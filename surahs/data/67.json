So the hired worker came and broke the vessels and ruined them all, then sat awaiting the wage, claiming that the employer is generous. Would the people of intellect see him in his waiting as one who is hopeful [raji] or as one who is deluded [maghrur]? This is from ignorance of the distinction between hope [raja'] and delusion [ghurra].\n\nIt was said to Al-Hasan: \"A people say, 'We hope in God,' yet they neglect the work.\" He said: \"Far be it, far be it! Those are their wishes [amaniyyah] they are swayed by. Whoever hopes for a thing seeks it, and whoever fears a thing flees from it.\"\n\nAnd Muslim ibn Yasar said: \"Last night I prostrated until my front teeth fell out!\" A man said to him: \"Indeed, we hope in God!\" Muslim said: \"Far be it, far be it? Whoever hopes for a thing seeks it, and whoever fears a thing flees from it.\"\n\nAnd just as he who hopes in the world [dunya] for a child, yet he has not married, or married but has not had intercourse, or had intercourse but has not emitted, he is foolish. Likewise, he who hopes for the mercy of God, yet he has not believed, or believed but has not done righteous deeds, or done them but has not abandoned sins, he is deluded [maghrur].\n\nAnd just as when he marries, has intercourse, and emits, he remains in a state of uncertainty regarding the child, fearing and hoping for the grace [fadl] of God in creating the child and warding off afflictions from the womb and from the mother until it is complete, he is wise [kayyis]. Likewise, when he believes and does righteous deeds and abandons evil deeds, and remains in a state of uncertainty between fear [khawf] and hope [raja'], fearing that it will not be accepted from him and that he will not remain steadfast upon it and that his end will be sealed with evil, and hoping in God, the Exalted, that He will establish him with the firm word [al-qawl al-thabit] and protect his religion from the thunderbolts of the agonies of death until he dies upon monotheism [tawhid], and guards his heart [qalb] from inclining towards the desires for the rest of his life so that he does not incline towards sins, he is wise [kayyis]. And whoever is other than these, they are the ones deluded [maghrur] by God. \"And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in way. And you will know the tidings of it after a time.\" And at that time they will say, as God has informed about them: \"Our Lord, we have seen and we have heard, so return us, we will do righteous deeds. Indeed, we are certain [muqinun].\" That is, we have learned that just as a child is not born except by intercourse and marriage, and a crop does not sprout except by tilling and sowing seed, likewise, reward and wage are not attained in the Hereafter [akhirah] except by righteous deeds. So return us, we will do righteous deeds, for we have now learned the truth of Your saying: \"And that for man is only what he has striven for, and that his striving is going to be seen. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, 'Did there not come to you a warner?' They will say, 'Yes, a warner had come to us.'\" That is, did we not hear you regarding the way of God [sunnat Allah] with His servants, and that \"Every soul will be paid in full what it has earned,\" and that \"Every soul, for what it has earned, is held in pledge\"? So what deluded you [gharra] concerning God after you had heard and understood? \"They will say, 'If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.'

Then, away with the companions of the Blaze!\n\nIf you ask: \"Then where is the place of hope [raja'] and its praiseworthy location?\" Know that it is praiseworthy in two places:\n\nThe first: For the disobedient one who is immersed [in sin], when the thought of repentance [tawba] occurs to him, and Satan says to him, \"How could your repentance be accepted?\" causing him to despair [yaqnutu] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is necessary to suppress that despair with hope [raja'] and to remember, \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins,\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says, \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.' And turn to your Lord [rabbikum].\" He commanded them to turn [inaba]. And He, the Exalted, says, \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteous work and then continues in guidance.\" So, if he anticipates forgiveness [maghfira] along with repentance, he is one who hopes [raji]. But if he anticipates forgiveness while persisting [in sin], he is deluded [maghrur]. It is like one for whom the time for Friday prayer has become tight while he is in the market, and the thought occurs to him to hasten to the Friday prayer. Satan says to him, \"You will not catch the prayer,\" so he should remain in his place. If he rejects Satan's lie and goes running, hoping to catch the Friday prayer, he is one who hopes. But if he continues with his trade and begins to hope that the Imam will delay the prayer for his sake until the middle of the time, or for the sake of another, or for some reason he does not know, he is deluded.\n\nThe second: When his soul [nafs] becomes sluggish concerning the virtues of deeds [fada'il al-a'mal] and he confines himself to the obligatory duties [fara'id], he should inspire hope in his soul for the bliss [na'im] of Allah, the Exalted, and what He has promised the righteous, so that from that hope [raja'] a vigor for worship [nashat al-'ibada] may spring forth, and he turns to the virtues. And he should remember the saying of Allah, the Exalted, \"Certainly will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly submissive\" up to His saying, \"Those are the inheritors who will inherit Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally.\"\n\nThus, the first hope suppresses the despair that prevents repentance. The second hope suppresses the sluggishness [futur] that prevents vigor and exertion [tashammur]. So, every anticipation that urges towards repentance or towards exertion in worship is hope [raja']. And every hope that causes sluggishness in worship and complacency in idleness is delusion [ghurra], just as when the thought occurs to him to abandon sin and engage in worship, Satan says to him, \"What is it to you, harming and tormenting yourself? You have a Lord who is Generous, Forgiving, Merciful.\" So he becomes sluggish because of that regarding repentance and worship—that is delusion. And at this point, it is incumbent upon the servant ['abd] to employ fear [khawf], frightening his soul with [divine] wrath.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>قالوا لو كنا نسمع أو نعقل ما كنا في أصحاب السعير فاعترفوا بذنبهم فسحقاً لأصحاب السعير. فإن قلت: فأين مظنة الرجاء وموضعه المحمود؟ فاعلم أنه محمود في موضعين: أحدهما: في حق العاصي المنهمك إذا خطرت له التوبة فقال له الشيطان: وأنى تقبل توبتك فيقنطه من رحمة الله تعالى فيجب عند هذا أن يقمع القنوط بالرجاء ويتذكر \"إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً\" وأن الله كريم يقبل التوبة عن عباده وأن التوبة طاعة تكفر الذنوب قال الله تعالى \"قل يا عبادي الذين أسرفوا على أنفسهم لا تقنطوا من رحمة الله إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً إنه هو الغفور الرحيم وأنيبوا إلى ربكم\" أمرهم بالإنابة وقال تعالى \"وإني لغفار لمن تاب وآمن وعمل صالحاً ثم اهتدى\" فإذا توقع المغفرة مع التوبة فهو راج، وإن توقع المغفرة مع الإصرار فهو مغرور، كما أن من ضاق عليه وقت الجمعة وهو في السوق فخطر له أن يسعى إلى الجمعة فقال له الشيطان: إنك لا تدرك الجمعة فأقم على موضعك فكذب الشيطان ومر يعدو وهو يرجو أن يدرك الجمعة فهو راج، وإن استمر على التجارة وأخذ يرجو تأخير الإمام للصلاة لأجله إلى وسط الوقت أو لأجل غيره أو لسبب من الأسباب التي لا يعرفها فهو مغرور. الثاني: أن تفتر نفسه عن فضائل الأعمال ويقتصر على الفرائض فيرجى نفسه نعيم الله تعالى وما وعد به الصالحين حتى ينبعث من الرجاء نشاط العبادة فيقبل على الفضائل ويتذكر قوله تعالى \"قد أفلح المؤمنون الذين هم في صلاتهم خاشعون\" إلى قوله \"أولئك هم الوارثون الذين يرثون الفردوس هم فيها خالدون\" فالرجاء الأول: يقمع القنوط المانع من التوبة. الرجاء الثاني: يقمع الفتور المانع من النشاط والتشمر، فكل توقع حث على توبة أو على تشمر في العبادة فهو رجاء، وكل رجاء أوجب فتوراً في العبادة وركوناً إلى البطالة فهو غرة، كما إذا خطر له أن يترك الذنب ويشتغل بالعمل فيقول له الشيطان: مالك ولإيذاء نفسك وتعذيبها ولك رب كريم غفور رحيم؟ فيفتر بذلك عن التوبة والعبادة فهو غرة، وعند هذا واجب على العبد أن يستعمل الخوف فيخوف نفسه بغضب.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Book of Knowledge</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, for everything there is a pillar [d'ima], and the pillar of the believer is his intellect ['aql].
