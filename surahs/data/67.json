So the hired worker came and broke the vessels and ruined them all, then sat awaiting the wage, claiming that the employer is generous. Would the people of intellect see him in his waiting as one who is hopeful [raji] or as one who is deluded [maghrur]? This is from ignorance of the distinction between hope [raja'] and delusion [ghurra].\n\nIt was said to Al-Hasan: \"A people say, 'We hope in God,' yet they neglect the work.\" He said: \"Far be it, far be it! Those are their wishes [amaniyyah] they are swayed by. Whoever hopes for a thing seeks it, and whoever fears a thing flees from it.\"\n\nAnd Muslim ibn Yasar said: \"Last night I prostrated until my front teeth fell out!\" A man said to him: \"Indeed, we hope in God!\" Muslim said: \"Far be it, far be it? Whoever hopes for a thing seeks it, and whoever fears a thing flees from it.\"\n\nAnd just as he who hopes in the world [dunya] for a child, yet he has not married, or married but has not had intercourse, or had intercourse but has not emitted, he is foolish. Likewise, he who hopes for the mercy of God, yet he has not believed, or believed but has not done righteous deeds, or done them but has not abandoned sins, he is deluded [maghrur].\n\nAnd just as when he marries, has intercourse, and emits, he remains in a state of uncertainty regarding the child, fearing and hoping for the grace [fadl] of God in creating the child and warding off afflictions from the womb and from the mother until it is complete, he is wise [kayyis]. Likewise, when he believes and does righteous deeds and abandons evil deeds, and remains in a state of uncertainty between fear [khawf] and hope [raja'], fearing that it will not be accepted from him and that he will not remain steadfast upon it and that his end will be sealed with evil, and hoping in God, the Exalted, that He will establish him with the firm word [al-qawl al-thabit] and protect his religion from the thunderbolts of the agonies of death until he dies upon monotheism [tawhid], and guards his heart [qalb] from inclining towards the desires for the rest of his life so that he does not incline towards sins, he is wise [kayyis]. And whoever is other than these, they are the ones deluded [maghrur] by God. \"And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in way. And you will know the tidings of it after a time.\" And at that time they will say, as God has informed about them: \"Our Lord, we have seen and we have heard, so return us, we will do righteous deeds. Indeed, we are certain [muqinun].\" That is, we have learned that just as a child is not born except by intercourse and marriage, and a crop does not sprout except by tilling and sowing seed, likewise, reward and wage are not attained in the Hereafter [akhirah] except by righteous deeds. So return us, we will do righteous deeds, for we have now learned the truth of Your saying: \"And that for man is only what he has striven for, and that his striving is going to be seen. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, 'Did there not come to you a warner?' They will say, 'Yes, a warner had come to us.'\" That is, did we not hear you regarding the way of God [sunnat Allah] with His servants, and that \"Every soul will be paid in full what it has earned,\" and that \"Every soul, for what it has earned, is held in pledge\"?

Then, away with the companions of the Blaze!\n\nIf you ask: \"Then where is the place of hope [raja'] and its praiseworthy location?\" Know that it is praiseworthy in two places:\n\nThe first: For the disobedient one who is immersed [in sin], when the thought of repentance [tawba] occurs to him, and Satan says to him, \"How could your repentance be accepted?\" causing him to despair [yaqnutu] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is necessary to suppress that despair with hope [raja'] and to remember, \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins,\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says, \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.' And turn to your Lord [rabbikum].\" He commanded them to turn [inaba]. And He, the Exalted, says, \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteous work and then continues in guidance.\" So, if he anticipates forgiveness [maghfira] along with repentance, he is one who hopes [raji]. But if he anticipates forgiveness while persisting [in sin], he is deluded [maghrur]. It is like one for whom the time for Friday prayer has become tight while he is in the market, and the thought occurs to him to hasten to the Friday prayer. Satan says to him, \"You will not catch the prayer,\" so he should remain in his place. If he rejects Satan's lie and goes running, hoping to catch the Friday prayer, he is one who hopes. But if he continues with his trade and begins to hope that the Imam will delay the prayer for his sake until the middle of the time, or for the sake of another, or for some reason he does not know, he is deluded.\n\nThe second: When his soul [nafs] becomes sluggish concerning the virtues of deeds [fada'il al-a'mal] and he confines himself to the obligatory duties [fara'id], he should inspire hope in his soul for the bliss [na'im] of Allah, the Exalted, and what He has promised the righteous, so that from that hope [raja'] a vigor for worship [nashat al-'ibada] may spring forth, and he turns to the virtues. And he should remember the saying of Allah, the Exalted, \"Certainly will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly submissive\" up to His saying, \"Those are the inheritors who will inherit Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally.\"\n\nThus, the first hope suppresses the despair that prevents repentance. The second hope suppresses the sluggishness [futur] that prevents vigor and exertion [tashammur]. So, every anticipation that urges towards repentance or towards exertion in worship is hope [raja']. And every hope that causes sluggishness in worship and complacency in idleness is delusion [ghurra], just as when the thought occurs to him to abandon sin and engage in worship, Satan says to him, \"What is it to you, harming and tormenting yourself? You have a Lord who is Generous, Forgiving, Merciful.\" So he becomes sluggish because of that regarding repentance and worship—that is delusion. And at this point, it is incumbent upon the servant ['abd] to employ fear [khawf], frightening his soul with [divine] wrath.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>قالوا لو كنا نسمع أو نعقل ما كنا في أصحاب السعير فاعترفوا بذنبهم فسحقاً لأصحاب السعير. فإن قلت: فأين مظنة الرجاء وموضعه المحمود؟ فاعلم أنه محمود في موضعين: أحدهما: في حق العاصي المنهمك إذا خطرت له التوبة فقال له الشيطان: وأنى تقبل توبتك فيقنطه من رحمة الله تعالى فيجب عند هذا أن يقمع القنوط بالرجاء ويتذكر \"إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً\" وأن الله كريم يقبل التوبة عن عباده وأن التوبة طاعة تكفر الذنوب قال الله تعالى \"قل يا عبادي الذين أسرفوا على أنفسهم لا تقنطوا من رحمة الله إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً إنه هو الغفور الرحيم وأنيبوا إلى ربكم\" أمرهم بالإنابة وقال تعالى \"وإني لغفار لمن تاب وآمن وعمل صالحاً ثم اهتدى\" فإذا توقع المغفرة مع التوبة فهو راج، وإن توقع المغفرة مع الإصرار فهو مغرور، كما أن من ضاق عليه وقت الجمعة وهو في السوق فخطر له أن يسعى إلى الجمعة فقال له الشيطان: إنك لا تدرك الجمعة فأقم على موضعك فكذب الشيطان ومر يعدو وهو يرجو أن يدرك الجمعة فهو راج، وإن استمر على التجارة وأخذ يرجو تأخير الإمام للصلاة لأجله إلى وسط الوقت أو لأجل غيره أو لسبب من الأسباب التي لا يعرفها فهو مغرور. الثاني: أن تفتر نفسه عن فضائل الأعمال ويقتصر على الفرائض فيرجى نفسه نعيم الله تعالى وما وعد به الصالحين حتى ينبعث من الرجاء نشاط العبادة فيقبل على الفضائل ويتذكر قوله تعالى \"قد أفلح المؤمنون الذين هم في صلاتهم خاشعون\" إلى قوله \"أولئك هم الوارثون الذين يرثون الفردوس هم فيها خالدون\" فالرجاء الأول: يقمع القنوط المانع من التوبة. الرجاء الثاني: يقمع الفتور المانع من النشاط والتشمر، فكل توقع حث على توبة أو على تشمر في العبادة فهو رجاء، وكل رجاء أوجب فتوراً في العبادة وركوناً إلى البطالة فهو غرة، كما إذا خطر له أن يترك الذنب ويشتغل بالعمل فيقول له الشيطان: مالك ولإيذاء نفسك وتعذيبها ولك رب كريم غفور رحيم؟ فيفتر بذلك عن التوبة والعبادة فهو غرة، وعند هذا واجب على العبد أن يستعمل الخوف فيخوف نفسه بغضب.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Book of Knowledge</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, for everything there is a pillar [d'ima], and the pillar of the believer is his intellect ['aql].

As for the earth, from His signs is that He created the earth as a bed (Firash) and a resting place (Mahad), and made in it wide paths, and made it submissive (Dhulul) so that you may walk in its tracts, and made it stable so it does not move, and set in it mountains as pegs for it to prevent it from shaking, then expanded its expanses until the sons of Adam (Adam) were unable to reach all its sides even if their lifespans were long and their travels abundant. So He, the Exalted, said: 'And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander. And the earth We have spread out, and excellent is the preparer.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'He is the one who made for you the earth submissive (Dhulul), so walk in its tracts.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'The one who made for you the earth a bed (Firash).' And He has frequently mentioned the earth in His mighty book so that one may contemplate its wonders: its surface is an abode for the living and its interior is a resting place for the dead. He, the Exalted, said: 'Have We not made the earth a container, for the living and the dead?'

If there is weakness in your faith (Iman), then strengthen the faith (Iman) by looking at the first creation, for the second is like it and easier than it. And if you are strong in faith (Iman) in it, then make your heart (Qalb) feel those fears and dangers, and increase in it reflection (Tafakkur) and consideration (I'tibar) to strip from your heart (Qalb) comfort and settlement, so you become occupied with preparing for the presentation before the Compeller (Al-Jabbar). And reflect first on what strikes the hearing of the inhabitants of the graves from the intensity of the blowing of the Trumpet (As-Sur), for it is a single cry by which the graves split open from the heads of the dead, and they rise up all at once. So imagine yourself having sprung up with your face changed, your body dusty from the parting of your hair to your feet from the dust of your grave, bewildered from the intensity of the shock, with your eye fixed toward the call. And the creation has risen up in a single uprising from the graves in which their tribulation (Bala') has been prolonged, and they have been agitated by terror (Faza') and dread (Ru'b), added to what was with them of sorrows (Humum) and griefs (Ghumum) and intense waiting for the outcome of the matter, as Allah the Exalted said: 'And the Trumpet (As-Sur) will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.' And Allah the Exalted said: 'And when the Trumpet (An-Naqur) is blown, that Day will be a difficult day for the disbelievers; not easy.' And Allah the Exalted said: 'And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\" They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing. And they will not be able to make a testament, nor to their people can they return. And the Trumpet (As-Sur) will be blown, and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten. They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping place? This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.\"' So if there were not before the dead except the terror of that blowing, it would be worthy of being feared, for it is a blowing and a cry by which those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning they die by it except whom Allah wills, and that is some of the angels. And therefore the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'How can I be at ease when the possessor of the Trumpet (As-Sur) has taken the horn in his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow?' Maqatil said: The Trumpet (As-Sur) is the horn, and that is because Israfil (upon him be peace) has placed his mouth on the horn like the form of a trumpet, and the circle of the head of the horn is like the expanse of the heavens and the earth, and he is fixing his gaze toward the Throne (Al-'Arsh), waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first blowing. And when he blows, those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning every animal dies from the intensity of the terror except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt). Then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded to take the soul (Ruh) of Jibril, then the soul (Ruh) of Mika'il, then the soul (Ruh) of Israfil, then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blowing in the Intermediate State (Al-Barzakh) for forty years, then Allah the Exalted revives Israfil and commands.</div><div class='ihya-arabic'

الأولى فإن الثانية مثلها وأسهل منها وإن كنت قوى الإيمان بها فأشعر قلبك تلك المخاوف والأخطار وأكثر فيها التفكر والاعتبار لتسلب عن قلبك الراحة والقرار فتشتغل بالتشمر للعرض على الجبار وتفكر أولا فيما يقرع سمع سكان القبور من شدة نفخ الصور فإنها صيحة واحدة تنفرج بها القبور عن رءوس الموتي فيثورون دفعة واحدة فتوهم نفسك وقد وثبت متغيرا وجهك مغبرا بدنك من فرقك إلى قدمك من تراب قبرك مبهوتا من شدة الصعقة شاخص العين نحو النداء وقد ثار الخلق ثورة واحدة من القبور التى طال فيها بلاؤهم وقد أزعجهم الفزع والرعب مضافا إلى ما كان عندهم من الهموم والغموم وشدة الانتظار لعاقبة الأمر كما قال تعالى: ﴿ ونفخ فى الصور فصعق من فى السموات ومن فى الأرض إلا من شاء الله ثم نفخ فيه أخرى فإذا هم قيام ينظرون ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ فإذا نقر فى الناقور فذلك يومئذ يوم عسير على الكافرين غير يسير ﴾ {} وقال تعال: ﴿ ويقولون متى هذا الوعد إن كنتم صادقين ما ينظرون إلا صيحة واحدة تأخذهم وهم يخصمون فلا يستطيعون توصية ولا إلى أهلهم يرجعون ونفخ فى الصور فإذا هم من الأجداث إلى ربهم ينسلون قالوا يا ويلنا من بعثنا من مرقدنا هذا ما وعد الرحمن وصدق المرسلون ﴾ {} فلو لم يكن بين يدي الموتي إلا هول تلك النفخة لكان ذلك جديرا بأن يتقى فإنها نفخة وصيحة يصعق بها من فى السموات والأرض يعنى يموتون بها إلا من شاء الله وهو بعض الملائكة ولذلك قال رسول الله ﭬ: (كيف أنعم وصاحب الصور قد التقم القرن وحنى الجبهة وأصغى بالأذن متى يؤمر فينفخ[144]) قال مقاتل: الصور هو القرن وذلك أن إسرافيل عليه السلام واضع فاه على القرن كهيئة البوق ودائرة رأس القرن كعرض السموات والأرض وهو شاخص بصره نحو العرش ينتظر متى يؤمر فينفخ النفخة الأولى فإذا نفخ صعق من فى السموات والأرض أى مات كل حيوان من شدة الفزع إلا من شاء الله وهو جبريل وميكائيل وإسرافيل وملك الموت ثم يأمر ملك الموت أن يقبض روح جبريل ثم روح ميكائيل ثم روح إسرافيل ثم يأمر ملك الموت فيموت ثم يلبث الخلق بعد النفخة الأولى فى البرزخ أربعين سنة ثم يحيى الله تعالى إسرافيل فيأمر</div></div></div>"}},"26":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.55","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"0.39","h":"1.14","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"āَmَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"2.0","h":"2.79","c":"الْعِلْمُ","d":"l-ʿil'mu","e":"ُmْlِʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.26","c":"عِنْدَ","d":"ʿinda","e":"َdnِʿع"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.86","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.7","h":"7.42","c":"وَإِنَّمَا","d":"wa-innamā","e":"ٓāَmَّnِiʾَw"},{"b":"8.3","h":"10.82","c":"أَنَا","d":"anā","e":"۠āَnَaʾ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"11.76","c":"نَذِيرٌ","d":"nadhīrun","e":"ٌryِhdَn"},{"b":"10.5","h":"13.54","c":"مُبِينٌ","d":"mubīnun","e":"ٌnyِbُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Say,
