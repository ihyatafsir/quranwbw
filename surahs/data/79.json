He constructed it. He raised its vault and proportioned it. And He darkened its night and brought forth its morning light.\"\n\nNow return to the sperm-drop [nutfa] and contemplate its state first, and what it became secondly. And contemplate that if the jinn and mankind were to gather together to create for the sperm-drop hearing, or sight, or intellect, or power, or knowledge [‘ilm], or a spirit [ruh], or to create within it a bone, or a vein, or a nerve, or skin, or hair—would they be capable of that? Nay, even if they wished to know the reality [kunh] of its essence [haqiqa] and the manner of its creation after God, the Most High, had created it, they would be incapable of it.\n\nSo the wonder is from you—if you were to look at the picture of a human depicted on a wall, and the painter had refined its depiction until it neared the form of a human, and the one looking at it said, \"It is as if it were a human,\" you would marvel at the craftsmanship of the painter, his skill, the deftness of his hand, and the completeness of his acumen, and a great place would be held for him in your heart [qalb]—even though you know that this picture was only completed by paint, a pen, a hand, by power, by knowledge [‘ilm], and by will, and not a single one of those things is from the action or creation of the painter. Rather, it is from the creation of another. The utmost of his action is merely the combining of the paint and the wall in a specific arrangement. Yet you greatly marvel at him and hold him in awe.\n\nAnd you see the filthy sperm-drop [nutfa]—it was non-existent, then its Creator [Khaliq] created it in the loins and the ribs. Then He brought it forth from them and formed it, so He perfected its formation. And He proportioned it, so He perfected its proportioning and its shaping. And He divided its similar parts into different parts. So He perfected the bones in its corners and beautified the forms of its limbs. And He adorned its exterior and its interior, and arranged its veins and its nerves, and made them a passage for its nourishment so that would be a cause for its permanence. And He made it hearing, seeing, knowing [‘alima], speaking.\n\nAnd He created for it the back as a foundation for its body, and the belly as a container for the instruments of its nourishment, and the head as a gatherer of its senses. So He opened the two eyes and arranged their layers, and perfected their form, color, and states. Then He protected them with eyelids to cover them, preserve them, polish them, and repel filth from them. Then He manifested within the measure of a single lens among them the image of the heavens with the vastness of their expanses and the remoteness of their extremities—so it gazes upon them.\n\nThen He split its two ears and deposited within them a bitter water to preserve its hearing and repel creeping things from them. And He surrounded them with the concha of the ear to gather the sound and return it to its auditory canal, and to sense the creeping of insects towards it. And He placed within them curves and bends so that the movement of what creeps within them would be multiplied and its path lengthened, so that its owner would be alerted from sleep if a creature intended it during the state of sleep.\n\nThen He raised the nose from the middle of the face and perfected its form, and opened its two nostrils, and deposited within it the sense of smell.</div></div></div>"}},"28":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.4","c":"رَفَعَ","d":"rafaʿa","e":"َʿعَfَr"},{"b":"0.63","h":"1.4","c":"سَمْكَهَا","d":"samkahā","e":"āَhَkْmَs"},{"b":"1.7","h":"3.55","c":"فَسَوَّاهَا","d":"fasawwāhā","e":"āَhٰàَّwَsَf"}],"a":{"g":"He raised its ceiling and proportioned it.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j4 k09</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, do not prolong the mention of the number of that. And the total number of bones in the human body is two hundred and forty-eight bones, excluding the small bones which fill the gaps of the joints. So look how He created all of that from a lowly, thin drop [nutfah]. And the intended purpose from mentioning the numbers of the bones is not that their number be known, for this is a proximate knowledge [‘ilm] which the physicians and anatomists know. Rather, the aim is that one should contemplate through them their Manager and their Creator—how He proportioned them and managed them, and varied between their forms and their sizes, and specified them with this particular number. For if He had increased upon them by one, it would have been a calamity upon the human, requiring its removal. And if He had decreased from them by one, it would have been a deficiency requiring its mending. So the physician looks into them to know the aspect of treatment in mending them, and the people of insight [ahl al-basa’ir] look into them to deduce through them the majesty of their Creator and Fashioner. So vast is the difference between the two contemplations.\n\nThen look how God, Exalted is He, created instruments to move the bones, which are the muscles. And He created in the human body five hundred and twenty-nine muscles. And the muscle is composed of flesh, nerve, ligament, and membranes. And they differ in sizes and forms according to the difference of their places and the measure of their needs. So twenty-four muscles from them are for moving the pupil of the eye and its eyelids. If one from their total were deficient, the affair of the eye would be disrupted. And thus for every limb are muscles of a specific number and a specific measure.\n\nAnd the affair of the nerves, the vessels, the veins, and the arteries, and their number, their sources, and their branchings, is more wondrous than all of this, and its explanation would be lengthy. So for thought [fikr] is scope in each one of these parts, then in the totality of the body.\n\nAll of that is a contemplation of the wonders of the bodies of the body. And the wonders of the meanings [ma’ani] and attributes [sifat] which are not perceived by the senses are greater. So look now at the outward [zahir] of the human and his inward [batin], and at his body and his attributes, and you will see in him from the wonders and the craftsmanship what compels wonder. And all of that is the making of God in a drop of filthy water. So you see from this His making in a drop of water—so what of His making in the kingdom [mulk] of the heavens and their stars, and what of His wisdom [hikmah] in their arrangements, their forms, their measures, their numbers, the gathering of some of them and the separation of some of them, the difference of their images, and the variation of their risings and settings? So do not think that an atom from the kingdom of the heavens is devoid of wisdom and judgment. Rather, they are more perfect in structure, more precise in craftsmanship, and more comprehensive of wonders than the body of the human. Nay, there is no proportion of all that is in the earth to the wonders of the heavens. And for that reason, He, Exalted is He, said: \"Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? He constructed it. He raised its ceiling and proportioned it. And He darkened its night and extracted its daylight.\"\n\nSo return now to the drop [nutfah] and contemplate its state firstly, and what it became secondly. And contemplate that if the jinn and mankind were to gather together to create for the drop hearing, or sight, or intellect [‘aql], or power [qudrah], or knowledge [‘ilm], or spirit [ruh], or to create in it a bone, or a vessel, or a nerve, or skin, or hair—would they be capable of that? Nay, if they wished to know the reality [haqiqah] of its essence and the modality of its creation after God, Exalted is He, had created that, they would be incapable of it.\n\nSo the wonder is from you if you looked at the image of a human depicted on a wall, and the painter excelled in depicting it until he brought that close to the image of a human, and the one looking at it said, \"It is as if it is a human.\" Great would be your wonder at the craftsmanship of the painter, his skill, the lightness of his hand, the perfection of his acumen, and great would be his place in your heart [qalb], even though you know that that image only came to be by the dye, the pen, the hand, the power [qudrah], the knowledge [‘ilm], the will [iradah], and not a thing from that is from the action of the painter nor his creation. Rather, it is from the creation of other than him. And the utmost of his action is only the combining of the dye and the wall in a specific arrangement. So your wonder at him increases and you deem him great.\n\nAnd you see the filthy drop [nutfah]—it was non-existent, then its Creator created it in the loins and the ribs. Then He brought it out from them and formed it, so He perfected its formation, and proportioned it, so He perfected its proportioning and its imaging, and divided its similar parts into different parts. So He made firm the bones in their corners, and beautified the forms of its limbs, and adorned its outward [zahir] and its inward [batin], and arranged its vessels and its nerves, and made them a passage for its nourishment so that would be a cause for its permanence. And He made it hearing, seeing, knowing, speaking. And He created for it the back as a foundation for its body, and the belly as a container for the instruments of its nourishment, and the head as a gatherer of its senses. So He opened the two eyes and arranged their layers, and perfected their form, their color, and their states. Then He protected them with the eyelids to cover them, preserve them, polish them, and repel filth from them. Then He manifested in the measure of their lens the image of the heavens with the vastness of their expanses and the remoteness of their extremities—so it looks at them.\n\nThen He split its two ears and deposited in them bitter water to preserve its hearing and repel vermin from them, and surrounded them with the shell of the ear to gather the sound so it returns it to its eardrum, and to sense the creeping of vermin towards it. And He placed in them curves and bends so that the movement of what creeps in them increases and its path lengthens, so its owner is alerted from sleep if a creature intends it during the state of sleep.\n\nThen He raised the nose from the middle of the face and perfected its form, and opened its two nostrils, and deposited in it its sense of smell.</div></div></div>"}},"29":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"وَأَغْطَشَ","d":"wa-aghṭasha","e":"َhsَṭْغَaʾَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.86","c":"لَيْلَهَا","d":"laylahā","e":"āَhَlْyَl"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.69","c":"وَأَخْرَجَ","d":"wa-akhraja","e":"َjgَrْhkَaʾَw"},{"b":"3.1","h":"5.51","c":"ضُحَاهَا","d":"ḍuḥāhā","e":"āَhٰàَḥُḍ"}],"a":{"g":"And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness."}},"30":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.35","c":"وَالْأَرْضَ","d":"wal-arḍa","e":"َḍْrَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.95","c":"بَعْدَ","d":"baʿda","e":"َdْʿعَb"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.54","c":"دَحَاهَا","d":"daḥāhā","e":"ٓāَhٰàَḥَd"}],"a":{"g":"And after that He spread the earth."}},"31":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.35","c":"أَخْرَجَ","d":"akhraja","e":"َjgَrْhkَaʾ"},{"b":"0.81","h":"1.51","c":"مِنْهَا","d":"min'hā","e":"āَhْnِm"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.01","c":"مَاءَهَا","d":"māahā","e":"āَhَءٓāَm"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.98","c":"وَمَرْعَاهَا","d":"wamarʿāhā","e":"āَhٰàَʿعْrَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"He extracted from it its water and its pasture,"}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَالْجِبَالَ","d":"wal-jibāla","e":"َlāَbِjgْlٱَw"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.15","c":"أَرْسَاهَا","d":"arsāhā","e":"āَhٰàَsْrَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And the mountains He set firmly"}},"33":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.03","c":"مَتَاعًا","d":"matāʿan","e":"āًʿعَٰtَm"},{"b":"0.76","h":"1.48","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَّl"},{"b":"1.8","h":"2.89","c":"وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ","d":"wali-anʿāmikum","e":"ْmُkِmَٰʿعْnَaʾِlَw"}],"a":{"g":"As provision for you and your grazing livestock."}},"34":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.3","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"0.87","h":"2.76","c":"جَاءَتِ","d":"jāati","e":"ِtَءٓāَjg"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.72","c":"الطَّامَّةُ","d":"l-ṭāmatu","e":"ُẗَّmٓāَّṭlٱ"},{"b":"7.5","h":"9.74","c":"الْكُبْرَى","d":"l-kub'rā","e":"ٰàَrْbُkْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity -"}},"35":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"1.2","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"0.54","h":"2.07","c":"يَتَذَكَّرُ","d":"yatadhakkaru","e":"ُrَّkَhdَtَy"},{"b":"1.8","h":"4.29","c":"الْإِنْسَانُ","d":"l-insānu","e":"ُnَٰsnِiʾْlٱ"},{"b":"3.8","h":"7.12","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"4.1","h":"7.85","c":"سَعَى","d":"saʿā","e":"ٰàَʿعَs"}],"a":{"g":"The Day when man will remember that for which he strove,"}},"36":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"وَبُرِّزَتِ","d":"waburrizati","e":"ِtَzِّrُbَw"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.31","c":"الْجَحِيمُ","d":"l-jaḥīmu","e":"ُmyِḥَjgْlٱ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.07","c":"لِمَنْ","d":"liman","e":"nَmِl"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.68","c":"يَرَى","d":"yarā","e":"ٰàَrَy"}],"a":{"g":"And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see -"}},"37":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.35","c":"فَأَمَّا","d":"fa-ammā","e":"āَّmَaʾَf"},{"b":"1.5","h":"4.78","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.88","c":"طَغَى","d":"ṭaghā","e":"ٰàَغَṭ"}],"a":{"g":"So as for he who transgressed","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book10</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, you have joined those concerning whom Allah, the Exalted, said: \"As for he who transgressed and preferred the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya], then indeed, Hellfire will be the refuge [al-ma'wa].\" For his community [ummah] is only those who followed him, and none followed him except he who turned away from this world [al-dunya] and turned towards the Hereafter [al-akhirah].
