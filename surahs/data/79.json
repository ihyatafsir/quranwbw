Indeed, there is no proportion between all that is on earth and the wonders of the heavens. And for that reason, the Exalted said: 'Are you more difficult to create or the heaven? He constructed it. He raised its ceiling and proportioned it. And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness.' So return now to the sperm-drop and contemplate its state first and what it became second, and contemplate that if the jinn and mankind gathered to create for the sperm-drop hearing or sight or intellect or power or knowledge or spirit (Ruh), or to create in it bone or vein or nerve or skin or hair, would they be capable of that?

Therefore, He called it preserved, saying: 'And We made the sky a preserved roof' (21:32). And He, glorified be He, said: 'And We built above you seven strong ones' (78:12). And He said: 'Are you more difficult to create or the sky? He built it, raised its height, and perfected it' (79:27-28). So look at the Dominion (al-Malakūt) to see the wonders of Might (al-ʿIzz) and Power (al-Jabarūt). And do not think that the meaning of looking at the Dominion (al-Malakūt) is by extending your sight to it so that you see the blueness of the sky, the light of the stars, and their dispersion, for the beasts share with you in this looking. If this were the intended meaning, then why did Allah, exalted be He, praise Abraham by saying: 'And thus did We show Abraham the Dominion (al-Malakūt) of the heavens and the earth' (6:75)? No, rather everything that is perceived by the sense of sight, the Quran expresses it with Kingdom (al-Mulk) and Witnessed (al-Shahādah), and what is hidden from the eyes, it expresses it with the Unseen (al-Ghayb) and the Dominion (al-Malakūt). And Allah, exalted be He, is Knower of the Unseen (al-Ghayb) and the Witnessed (al-Shahādah), and Sovereign of the Kingdom (al-Mulk) and the Dominion (al-Malakūt). And no one encompasses anything of His knowledge except by what He wills, and He is Knower of the Unseen (al-Ghayb), so He does not reveal His Unseen (al-Ghayb) to anyone except a messenger He has chosen. So, O intelligent one, reflect on the Dominion (al-Malakūt), perhaps the doors of the sky will be opened for you, and you will roam with your Heart (al-Qalb) in its regions until your Heart (al-Qalb) stands before the Throne of the Merciful. At that point, perhaps it may be hoped for you to reach the rank of ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, where he said: 'My Heart (al-Qalb) saw my Lord.' And this is because reaching the utmost cannot be except after surpassing the nearest, and the nearest thing to you is your Soul (al-Nafs), then the earth which is your abode, then the air enveloping you, then the plants and animals and what is on the face of the earth, then the wonders of the atmosphere, which is what is between the sky and the earth, then the seven heavens with their stars, then the Throne (al-Kursī), then the Throne (al-ʿArsh).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em;

And if you understand the way of summarization and detail, you know that some of these do not contradict others but rather differ in explanation and summarization. The result is that asceticism (Zuhd) is an expression for aversion from all the inclinations of the Soul (Nafs), and whenever one is averse from the inclinations of the Soul (Nafs), he is averse from remaining in this world, so his hope inevitably shortens, because he only wants to remain to enjoy and wants permanent enjoyment with the will to remain; for whoever wants something wants its permanence, and there is no meaning to the love of life except the love of the permanence of what exists or is possible in this life, so if he is averse from it, he does not want it. Therefore, when fighting was prescribed for them, \"They said: Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? If only You had postponed it for us for a short term.\" So Allah said: \"Say: The enjoyment of this world is little,\" meaning you do not want to remain except for the enjoyment of this world, so at that time the ascetics (Zahidun) became apparent and the condition of the hypocrites was revealed. As for the ascetics (Zahidun) who love Allah, they fought in the path of Allah as if they were a solid structure and awaited one of the two good things, and when they were called to fight, they would inhale the fragrance of Paradise and hasten to it like the thirsty hasten to cold water, eager for the victory of the religion of Allah or attaining the rank of martyrdom, and whoever of them died on his bed</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ثم رد الكل إلى واحد في موضع آخر فقال: \" ونهى النفس عن الهوى فإن الجنة هي المأوى \" فالهوى لفظ يجمع جميع حظوظ النفس في الدنيا، فينبغي أن يكون الزهد فيه. وإذا فهمت طريق الإجمال والتفصيل عرفت أن البعض من هذه لا يخالف البعض وإنما يفارقه في الشرح والإجمال أخرى. فالحاصل أن الزهد عبارة عن الرغبة عن حظوظ النفس كلها، ومهما رغب عن حظوظ النفس رغب عن البقاء في الدنيا فقصر أمله لا محالة، لأنه إنما يريد البقاء ليتمتع ويريد التمتع الدائم بإرادة البقاء؛ فإن من أراد شيئاً أراد دوامه، ولا معنى لحب الحياة إلا حب دوام ما هو موجود أو ممكن في هذه الحياة، فإذا رغب عنها لم يردها، ولذلك لما كتب عليهم القتال \" قالوا ربنا لم كتبت علينا القتال لولا أخرتنا إلى أجلٍ قريب \" فقال تعالى: \" قل متاع الدنيا قليل \"، أي لستم تريدون البقاء إلا لمتاع الدنيا، فظهر عند ذلك الزاهدون وانكشف حال المنافقين. أما الزاهدون المحبون لله تعالى فقاتلوا في سبيل الله كأنهم بنيان مرصوص وانتظروا إحدى الحسنيين، وكانوا إذا دعوا إلى القتال يستنشقون رائحة الجنة ويبادرون إليه مبادرة الظمآن إلى الماء البارد حرصاً على نصرة دين الله أو نيل رتبة الشهادة، وكان من مات منهم على فراشه</div></div></div>"}},"41":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"فَإِنَّ","d":"fa-inna","e":"َّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.09","c":"الْجَنَّةَ","d":"l-janata","e":"َẗَّnَjgْlٱ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.42","c":"هِيَ","d":"hiya","e":"َàِh"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.15","c":"الْمَأْوَى","d":"l-mawā","e":"ٰàَwْaʾَmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge."}},"42":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"1.35","c":"يَسْءَلُونَكَ","d":"yasalūnaka","e":"َkَnwُlَٔـْsَy"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3.5","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"1.9","h":"4.27","c":"السَّاعَةِ","d":"l-sāʿati","e":"ِẗَʿعāَّslٱ"},{"b":"3.1","h":"6.2","c":"أَيَّانَ","d":"ayyāna","e":"َnāَّyَaʾ"},{"b":"4.1","h":"7.97","c":"مُرْسَاهَا","d":"mur'sāhā","e":"āَhٰàَsْrُm"}],"a":{"g":"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the Hour: when is its arrival?"}},"43":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.7","c":"فِيمَ","d":"fīma","e":"َmyِf"},{"b":"0.56","h":"1.65","c":"أَنْتَ","d":"anta","e":"َtnَaʾ"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.18","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.29","c":"ذِكْرَاهَا","d":"dhik'rāhā","e":"ٓāَhٰàَrْkِhd"}],"a":{"g":"In what [position] are you that you should mention it?"}},"44":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.58","h":"1.44","c":"رَبِّكَ","d":"rabbika","e":"َkِّbَr"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3.02","c":"مُنْتَهَاهَا","d":"muntahāhā","e":"ٓāَhٰàَhَtnُm"}],"a":{"g":"To your Lord is its finality."}},"45":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.65","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"ٓāَmَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.78","c":"أَنْتَ","d":"anta","e":"َtnَaʾ"},{"b":"4.2","h":"5.3","c":"مُنْذِرُ","d":"mundhiru","e":"ُrِhdnُm"},{"b":"5.7","h":"7","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"7.0","h":"8.24","c":"يَخْشَاهَا","d":"yakhshāhā","e":"āَhٰàَhsْhkَy"}],"a":{"g":"You are only a warner for those who fear it."}},"46":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.35","c":"كَأَنَّهُمْ","d":"ka-annahum","e":"ْmُhَّnَaʾَk"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.3","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.26","c":"يَرَوْنَهَا","d":"yarawnahā","e":"āَhَnْwَrَy"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.36","c":"لَمْ","d":"lam","e":"ْmَl"},{"b":"4.4","h":"6.94","c":"يَلْبَثُوا","d":"yalbathū","e":"۟āٓwُhtَbْlَy"},{"b":"6.6","h":"9.59","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.7","c":"عَشِيَّةً","d":"ʿashiyyatan","e":"ًẗَّyِhsَʿع"},{"b":"9.1","h":"13.21","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"9.6","h":"13.84","c":"ضُحَاهَا","d":"ḍuḥāhā","e":"āَhٰàَḥُḍ"}],"a":{"g":"It will be, on the Day they see it, as though they had not remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning thereof."}}}
