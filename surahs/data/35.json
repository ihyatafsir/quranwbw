Indeed, Allah the Exalted has angels who distribute, and He who adorned the children of Adam with beards, and it is from the completion of creation, and through it men are distinguished from women. And it is said in an unusual interpretation: the beard is what is intended by His saying, the Exalted: 'He increases in creation what He wills' {Quran 35:1}. The companions of Al-Ahnaf ibn Qais said: 'We wish we could buy a beard for Al-Ahnaf even for twenty thousand.' And Shuraih the judge said: 'I wish I had a beard even for ten thousand.' And how can the beard be disliked when in it is the magnification of the man and looking at him with the eye of knowledge and dignity, elevation in gatherings, the turning of faces toward him, precedence over the group, and protection of honor? For whoever insults makes reference to the beard if the insulted one has a beard.

Do you think, O soul (nafs), that the intense cold (zamharir) of Hell (Jahannam) is lighter in cold and shorter in duration than the intense cold of winter? Or do you think that that is less than this? No, it is not so, nor is there any similarity between them in severity and coldness. Do you think that the servant (al-'abd) is saved from it without striving? Far from it! Just as the cold of winter is not repelled except by a cloak, fire, and other means, so the heat of the Fire (al-nar) and its cold are not repelled except by the fortress of Oneness (Tawhid) and the trench of acts of obedience (al-ta'at). And the generosity (karam) of Allah, the Exalted, is in that He made known to you the way of fortification and facilitated its means for you, not in that He repels the punishment from you without its fortress, just as the generosity (karam) of Allah, the Exalted, in repelling the cold of winter is that He created fire and guided you to the way of extracting it from between iron and stone so that you may repel with it the cold of winter from your soul (nafs).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ويحك يا نفس لا ينبغى أن تغرك الحياة الدنيا ولا يغرنك بالله الغرور فانظرى لنفسك فما أمرك بمهم لغيرك ولا تضيعى أوقاتك فالأنفاس معدودة فإذا مضى منك نفس فقد ذهب بعضك فاغتنمى الصحة قبل السقم والفراغ قبل الشغل والغنى قبل الفقر والشباب قبل الهرم والحياة قبل الموت واستعدي للآخرة على قدر بقائك فيها يا نفس أما تستعدين للشتاء بقدر طول مدته فتجمعين له القوت والكسوة والحطب وجميع الأسباب ولا تتكلين في ذلك على فضل الله وكرمه حتى يدفع عنك البرد من غير جبة ولبد وحطب وغير ذلك فإنه قادر على ذلك أفتظنين أيتها النفس أن زمهرير جهنم أخف بردا وأقصر مدة من زمهرير الشتاء أم تظنين أن ذلك دون هذا كلا أن يكون هذا كذلك أو أن يكون بينهما مناسبة في الشدة والبرودة أفتظنين أن العبد ينجو منها يغير سعى هيهات كما لا يندفع برد الشتاء إلا بالجبة والنار وسائر الأسباب فلا يندفع حر النار وبردها إلا بحصن التوحيد وخندق الطاعات وإنما كرم الله تعالى فى أن عرفك طريق التحصن ويسر لك أسبابه لا فى أن يندفع عنك العذاب دون حصنه كما أن كرم الله تعالى فى دفع برد الشتاء أن خلق النار وهداك لطريق استخراجها من بين حديدة وحجر حتى تدفعى بها برد الشتاء عن نفسك</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book3.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Fear and Hope</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And among the wonders is that when we want wealth in the worldly life (Dunya), we sow and plant and trade and ride the seas and deserts and take risks, and when we want to seek the rank of knowledge, we understand and toil in memorizing it and repeating it and become famous, and we strive in seeking our provisions and do not trust in God's guarantee for us, nor do we sit in our houses and say: O God, provide for us. Then when our eyes covet the permanent, abiding kingdom, we content ourselves with saying with our tongues: O God, forgive us and have mercy on us. And He to whom is our hope and by whom is our honor calls to us and says: 'And there is not for man except what he strives for. And let not the deceiver deceive you concerning God. O man, what has made you arrogant toward your Lord, the Noble?' Then all of that does not awaken us nor bring us out from the valleys of our deception (Ghurur) and our hopes. So this is nothing but a tremendous trial unless God favors us with a sincere repentance (Tawbah Nasuh) by which He rescues us and grants us refuge. So we ask God the Exalted to grant us repentance, rather we ask Him to make the innermost secrets (Sara'ir) of our hearts (Qulub) yearn for repentance, and that He not make the movement of the tongue with asking for repentance the ultimate portion of our share, so that we become among those who say and do not act, and hear and do not accept. When we hear the admonition, we weep, and when the time comes for acting upon what we have heard, we disobey—a sign of abandonment greater than this. So we ask God the Exalted to bestow upon us success (Tawfiq) and right guidance (Rushd) by His grace and favor.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ومن العجائب أنا إذا أردنا المال في الدنيا زرعنا وغرسنا واتجرنا وركبنا البحار والبراري وخاطرنا وإن أردنا طلب رتبة العلم فقهنا وتعبنا في حفظه وتكراره وشهرنا ونجتهد في طلب أرزاقنا ولا نثق بضمان الله لنا ولا نجلس في بيوتنا فنقول اللهم ارزقنا ثم إذا طمعت أعيننا نحو الملك الدائم المقيم قنعنا بأن نقول بألسنتنا اللهم اغفر لنا وارحمنا والذي إليه رجاؤنا وبه اعتزازنا ينادينا ويقول ﴿ وإن ليس للإنسان إلا ما سعى. ولا يغرنكم بالله الغرور. يا أيها الإنسان ما عزك بربك الكريم ﴾{} ثم كل ذلك لا ينبهنا ولا يخرجنا عن أودية غرورنا وأمانينا فما هذه إلا محنة هائلة إن لم يتفضل الله علينا بتوبة نصوح يتداركنا بها ويجيرنا فنسأل الله تعالى أن يتوب علينا بل نسأله أن يشوق إلى التوبة سرائر قلوبنا وأن لا يجعل حركة اللسان بسؤال التوبة غاية حظنا فنكون ممن يقول ولا يعمل ويسمع ولا يقبل إذا سمعنا الوعظ بكينا وإذا جاء وقت العمل بما سمعناه عصينا علامة للخذلان أعظم من هذا فنسأل الله تعالى أن يمن علينا بالتوفيق والرشد بمنه وفضله</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-6a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of the World</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And Al-Hasan said after reciting the saying of the Exalted: \"So do not let the worldly life deceive you\" - Who said this?

This is sufficient in censuring deception (al-ghurur), and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"How excellent is the sleep of the intelligent and their breaking of fast, how they surpass the staying awake of the foolish and their striving, and a speck's weight of one with piety (taqwa) and certainty (yaqin) is better than the earth filled with the deceived.\" And he, peace be upon him, said: \"The intelligent is he who holds his soul (nafs) accountable and works for what is after death, and the foolish is he who follows his soul (nafs) its desire (hawa) and hopes upon Allah.\" And all that has come regarding the virtue of knowledge and the censure of ignorance is evidence for censuring deception (al-ghurur), because deception (al-ghurur) is an expression for some types of ignorance, for ignorance is to believe a thing and see it contrary to what it is, and deception (al-ghurur) is ignorance except that there is ignorance that is not deception (ghurur), but it necessitates deception (al-ghurur): a deceived one in it specified and a deceived one by it which is that which deceives him. So whenever the striving one believes something that agrees with desire (al-hawa) and the cause necessitating ignorance is a false doubt and imagination he thinks is evidence but is not evidence, the ignorance occurring by it is called deception (ghurur). So deception (al-ghurur) is the settling of the soul (al-nafs) to what agrees with desire (al-hawa), and the inclination of the nature (al-tab') to it from a doubt and trick of Satan, so whoever believes he is upon good either in the immediate or in the ultimate from a false doubt is deceived, and most people think of themselves good and they are mistaken in it, so most people then are deceived and if</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>اعلم أن قوله تعالى \"فلا تغرنكم الحياة الدنيا ولا يغرنكم بالله الغرور\" وقوله تعالى \"ولكنكم فتنتم أنفسكم وتربضتم وارتبتم وغرتكم الأماني\" الآية. كاف في ذم الغرور، وقد قال رسول الله ﭬ \"حبذا نوم الأكياس وفطرهم كيف يغبنون سهر الحمقى واجتهادهم ولمثقال ذرة من صاحب تقوى ويقين أفضل من ملئ الأرض من المغترين\"[1] وقال ﭬ \"الكيس من دان نفسه وعمل لما بعد الموت، والأحمق من اتبع نفسه هواها وتمنى على الله\"[2] وكل ما ورد في فضل العلم وذم الجهل فهو دليل على ذم الغرور، لأن الغرور عبارة عن بعض أنواع الجهل، إذ الجهل هو أن يعتقد الشيء ويراه على خلاف ما هو به، والغرور هو جهل إلا أن لك جهل ليس بغرور، بل يستدعي الغرور: مغروراً فيه مخصوصاً ومغروراً به وهو الذي يغره. فمهما كان المجهدل المعتقد شيئاً يوافق الهوى وكان السبب الموجب للجهل شبهة ومخيلة فاسدة يظن أنها دليل ولا تكون دليلاً سمي الجهل الحاصل به غروراً. فالغرور هو سكون النفس إلى ما يوافق الهوى، ويميل إليه الطبع عن شبهة وخدعة من الشيطان فمن اعتقد أنه على خير إما في العاجل أو في الآجل عن شبهة فاسدة فهو مغرور، وأكثر الناس يظنون بأنفسهم الخير وهم مخطئون فيه، فأكثر الناس إذن مغرورون وإن</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-10a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Self-Delusion</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>The first example is the delusion (Ghurur) of the disbelievers (Kuffar), among them are those whom worldly life (Al-Hayat Al-Dunya) deluded, and among them are those whom the deluder (Al-Gharur) deluded concerning Allah. As for those whom worldly life deluded: they are those who said: 'Cash (Naqd) is better than credit (Nasi'ah), and the worldly life is cash and the Hereafter (Al-Akhirah) is credit, so it is therefore better and must be preferred.' And they said: 'Certainty (Yaqin) is better than doubt (Shakk), and the pleasures of worldly life are certain while the pleasures of the Hereafter are doubtful, so do not abandon certainty for doubt.' These are corrupt analogies resembling the analogy of Iblis when he said 'I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.' And to these is the reference in His saying, the Exalted: 'Those are the ones who have purchased the worldly life [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.' And the cure for this delusion is either through affirmation of faith (Iman) or through proof (Burhan). As for affirmation through mere faith, it is to believe Allah, the Exalted, in His saying: 'Whatever you have will end, but what Allah has is lasting' and in His saying, the Mighty and Majestic: 'And what is with Allah is better' and His saying: 'And the Hereafter is better and more enduring' and His saying: 'And worldly life is not but the enjoyment of delusion' and His saying: 'So do not let the worldly life delude you.' And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ informed groups of disbelievers of this, so they followed him, believed him, and had faith in him without demanding proof. And among them were those who said: 'I adjure you by Allah, did Allah send you as a messenger?' He would say 'Yes,' so they would believe. And this is the faith of the common people, and it removes from delusion, and this is likened to the child believing his father that attending the school is better than attending the playground, even though he does not know the reason for its being better.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>المثال الأول غرور الكفار، فمنهم من غرته الحياة الدنيا ومنهم من غره بالله الغرور، أما الذين غرتهم الحياة الدنيا: فهم الذين قالوا: النقد خير من النسيئة والدنيا نقد والآخرة نيسئة فهي إذن خير فلا بد من إيثارها، وقالوا: اليقين خير من الشك ولذات الدنيا يقين ولذات الآخرة شك فلا تترك اليقين بالشك. وهذه أقيسة فاسدة تشبه قياس إبليس حيث قال \"أنا خير منه خلقتني من نار وخلقته من طين\" وإلى هؤلاء الإشارة بقوله تعالى \"أولئك الذين اشتروا الحياة الدنيا بالآخرة فلا يخفف عنهم العذاب ولا هم ينصرون\" وعلاج هذا الغرور إما بتصديق الإيمان وإما بالبرهان؛ أما التصديق بمجرد الإيمان فهو أن يصدق الله تعالى في قوله \"ما عندكم ينفد وما عند الله باق\" وفي قوله عز وجل \"وما عند الله خير\" وقوله \"والآخرة خير وأبقى\" وقوله \"وما الحياة الدنيا إلا متاع الغرور\" وقوله \"فلا تغرنكم الحياة الدنيا\" وقد أخبر رسول الله ﭬ بذلك طوائف من الكفار فقلدوه وصدقوه وآمنوا به ولم يطالبوه بالبرهان[3]، ومنهم من قال: نشدتك الله أبعثك الله رسولاً؟ فكان يقول \"نعم\" فيصدق[4] وهذا إيمان العامة وهو يخرج من الغرور، وينزل هذا منزله تصديق الصبي والده في أن حضور المكتب خير من حضور الملعب مع أنه لا يدري وجه كونه خيراً.</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.2","h":"0.15","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.46","c":"الشَّيْطَانَ","d":"l-shayṭāna","e":"َnَٰṭْyَّhslٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.57","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.46","c":"عَدُوٌّ","d":"ʿaduwwun","e":"ٌّwُdَʿع"},{"b":"4.8","h":"6.84","c":"فَاتَّخِذُوهُ","d":"fa-ittakhidhūhu","e":"ُhwُhdِhkَّtٱَf"},{"b":"6.2","h":"9.27","c":"عَدُوًّا","d":"ʿaduwwan","e":"āًّwُdَʿع"},{"b":"7.9","h":"12.9","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"āَmَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"9.4","h":"14.63","c":"يَدْعُوا","d":"yadʿū","e":"۟āwُʿعْdَy"},{"b":"10.1","h":"15.94","c":"حِزْبَهُ","d":"ḥiz'bahu","e":"ۥُhَbْzِḥ"},{"b":"11.2","h":"17.68","c":"لِيَكُونُوا","d":"liyakūnū","e":"۟āwُnwُkَyِl"},{"b":"12.3","h":"19.84","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"12.7","h":"20.41","c":"أَصْحَابِ","d":"aṣḥābi","e":"ِbَٰḥْṣَaʾ"},{"b":"13.6","h":"22.08","c":"السَّعِيرِ","d":"l-saʿīri","e":"ِryِʿعَّslٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy.

He said the Exalted: 'Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.' And He said the Exalted: 'Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - indeed, he is to you a clear enemy?' So it is incumbent upon the servant to occupy himself with repelling the enemy from himself, not with asking about his origin, lineage, and dwelling. Yes, he should ask about his weapon to repel him from himself, and the weapon of Satan is the desire (Hawa) and the lusts (Shahawat), and that is sufficient for the knowers. As for knowing his essence, attributes, and reality - we seek refuge in Allah from him - and the reality of the angels, that is the field of the knowers (Arifin) who delve deeply into the sciences of unveilings (Mukashafat), so there is no need in the science of transaction (Mu'amalah) to know it. Yes, one should know that the thoughts (Khawatir) are divided into what is known decisively to be calling to evil - so it is not hidden that it is a whispering (Waswasa) - and into what is known to be calling to good - so there is no doubt that it is an inspiration (Ilham) - and into what is ambiguous in it - so one does not know whether it is from the prompting (Lamma) of the angel or from the prompting of Satan. For among the stratagems of Satan is that he presents evil in the guise of good, and the distinction in that is obscure, and most worshippers perish by it. For Satan is not able to call them to clear evil, so he portrays evil in the image of good, as he says to the scholar by way of admonition: 'Do you not look at the creation, and they are dead from ignorance, perished from heedlessness, they have approached the Fire? Do you not have mercy upon the servants of Allah to rescue them from the calamities with your advice and admonition?

Therefore, not a blink of an eye, nor a turn of thought (Khatir), nor a glance of the eye occurs in the dominion (Al-Mulk) and the kingdom (Al-Malakut) except by the decree (Qada) of Allah and His power (Qudrah) and by His will (Iradah) and His wish (Mashiyyah). From it comes evil (Al-Sharr) and good (Al-Khayr), benefit (Al-Naf) and harm (Al-Darr), Islam and disbelief (Al-Kufr), recognition (Al-Irfan) and denial (Al-Nukr), success (Al-Fawz) and loss (Al-Khusran), misguidance (Al-Ghawayah) and guidance (Al-Rushd), obedience (Al-Ta'ah) and disobedience (Al-Isyan), polytheism (Al-Shirk) and faith (Al-Iman). There is no repeller of His decree, nor any overturner of His judgment. He misguides whom He wills and guides whom He wills. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. This is indicated by transmission (Al-Naql) from the unanimous saying of the community: 'What He wills happens, and what He does not will does not happen,' and by the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic: 'If Allah had willed, He would have guided all people,' and His saying, the Exalted: 'And if We had willed, We could have given every soul (Nafs) its guidance.' It is indicated by reason (Al-Aql) that if sins (Al-Ma'asi) and crimes were something Allah dislikes and does not will, but they occur in accordance with the will of the enemy, Iblis—may Allah curse him—even though he is an enemy of Allah, the Exalted, and what occurs in accordance with the will of the enemy is more than what occurs in accordance with His will, the Exalted, then I wonder how a Muslim can permit reducing the dominion of the Compeller (Al-Jabbar), Possessor of Majesty (Al-Jalal) and Honor (Al-Ikram), to a rank that, if the leadership of a village chief were reduced to it, he would disdain it. For if what persists for the enemy of the chief in the village is more than what is established for him, he would disdain his leadership and disavow his authority. Disobedience (Al-Ma'siyah) is predominant over creation, and all of that, according to the innovators, occurs contrary to the will of the Truth (Al-Haqq), the Exalted. This is the utmost weakness and incapacity—exalted is the Lord of lords above what the wrongdoers say, high and great. Then, whenever it becomes clear that the actions of the servants are created by Allah, it follows that they are willed by Him. If it is said: 'How can He forbid what He wills and command what He does not will?' We say: Command (Al-Amr) is different from will (Al-Iradah). Therefore, if a master strikes his servant and the ruler reproaches him for it, and he excuses himself by the rebellion of his servant against him, and the ruler disbelieves him, then he shows...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الأصل الثالث: أن فعل العبد وإن كان كسبا للعبد فلا يخرج عن كونه مرادا لله سبحانه فلا يجري في الملك والملكوت طرفة عين ولا لفتة خاطر ولا فلتة ناظر إلا بقضاء الله وقدرته وبإرادته ومشيئته ومنه الشر والخير والنفع والضر والإسلام والكفر والعرفان والنكر والفوز والخسران والغواية والرشد والطاعة والعصيان والشرك والإيمان لا راد لقضائه ولا معقب لحكمه يضل من يشاء ويهدي من يشاء لا يسئل عما يفعل وهم يسألون ويدل عليه من النقل قول الأمة قاطبة ما شاء كان وما لم يشأ لم يكن وقول الله عز وجل أن لو يشاء الله لهدى الناس جميعا وقوله تعالى ولو شئنا لآتينا كل نفس هداها ويدل عليه من جهة العقل أن المعاصي والجرائم إن كان الله يكرهها ولا يريدها وإنما هي جارية على وفق إرادة العدو إبليس لعنه الله مع أنه عدو لله سبحانه والجاري على وفق إرادة العدو أكثر من الجاري على وفق إرادته تعالى فليت شعري كيف يستجيز المسلم أن يرد ملك الجبار ذي الجلال والإكرام إلى رتبة لو ردت إليها رياسة زعيم ضيعة لاستنكف منها إذ لو كان ما يستمر لعدو الزعيم في القرية أكثر مما يستقيم له لاستنكف من زعامته وتبرأ عن ولايته والمعصية هي الغالبة على الخلق وكل ذلك جار عند المبتدعة على خلاف إرادة الحق تعالى وهذا غاية الضعف والعجز تعالى رب الأرباب عن قول الظالمين علوا كبيرا ثم مهما ظهر أن أفعال العباد مخلوقة لله صح أنها مرادة له فإن قيل فكيف ينهى عما يريد ويأمر بما لا يريد قلنا الأمر غير الإرادة ولذلك إذا ضرب السيد عبده فعاتبه السلطان عليه فاعتذر بتمرد عبده عليه فكذبه السلطان فأرا</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 1: Book of Knowledge</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: Misguidance (Dhalalah) has sweetness in the hearts (Qulub) of its people.

Allah the Exalted said: \"Is he whose evil deed is made fair-seeming unto him so that he sees it as good?\" and He said: \"And they think that they are doing well.\" And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) informed: that this will prevail over the latter part of this nation [101], and by this the past nations perished when they split into factions, each proud of his opinion, \"and every party rejoices in what is with them.\" And all the people of innovation and misguidance only persist in them due to their pride in their opinions, and pride in innovation is the approval of what leads to desire and appetite with the assumption of its being truth. The treatment of this pride is more severe than the treatment of others because the possessor of erroneous opinion is ignorant of his error, and if he knew it he would abandon it, and the disease that is not known is not treated, and ignorance is a disease that is not known, so its cure is extremely difficult. Because the knower is able to clarify to the ignorant his ignorance and remove it from him, except if he is proud of his opinion and his ignorance, then he does not listen to the knower and accuses him. Indeed, Allah has imposed upon him a trial that destroys him while he thinks it a blessing, so how can his treatment be possible and how can he seek escape from what is the cause of his happiness in his belief? And his treatment in summary is that he be suspicious of his opinion always, not being deceived by it except when a decisive proof from the Book or the Sunnah or a sound rational evidence encompassing the conditions of evidences testifies, and the human will not know the evidences of the Sharia and the intellect and their conditions and the places of error in them except with a complete natural disposition and a penetrating intellect and diligence and exertion in seeking and practice with the Book and the Sunnah and sitting with the people of knowledge for a long time.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الثامن العجب بالرأي الخطأ. قال الله تعالى \"أفمن زين له سوء عمله فرآه حسناً\" وقال تعالى \"وهم يحسبون أنهم يحسنون صنعاً\" وقد أخبر رسول الله ﭬ: أن ذلك يغلب على آخر هذه الأمة[101] وبذلك هلكت الأمم السالفة إذ افترقت فرقاً فكل معجب برأيه \"وكل حزب بما لديهم فرحون\" وجميع أهل البدع والضلال إنما أصروا عليها لعجبهم بآرائهم والعجب بالبدعة هو استحسان ما يسوق إليه الهوى والشهوة مع ظن كونه حقاً، وعلاج هذا العجب أشد من علاج غيره لأن صاحب الرأي الخطأ جاهل بخطئه ولو عرفه لتركه، ولا يعالج الداء الذي لا يعرف والجهل داء لا يعرف فتعسر مداواته جداً. لأن العارف يقدر على أن يبين للجاهل جهله ويزيله عنه، إلا إذا كان معجباً برأيه وجهله فإنه لا يصغي إلى العارف ويتهمه، فقد سلط الله عليه بليّة تهلكه وهو يظنها نعمة فكيف يمكن علاجه وكيف يطلب الهرب مما هو سبب سعادته في اعتقاده؟ وإنما علاجه على الجملة أن يكون متهماً لرأيه أبداً لا يغتر به إلا أن يشهد قاطع منن كتاب أو سنة أو دليل عقلي صحيح جامع لشروط الأدلة ولن يعرف الإنسان أدلة الشرع والعقل وشروطها ومكامن الغلط فيها إلا بقريحة تامة وعقل ثاقب وجد وتشمر في الطلب وممارسة للكتاب والسنة ومجالسة لأهل العلم طو</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='#' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 2: The Lawful and Prohibited</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>For He misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills, and He causes death whom He wills and gives life whom He wills.

And why do I estimate this when what I estimate has already occurred? For indeed Allah sent our Prophet (peace be upon him) after an interval of messengers, and the law of Jesus (peace be upon him) had passed upon it close to six hundred years, and the people were divided into those who disbelieved in him from the Jews and idol worshippers, and into those who believed in him, and corruption had spread among them as it has spread in our time now. And the disbelievers were addressed with the branches of the law, and the wealth was in the hands of those who disbelieved in him and those who believed. As for the disbelievers, they were transacting without the law of Jesus (peace be upon him), and as for the believers, they were being lax with the foundation of belief just as Muslims are lax now, even though the era of prophethood was closer.

Then from this seed is generated the tree of love and knowledge, which is the good word (Kalimah Tayyibah) that Allah struck as a parable when He said: \"Allah strikes a parable of a good word like a good tree whose root is firm and its branch is in the sky.\" And to it is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: \"To Him ascends the good word (Al-Kalim Al-Tayyib)\", meaning the knowledge (Ma'rifah), \"and the righteous deed (Al-'Amal Al-Salih) raises it.\" So the righteous deed is like beauty for this knowledge and like a servant, and indeed all righteous deeds are in purifying the heart first from the world then in maintaining its purity, so the deed is not intended except for this knowledge, and as for the knowledge of how to perform the deed, it is intended for the deed, so knowledge is the first and it is the last, and indeed the first is the knowledge of interaction (Ilm Al-Mu'amalah) and its purpose is the deed, and the purpose of interaction is the clarity (Safa') of the heart and its purity so that the clarity of the truth becomes evident in it and it becomes adorned with the knowledge of knowledge (Ilm Al-Ma'rifah), which is the knowledge of unveiling (Ilm Al-Mukashafah). And whenever this knowledge is attained, love follows it by necessity, just as one with a balanced temperament, if he sees beauty and perceives it with the apparent eye, loves it and inclines toward it, and whenever he loves it, pleasure (Ladhdhah) occurs, so pleasure follows love by necessity, and love follows knowledge by necessity, and one does not reach this knowledge after the cutting off of worldly distractions from the heart except with pure thought (Fikr Safi), constant remembrance (Dhikr Da'im), utmost effort in seeking, and continuous contemplation (Nadhar Mustamirr) in Allah the Exalted and in His attributes and in the dominion of His heavens and all His creatures.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>السبب الثاني: لقوة المحبة، قوة معرفة الله تعالى واتساعها واستيلاؤها على القلب، وذلك بعد تطهير القلب من جميع شواغل الدنيا وعلائقها يجري مجرى وضع البذر في الأرض بعد تنقيتها من الحشيش وهو الشطر الثاني. ثم يتولد من هذا البذر شجرة المحبة والمعرفة وهي الكلمة الطيبة التي ضرب الله بها مثلاً حيث قال: \" ضرب الله مثلاً كلمة طيبة كشجرة طيبة أصلها ثابت وفرعها في السماء \" وإليها الإشارة بقوله تعالى \" إليه يصعد الكلم الطيب \"، أي المعرفة \" والعمل الصالح يرفعه \" فالعمل الصالح كالجمال لهذه المعرفة وكالخادم وإنما العمل الصالح كله في تطهير القلب أولاً من الدنيا ثم إدامة طهارته، فلا يراد العمل إلا لهذه المعرفة، وأما العلم بكيفية العمل فيراد للعمل، فالعلم هو الأول وهو الآخر، وإنما الأول علم المعاملة وغرضه العمل، وغرض المعاملة صفاء القلب وطهارته ليتضح فيه جلية الحق ويتزين بعلم المعرفة وهو علم المكاشفة ومهما حصلت هذه المعرفة تبعتها المحبة بالضرورة، كما أن من كان معتدل المزاج إذا أبصر الجميل وأدركه بالعين الظاهرة أحبه ومال إليه، ومهما أحبه حصلت اللذة، فاللذة تبع المحبة بالضرورة، والمحبة تبع المعرفة بالضرورة، ولا يوصل إلى هذه المعرفة بعد انقطاع شواغل الدنيا من القلب إلا بالفكر الصافي والذكر الدائم والجد البالغ في الطلب والنظر المستمر في الله تعالى وفي صفاته وفي ملكوت سمواته وسائر مخلوقاته.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='#' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 2: Etiquette of Seclusion</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>The third [aspect] is that what is intended by it is knowledge of Allah and His attributes and His actions, for that is better than every deed. Rather, the purpose of deeds is to divert the hearts (Qulūb) from creation to the Creator, so that they may be stirred after turning to Him for His knowledge (Maʿrifah) and His love. Thus, the deed and knowledge of the deed are intended for this knowledge, and this knowledge is the ultimate goal of the seekers (Murīdīn), and the deed is like a condition for it. And to this is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: 'To Him ascends the good word (Al-Kalim al-Ṭayyib), and the righteous deed raises it.' So the good word (Al-Kalim al-Ṭayyib) is this knowledge, and the deed is like the carrier that raises it to its intended destination, so the raised is better than the raiser.

If love were to flow from the father to the son, it would be likely that hatred would also flow. Rather, the truth is that 'no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another' (Quran 35:18). And whoever thinks that he will be saved by the piety (Taqwa) of his father is like one who thinks that he will be satiated by his father's eating, quenched by his father's drinking, becomes knowledgeable by his father's learning, and reaches the Kaaba and sees it by his father's walking. Piety (Taqwa) is an individual obligation (Fard 'Ayn), so no parent can substitute for their child in it, and likewise the reverse. And with Allah is the reward of piety (Taqwa) 'on the Day when a man will flee from his brother, his mother, and his father' except by way of intercession (Shafa'a) for one upon whom Allah's anger has not intensified, so He permits intercession (Shafa'a) for him - as previously mentioned in the Book of Arrogance and Vanity.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فكما أنه لا يبغض الأب المطيع ببغضه للولد العاصي فكذلك لا يحب الولد العاصي بحبه للأب المطيع، ولو كان الحب يسري من الأب إلى الولد لأوشك أن يسري البغض أيضاً بل الحق أن لا تزر وازرة وزر أخرى. ومن ظن أنه ينجو بتقوى أبيه كمن ظن أنه يشبع بأكل أبيه ويروى بشرب أبيه، ويصير عالماً بتعلم أبيه ويصل إلى الكعبة ويراها بمشي أبيه. فالتقوى فرض عين فلا يجزه فيه والد عن ولده شيئاً وكذا العكس، وعند الله جزاء التقوى \"يوم يفر المرء من أخيه وأمه وأبيه\" إلا على سبيل الشفاعة لمن لم يشتد غضب الله عليه فيأذن في الشفاعة له - كما سبق في كتاب الكبر والعجب.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-9a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Pride and Conceit</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>So do not contemplate what is possible for others, but rather what is feared in your own right, for indeed no bearer of burdens (Wazira) bears the burden (Wizr) of another, and the punishment of another does not alleviate anything from your punishment.

And in the tradition, supplications are presented to the dead on trays of light. And the statement of the one who says that the child might not be righteous does not affect it, for he is a believer, and righteousness is predominant among the children of the people of religion, especially if he resolves to raise him and compel him to righteousness. And in summary, the supplication of the believer for his parents is beneficial, whether they are righteous or wicked, for he is rewarded for his supplications and good deeds, for they are from his earning, and he is not held accountable for their evil deeds, for no bearer of burdens bears the burden of another. And therefore, the Exalted said: 'We have joined their offspring with them, and We have not diminished anything from their deeds' meaning: We have not decreased anything from their deeds, and We have made their children an increase in their good deeds.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الوجه الثالث أن يبقى بعده ولدا صالحا يدعو له كما ورد في الخبر أن جميع عمل ابن آدم منقطع إلا ثلاثا فذكر الولد الصالح وفي الخبر إن الأدعية تعرض على الموتى على أطباق من نور وقول القائل إن الولد ربما لم يكن صالحا لا يؤثر فإنه مؤمن والصلاح هو الغالب على أولاد ذوي الدين لا سيما إذا عزم على تربيته وحمله على الصلاح وبالجملة دعاء المؤمن لأبويه مفيد برا كان أو فاجرا فهو مثاب على دعواته وحسناته فإنه من كسبه وغير مؤاخذ بسيئاته فإنه لا تزر وازرة وزر أخرى ولذلك قال تعالى ألحقنا بهم ذرياتهم وما ألتناهم من عملهم من شيء أي ما نقصناهم من أعمالهم وجعلنا أولادهم مزيدا في إحسانهم.</div></div></div>"}},"19":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.9","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"0.75","h":"1.69","c":"يَسْتَوِي","d":"yastawī","e":"àِwَtْsَy"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.99","c":"الْأَعْمَى","d":"l-aʿmā","e":"ٰàَmْʿعَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.69","c":"وَالْبَصِيرُ","d":"wal-baṣīru","e":"ُryِṣَbْlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"Not equal are the blind and the seeing,"}},"20":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.3","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"0.44","h":"0.72","c":"الظُّلُمَاتُ","d":"l-ẓulumātu","e":"ُtَٰmُlُّẓlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.94","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"2.0","h":"4.35","c":"النُّورُ","d":"l-nūru","e":"ُrwُّnlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Nor are the darknesses and the light,"}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.61","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"0.4","h":"1.09","c":"الظِّلُّ","d":"l-ẓilu","e":"ُّlِّẓlٱ"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.63","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"1.5","h":"3.3","c":"الْحَرُورُ","d":"l-ḥarūru","e":"ُrwُrَḥْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Nor are the shade and the heat,"}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.55","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"0.53","h":"1.43","c":"يَسْتَوِي","d":"yastawī","e":"àِwَtْsَy"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.91","c":"الْأَحْيَاءُ","d":"l-aḥyāu","e":"ُءٓāَyْḥَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.89","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"4.2","h":"6.56","c":"الْأَمْوَاتُ","d":"l-amwātu","e":"ُtَٰwْmَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"7.8","h":"11.65","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"13.06","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.7","h":"14.49","c":"يُسْمِعُ","d":"yus'miʿu","e":"ُʿعِmْsُy"},{"b":"10.5","h":"15.9","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"11.5","h":"17.19","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"14.5","h":"21.4","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"16.2","h":"23.24","c":"أَنْتَ","d":"anta","e":"َtnَaʾ"},{"b":"17.5","h":"24.73","c":"بِمُسْمِعٍ","d":"bimus'miʿin","e":"ٍʿعِmْsُmِb"},{"b":"19.","h":"27.34","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَّm"},{"b":"20.5","h":"28.55","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"20.8","h":"29.05","c":"الْقُبُورِ","d":"l-qubūri","e":"ِrwُbُqْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And not equal are the living and the dead.

For among the first aspects of that knowledge is that it becomes apparent to him that sins (Ma'asi) are deadly, destructive poisons. Have you seen anyone who consumes poison while knowing it to be deadly poison? What you hear from the superficial imitators (Mutarassimin) is speech they fabricate with their tongues at one time and repeat with their hearts (Qulub) at another, and that is not from knowledge in anything. Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'Knowledge is not in abundant narration; rather, knowledge is a light (Nur) cast into the heart (Qalb).' And some said: 'Indeed, knowledge is fear (Khashya),' due to His saying, the Exalted: 'Only those among His servants who have knowledge (Ulama) fear Allah' (Fatir: 28). And it is as if he pointed to the most specific fruits of knowledge. Therefore, some of the verifiers (Muhaqqiqin) said: The meaning of their saying, 'We learned knowledge for other than Allah, but knowledge refused to be except for Allah,' is that knowledge refused and withheld itself from us, so its reality (Haqiqa) was not unveiled to us; rather, we only obtained its narration (Hadith) and its expressions (Alfaz).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فإن قلت: كم من طالب ردىء الأخلاق حصل العلوم فهيهات ما أبعده عن العلم الحقيقي النافع في الآخرة الجالب للسعادة فإن من أوائل ذلك العلم أن يظهر له أن المعاصي سموم قاتلة مهلكة وهل رأيت من يتناول سما مع علمه بكونه سما قاتلا إنما الذي تسمعه من المترسمين حديث يلفقونه بألسنتهم مرة ويرددونه بقلوبهم أخرى وليس ذلك من العلم في شيء قال ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه ليس العلم بكثرة الرواية إنما العلم نور يقذف في القلب وقال بعضهم إنما العلم الخشية لقوله تعالى: (إنما يخشى الله من عباده العلماء( (فاطر: 28). وكأنه أشار إلى أخص ثمرات العلم ولذلك قال بعض المحققين معنى قولهم تعلمنا العلم لغير الله فأبى العلم أن يكون إلا لله أن العلم أبى وامتنع علينا فلم تنكشف لنا حقيقته وإنما حصل لنا حديثه وألفاظه.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 1: Book of Knowledge</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>Its evidences from the Quran are His saying, the Mighty and Majestic: 'Allah bears witness that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice' (Al Imran 3:18).

And Allah, the Exalted, said: 'Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees' (Al-Mujadilah: 11). Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: 'For the scholars are degrees above the believers by seven hundred degrees, the distance between two degrees being a journey of five hundred years.' And the Mighty and Majestic said: 'Say, \"Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\"' And He, the Exalted, said: 'Only those fear Allah from among His servants who are scholars' (Quran 35:28). And He, the Exalted, said: 'Say, \"Sufficient is Allah as Witness between me and you, and [from] whoever has knowledge of the Scripture.\"' And He, the Exalted, said: 'Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, \"I will bring it to you.\"' indicating that he was empowered by the strength of knowledge.

And He, the Exalted, said: 'And these examples We present to the people, but none will understand them except those of knowledge.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'And if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it.' referring His ruling in events to their deduction and equating their rank with the rank of the prophets in uncovering Allah's ruling. And it is said regarding His saying, the Exalted: 'O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts' meaning knowledge, 'and adornment' meaning certainty (Yaqin), 'and the clothing of righteousness (Taqwa)' meaning modesty (Haya'). And the Mighty and Majestic said: 'And We had certainly brought them a Book which We detailed by knowledge.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'So We will surely relate [their deeds] to them with knowledge.'

Dhu al-Nun, may God have mercy on him, said: 'The fear of Hell compared to the fear of separation is like a drop that has fallen into a deep sea.' And this is the fear (Khashya) of the scholars, where He, the Exalted, said: 'Indeed, only those who have knowledge (Al-'Ulama') among His servants fear God.' And the general believers also have a share of this fear, but it is merely by imitation (Taqleed), like the fear of a child from a snake by imitating his father, and that is not based on insight (Bassira), so it weakens and disappears quickly. Indeed, the child might see the snake charmer proceed to take the snake, look at him, be deceived by him, and dare to take it by imitating him, just as he refrained from taking it by imitating his father. Imitative beliefs are weak in general, unless they are strengthened by witnessing their confirming causes continuously and by persisting in their requirements in increasing acts of obedience (Taa'at) and avoiding sins (Ma'asi) for a long duration consistently. Therefore, whoever ascends to the peak of knowledge (Ma'rifa) and knows God, the Exalted, fears Him necessarily, so he does not need treatment to induce fear, just as whoever knows the lion and sees himself falling into its claws does not need treatment to induce fear into his heart (Qalb), but fears it necessarily, whether he wills or not. And for that reason, God, the Exalted, revealed to David, peace be upon him: 'Fear Me as you fear the predatory lion.' And there is no means to induce fear of the predatory lion except knowledge of the lion and knowledge of falling into its claws, so he does not need any means. Similarly, whoever knows God, the Exalted, knows that He does what He wills and does not care, and decrees what He wants, and does not fear the closeness of the angels without a prior means, and He banished Iblis.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>وأما الثاني وهو الأعلى فأن يكون الله هو المخوف أعني أن يخاف العبد الحجاب عنه ويرجو القرب منه. قال ذو النون رحمه الله تعالى خوف النار عند خوف الفراق كقطرة قطرت في بحر لجي وهذه خشية العلماء حيث قال تعالى: ﴿ إنما يخشى الله من عباده العلماء ﴾ {} ولعموم المؤمنين أيضا حظ من هذه الخشية ولكن هو بمجرد التقليد أيضا هي خوف الصبي من الحية تقليدا لأبيه وذلك لا يستند إلى بصيرة فلا جرم يضعف ويزول على قرب حتى إن الصبي ربما يرى المعزم يقدم على أخذ الحية فينظر إليه ويغتر به فيتجرأ على أخذها تقليدا له كما احترز من أخذها تقليدا لأبيه والعقائد التقليدية ضعيفة في الغالب إلا إذا قويت بمشاهدة أسبابها المؤكدة لها على الدوام وبالمواظبة على مقتضاها في تكثير الطاعات واجتناب المعاصي مدة طويلة على الاستمرار فإذن من ارتقى إلى ذروة المعرفة وعرف الله تعالى خافه بالضرورة فلا يحتاج إلى علاج لجلب الخوف كما أن من عرف السبع ورأى نفسه واقعا في مخالبه لا يحتاج إلى علاج لجلب الخوف إلى قلبه بل يخافه بالضرورة شاء أم أبى ولذلك أوحى الله تعالى إلى داود عليه الصلاة والسلام خفني كما تخاف السبع الضاري ولا حيلة في جلب الخوف من السبع الضاري إلا معرفة السبع ومعرفة الوقوع في مخالبة فلا يحتاج إلى حيلة سواء فمن عرف الله تعالى عرف أنه يفعل ما يشاء ولا يبالي ويحكم ما يريد ولا يخاف قرب الملائكة من غير وسيلة سابقة وأبعد إبليس</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book3.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Fear and Hope</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And as for the method of citation from the verses and reports, what has come regarding the virtue of fear is beyond enumeration, and sufficient as an indication of its virtue is that Allah the Exalted has gathered for those who fear: guidance, mercy, knowledge, and pleasure, which are the collective stations of the people of the Gardens. And Allah the Exalted said: 'And guidance and mercy for those who are in awe of their Lord' (Quran 16:128). And He the Exalted said: 'Indeed, only those who fear Allah from among His servants are the knowledgeable ones' (Quran 35:28). He described them with knowledge due to their fear. And He the Mighty and Majestic said: 'Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him; that is for whoever fears his Lord' (Quran 98:8). And everything that indicates the virtue of knowledge indicates the virtue of fear, because fear is the fruit of knowledge. And therefore, it came in the report of Moses, upon him the best of prayers and peace: 'And as for those who fear, for them is the Highest Companion, in which they are not shared.' So see how He singled them out with the companionship of the Highest Companion, and that is because they are the knowledgeable ones, and the knowledgeable ones have a rank of companionship with the prophets, because they are the inheritors of the prophets, and the companionship of the Highest Companion is for the prophets and those who join them. And therefore (when the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was given the choice during his terminal illness between remaining in the world and coming to Allah the Exalted, he would say: 'I ask You for the Highest Companion' [60]). So then, if one looks at its producer, it is knowledge, and if one looks at its fruit, it is piety (Wara') and God-consciousness (Taqwa). And what has come regarding their virtues is not hidden, until indeed the outcome has become marked with God-consciousness (Taqwa), specified by it, just as praise has become specified for Allah the Exalted and prayer for the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, until it is said: 'Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and the outcome is for the God-conscious ones (Mut-taqeen), and prayers upon our master Muhammad, peace be upon him, and all his family.' And Allah the Exalted has specified God-consciousness (Taqwa) with addition to Himself, so He the Exalted said: 'Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is God-consciousness (Taqwa) from you' (Quran 22:37). And indeed, God-consciousness (Taqwa) is an expression of restraint by the dictate of fear, as preceded.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>وأما بطريق الإقتباس من الآيات والأخبار فما ورد في فضيلة الخوف خارج عن الحصر وناهيك دلالة على فضيلته جمع الله تعالى للخائفين الهدى والرحمة والعلم والرضوان وهي مجامع مقامات أهل الجنان وقال الله تعالى: ﴿ وهدى ورحمة للذين هم لربهم يرهبون ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ إنما يخشى الله من عباده العلماء ﴾ {} وصفهم بالعلم لخشيتهم وقال عز وجلّ: ﴿ رضى الله عنهم ورضوا عنه ذلك لمن خشى ربه ﴾ {} وكل ما دل على فضيلة العلم دل على فضيلة الخوف لأن الخوف ثمرة العلم ولذلك جاء في خبر موسى عليه أفضل الصلاة والسلام وأما الخائفون فإن لهم الرفيق الأعلى لا يشاركون فيه فانظر كيف أفردهم بمرافقة الرفيق الأعلى وذلك لأنهم العلماء والعلماء لهم رتبة مرافقة الأنبياء لأنهم ورثة الأنبياء ومرافقة الرفيق الأعلى للأنبياء ومن يلحق بهم ولذلك (لما خير رسول الله ﭬ في مرض موته بين البقاء في الدنيا وبين القدوم على الله تعالى كان يقول أسألك الرفيق الأعلى[60]) فإذن إن نظر إلى مثمره فهو العلم وإن نظر إلى ثمرته فالورع والتقوى ولا يخفى ما ورد في فضائلهما حتى إن العاقب صارت موسومة بالتقوى مخصوصة بها كما صار الحمد مخصوصا بالله تعالى والصلاة برسول الله ﭬ حتى يقال الحمد لله رب العالمين والعاقبة للمتقين والصلاة على سيدنا محمد ﭬ وآله أجمعين وقد خصص الله تعالى التقوى بالإضافة إلى نفسه فقال تعالى: ﴿ لن ينال الله لحومها ولا دماؤها ولكن يناله التقوى منكم ﴾ {} وإنما التقوى عبارة عن كف بمقتضى الخوف كما سب</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-10a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Self-Delusion</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>For whoever knows Allah (the Exalted) knows from His attributes that He destroys the worlds and does not care, and knows that he is subjugated in the power of One who, if He destroyed thousands upon thousands like him and made the punishment eternal upon them for eternity, it would not affect Him with any effect, nor would any compassion take Him regarding it, nor would any distress afflict Him concerning it.

For Allah the Exalted has said: 'If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good' (Quran 2:271) {} and that is where the situation necessitates disclosure, either for emulation or because the asker only asked in public view, so one should not refrain from giving charity out of fear of hypocrisy in publicity; rather, one should give charity and guard his secret from hypocrisy as much as possible. This is because in publicity there is a third danger besides reminding of favor and hypocrisy, which is exposing the cover of the poor person, for he might be harmed by being seen in the guise of a needy person. So whoever makes the asking public is the one who exposed his own cover, so one should not be cautious of this meaning in his publicity, and it is like exposing immorality upon one who concealed it, for that is prohibited, and spying into it and habitual mention of it is forbidden. As for whoever exposes it, the establishment of the punishment upon him is publicizing, but he is the cause in it. And with a similar meaning, the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Whoever casts off the garment of modesty (Haya'), then there is no backbiting for him.' And Allah the Exalted has said: 'And spend from what We have provided you, secretly and openly' (Quran 35:29) {} He encouraged to openness also because of the benefit of encouragement in it. So let the servant (Abd) be precise in contemplation in weighing this benefit against the danger that is in it, for that differs by circumstances and persons. Indeed, announcement in some circumstances for some persons may be better, and whoever knows the benefits and harms and does not look with the eye of desire, the most appropriate and fitting for every situation becomes clear to him.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الوظيفة الرابعة: أن يظهر حيث يعلم أن في إظهاره ترغيبا للناس في الاقتداء ويحرس سره من داعية الرياء بالطريق الذي سنذكره في معالجة الرياء في كتاب الرياء فقد قال الله عز وجل: ﴿ إن تبدوا الصدقات فنعما هي ﴾ {} وذلك حيث يقتضي الحال الإبداء إما للاقتداء وإما لأن السائل إنما سأل على ملأ من الناس فلا ينبغي أن يترك التصدق خيفة من الرياء في الإظهار بل ينبغي أن يتصدق ويحفظ سره عن الرياء بقدر الإمكان وهذا لأن في الإظهار محذورا ثالثا سوى المن والرياء وهو هتك ستر الفقير فإنه ربما يتأذى بأن يرى في صورة المحتاج فمن أظهر السؤال فهو الذي هتك ستر نفسه فلا يحذر هذا المعنى في إظهاره وهو كإظهار الفسق على من تستر به فإنه محظور والتجسس فيه والاعتياد بذكره منهي عنه فأما من أظهره فإقامة الحد عليه إشاعة ولكن هو السبب فيها وبمثل هذا المعنى قال ﭬ: (من ألقى جلباب الحياء فلا غيبة له[17]) وقد قال الله تعالى: ﴿ وأنفقوا مما رزقناهم سرا وعلانية ﴾ {} ندب إلى العلانية أيضا لما فيها من فائدة الترغيب فليكن العبد دقيق التأمل في وزن هذه الفائدة بالمحذور الذي فيه فإن ذلك يختلف بالأحوال والأشخاص فقد يكون الإعلان في بعض الأحوال لبعض الأشخاص أفضل ومن عرف الفوائد والغوائل ولم ينظر بعين الشهوة اتضح له الأولى والأليق بكل حال.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book3.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Fear and Hope</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those who recite the Book (Kitab) of Allah and establish the Prayer (Salah) and spend from what We have provided them, secretly and openly, they hope for a trade that will never perish.'
