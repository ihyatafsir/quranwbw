He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.\"*** And the Exalted said, ***\"Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship the satan [shaytan]? Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.\"*** Therefore, it is incumbent upon the servant ['abd] to busy himself with repelling the enemy ['aduww] from himself, not with asking about his origin, his lineage, or his dwelling. Yes, he should ask about his weapon [silah] so he can repel him from himself. And the weapon [silah] of the satan [shaytan] is caprice [hawa] and desires [shahawat]. And that is sufficient for the knowers ['alimin].</div></div></div>"}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.15","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"۟āwُrَfَk"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.6","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.42","c":"عَذَابٌ","d":"ʿadhābun","e":"ٌbāَhdَʿع"},{"b":"4.1","h":"6.72","c":"شَدِيدٌ","d":"shadīdun","e":"ٌdyِdَhs"},{"b":"6.7","h":"11.2","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"},{"b":"7.8","h":"13.06","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"8.7","h":"14.58","c":"وَعَمِلُوا","d":"waʿamilū","e":"۟āwُlِmَʿعَw"},{"b":"9.4","h":"15.88","c":"الصَّالِحَاتِ","d":"l-ṣāliḥāti","e":"ِtَٰḥِlَّٰṣlٱ"},{"b":"10.8","h":"18.44","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"mُhَl"},{"b":"12.2","h":"19.84","c":"مَغْفِرَةٌ","d":"maghfiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِfْغَّm"},{"b":"13.7","h":"22.23","c":"وَأَجْرٌ","d":"wa-ajrun","e":"ٌrْjgَaʾَw"},{"b":"15.7","h":"24.55","c":"كَبِيرٌ","d":"kabīrun","e":"ٌryِbَk"}],"a":{"g":"Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward."}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.5","c":"أَفَمَنْ","d":"afaman","e":"nَmَfَaʾ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.92","c":"زُيِّنَ","d":"zuyyina","e":"َnِّyُz"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.39","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.53","c":"سُوءُ","d":"sūu","e":"ُءٓwُs"},{"b":"4.4","h":"6.51","c":"عَمَلِهِ","d":"ʿamalihi","e":"ۦِhِlَmَʿع"},{"b":"5.4","h":"8.25","c":"فَرَءَاهُ","d":"faraāhu","e":"ُhāَءَrَf"},{"b":"6.3","h":"10.08","c":"حَسَنًا","d":"ḥasanan","e":"āًnَsَḥ"},{"b":"7.6","h":"13.3","c":"فَإِنَّ","d":"fa-inna","e":"َّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"9","h":"14.98","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.7","h":"16.4","c":"يُضِلُّ","d":"yuḍillu","e":"ُّlِḍُy"},{"b":"10.5","h":"17.9","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"11.6","h":"19.01","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"13.4","h":"21.23","c":"وَيَهْدِي","d":"wayahdī","e":"àِdْhَyَw"},{"b":"14.4","h":"23.05","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"15.5","h":"24.25","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"18.1","h":"29.25","c":"فَلَا","d":"falā","e":"āَlَf"},{"b":"18.6","h":"29.95","c":"تَذْهَبْ","d":"tadhhab","e":"ْbَhْhdَt"},{"b":"19.","h":"31.36","c":"نَفْسُكَ","d":"nafsuka","e":"َkُsْfَn"},{"b":"20.","h":"32.59","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"21.","h":"34.26","c":"حَسَرَاتٍ","d":"ḥasarātin","e":"ٍtَٰrَsَḥ"},{"b":"24.","h":"38.25","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"25.6","h":"39.74","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"26.4","h":"40.86","c":"عَلِيمٌ","d":"ʿalīmun","e":"ٌۢmyِlَʿع"},{"b":"28.1","h":"43.21","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"28.8","h":"44.33","c":"يَصْنَعُونَ","d":"yaṣnaʿūna","e":"َnwُʿعَnْṣَy"}],"a":{"g":"Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]?

Likewise, fear of God, Exalted is He, arises at times from knowledge [maʿrifa] of God, Exalted is He, and knowledge of His attributes—that if He destroyed all the worlds He would not care, and no preventer could prevent Him. At times it arises from the abundance of the servant's offenses through committing sins. At times it arises from both together. And according to his knowledge of the faults of his own soul [nafs], and his knowledge of the majesty [jalāl] of God, Exalted is He, and His self-sufficiency—that He is not questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned—so his fear becomes strong. Therefore, the most fearful of people towards his Lord are those most knowledgeable of themselves and their Lord. For this reason, He, peace be upon him, said: \"I am the most fearful of you towards God.\" And likewise, God, Exalted is He, said: \"Only those among His servants who have knowledge [ʿulamāʾ] fear God.\" Then, when knowledge is perfected, it bequeaths the majesty of fear and the burning of the heart. Then the effect of the burning overflows from the heart onto the body, onto the limbs, and onto the attributes.\n\nAs for in the body, it is through emaciation, pallor, fainting, cries, and weeping. The gallbladder may even rupture from it, leading to death, or it may ascend to the brain and corrupt the intellect, or it may become strong and beget despair and hopelessness.\n\nAs for in the limbs, it is by restraining them from sins and binding them to acts of obedience, making up for what was neglected and preparing for what is to come. For this reason it is said: \"The one who is fearful is not he who weeps and wipes his eyes, but rather he who abandons what he fears he will be punished for.\" And Abū al-Qāsim al-Ḥakīm said: \"Whoever fears something flees from it, but whoever fears God flees to Him.\" And it was said to Dhū al-Nūn: \"When is a servant fearful?\" He said: \"When he places his soul in the position of a sick person who abstains, fearing a prolonged illness.\"\n\nAs for in the attributes, it is by suppressing the appetites and clouding the pleasures, so that sins which were beloved to him become detested, just as honey becomes detested to one who desires it when he knows it contains poison. Thus, the appetites are burned by fear, the limbs are disciplined, and there occurs in the heart withering, humility, abasement, and submissiveness. Arrogance, rancor, and envy depart from it. Rather, he becomes wholly consumed by his preoccupation with his fear and by looking at the peril of his outcome. He has no leisure for anything else, and he has no occupation except vigilance [murāqaba], self-reckoning [muḥāsaba], striving [mujāhada], and being miserly with his breaths and glances, holding his soul to account for its passing thoughts, its steps, and its words. His state becomes like the state of one who has fallen into the claws of a ferocious beast, not knowing if it will become heedless of him so he escapes, or if it will pounce upon him so he perishes. Thus, his outward and inward become preoccupied with what he fears, with no room in him for anything else. This is the state of one whom fear has overcome and taken possession of. And such was the state of a group of the Companions and the Successors. The strength of vigilance, self-reckoning, and striving is according to the strength of the fear, which is the pain and burning of the heart. And the strength of the fear is according to the strength of the knowledge of the majesty of God and His attributes and His acts, and of the faults of the soul, and of the perils and terrors that lie before it.\n\nThe lowest degree of fear from which its effect appears in actions is that which prevents from the forbidden matters. The restraint resulting from the forbidden matters is called scrupulousness [warʿ]. If its strength increases, it restrains from that to which the possibility of prohibition extends, so he also restrains from that which he is not certain is forbidden.

Likewise, fear of God, Exalted is He, arises at times from knowledge [maʿrifa] of God, Exalted is He, and knowledge of His attributes—that if He destroyed all the worlds He would not care, and no preventer could prevent Him. At times it arises from the abundance of the servant's offenses through committing sins. At times it arises from both together. And according to his knowledge of the faults of his own soul [nafs], and his knowledge of the majesty [jalāl] of God, Exalted is He, and His self-sufficiency—that He is not questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned—so his fear becomes strong. Therefore, the most fearful of people towards his Lord are those most knowledgeable of themselves and their Lord. For this reason, He, peace be upon him, said: \"I am the most fearful of you towards God.\" And likewise, God, Exalted is He, said: \"Only those among His servants who have knowledge [ʿulamāʾ] fear God.\" Then, when knowledge is perfected, it bequeaths the majesty of fear and the burning of the heart. Then the effect of the burning overflows from the heart onto the body, onto the limbs, and onto the attributes.\n\nAs for in the body, it is through emaciation, pallor, fainting, cries, and weeping. The gallbladder may even rupture from it, leading to death, or it may ascend to the brain and corrupt the intellect, or it may become strong and beget despair and hopelessness.\n\nAs for in the limbs, it is by restraining them from sins and binding them to acts of obedience, making up for what was neglected and preparing for what is to come. For this reason it is said: \"The one who is fearful is not he who weeps and wipes his eyes, but rather he who abandons what he fears he will be punished for.\" And Abū al-Qāsim al-Ḥakīm said: \"Whoever fears something flees from it, but whoever fears God flees to Him.\" And it was said to Dhū al-Nūn: \"When is a servant fearful?\" He said: \"When he places his soul in the position of a sick person who abstains, fearing a prolonged illness.\"\n\nAs for in the attributes, it is by suppressing the appetites and clouding the pleasures, so that sins which were beloved to him become detested, just as honey becomes detested to one who desires it when he knows it contains poison. Thus, the appetites are burned by fear, the limbs are disciplined, and there occurs in the heart withering, humility, abasement, and submissiveness. Arrogance, rancor, and envy depart from it. Rather, he becomes wholly consumed by his preoccupation with his fear and by looking at the peril of his outcome. He has no leisure for anything else, and he has no occupation except vigilance [murāqaba], self-reckoning [muḥāsaba], striving [mujāhada], and being miserly with his breaths and glances, holding his soul to account for its passing thoughts, its steps, and its words. His state becomes like the state of one who has fallen into the claws of a ferocious beast, not knowing if it will become heedless of him so he escapes, or if it will pounce upon him so he perishes. Thus, his outward and inward become preoccupied with what he fears, with no room in him for anything else. This is the state of one whom fear has overcome and taken possession of. And such was the state of a group of the Companions and the Successors. The strength of vigilance, self-reckoning, and striving is according to the strength of the fear, which is the pain and burning of the heart. And the strength of the fear is according to the strength of the knowledge of the majesty of God and His attributes and His acts, and of the faults of the soul, and of the perils and terrors that lie before it.\n\nThe lowest degree of fear from which its effect appears in actions is that which prevents from the forbidden matters.
