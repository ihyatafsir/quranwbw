At this point, Satan says to him: Do not let this example delude you, for knowledge of the medicine does not remove the illness; rather, your objective is nearness to Allah and His reward, and knowledge brings reward, and he recites to him the reports that have come regarding the virtue of knowledge.

Likewise, the intellect [al-'aql] needs, first, to stipulate terms with the soul [al-nafs], so he imposes upon it the duties and stipulates for it the conditions, and guides it to the path of success [falāh], and binds it firmly to the command of walking those paths.

And the meaning of its purification is the attainment of the lights of Faith (Iman) in it, I mean the shining of the light of knowledge (ma'rifah), and that is what is intended by His saying, the Exalted: 'So whoever Allah wants to guide - He expands his breast to Islam. And whoever He wants to send astray - He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe. And this is the path of your Lord, straight. We have detailed the verses for a people who remember.' (Quran 6:125-126) 'So is one whose breast Allah has expanded to [accept] Islam and he is upon a light from his Lord [like one whose heart rejects it]?' (Quran 39:22) Yes, this manifestation and this Faith (Iman) has three levels: The first level is the faith of the common people, and it is faith of pure imitation (taqlid). The second is the faith of the theologians (mutakallimun), and it is mixed with a kind of reasoning, and its degree is close to the degree of the faith of the common people. The third is the faith of the knowers (arifun), and it is witnessed with the light of certainty (yaqin). And we explain to you these levels with an example, which is that your belief in Zayd being, for example, in the house has three degrees: The first is that one whom you have experienced as truthful informs you, and you do not know him to lie nor suspect him in speech, so your Heart (Qalb) finds tranquility in him and is reassured by his report merely by hearing. And this faith is by mere imitation, and it is like the faith of the common people, for when they reached the age of discernment, they heard from their fathers and mothers the existence of Allah, the Exalted, and His knowledge, His will, His power, and His other attributes, and the sending of the messengers and their truthfulness and what they brought, and as they heard it, they accepted it, adhered to it, and were reassured by it, and it did not occur to their minds to oppose what was said to them due to their good opinion of their fathers, mothers, and teachers.
