Yet, nothing hidden remains concealed from this light [nur], nor can any of Satan's stratagems succeed against it. Rather, Satan stands confounded, and he whispers embellished speech as delusion, but no heed is paid to him. And this heart [qalb], after its purification from destructive traits, becomes, in proximity [qurb], inhabited by salvific traits which we will mention: gratitude [shukr], patience [sabr], fear [khawf], hope [raja'], poverty [faqr], asceticism [zuhd], love [mahabba], contentment [rida'], longing [shawq], reliance [tawakkul], reflection [tafakkur], self-reckoning [muhasaba], and others besides. This is the heart upon which God, Mighty and Majestic, has turned His Countenance, and it is the contented heart [al-qalb al-mutma'inn] intended by His saying, Exalted is He: \"Is it not in the remembrance of God that hearts find contentment?\" and by His saying, Mighty and Majestic: \"O contented soul [al-nafs al-mutma'inna]!\"\n\nThe second heart is the forsaken heart [al-qalb al-makhdhul], crammed with caprice [hawa], defiled by blameworthy traits and vile things, its gates opened to the satans and its gates to the angels closed. The origin of evil within it is that a thought [khātir] from caprice sparks within it and whispers. The heart then looks to the ruler, the intellect [al-'aql], to seek a legal opinion from it and to discover the face of correctness in the matter. But the intellect has grown accustomed to serving caprice, become intimate with it, and persisted in devising stratagems for it and in aiding caprice. Thus, the soul [al-nafs] gains mastery and assists it. The breast expands with caprice, and its darknesses spread within it due to the withholding of the intellect's army from repelling it. The authority of Satan strengthens due to the expanse of his place caused by the spread of caprice. He turns to it with embellishment, delusion, and false hopes, and he whispers to it embellished speech as delusion. The authority of faith [iman] in the promise and the threat weakens, and the light of certainty [nur al-yaqin] regarding the fear of the Hereafter dims, for a dark smoke ascends from caprice to the heart, filling its corners until its lights are extinguished. The intellect thus becomes like an eye whose eyelids are filled with smoke, unable to see. This is what the dominance of desire [shahwa] does to the heart, until no possibility remains for the heart to pause and gain insight [istibsar]. Even if an admonisher were to show it and make it hear what is true in the matter, it would be blind to understanding and deaf to hearing. Desire rages within it, Satan triumphs, and the limbs move in accordance with caprice. Thus, disobedience [ma'siya] appears from the unseen realm [alam al-ghayb] into the realm of witness [alam al-shahada] by the decree and destiny of God, Exalted is He. To such a heart is the allusion in His saying, Exalted is He: \"Have you seen him who takes his caprice as his god? Would you then be a guardian over him?\" and \"Or do you suppose that most of them hear or understand? They are but like cattle; nay, they are further astray from the way,\" and in His saying, Mighty and Majestic: \"The word has been justified against most of them, for they do not believe,\" and in His saying: \"Alike it is to them whether you warn them or warn them not; they do not believe.\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>يخفى فيه الشرك الخفي الذي هو أخفى من دبيب النملة السوداء في الليلة الظلماء فلا يخفى على هذا النور خافية ولا يروج عليه شيء من مكايد الشيطان بل يقف الشيطان ويوحي زخرف القول غرورا فلا يلتفت إليه وهذا القلب بعد طهارته من المهلكات يصير على القرب معمورا بالمنجيات التي سنذكرها من الشكر والصبر والخوف والرجاء والفقر والزهد والمحبة والرضا والشوق والتوكل والتفكر والمحاسبة وغير ذلك وهو القلب الذي أقبل الله عز وجل بوجهه عليه وهو القلب المطمئن المراد بقوله تعالى ألا بذكر الله تطمئن القلوب وبقوله عز وجل يا أيتها النفس المطمئنة القلب الثاني القلب المخذول المشحون بالهوى المدنس بالأخلاق المذمومة والخبائث المفتوح فيه أبواب الشياطين المسدود عنه أبواب الملائكة ومبدأ الشر فيه أن ينقدح فيه خاطر من الهوى ويهجس فيه فينظر القلب إلى حاكم العقل ليستفتي منه ويستكشف وجه الصواب فيه فيكون العقل قد ألف خدمة الهوى وأنس به واستمر على استنباط الحيل له وعلى مساعدة الهوى فتستولي النفس وتساعد عليه فينشرح الصدر بالهوى وتنبسط فيه ظلماته لانحباس جند العقل عن مدافعته فيقوى سلطان الشيطان لاتساع مكانه بسبب انتشار الهوى فيقبل عليه بالتزيين والغرور والأماني ويوحي بذلك زخرفا من القول غرورا فيضعف سلطان الإيمان بالوعد والوعيد ويخبو نور اليقين لخوف الآخرة إذ يتصاعد عن الهوى دخان مظلم إلى القلب يملأ جوانبه حتى تنطفيء أنواره فيصير العقل كالعين التي ملأ الدخان أجفانها فلا يقدر على أن ينظر وهكذا تفعل غلبة الشهوة بالقلب حتى لا يبقى للقلب إمكان التوقف والاستبصار ولو بصره واعظ وأسمعه ما هو الحق فيه عمى عن الفهم وصم عن السمع وهاجت الشهوة فيه وسطا الشيطان وتحركت الجوارح على وفق الهوى فظهرت المعصية إلى عالم الشهادة من عالم الغيب بقضاء من الله تعالى وقدره وإلى مثل هذا القلب الإشارة بقوله تعالى أرأيت من اتخذ إلهه هواه أفأنت تكون عليه وكيلا أم تحسب أن أكثرهم يسمعون أو يعقلون إن هم إلا كالأنعام بل هم أضل سبيلا وبقوله عز وجل لقد حق القول على أكثرهم فهم لا يؤمنون وبقوله سواء عليهم أأنذرتهم أم لم تنذرهم لا يؤمنون</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.65","c":"إِنَّا","d":"innā","e":"āَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.87","c":"جَعَلْنَا","d":"jaʿalnā","e":"āَnْlَʿعَjg"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.18","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٓàِf"},{"b":"4.5","h":"4.74","c":"أَعْنَاقِهِمْ","d":"aʿnāqihim","e":"ْmِhِqَٰnْʿعَaʾ"},{"b":"5.9","h":"6.51","c":"أَغْلَالًا","d":"aghlālan","e":"āًlَٰlْغَaʾ"},{"b":"7.8","h":"8.43","c":"فَهِيَ","d":"fahiya","e":"َàِhَf"},{"b":"8.5","h":"9.24","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"9.72","c":"الْأَذْقَانِ","d":"l-adhqāni","e":"ِnāَqْhdَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"10.1","h":"11.29","c":"فَهُمْ","d":"fahum","e":"mُhَf"},{"b":"11.","h":"12.69","c":"مُقْمَحُونَ","d":"muq'maḥūna","e":"َnwُḥَmْqُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-7a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol3 book 7a</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, We have placed shackles [aghlāl] upon their necks.

Every single atom [dharrah] among the atoms, whether substance [jawhar] or accident ['arad], attribute [sifah] or thing described [mawsuf], contains wonders ['aja'ib] and marvels [ghara'ib] through which the wisdom [hikmah] of God, His power [qudrah], His majesty [jalal], and His greatness ['azamah] are made manifest. To enumerate that is not possible, for if the sea were ink for that, the sea would be exhausted before a tenth of its tenth was exhausted. Yet, we point to a summary of it so that it may serve as an example for what lies beyond it.\n\nWe say: The created existents [mawjudat al-makhluqah] are divided into that whose origin [asl] is not known, so we cannot contemplate [tafakkur] upon it. How many existents are there that we do not know, as God, the Most High, has said: **\"And He creates what you do not know.\"** Glory be to Him Who created all pairs, from what the earth grows and from themselves and from what they do not know. And He said: **\"And We will develop you into what you do not know.\"**\n\nAnd into that whose origin and totality [jumlatiha] are known, but whose details [tafsil] are not known, so we can contemplate upon its details. And it is divided into what we perceive [nadrikuhu] by the sense of sight [hass al-basar], and into what we do not perceive by sight. As for what we do not perceive by sight, such as the angels, the jinn, the devils, the Throne ['Arsh], the Footstool [Kursi], and other than that, the scope for thought [majal al-fikr] in these things is that which constricts and becomes obscure. So let us turn to what is closer to comprehension, which is that which is perceived by the sense of sight. And that is the seven heavens [al-samawat] and the earth [al-ard] and what is between them.\n\nThe heavens are witnessed [mushahadah] with their stars, their sun, their moon, their movement, and their rotation in their rising and setting. The earth is witnessed with what it contains of its mountains, its minerals, its rivers, its seas, its animals, and its plants. And what is between the heaven and the earth, which is the atmosphere [al-jaww], is perceived [mudrak] with its clouds, its rains, its snows, its thunder, its lightning, its thunderbolts, its shooting stars, and its stormy winds. These are the witnessed genera [al-ajnas al-mushahadah] of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them.\n\nEvery genus [jins] among them divides into species [anwa'], and every species divides into categories [aqsam], and every category branches out [yatasha'abb] into varieties [asnaf]. And there is no end to the branching and division of that in the difference of its attributes [sifat], its states [hay'at], and its apparent [zahirah] and hidden [batinah] meanings. And all of that is a scope for thought [majal al-fikr].\n\nNot a single atom [dharrah] moves in the heavens and the earth, whether inanimate [jamad], plant [nabat], animal [hayawan], celestial sphere [falak], or star [kawkab], except that God, the Most High, is its mover. And in its movement is a wisdom [hikmah], or two wisdoms, or ten, or a thousand wisdoms. All of that bears witness [shahid] for God, the Most High, to His Oneness [wahdaniyah] and points to His majesty [jalal] and His greatness [kibriya']. And these are the signs [ayat] pointing to Him.\n\nAnd the Qur'an has come urging contemplation [tafakkur] upon these signs, as God, the Most High, has said: **\"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.\"** And as He, the Most High, has said: **\"And among His signs...\"** from the beginning of the Qur'an to its end.\n\nSo let us mention the manner of contemplation [kayfiyat al-fikr] upon some of the signs. Among His signs is the human [al-insan], created from a sperm-drop [nutfah]. The closest thing to you is your own self [nafs]. And within you are wonders ['aja'ib] pointing to the greatness ['azamah] of God, the Most High, that lifetimes would end before standing upon a tenth of its tenth, while you are heedless [ghafil] of it. So O you who are heedless of your own self and ignorant [jahil] of it, how do you aspire to know other than yourself?\n\nAnd God, the Most High, has commanded you to reflect [tadabbur] upon your self in His Mighty Book, saying: **\"And in yourselves. Then will you not see?\"** And He reminded that you are created from a foul sperm-drop, saying: **\"Destroyed is man; how disbelieving he is. From what thing did He create him?\"**</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن كل ما في الوجود مما سوى الله تعالى فهو فعل الله وخلقه وكل ذرة من الذرات من جوهر وعرض وصفة وموصوف ففيها عجائب وغرائب تظهر بها حكمة الله وقدرته وجلاله وعظمته وإحصاء ذلك غير ممكن لأنه لو كان البحر مدادا لذلك لنفد البحر قبل أن ينفد عشر عشيره ولكنا نشير إلى جمل منه ليكون ذلك كالمثال لماعداه فنقول الموجودات المخلوقة منقسمة الى مالا يعرف أصلها فلا يمكننا التفكر فيها وكم من الموجودات التى لا نعلمها كما قال الله تعالى ويخلق ما لا تعلمون سبحان الذي خلق الأزواج كلها مما تنبت الأرض ومن أنفسهم ومما لا يعلمون وقال وننشئكم فيما لا تعلمون وإلى ما يعرف أصلها وجملتها ولا يعرف تفصيلها فيمكننا أن نتفكر في تفصيلها وهي منقسمة إلى ما أدركناه بحس البصر وإلى ما لا ندركه بالبصر أما الذي لا ندركه بالبصر فكالملائكة والجن والشياطين والعرش والكرسي وغير ذلك ومجال الفكر في هذه الأشياء مما يضيق ويغمض فلنعدل إلى الأقرب إلى الأفهام وهي المدركات بحس البصر وذلك هو السموات السبع والأرض وما بينهما فالسموات مشاهدة بكواكبها وشمسها وقمرها وحركتها ودورانها في طلوعها وغروبها والأرض مشاهدة بما فيها من جبالها ومعادنها وأنهارها وبحارها وحيوانها ونباتها وما بين السماء والأرض وهو الجو مدرك بغيومها وأمطارها وثلوجها ورعدها وبرقها وصواعقها وشهبها وعواصف رياحها فهذه هي الأجناس المشاهدة من السموات والأرض وما بينهما وكل جنس منها ينقسم إلى أنواع وكل نوع ينقسم إلى أقسام ويتشعب كل قسم إلى أصناف ولا نهاية لانشعاب ذلك وانقسامه في اختلاف صفاته وهيآته ومعانيه الظاهرة والباطنة وجميع ذلك مجال الفكر فلا تتحرك ذرة في السموات والأرض من جماد ولا نبات ولا حيوان ولا فلك ولا كوكب إلا والله تعالى هو محركها وفي حركتها حكمة أو حكمتان أو عشر أو ألف حكمة كل ذلك شاهد لله تعالى بالوحدانية ودال على جلاله وكبريائه وهي الآيات الدالة عليه وقد ورد القرآن بالحث على التفكر في هذه الايات كما قال الله تعالى إن في خلق السموات والأرض واختلاف الليل والنهار لآيات لأولي الألباب وكما قال تعالى ومن آياته من أول القرآن إلى آخره فلنذكر كيفية الفكر في بعض الآيات فمن آياته الانسان المخلوق من النطفة وأقرب شيء إليك نفسك وفيك من العجائب الدالة على عظمة الله تعالى ما تنقضي الأعمار في الوقوف على عشر عشيره وأنت غافل عنه فيامن هو غافل عن نفسه وجاهل بها كيف تطمع في معرفة غيرك وقد أمرك الله تعالى بالتدبر في نفسك في كتابه العزيز فقال وفي أنفسكم أفلا تبصرون وذكر أنك مخلوق من نطفة قذرة فقال قتل الإنسان ما أكفره من أي شئ خلقه</div></div></div>"}},"37":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.85","c":"وَءَايَةٌ","d":"waāyatun","e":"ٌẗَyāَءَw"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.22","c":"لَهُمُ","d":"lahumu","e":"ُmُhَّl"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.29","c":"اللَّيْلُ","d":"al-laylu","e":"ُlْyَّlٱ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.42","c":"نَسْلَخُ","d":"naslakhu","e":"ُhkَlْsَn"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.65","c":"مِنْهُ","d":"min'hu","e":"ُhْnِm"},{"b":"4.1","h":"6.54","c":"النَّهَارَ","d":"l-nahāra","e":"َrāَhَّnlٱ"},{"b":"5.8","h":"8.35","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"6.6","h":"9.65","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"mُh"},{"b":"7.7","h":"10.82","c":"مُظْلِمُونَ","d":"muẓ'limūna","e":"َnwُmِlْẓُّm"}],"a":{"g":"And a sign for them is the night.

The second [meaning] is the judgments [al-ahkam], and its essence refers to deducing events based on causes [al-asbab], and this resembles a doctor deducing what illness will occur from the pulse. It is a knowledge [ma'rifa] of the courses of the custom [sunnah] of Allah, the Exalted, and His habit in His creation. But the Law [al-shar'] has indeed censured it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"When predestination [al-qadar] is mentioned, refrain. And when the stars [al-nujum] are mentioned, refrain. And when my companions are mentioned, refrain.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"I fear for my nation after me three things: the injustice of rulers, belief in the stars [al-nujum], and denial of predestination [al-qadar].\" And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Learn from the stars what guides you on land and sea, then refrain.\"\n\nAnd it was prohibited for three reasons: The first of them: It is harmful to most of creation [al-khalq]. For if it is presented to them that these effects occur following the course of the planets, it settles in their souls [nufus] that the planets are the effectors and that they are the gods [alihah] managing affairs, because they are noble, celestial substances [jawhar], and their impact is great upon the hearts [qulub]. Thus, the heart [qalb] remains attentive to them, and it sees good and evil as something to be feared or hoped for from their direction, and the remembrance [dhikr] of Allah, glory be to Him, is erased from the heart [qalb]. For the weak one [al-da'if] restricts his gaze to the intermediaries [al-wasa'it], while the firmly-grounded knower [al-'alim al-rasikh] is the one who perceives that the sun, the moon, and the stars are subjugated by His command, glory be to Him, the Exalted. The example of the weak one's gaze upon the occurrence of sunlight following the sunrise is like an ant—if intellect were created for it and it were on the surface of a paper, looking at the blackness of a line being renewed—it would believe it is the action of the pen, and its gaze would not ascend to witnessing the fingers, then from them to the hand, then from it to the will [al-iradah] moving the hand, then from it to the writer who is capable and willing, then from him to the Creator of the hand, the capability, and the will. Thus, the gaze of most of creation [al-khalq] is restricted to the lowly, proximate causes [al-asbab], severed from ascending to the Causer of Causes [musabbib al-asbab].

The second [meaning] is the judgments [al-ahkam], and its essence refers to deducing events based on causes [al-asbab], and this resembles a doctor deducing what illness will occur from the pulse. It is a knowledge [ma'rifa] of the courses of the custom [sunnah] of Allah, the Exalted, and His habit in His creation. But the Law [al-shar'] has indeed censured it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"When predestination [al-qadar] is mentioned, refrain. And when the stars [al-nujum] are mentioned, refrain. And when my companions are mentioned, refrain.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"I fear for my nation after me three things: the injustice of rulers, belief in the stars [al-nujum], and denial of predestination [al-qadar].\" And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Learn from the stars what guides you on land and sea, then refrain.\"\n\nAnd it was prohibited for three reasons: The first of them: It is harmful to most of creation [al-khalq]. For if it is presented to them that these effects occur following the course of the planets, it settles in their souls [nufus] that the planets are the effectors and that they are the gods [alihah] managing affairs, because they are noble, celestial substances [jawhar], and their impact is great upon the hearts [qulub]. Thus, the heart [qalb] remains attentive to them, and it sees good and evil as something to be feared or hoped for from their direction, and the remembrance [dhikr] of Allah, glory be to Him, is erased from the heart [qalb]. For the weak one [al-da'if] restricts his gaze to the intermediaries [al-wasa'it], while the firmly-grounded knower [al-'alim al-rasikh] is the one who perceives that the sun, the moon, and the stars are subjugated by His command, glory be to Him, the Exalted. The example of the weak one's gaze upon the occurrence of sunlight following the sunrise is like an ant—if intellect were created for it and it were on the surface of a paper, looking at the blackness of a line being renewed—it would believe it is the action of the pen, and its gaze would not ascend to witnessing the fingers, then from them to the hand, then from it to the will [al-iradah] moving the hand, then from it to the writer who is capable and willing, then from him to the Creator of the hand, the capability, and the will.

And the heart, according to the effect of these actions, becomes prepared for the descent of guidance [hidaya] and the light [nur] of knowledge [ma'rifa]. This is the universal statement [al-qawl al-kulli] and the fundamental principle [al-qanun al-asli] to which one must return in knowing the virtues of actions, states [ahwal], and knowledges [ma'arif].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد انخدع بمثل هذا الخيال طائفة وسلكوا طريق الإباحة وقالوا إن الله تعالى غنى عن عبادتنا وعن أن يستقرض منا فأي معنى لقوله: ﴿ من ذا الذي يقرض الله قرضا حسنا ﴾ ولو شاء الله إطعام المساكين لأطعمهم فلا حاجة بنا إلى صرف أموالنا إليهم كما قال تعالى حكاية عن الكفار: ﴿ وإذا قيل لهم أنفقوا مما رزقكم الله قال الذين كفروا للذين آمنوا أنطعم من لو يشاء الله أطعمه ﴾ وقالوا أيضا ﴿ لو شاء الله ما أشركنا ولا آباؤنا ﴾ فانظر كيف كانوا صادقين في كلامهم وكيف هلكوا بصدقهم فسبحان من إذا شاء أهلك بالصدق وإذا شاء أسعد بالجهل يضل به كثيرا ويهدى به كثيرا فهؤلاء لما ظنوا أنهم استخدموا لأجل المساكين والفقراء أو جل الله تعالى ثم قالوا لا حظ لنا في المساكين ولا حظ لله فينا وفي أموالنا سواء أنفقنا أو أمسكنا هلكوا كما هلك الصبي لما ظن أن مقصود الوالد استخدامه لأجل العبيد ولم يشعر بأنه كان المقصود ثبات صفة العلم في نفسه وتأكده في قلبه حتى يكون ذلك سبب سعادته في الدنيا وإنما كان ذلك من الوالد تلطفا به في استجراره إلى ما فيه سعادته، فهذا المثال يبين لك ضلال من ضل من هذا الطريق فإذن هذا المسكين الآخذ لمالك يستوفى بواسطة المال خبث البخل وحب الدنيا من باطنك فإنه مهلك لك فهو كالحجام يستخرج الدم منك ليخرج بخروج الدم العلة المهلكة من باطنك فالحجام خادم لك لا أنت خادم للحجام ولا يخرج الحجام عن كونه خادما بأن يكون له غرض في أن يصنع شيئا بالدم ولما كانت الصدقات مطهرة للبواطن ومزكية لها عن خبائث الصفات امتنع رسول الله ﭬ من أخذها وانتهى عنها كما نهى عن كسب الحجام وسماها أوساخ أموال الناس وشرف أهل بيته بالصيانة عنها والمقصود أن الأعمال مؤثرات في القلب كما سبق في ربع المهلكات والقلب بحسب تأثيرها مستعد لقعود الهداية ونور المعرفة فهذا هو القول الكلى والقانون الأصلي الذي ينبغي أن يرجع إليه في معرفة فضائل الأعمال والأحوال والمعارف.</div></div></div>"}},"48":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.77","c":"وَيَقُولُونَ","d":"wayaqūlūna","e":"َnwُlwُqَyَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.79","c":"مَتَى","d":"matā","e":"ٰàَtَm"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.8","c":"هَذَا","d":"hādhā","e":"āَhdَٰh"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.79","c":"الْوَعْدُ","d":"l-waʿdu","e":"ُdْʿعَwْlٱ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.02","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"7.05","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"6.2","h":"8.77","c":"صَادِقِينَ","d":"ṣādiqīna","e":"َnyِqِdَٰṣ"}],"a":{"g":"And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol4 book10</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, if there were nothing before the dead except the terror of that Blast [nafkha], that alone would be worthy of being feared.
