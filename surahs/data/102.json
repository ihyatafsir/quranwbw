Their bellies are not satisfied with little, and their souls [anfus] are not content with much. They are devoted to the world [ad-dunya], going to it in the morning and returning to it in the evening. They have taken it as a god besides their God and a lord besides their Lord. They end at its command and follow its desires. So, a firm resolve from Muhammad, son of Abdullah, to those of your descendants and successors who reach that time: do not greet them with peace, do not visit their sick, do not follow their funeral processions, and do not honor their elders. For whoever does that has indeed aided in the destruction of Islam.\"\n\nAnd he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Leave the world [ad-dunya] for its people. Whoever takes from the world [ad-dunya] more than what suffices him takes his own destruction while he is unaware.\"\n\nAnd he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The son of Adam says, 'My wealth [mali], my wealth [mali]!' But do you have anything of your wealth [mal] except what you ate and thus consumed, or wore and thus wore out, or gave in charity and thus forwarded?\"\n\nAnd a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, why do I not love death?\" He said: \"Do you have wealth [mal]?\" The man said: \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said: \"Send your wealth [mal] forward, for the heart [qalb] of the believer is with his wealth [mal]. If he sends it forward, he loves to join it. If he leaves it behind, he loves to remain with it.\"\n\nAnd he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The companions of the son of Adam are three. One follows him until his soul [ruh] is taken, the second follows him to his grave, and the third follows him to the gathering place [al-mahshar]. The one who follows him until his soul [ruh] is taken is his wealth [maluhu]. The one who follows him to his grave is his family [ahluhu].
