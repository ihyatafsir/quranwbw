Among people, some are granted the vision of consideration, so they do not look at anything from the world of dominion except that they cross with it to the world of the kingdom, and their crossing is called a lesson. And the Truth has commanded this, saying: 'So take lesson, O possessors of insight' (Quran 59:2). And among them are those whose insight (Basarah) is blinded, so they do not take lesson, and they are confined in the world of dominion and witnessing, and the gates of Hell will open to their confinement. And this confinement is filled with a fire whose nature is to rise upon the hearts (al-Af'idah), except that between it and the perception of its pain is a veil. So when that veil is lifted by death, they perceive. And from this, Allah the Exalted manifested the truth upon the tongue of a people whom He made speak with the truth, and they said: 'Paradise and Hell are created, but Hell is perceived once with a perception called the knowledge of certainty (Ilm al-Yaqin), and once with another perception called the eye of certainty (Ayn al-Yaqin). And the eye of certainty (Ayn al-Yaqin) does not occur except in the Hereafter, and the knowledge of certainty (Ilm al-Yaqin) can occur in this world, but only for those who have fulfilled their share of the light of certainty (Nur al-Yaqin). Therefore, Allah the Exalted said: 'No! If you knew with the knowledge of certainty (Ilm al-Yaqin), you would surely see Hell' (Quran 102:5), meaning in this world, 'Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty (Ayn al-Yaqin)' (Quran 102:7), meaning in the Hereafter. So then it has become clear that the sound heart (al-Qalb al-Salih) for the kingdom of the Hereafter cannot be except noble, like the sound person for the kingdom of this world.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ولكن الانعكاس والانتكاس ضرورة هذا العالم فكذلك عالم الملك والشهادة محاك لعالم الغيب والملكوت فمن الناس من يسر له نظر الاعتبار فلا ينظر في شىء من عالم الملك إلا ويعبر به إلى عالم الملكوت فيسمى عبوره عبرة وقد أمر الحق به فقال: ﴿ فاعتبروا يا أولى الأبصار ﴾ {} ومنهم من عميت بصيرته فلم يعتبر فاحتبس في عالم الملك والشهادة وستنفتح إلى حبسه أبواب جهنم وهذا الحبس مملوء نارا من شأنها أن تطلع على الأفئدة إلا أن بينه وبين إدراك ألمها حجابا فإذا رفع ذلك الحجاب بالموت أدرك وعن هذا أظهر الله تعالى الحق على لسان قوم استنطقهم بالحق فقالوا الجنة والنار مخلوقتان ولكن الجحيم تدرك مرة بإدراك يسمى علم اليقين ومرة بإدراك آخر يسمى عين اليقين وعين اليقين لا يكون إلا في الآخرة وعلم اليقين قد يكون في الدنيا ولكن للذين قد وفوا حظهم من نور اليقين فلذلك قال الله تعالى: ﴿ كلا لو تعلمون علم اليقين لترون الجحيم ﴾ {} أى في الدنيا ﴿ ثم لترونها عين اليقين ﴾ {} أى في الآخرة فإذن قد ظهر أنّ القلب الصالح لملك الآخرة لا يكون إلا عزيزا كالشخص الصالح لملك الدنيا.</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.15","h":"0.3","c":"لَتَرَوُنَّ","d":"latarawunna","e":"َّnُwَrَtَl"},{"b":"2.2","h":"2.77","c":"الْجَحِيمَ","d":"l-jaḥīma","e":"َmyِḥَjgْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"You will surely see the Hellfire."}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.25","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.49","c":"لَتَرَوُنَّهَا","d":"latarawunnahā","e":"āَhَّnُwَrَtَl"},{"b":"3.8","h":"4.62","c":"عَيْنَ","d":"ʿayna","e":"َnْyَʿع"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.83","c":"الْيَقِينِ","d":"l-yaqīni","e":"ِnyِqَyْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty."}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.83","c":"لَتُسْءَلُنَّ","d":"latus'alunna","e":"َّnُlَٔـْsُtَl"},{"b":"3.8","h":"4.66","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"5.1","h":"6.66","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.58","c":"النَّعِيمِ","d":"l-naʿīmi","e":"ِmyِʿعَّnlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Then you will surely be asked that Day about pleasure."}}}
