And how did He lead them by the chain of love [mahabbah] and desire [shahwah] to union? And how did He extract the sperm-drop [nutfah] from the man by the movement of intercourse? And how did He draw the blood of menstruation from the depths of the veins and gather it in the womb? Then how did He create the newborn from the sperm-drop [nutfah] and nourish it with the water of menstruation and feed it until it grew, increased, and became large? And how did He make the sperm-drop [nutfah], which is white and shining, into a red clinging clot ['alaqah]? Then how did He make it a chewed lump [mudghah]? Then how did He divide the parts of the sperm-drop [nutfah], which are equal and similar, into bones, nerves, veins, tendons, and flesh? Then how did He compose from the flesh, nerves, and veins the apparent limbs: the roundness of the head, the aperture of hearing, sight, the nose, the mouth, and all the openings? Then He extended the hand and the leg and divided their ends into fingers, and divided the fingers into fingertips? Then how did He compose the internal organs: the heart [qalb], the stomach, the liver, the spleen, the lung, the womb, the bladder, and the intestines—each one with a specific form, a specific measure, for a specific function? Then how did He divide each of these organs into other divisions, composing the eye from seven layers, each layer with a specific attribute and a specific constitution?</div></div></div>"}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"وَفِي","d":"wafī","e":"àِfَw"},{"b":"0.44","h":"0.8","c":"السَّمَاءِ","d":"l-samāi","e":"ِءٓāَmَّslٱ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"3.48","c":"رِزْقُكُمْ","d":"riz'qukum","e":"ْmُkُqْzِr"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.18","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.43","c":"تُوعَدُونَ","d":"tūʿadūna","e":"َnwُdَʿعwُt"}],"a":{"g":"And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, and what Allah has sworn by—so what is your estimation of that by which Allah, the Exalted, has sworn, and upon which He has made the provision [arzaq] dependent and attributed it to Himself?

And self-reckoning [muhasabah] is sometimes after the action and sometimes before it, as a warning. Allah, the Exalted, said: \"And know that Allah knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him.\" And this is for the future. And every consideration of the quantity and measure to know increase and decrease, then it is called self-reckoning [muhasabah]. So the consideration of what lies before the servant during his day to know his increase from his decrease is from self-reckoning [muhasabah]. And Allah, the Exalted, has said: \"O you who have believed, when you go forth in the cause of Allah, investigate.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"And We have certainly created man and We know what his soul [nafs] whispers to him.\" He mentioned that as a warning and an alert to guard against it in the future.\n\nAnd 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man who asked him to advise and exhort him: \"If you intend a matter, then consider its consequence [‘aqibah]. If it is right guidance [rushd], then proceed with it, and if it is misguidance [ghayy], then desist from it.\" (The hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: \"If you intend a matter, then consider its consequence [‘aqibah]\" has preceded.)\n\nAnd some of the wise said: \"If you want the intellect [‘aql] to prevail over the desire [hawa], then do not act upon the decree of the appetite [shahwah] until you look at the consequence [‘aqibah], for the abiding of regret [nadamah] in the heart [qalb] is longer than the abiding of the lightness of appetite [shahwah].\" And Luqman said: \"Indeed, the believer, when he perceives the consequence [‘aqibah], is safe from regret [nadamah].\"\n\nAnd Shaddad ibn Aws reported from him, peace be upon him, that he said: \"The intelligent one [kayyis] is he who holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana] and works for what is after death [mawt]. And the fool [ahmaq] is he who follows his soul [nafs] its desire [hawa] and makes wishes upon Allah.\" (The hadith \"The intelligent one [kayyis] is he who holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana] and works for what is after death [mawt]\" has preceded.) \"Holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana]\" means he reckons it. And the Day of Recompense [yawm al-din] is the Day of Account [hisab]. And His saying, \"Are we indeed to be judged [madinun]?\" means \"Are we indeed to be brought to account [muhasabun]?\"\n\nAnd 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Reckon with yourselves [hasibu anfusakum] before you are reckoned with, and weigh them before they are weighed, and prepare for the greatest presentation.\" And he wrote to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: \"Reckon your soul [nafs] in times of ease before the reckoning of hardship.\" And he said to Ka'b: \"How do you find it in the Book of Allah?\" He said: \"Woe to the judges [dayyan] of the earth from the Judge [dayyan] of the heavens,\" so he struck him with the whip. And he said: \"Except for he who reckons his soul [nafs].\" So Ka'b said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, it is next to it in the Torah; there is not a letter between them: 'Except for he who reckons his soul [nafs].'\" And all of this is an indication to self-reckoning [muhasabah] for the future, when He said: \"Except for he who reckons his soul [nafs].\"</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j4 k08</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>And He, the Exalted, said: \"And remind, for indeed the reminder benefits the believers.\" [51:55] This, and what follows its course, is the first station of vigilance [murabatah] with the self [nafs], and it is self-reckoning [muhasabah] before the action. And self-reckoning [muhasabah] is sometimes after the action and sometimes before it, as a warning. Allah, the Exalted, said: \"And know that Allah knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him.\" And this is for the future. And every consideration of the quantity and measure to know increase and decrease, then it is called self-reckoning [muhasabah]. So the consideration of what lies before the servant during his day to know his increase from his decrease is from self-reckoning [muhasabah]. And Allah, the Exalted, has said: \"O you who have believed, when you go forth in the cause of Allah, investigate.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"And We have certainly created man and We know what his soul [nafs] whispers to him.\" He mentioned that as a warning and an alert to guard against it in the future.\n\nAnd 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man who asked him to advise and exhort him: \"If you intend a matter, then consider its consequence [‘aqibah]. If it is right guidance [rushd], then proceed with it, and if it is misguidance [ghayy], then desist from it.\" (The hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: \"If you intend a matter, then consider its consequence [‘aqibah]\" has preceded.)\n\nAnd some of the wise said: \"If you want the intellect [‘aql] to prevail over the desire [hawa], then do not act upon the decree of the appetite [shahwah] until you look at the consequence [‘aqibah], for the abiding of regret [nadamah] in the heart [qalb] is longer than the abiding of the lightness of appetite [shahwah].\" And Luqman said: \"Indeed, the believer, when he perceives the consequence [‘aqibah], is safe from regret [nadamah].\"\n\nAnd Shaddad ibn Aws reported from him, peace be upon him, that he said: \"The intelligent one [kayyis] is he who holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana] and works for what is after death [mawt]. And the fool [ahmaq] is he who follows his soul [nafs] its desire [hawa] and makes wishes upon Allah.\" (The hadith \"The intelligent one [kayyis] is he who holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana] and works for what is after death [mawt]\" has preceded.) \"Holds his soul [nafs] to account [dana]\" means he reckons it. And the Day of Recompense [yawm al-din] is the Day of Account [hisab]. And His saying, \"Are we indeed to be judged [madinun]?\" means \"Are we indeed to be brought to account [muhasabun]?\"\n\nAnd 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Reckon with yourselves [hasibu anfusakum] before you are reckoned with, and weigh them before they are weighed, and prepare for the greatest presentation.\" And he wrote to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: \"Reckon your soul [nafs] in times of ease before the reckoning of hardship.\" And he said to Ka'b: \"How do you find it in the Book of Allah?\" He said: \"Woe to the judges [dayyan] of the earth from the Judge [dayyan] of the heavens,\" so he struck him with the whip.

So, whoever strikes another with his hand has disbelieved in the blessing of the hand, for the hand was created for him to repel with it from himself what would destroy him and to take what benefits him, not to destroy another with it. And whoever looks at the face of one who is not forbidden has disbelieved in the blessing of the eye and the blessing of the sun, for sight is perfected by them, and they were only created so that one may see with them what benefits him in his religion [din] and his worldly life [dunya], and to guard with them against what harms him in both. Thus, he has employed them in other than what was intended for them.\n\nAnd this is because the intended purpose from the creation of creation and the creation of the world [dunya] and its means is that creation may be aided by them to reach Allah, the Most High. And there is no reaching Him except through love [mahabbah] for Him and intimacy [uns] with Him in the world [dunya], and turning away from the deception of the world [dunya]. And there is no intimacy [uns] except through perpetual remembrance [dhikr], and no love [mahabbah] except through the knowledge [ma'rifah] attained through perpetual reflection [fikr]. And one cannot persist in remembrance [dhikr] and reflection [fikr] except through the persistence of the body [badan]. And the body [badan] does not remain except through nourishment [ghidha'], and nourishment [ghidha'] is not perfected except through the earth, water, and air. And that is not perfected except through the creation of the heaven and the earth, and the creation of all the limbs, outwardly and inwardly. So all of that is for the sake of the body [badan], and the body [badan] is the mount of the soul [nafs]. And what returns to Allah, the Most High, is the soul at peace [al-nafs al-mutma'innah] through prolonged worship ['ibadah] and knowledge [ma'rifah].\n\nTherefore, He, the Most High, said: **\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision...\"** (51:56-57). So, whoever employs a thing in other than obedience to Allah has disbelieved in the blessing [ni'mah] of Allah in all the means [asbab] which are necessary for his embarking upon that disobedience [ma'siyah].</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book5</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, to this He alluded, may He be exalted, in His saying: \"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me [li-ya'budun].\" Thus, everything between the heaven and the earth is a created thing [hadith] occurring according to a necessary order [tartib wajib] and a binding truth [haqq lazim]; it is inconceivable for it to be other than as it has occurred, and according to this order [tartib] in which it is found.
