Have you not heard the saying of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, concerning Jesus, upon him be peace: \"Had his certainty increased, he would have walked upon air,\" when it was said to him that he walked upon water?\n\nThen the traveling seeker said: I have become perplexed in my affair, and my heart [qalb] has felt fear from what you have described of the peril of the path. I do not know if I am capable of traversing these vast deserts you have described or not. Is there, for that, any sign?\nHe said: Yes. Open your sight, gather the light of your eyes, and fix your gaze upon me. For if the Pen [al-qalam] with which I write upon the Tablet of the Heart [lawh al-qalb] appears to you, then it is likely you are worthy of this path. Indeed, whoever passes beyond the world of Omnipotence [al-jabarut] and knocks upon a door from the doors of the Dominion [al-malakut] is unveiled to the Pen [al-qalam]. Do you not see that the Prophet, peace be upon him, at the beginning of his affair, was unveiled to the Pen [al-qalam] when was revealed to him: \"Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous, Who taught by the Pen [al-qalam], taught man that which he knew not.\"\n\nThen the traveler said: I have opened my sight and fixed my gaze, and by God, I see neither reed nor wood, and I know of no pen [qalam] except of that kind.\nThen the Knowledge [al-'ilm] said: You have strayed far indeed. Have you not heard that the furnishings of a house resemble the master of the house? Do you not know that God, exalted is He, His Essence is not resembled by other essences? Likewise, His Hand is not resembled by hands, nor His Pen [qalam] by pens, nor His Speech by other speech, nor His Script by other scripts. These are divine matters from the world of the Dominion [al-malakut]. God, exalted is He, is not in His Essence a body, nor is He in a place, unlike others. Nor is His Hand flesh, bone, and blood, unlike hands. Nor is His Pen [qalam] from reed, nor His Tablet from wood, nor His Speech by voice and letter, nor His Script by inscription and form, nor His Ink by vitriol and gallnut. If you do not witness this as such, then I see you only as effeminate between the manliness of Transcendence [al-tanzih] and the femininity of Resemblance [al-tashbih], vacillating between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those. How have you declared His Essence and His Attributes, exalted is He, transcendent above bodies and their attributes, and declared His Speech transcendent above the meanings of letters and sounds, yet you hesitate concerning His Hand, His Pen [qalam], His Tablet, and His Script?</div></div></div>"}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.1","c":"الَّذِي","d":"alladhī","e":"àِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"0.97","h":"1.65","c":"عَلَّمَ","d":"ʿallama","e":"َmَّlَʿع"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.09","c":"بِالْقَلَمِ","d":"bil-qalami","e":"ِmَlَqْlٱِb"}],"a":{"g":"Who taught by the pen -","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j3 k01</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, God the Exalted has said: \"Who taught by the pen [al-qalam], taught man that which he knew not.\" Then He said: \"The Most Merciful taught the Qur'an.\" And He said: \"He taught him clear expression.\" And He said: \"Then indeed, upon Us is its explanation.\"\n\nAnd the first world [ʿālam] of the Dominion [al-malakūt] is witnessing the pen [al-qalam] with which knowledge [ʿilm] is written upon the tablet [lawḥ] of the heart [qalb], and the attainment of certainty [yaqīn] by which one walks upon water.

And it is said: it is the light [nur] of humility [khushu'], for it shines from the inner [batin] upon the outer [zahir], and this is the most sound. And it is said: it is the bright marks [al-ghurar] that will be upon their faces on the Day of Resurrection from the trace of ablution [athar al-wudu'].</div></div></div>"}}}
