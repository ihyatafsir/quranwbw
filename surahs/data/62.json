Allah, the Exalted, says: \"When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on the day of Friday [al-Jumu'ah], hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business.\" Thus, He prohibited preoccupation with the affairs of the world [al-dunya] and with everything that diverts from hastening to the Friday prayer. And He, peace be upon him, said: \"Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made the Friday prayer obligatory upon you on this day of mine, in this place of mine.\" And He, peace be upon him, said: \"Whoever abandons the Friday prayer three times without an excuse, Allah will seal his heart [qalb].\" In another wording: \"He has indeed cast Islam behind his back.\" And in the report: \"The people of the two scriptures were given Friday, but they differed concerning it, so they were turned away from it, and Allah, the Exalted, guided us to it and postponed it for this nation, and made it a festival for them. Thus, they are the foremost people to it, and the people of the two scriptures follow them.\" And in the hadith of Anas from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: \"Jibril, upon him be peace, came to me with a white mirror in his hand and said: 'This is Friday. Your Lord has made it obligatory upon you so that it may be a festival for you and for your nation after you.' I said: 'What is for us in it?' He said: 'For you in it is a good hour. Whoever supplicates in it for a good thing, it is apportioned for him; Allah, the Glorified, grants it to him. Or if it is not apportioned for him, it is stored for him what is greater than it. Or whoever seeks refuge from an evil decreed for him, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, grants him refuge from what is greater than it. And it is the master of days for us, and we call it in the Hereafter [al-akhirah] the Day of Increase.' I said: 'Why?' He said: 'Indeed, your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has taken in Paradise a spacious valley of white musk. When Friday comes, He, the Exalted, descends from the Highest Place to His Throne, and He manifests Himself to them until they look upon His Noble Face.'\" And He, peace be upon him, said: \"The best day upon which the sun has risen is Friday. On it, Adam, upon him be peace, was created; on it, he was admitted to Paradise; on it, he was sent down to the earth; on it, his repentance was accepted; on it, he died; and on it, the Hour will be established. And it is, with Allah, the Day of Increase. Likewise, the angels in the heaven name it, and it is the day of looking upon Allah, the Exalted, in Paradise.\" And in the report: \"Indeed, for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in every Friday are six hundred thousand freed from the Fire.\" And in the hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that He, peace be upon him, said: \"If Friday is safe, the days are safe.\" And He, peace be upon him, said: \"Indeed...\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن هذا يوم عظيم عظم الله به الإسلام وخصص به المسلمين قال الله تعالى ﴿ إذا نودي للصلاة من يوم الجمعة فاسعوا إلى ذكر الله وذروا البيع ﴾ فحرم الاشتغال بأمور الدنيا وبكل صارف عن السعي إلى الجمعة، وقال ﭬ: (إن الله عز وجل فرض عليكم الجمعة في يومي هذا في مقامي هذا) وقال ﭬ: (من ترك الجمعة ثلاثا من غير عذر طبع الله على قلبه) وفي لفظ آخر: (فقد نبذ الإسلام وراء ظهره) وفي الخبر: إن أهل الكتابين أعطوا يوم الجمعة فاختلفوا فيه فصرفوا عنه وهدانا الله تعالى له وأخره لهذه الأمة وجعله عيدا لهم فهم أولى الناس به سبقا وأهل الكتابين لهم تبع وفي حديث أنس عن النبي ﭬ أنه قال: (أتاني جبريل عليه السلام في كفة مرآة بيضاء وقال: هذه الجمعة يفرضها عليك ربك لتكون لك عيدا ولأمتك من بعدك قلت: فما لنا فيها؟ قال: لكم فيها خير ساعة من دعا فيها بخير قسم له أعطاه الله سبحانه إياه أو ليس له قسم ذخر له ما هو أعظم منه أو تعوذ من شر مكتوب عليه إلا أعاذه الله عز وجل من أعظم منه وهو سيد الأيام عندنا ونحن ندعوه في الآخرة يوم المزيد قلت: ولم؟ قال: إن ربك عز وجل اتخذ في الجنة واديا أفيح من المسك أبيض فإذا كان يوم الجمعة نزل تعالى من عليين على كرسيه فيتجلى لهم حتى ينظروا إلى وجهه الكريم) وقال ﭬ: (خير يوم طلعت عليه الشمس يوم الجمعة فيه خلق آدم عليه السلام وفيه أدخل الجنة وفيه أهبط إلى الأرض وفيه تيب عليه وفيه مات وفيه تقوم الساعة وهو عند الله يوم المزيد كذلك تسميه الملائكة في السماء وهو يوم النظر إلى الله تعالى في الجنة) وفي الخبر: (إن لله عز وجل في كل جمعة ستمائة ألف عتيق من النار) وفي حديث أنس رضي الله عنه أنه ﭬ قال: (إذا سلمت الجمعة سلمت الأيام) وقال ﭬ: (إن</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.25","c":"هُوَ","d":"huwa","e":"َwُh"},{"b":"0.34","h":"0.64","c":"الَّذِي","d":"alladhī","e":"àِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.84","c":"بَعَثَ","d":"baʿatha","e":"َhtَʿعَb"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.79","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.14","c":"الْأُمِّيِّينَ","d":"l-umiyīna","e":"َnۦِّyِّmُaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.89","c":"رَسُولًا","d":"rasūlan","e":"āًlwُsَr"},{"b":"5.2","h":"7.49","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"5.8","h":"9.11","c":"يَتْلُوا","d":"yatlū","e":"۟āwُlْtَy"},{"b":"6.4","h":"10.38","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"7.4","h":"11.88","c":"ءَايَاتِهِ","d":"āyātihi","e":"ۦِhِtَٰyāَء"},{"b":"8.7","h":"14.22","c":"وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ","d":"wayuzakkīhim","e":"ْmِhyِّkَzُyَw"},{"b":"12.1","h":"16.8","c":"وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ","d":"wayuʿallimuhumu","e":"ُmُhُmِّlَʿعُyَw"},{"b":"13.6","h":"19.26","c":"الْكِتَابَ","d":"l-kitāba","e":"َbَٰtِkْlٱ"},{"b":"14.5","h":"20.86","c":"وَالْحِكْمَةَ","d":"wal-ḥik'mata","e":"َẗَmْkِḥْlٱَw"},{"b":"15.6","h":"32.13","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"16.6","h":"33.39","c":"كَانُوا","d":"kānū","e":"۟āwُnāَk"},{"b":"17.4","h":"34.93","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"18.4","h":"35.86","c":"قَبْلُ","d":"qablu","e":"ُlْbَq"},{"b":"19.0","h":"36.84","c":"لَفِي","d":"lafī","e":"àِfَl"},{"b":"19.5","h":"37.67","c":"ضَلَالٍ","d":"ḍalālin","e":"ٍlَٰlَḍ"},{"b":"20.3","h":"39.81","c":"مُبِينٍ","d":"mubīnin","e":"ٍnyِbُّm"}],"a":{"g":"It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error -"}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.15","c":"وَءَاخَرِينَ","d":"waākharīna","e":"َnyِrَhkāَءَw"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.02","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِm"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.4","c":"لَمَّا","d":"lammā","e":"āَّmَl"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.03","c":"يَلْحَقُوا","d":"yalḥaqū","e":"۟āwُqَḥْlَy"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.63","c":"بِهِمْ","d":"bihim","e":"ْmِhِb"},{"b":"5.3","h":"8.65","c":"وَهُوَ","d":"wahuwa","e":"َwُhَw"},{"b":"5.8","h":"9.38","c":"الْعَزِيزُ","d":"l-ʿazīzu","e":"ُzyِzَʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"6.8","h":"11.03","c":"الْحَكِيمُ","d":"l-ḥakīmu","e":"ُmyِkَḥْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And [to] others of them who have not yet joined them.

This is because the status of knowledge is immense with Allah and with people, and it is greater than the status of wealth and beauty and other things. Rather, they have no status at all unless accompanied by knowledge and action. And the scholar [‘ālim] will only be able to repel arrogance by knowing two matters: The first is that he knows the proof [ḥujjah] of Allah upon the people of knowledge is more binding, and that He bears from the ignorant [jāhil] what He would not bear a tenth of from the scholar. For whoever disobeys Allah the Exalted with knowledge and awareness, his transgression is more heinous, as he has not fulfilled the right of Allah's favor upon him in knowledge. Therefore, He said, \"The scholar will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown into the Fire, and his intestines will spill out, and he will circle with them as a donkey circles a millstone. The people of the Fire will gather around him and say, 'What is wrong with you?' He will say, 'I used to command good and not do it, and I used to forbid evil and do it.'\" And Allah, glory be to Him and exalted is He, has likened the one who knows but does not act to the donkey and the dog, for He, mighty and majestic, said, \"The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Torah but then did not uphold it is like that of a donkey carrying volumes [of books].\" He intended by this the scholars of the Jews.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وكقوله تعالى \"مثل الذين حملوا التوراة ثم لم يحملوها كمثل الحمار يحمل أسفاراً\" فأي خزي أعظم من التمثيل بالكلب والحمار؟</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.36","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"0.22","h":"0.82","c":"يَاأَيُّهَا","d":"yāayyuhā","e":"āَhُّyَaʾَٰٓy"},{"b":"2.8","h":"3.59","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.19","c":"هَادُوا","d":"hādū","e":"۟āٓwُdāَh"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.49","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"6.5","h":"8.4","c":"زَعَمْتُمْ","d":"zaʿamtum","e":"ْmُtْmَʿعَz"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.08","c":"أَنَّكُمْ","d":"annakum","e":"ْmُkَّnَaʾ"},{"b":"9.0","h":"12.02","c":"أَوْلِيَاءُ","d":"awliyāu","e":"ُءٓāَyِlْwَaʾ"},{"b":"11.5","h":"14.71","c":"لِلَّهِ","d":"lillahi","e":"ِhَّlِl"},{"b":"12.4","h":"16.28","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"13.3","h":"17.22","c":"دُونِ","d":"dūni","e":"ِnwُd"},{"b":"13.9","h":"18.18","c":"النَّاسِ","d":"l-nāsi","e":"ِsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"15.","h":"19.73","c":"فَتَمَنَّوُا","d":"fatamannawū","e":"۟āُwَّnَmَtَf"},{"b":"19.3","h":"21.91","c":"الْمَوْتَ","d":"l-mawta","e":"َtْwَmْlٱ"},{"b":"20.","h":"23.15","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"20.9","h":"24.15","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"22.4","h":"26.05","c":"صَادِقِينَ","d":"ṣādiqīna","e":"َnyِqِdَٰṣ"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\""}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.56","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"0.54","h":"1.34","c":"يَتَمَنَّوْنَهُ","d":"yatamannawnahu","e":"ٓۥُhَnْwَّnَmَtَy"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.58","c":"أَبَدًا","d":"abadan","e":"āًۢdَbَaʾ"},{"b":"5.7","h":"7.3","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.28","c":"قَدَّمَتْ","d":"qaddamat","e":"ْtَmَّdَq"},{"b":"7.3","h":"9.99","c":"أَيْدِيهِمْ","d":"aydīhim","e":"ْmِhyِdْyَaʾ"},{"b":"8.8","h":"13.45","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"},{"b":"9.7","h":"14.81","c":"عَلِيمٌ","d":"ʿalīmun","e":"ٌۢmyِlَʿع"},{"b":"11.5","h":"17.03","c":"بِالظَّالِمِينَ","d":"bil-ẓālimīna","e":"َnyِmِlَّٰẓlٱِb"}],"a":{"g":"But they will not wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth.
