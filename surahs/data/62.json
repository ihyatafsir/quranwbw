Rather, they have no status at all unless accompanied by knowledge and action. And the scholar [‘ālim] will only be able to repel arrogance by knowing two matters: The first is that he knows the proof [ḥujjah] of Allah upon the people of knowledge is more binding, and that He bears from the ignorant [jāhil] what He would not bear a tenth of from the scholar. For whoever disobeys Allah the Exalted with knowledge and awareness, his transgression is more heinous, as he has not fulfilled the right of Allah's favor upon him in knowledge.

He will say, 'I used to command good and not do it, and I used to forbid evil and do it.'\" And Allah, glory be to Him and exalted is He, has likened the one who knows but does not act to the donkey and the dog, for He, mighty and majestic, said, \"The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Torah but then did not uphold it is like that of a donkey carrying volumes [of books].\" He intended by this the scholars of the Jews.\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.36","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"Say"},{"b":"0.22","h":"0.82","c":"يَاأَيُّهَا","d":"yāayyuhā","e":"O"},{"b":"2.8","h":"3.59","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"you (who)"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.19","c":"هَادُوا","d":"hādū","e":"(are) Jews"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.49","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"If"},{"b":"6.5","h":"8.4","c":"زَعَمْتُمْ","d":"zaʿamtum","e":"you claim"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.08","c":"أَنَّكُمْ","d":"annakum","e":"that you"},{"b":"9.0","h":"12.02","c":"أَوْلِيَاءُ","d":"awliyāu","e":"(are) allies"},{"b":"11.5","h":"14.71","c":"لِلَّهِ","d":"lillahi","e":"of Allah"},{"b":"12.4","h":"16.28","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"from"},{"b":"13.3","h":"17.22","c":"دُونِ","d":"dūni","e":"excluding"},{"b":"13.9","h":"18.18","c":"النَّاسِ","d":"l-nāsi","e":"the people"},{"b":"15.","h":"19.73","c":"فَتَمَنَّوُا","d":"fatamannawū","e":"then wish"},{"b":"19.3","h":"21.91","c":"الْمَوْتَ","d":"l-mawta","e":"(for) the death"},{"b":"20.","h":"23.15","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"if"},{"b":"20.9","h":"24.15","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"you are"},{"b":"22.4","h":"26.05","c":"صَادِقِينَ","d":"ṣādiqīna","e":"truthful"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\""}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.56","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"But not"},{"b":"0.54","h":"1.34","c":"يَتَمَنَّوْنَهُ","d":"yatamannawnahu","e":"they will wish for it"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.58","c":"أَبَدًا","d":"abadan","e":"ever"},{"b":"5.7","h":"7.3","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"for what"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.28","c":"قَدَّمَتْ","d":"qaddamat","e":"have sent forth"},{"b":"7.3","h":"9.99","c":"أَيْدِيهِمْ","d":"aydīhim","e":"their hands"},{"b":"8.8","h":"13.45","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"And Allah"},{"b":"9.7","h":"14.81","c":"عَلِيمٌ","d":"ʿalīmun","e":"(is) All-Knowing"},{"b":"11.5","h":"17.03","c":"بِالظَّالِمِينَ","d":"bil-ẓālimīna","e":"of the wrongdoers"}],"a":{"g":"But they will not wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth.
