So they devised stratagems [hila] to repel rightful claims, and they misinterpreted weighty expressions, and were deluded by outward appearances [zawahir] and erred in them. This is from the category of error in legal verdicts [fatwa] and delusion therein, and error in verdicts is something that is frequent. But this type has become widespread among the masses except the discerning [akyaas] among them, so we point to examples: From that is their verdict that whenever a woman absolves [abara'at] from the dowry [sadaq], the husband is absolved between him and God, the Exalted. And that is an error. Rather, the husband may mistreat the wife such that he constricts her affairs with bad character, so she is compelled to seek deliverance, so she absolves the husband to be free of him. So it is an absolution [ibra'] not from a contented self [nafs]. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"But if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.\" And contentment of the self [tayyibat al-nafs] is other than contentment of the heart [qalb]. For a person may will with his heart what his self is not content with, for he wills cupping with his heart but his self dislikes it. And contentment of the self is only that her self permits the absolution, not from a necessity that confronts her, such that when she is placed between two harms, she chooses the lesser of them. This is, in truth, seizure [musadara] with inner compulsion [ikrah al-batin]. Yes, the judge [qadi] in this world [dunya] does not perceive the hearts and the intentions, so he looks to the outward absolution and that she was not coeraked by an outward cause, and inner compulsion is not something creation perceives. But whenever the Greatest Judge [al-Qadi al-Akbar] undertakes judgment on the plain of resurrection [qiyama], this will not be counted nor considered in establishing the absolution. And for that reason, it is not permissible to take a person's wealth except from a contented self of his. So if wealth were demanded from a person in front of people, and he felt ashamed before the people not to give it, and he wished the request had been in private so he would not give it, but he feared the pain of people's blame and he feared the pain of surrendering the wealth, and he weighed his soul [nafs] between them and chose the lesser of the two pains, which is the pain of surrender, and so he surrendered it—there is no difference between this and seizure. For the meaning of seizure is inflicting pain on the body with the whip until that becomes stronger than the pain of the heart in parting with wealth, so he chooses the lesser of the two pains. And the request in a situation of shame and ostentation is a strike upon the heart with a whip. And there is no difference between striking the inner [batin] and striking the outer [zahir] before God, the Exalted, for the inner before God, the Exalted, is outer. It is only the judge of this world who rules by the apparent [zahir] of his statement \"I have given it,\" because he cannot ascertain what is in the heart. Likewise, whoever gives for fear of the evil of his tongue or the evil of his slander, it is forbidden [haram] for him. And likewise, every wealth taken in this manner is forbidden. Do you not see what came in the story of David, peace be upon him, when he said—after he was forgiven—\"O Lord, how shall I deal with my adversary?\" So he was commanded to seek lawful release [istihlal] from him, and he was dead, so he was commanded to call him in the rock of the Sacred House. So he called: \"O Uriah!\" He answered him: \"At your service, O Prophet of God. You brought me out from Paradise, what do you want?\" He said: \"I wronged you in a matter, so forgive it for me.\" He said: \"I have done that, O Prophet of God.\" So he departed, having relied upon that. Then Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to him: \"Did you mention to him what you did?\" He said: \"Did I not forgive it for you?\" He said: \"Will you not ask me what that sin was?\" He said: \"What is it, O Prophet of God?\" He said: \"Such and such,\" and he mentioned the affair of the woman, and the answer was cut off. So he said, \"O Uriah, will you not answer me?\" He said: \"O Prophet of God, this is not how the Prophets act, until I stand with you before God.\" So David turned to weeping and wailing from the head until God promised him that He would ask it from him for him in the Hereafter [Akhira]. Thus, this alerts you that a gift [hiba] not from a contented heart [qalb] is of no benefit, and that contentment of the heart is not attained except through knowledge [ma'rifa]. So likewise, contentment of the heart does not occur in absolution, gift, and other matters except when a person is left to his own choice [ikhtiyar], until the motives [dawa'i] emanate from his very soul [nafs], not that his motives are compelled to act by stratagems and coercion.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;

And for this reason it is said: Give to every servant according to the measure of his intellect [‘aql], and weigh for him with the scale of his understanding [fahm] so that you may be safe from him and he may benefit from you, otherwise denial will occur due to the disparity of the measure. And one of the scholars was asked about something and he did not answer, so the questioner said: Have you not heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say: \"Whoever conceals beneficial knowledge will come on the Day of Resurrection bridled with a bridle of fire\"? So he said: Leave the bridle and go, for if one comes who comprehends [yafqahu] and I conceal it from him, then let him bridle me. For God, the Exalted, has said: \"And do not give the foolish [sufahā’] your wealth\" [4:5] as an indication that safeguarding knowledge from one who would corrupt it and harm himself is more paramount. And the injustice [ẓulm] in giving to one who is undeserving is not less than the injustice in withholding from one who is deserving. Shall I scatter pearls among a grazing herd of cattle, only to find them stored away by the shepherd of the sheep? For they, in their ignorance [jahl] of its worth, have passed the night, so I will not spend the morning adorning cattle with it. If the Gentle [laṭīf] God, in His gentleness [luṭf], is gracious, and I encounter people fit for the sciences [‘ulūm] and the wisdom [ḥikam], I will disseminate what is beneficial and gain a legacy; otherwise, it remains stored with me and concealed. For whoever bestows knowledge [‘ilm] upon the ignorant [juhhāl] squanders it, and whoever withholds it from those who are deserving has indeed been unjust [ẓalama].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال عيسى عليه السلام: لا تعلقوا الجواهر في أعناق الخنازير، فإن الحكمة خير من الجوهر، ومن كرهها فهو شر من الخنازير. ولذلك قيل: كل لكل عبد بمعيار عقله، وزن له بميزان فهمه حتى تسلم منه وينتفع بك، وإلا وقع الإنكار لتفاوت المعيار. وسئل بعض العلماء عن شيء فلم يجب فقال السائل: أما سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: ((من كتم علما نافعا جاء يوم القيامة ملجما بلجام من نار))[140]. فقال اترك اللجام واذهب فإن جاء من يفقه وكتمته فليلجمني فقد قال الله تعالى ولا تؤتوا السفهاء أموالكم تنبيها على أن حفظ العلم ممن يفسده ويضره أولى وليس الظلم في إعطاء غير المستحق بأقل من الظلم في منع المستحق: أأنثر دّراً بين سارحةِ النَّعمِ فأصبح مخزوناً براعيةِ الغنمْ لأنهم أمسوا بجهلٍ لقدرهِ فلا أنا أضحى أن أطوقهُ البهمْ فإن لطفَ اللهِ اللطيفُ بلطفهِ وصادفتُ أهلاً للعلوم وللحكمْ نشرتُ مفيداً واستفدتُ مواة وإلا فمخزونٌ لدي ومكتتمْ فمَن منحَ الجهالَ علماً أضاعهُ ومَن منعَ المستوجبين فقد ظلمْ</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"1.21","c":"وَابْتَلُوا","d":"wa-ib'talū","e":"۟āwُlَtْbٱَw"},{"b":"0.87","h":"2.57","c":"الْيَتَامَى","d":"l-yatāmā","e":"ٰàَmَٰtَyْlٱ"},{"b":"2.1","h":"4.45","c":"حَتَّى","d":"ḥattā","e":"ٰٓàَّtَḥ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"7.18","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"4.9","h":"8.25","c":"بَلَغُوا","d":"balaghū","e":"۟āwُغَlَb"},{"b":"5.6","h":"9.29","c":"النِّكَاحَ","d":"l-nikāḥa","e":"َḥāَkِّnlٱ"},{"b":"6.9","h":"11.54","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"ْnِiʾَf"},{"b":"7.6","h":"12.48","c":"ءَانَسْتُمْ","d":"ānastum","e":"mُtْsَnāَء"},{"b":"9.4","h":"15.16","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"10.2","h":"16.55","c":"رُشْدًا","d":"rush'dan","e":"āًdْhsُr"},{"b":"11.5","h":"18.39","c":"فَادْفَعُوا","d":"fa-id'faʿū","e":"۟āٓwُʿعَfْdٱَf"},{"b":"15.4","h":"21.14","c":"إِلَيْهِمْ","d":"ilayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"16.5","h":"22.95","c":"أَمْوَالَهُمْ","d":"amwālahum","e":"ْmُhَlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"18.4","h":"29.4","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"19.0","h":"30.35","c":"تَأْكُلُوهَا","d":"takulūhā","e":"ٓāَhwُlُkْaʾَt"},{"b":"21.7","h":"34.19","c":"إِسْرَافًا","d":"is'rāfan","e":"āًfāَrْsِiʾ"},{"b":"23.2","h":"36.33","c":"وَبِدَارًا","d":"wabidāran","e":"āًrāَdِbَw"},{"b":"25.1","h":"39.3","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"26.4","h":"40.92","c":"يَكْبَرُوا","d":"yakbarū","e":"۟āwُrَbْkَy"},{"b":"28.0","h":"44.4","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"29.3","h":"45.68","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"30.0","h":"46.86","c":"غَنِيًّا","d":"ghaniyyan","e":"āًّyِnَغ"},{"b":"31.6","h":"48.95","c":"فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ","d":"falyastaʿfif","e":"ْfِfْʿعَtْsَyْlَf"},{"b":"33.3","h":"52.21","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"34.4","h":"53.56","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"35.1","h":"54.69","c":"فَقِيرًا","d":"faqīran","e":"āًryِqَf"},{"b":"36.8","h":"57.04","c":"فَلْيَأْكُلْ","d":"falyakul","e":"ْlُkْaʾَyْlَf"},{"b":"38.1","h":"59.31","c":"بِالْمَعْرُوفِ","d":"bil-maʿrūfi","e":"ِfwُrْʿعَmْlٱِb"},{"b":"41.0","h":"64.9","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"41.9","h":"66.13","c":"دَفَعْتُمْ","d":"dafaʿtum","e":"ْmُtْʿعَfَd"},{"b":"43.1","h":"68.01","c":"إِلَيْهِمْ","d":"ilayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"44.1","h":"69.94","c":"أَمْوَالَهُمْ","d":"amwālahum","e":"ْmُhَlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"45.6","h":"72.48","c":"فَأَشْهِدُوا","d":"fa-ashhidū","e":"۟āwُdِhْhsَaʾَf"},{"b":"46.8","h":"74.63","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"48.3","h":"78.7","c":"وَكَفَى","d":"wakafā","e":"ٰàَfَkَw"},{"b":"49.2","h":"80.06","c":"بِاللَّهِ","d":"bil-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱِb"},{"b":"50.2","h":"81.97","c":"حَسِيبًا","d":"ḥasīban","e":"āًbyِsَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age.

Yes, whoever is overcome by a dominant, all-consuming state [hala] that leaves no room for anything else, and who possesses, with it, a wakefulness [yaqaza] and a penetrating, acute intelligence [dhaka'] by which he perceives the distant meanings [ma'ani] within the words—his spiritual passion [wajd] may be stirred by everything he hears. Like one for whom, upon hearing the words of the Almighty \"God instructs you concerning your children,\" the state [hala] of death arises—the death that necessitates the will—and that every person must inevitably leave behind his wealth and his children, and they are his two beloved things from the world [dunya], so he leaves one beloved for the other and abandons them both. Thus, fear [khawf] and anguish [jaza'] overcome him. Or he hears the mention of God in His words \"God instructs you concerning your children,\" and he is awestruck by the Name alone, oblivious to what precedes and follows it. Or the mercy [rahma] of God upon His servants and His compassion occur to him—that He Himself undertook the division of their inheritances, providing for them in their life and their death—so he says, \"If He looks after our children after our death, then we have no doubt that He looks after us.\" Then a state of hope [raja'] is stirred within him, and that bequeaths to him gladness [istibshar] and joy [surur]. Or it occurs to him from the words of the Almighty \"for the male the share of two females\" the preference [tafdil] of the male for being a man over the female, and that the virtue [fadl] in the Hereafter [akhira] is for men whom no commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God, and that whoever is distracted by other than God from God, he is from the females, not from the men, in truth [tahqiq]. So he fears that he may be veiled [hujiba] or delayed in the bliss [na'im] of the Hereafter as the female was delayed in the worldly [dunya] wealth. So the likes of this may stir spiritual passion [wajd]. But only for one in whom are two qualities: the first, an all-consuming, overwhelming, dominant state [hala]; and the second, a profound perception [tafattun] and a complete, intense wakefulness [yaqaza] for being alerted by proximate matters to distant meanings [ma'ani].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl;

Rather, he should observe moderation [i'tidal] in it. So he does not abandon awe and sternness whenever he sees a wrong [munkar], nor does he open the door to assisting in wrongs at all. Rather, whenever he sees what contradicts the Sacred Law [shar'] and manly virtue [muru'a], he should show displeasure and be vexed.\n\nAl-Hasan said, \"By God, no man obeys his wife in what she desires [hawa] except that God casts him into the Fire.\" And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, \"Oppose women, for in opposing them is blessing [baraka].\" And it has been said, \"Consult them and oppose them.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"Wretched is the slave of the wife.\" He only said that because if he obeys her in her whim [hawa], then he is her slave, and he is wretched. For God made him the master [malik] of the woman, but he made her the master of himself. So he has reversed the matter and overturned the case, and he has obeyed Satan when he said, \"And I will command them so they will change the creation of God.\" For the right of the man is to be followed, not a follower.\n\nAnd God has named men \"maintainers [qawwamun] over women,\" and He named the husband a master [sayyid], as He, the Exalted, said, \"And they found her master [sayyidaha] at the door.\" So if the master becomes subjugated, then he has \"exchanged the favor of God for disbelief.\"\n\nAnd the soul [nafs] of the woman is like your own soul [nafs]. If you loosen its rein a little, it will bolt with you for a long time. If you slacken its bridle a bit, it will drag you an arm's length. If you curb it and tighten your hand upon it in the place of severity, you will master it.\n\nAl-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, said, \"Three, if you honor them, they will disgrace you, and if you disgrace them, they will honor you: the woman, the servant, and the Nabatean.\" He meant by this that if you offer pure honor and do not mix your harshness with your gentleness and your roughness with your kindness.\n\nAnd in sum, by justice [adl] the heavens and the earth stand. So everything that exceeds its limit reverts to its opposite. Therefore, you should take the path of moderation [iqtisad] in opposition and agreement, and follow the truth [haqq] in all of that, to be safe from their evil.

As for the spender, he does not spend anything except that it flows over or becomes ample upon his skin until it conceals his fingertips. As for the miser [bakhil], he does not intend to spend anything except that it shrinks and clings to every ring of his throat until it takes hold of his collarbones, so he loosens it but it does not expand.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Two traits do not gather in a believer: miserliness [bukhul] and bad character.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from miserliness [bukhul], and I seek refuge in You from cowardice, and I seek refuge in You from being returned to the most abject age.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Beware of oppression, for oppression is darknesses on the Day of Resurrection. And beware of obscenity, for Allah does not love the obscene nor the one who acts obscenely. And beware of stinginess [shuhh], for it only destroyed those before you. Stinginess [shuhh] commanded them to lie, so they lied, and it commanded them to oppress, so they oppressed, and it commanded them to sever ties, so they severed.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The worst thing in a man is destructive stinginess [shuhh hal'] and stripping cowardice.\"\n\nAnd a martyr was killed during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, so a weeping woman wept for him and said, \"O my martyr!\" So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"And what makes you know that he is a martyr? Perhaps he used to speak about what does not concern him or was stingy [yabkhalu] with what would not diminish him.\"\n\nAnd Jubayr ibn Mut'im said: While we were traveling with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and the people were with him returning from Khaybar, the Bedouins clung to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, asking him, until they pushed him to a thorny tree and snatched his cloak.

For indeed Allah the Exalted has said: **\"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him [shirk], but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.\"** And He the Exalted said: **\"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy [rahma] of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'\"** And He the Exalted said: **\"And whoever does an evil or wrongs himself then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\"**\n\nAnd we seek forgiveness [istighfar] from Allah the Exalted for every slip of the foot or transgression of the pen in this book of ours and in all our books. And we seek His forgiveness for our words which our actions do not match. And we seek His forgiveness for what we claimed and displayed of knowledge [ilm] and insight [basira] into the religion of Allah the Exalted while being deficient in it. And we seek His forgiveness for every knowledge [ilm] and deed we intended for His Noble Countenance, then something else became mixed with it. And we seek His forgiveness for every promise we made to ourselves, then fell short in fulfilling. And we seek His forgiveness for every blessing [ni'ma] He bestowed upon us, then we employed it in disobedience to Him. And we seek His forgiveness for every explicit and implicit mention of the deficiency of a deficient one or the shortcoming of one who fell short, with which we were characterized. And we seek His forgiveness for every fleeting thought that called us to affectation and pretense, to adorn ourselves before people in a book we penned, or speech we composed, or knowledge [ilm] we imparted or received.\n\nAnd we hope, after seeking forgiveness for all of that—for us and for whoever reads this book of ours or writes it or hears it—that we are honored with forgiveness [maghfira] and mercy [rahma] and pardon for all sins, outward and inward. For generosity is immense, mercy [rahma] is vast, and bounty upon all kinds of creation is overflowing. And we are a creation from the creation of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic; we have no means to Him except His favor and His generosity. For indeed the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: **(Indeed, Allah the Exalted has one hundred mercies [rahma]; He sent down from them a single mercy [rahma] between the jinn, mankind, birds, beasts, and creeping things.

Allah, the Exalted, says: \"So do not claim purity for yourselves [fa la tuzakku anfusakum]\" (4:49). And He says: \"Have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves [alladhina yuzakkuuna anfusahum]?\" (4:49). And the Exalted says: \"See how they invent lies about Allah\" (4:50). And it was said to a wise man, \"What is ugly truthfulness [al-sidq al-qabih]?\" He said, \"A person's praise of himself.\" And faith [al-iman] is among the highest attributes of glory [al-majd], and certainty [al-jazm] is absolute self-praise [tazkiyah mutlaqah]. And the formula of exception [sighat al-istithna'] is as if it is a burden for one who knows self-praise [al-tazkiyah]; just as it is said to a person, \"You are a doctor, or a jurist, or an exegete,\" and he says, \"Yes, if Allah wills [in sha' Allah],\" not in the manner of casting doubt [al-tashkik] but to remove himself from praising himself. Thus, the formula is the formula of hesitation [al-taraddud] and weakening [al-tad'if] of the report itself, and its meaning is the necessary weakening [al-tad'if al-lazim] from the necessary concomitants [lawazim] of the report, which is self-praise [al-tazkiyah].

So supplication is a cause [sabab] for repelling affliction and for attracting mercy [rahma], just as the shield is a cause for repelling the arrow, and water is a cause for the emergence of plants from the earth. And just as the shield pushes against the arrow and they repel each other, so too do supplication and affliction contend with one another. And it is not a condition of affirming the decree [qada'] of God, the Exalted, that one should not carry a weapon, for He, the Exalted, has said: \"Take your precaution.\" Nor is it that one should not water the earth after scattering the seed, saying, \"If the decree [qada'] preceded it with growth, the seed will grow, and if it did not precede it, it will not grow.\" Rather, the linking of causes [asbab] to their effects [musabbabat] is the First Decree [al-qada' al-awwal], which is like the blinking of an eye, or even closer.

Whenever one is averse to the desires of the self, he is averse to remaining in the world [dunya], and his hope [amal] is inevitably shortened. For he only desires to remain in order to enjoy, and he desires perpetual enjoyment through desiring permanence; for whoever desires a thing desires its permanence. And there is no meaning to the love of life except the love of the permanence of what exists or is possible in this life. So when he is averse to it, he does not desire it. And for this reason, when fighting was prescribed for them, \"They said, 'Our Lord, why have You prescribed for us fighting? If only You had postponed it for us for a short time.'\" So the Most High said: \"Say, 'The enjoyment of the world is little.'\" That is: You do not desire to remain except for the enjoyment of the world. Thus, at that point, the ascetics [zahidun] became manifest, and the condition of the hypocrites was unveiled. And the indication to defining the baseness of the world is in His saying, the Most High: \"Say, 'The enjoyment of the world is little.'\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وإلى تعريف خساسة الدنيا الإشارة بقوله تعالى: \" قل متاع الدنيا قليل \" وإلى تعريف نفاسة الآخرة الإشارة بقوله عز وجل: \"وقال الذين أوتوا ويلكم ثواب الله خير \" فنبه على أن العلم بنفاسة الجوهر هو المرغب عن عوضه، ولما لم يتصور الزهد إلا بمعارضة ورغبة عن المحبوب في أحب منه قال رجل في دعائه: اللهم أرني الدنيا كما تراها، فقال له النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \" لا تقل هكذا \" ولكن قل: أرني الدنيا كما أريتها الصالحين من عبادك\" وهذا لأن الله تعالى يراها حقيرة كما هي، وكل مخلوق فهو بالإضافة إلى جلاله حقير والعبد يراها حقيرة في نفسه بالإضافة إلى ما هو خير له، ولا يتصور أن يرى بائع الفرس وإن رغب عنه فرسه كما يرى الحشرات الأرض مثلاً، لأنه مستغن عن الحشرات أصلاً وليس مستغنياً عن الفرس، والله تعالى غني بذاته عن كل ما سواه، فيرى الكل في درجة واحدة بالإضافة إلى جلاله، ويراه متفاوتاً بالإضافة إلى غيره، والزاهد هو الذي يرى تفاوته بالإضافة إلى نفسه لا إلى غيره.</div></div></div>"}},"78":{"w":[{"b":"0.01","h":"1.8","c":"أَيْنَمَا","d":"aynamā","e":"āَmَnْyَaʾ"},{"b":"0.75","h":"3","c":"تَكُونُوا","d":"takūnū","e":"۟āwُnwُkَt"},{"b":"2.0","h":"4.7","c":"يُدْرِكُكُمُ","d":"yud'rikkumu","e":"ُmُّkkِrْdُy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"6.38","c":"الْمَوْتُ","d":"l-mawtu","e":"ُtْwَmْlٱ"},{"b":"4.1","h":"7.61","c":"وَلَوْ","d":"walaw","e":"ْwَlَw"},{"b":"4.8","h":"8.45","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"6.3","h":"10.18","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"6.8","h":"11.04","c":"بُرُوجٍ","d":"burūjin","e":"ٍjgwُrُb"},{"b":"8.6","h":"12.98","c":"مُشَيَّدَةٍ","d":"mushayyadatin","e":"ٍẗَdَّyَhsُّm"},{"b":"10.4","h":"16.7","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"11.6","h":"17.7","c":"تُصِبْهُمْ","d":"tuṣib'hum","e":"ْmُhْbِṣُt"},{"b":"12.6","h":"19.16","c":"حَسَنَةٌ","d":"ḥasanatun","e":"ٌẗَnَsَḥ"},{"b":"14.2","h":"21.16","c":"يَقُولُوا","d":"yaqūlū","e":"۟āwُlwُqَy"},{"b":"15.2","h":"22.63","c":"هَذِهِ","d":"hādhihi","e":"ۦِhِhdَٰh"},{"b":"16.1","h":"24.27","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"16.6","h":"24.76","c":"عِنْدِ","d":"ʿindi","e":"ِdnِʿع"},{"b":"17.6","h":"26.25","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"20.3","h":"29.85","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"21.6","h":"31.12","c":"تُصِبْهُمْ","d":"tuṣib'hum","e":"ْmُhْbِṣُt"},{"b":"22.6","h":"32.64","c":"سَيِّئَةٌ","d":"sayyi-atun","e":"ٌẗَyʾِّyَs"},{"b":"24.2","h":"35.04","c":"يَقُولُوا","d":"yaqūlū","e":"۟āwُlwُqَy"},{"b":"25.2","h":"36.76","c":"هَذِهِ","d":"hādhihi","e":"ۦِhِhdَٰh"},{"b":"26.2","h":"38.31","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"27.0","h":"38.8","c":"عِنْدِكَ","d":"ʿindika","e":"َkِdnِʿع"},{"b":"28.5","h":"42.45","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"28.9","h":"43.65","c":"كُلٌّ","d":"kullun","e":"ٌّlُk"},{"b":"29.7","h":"44.66","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِّm"},{"b":"30.7","h":"45.14","c":"عِنْدِ","d":"ʿindi","e":"ِdnِʿع"},{"b":"31.8","h":"46.84","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"34.6","h":"50.3","c":"فَمَالِ","d":"famāli","e":"ِlāَmَf"},{"b":"35.8","h":"51.44","c":"هَؤُلَاءِ","d":"hāulāi","e":"ِءٓāَlُwʾَٰٓh"},{"b":"39.1","h":"55.45","c":"الْقَوْمِ","d":"l-qawmi","e":"ِmْwَqْlٱ"},{"b":"40.1","h":"56.77","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"40.9","h":"57.33","c":"يَكَادُونَ","d":"yakādūna","e":"َnwُdāَkَy"},{"b":"42.0","h":"59.35","c":"يَفْقَهُونَ","d":"yafqahūna","e":"َnwُhَqْfَy"},{"b":"43.2","h":"61.16","c":"حَدِيثًا","d":"ḥadīthan","e":"āًhtyِdَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction.

Then your dislike of it and your desire for its removal does not harm you, for you do not desire its removal insofar as it is a blessing, but rather insofar as it is an instrument of corruption. And if you were secure from his corruption, his blessing would not grieve you.\n\nThe prohibition of envy is indicated by the narrations we have transmitted, and by the fact that this dislike is displeasure with God's decree in preferring some of His servants over others. There is no excuse or concession for that. And what sin is greater than your dislike of a Muslim's comfort when no harm from it reaches you?\n\nThe Qur'an alludes to this in His saying: \"If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if evil strikes you, they rejoice at it.\" This rejoicing is malicious glee [shamatah], and envy and malicious glee are concomitant.\n\nAnd the Almighty said: \"Many of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after your belief, out of envy from themselves.\" So the Almighty informed that their love for the removal of the blessing of faith is envy.\n\nAnd the Almighty said: \"They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would be equal.\"\n\nAnd God the Almighty mentioned the envy of the brothers of Joseph, peace be upon him, and expressed what was in their hearts with His saying: \"When they said, 'Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you.'\" So when they disliked their father's love for him and it distressed them, and they desired its removal from him, they hid him from him.\n\nAnd He said: \"And they find within themselves no discomfort from what they were given\" — meaning their breasts are not constricted by it and they are not grieved — so He praised them for the absence of envy.\n\nAnd He said, in the context of reproach: \"Or do they envy people for what God has given them of His bounty?\"\n\nAnd He said: \"Mankind was one community\" up to His saying: \"Except those to whom it was given, after clear proofs had come to them, out of mutual envy.\" It is said in the interpretation: envy.\n\nAnd He said: \"And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves.\" So God sent down knowledge to unite them and bring them together in obedience to Him, and commanded them to unite through knowledge, but they envied one another and differed when each one of them desired to be alone with leadership and acceptance of speech, so they refuted one another.\n\nIbn Abbas said: The Jews, before the Prophet ﷺ was sent, when they fought a people, would say: \"We ask you by the Prophet you promised to send and by the Book you will reveal, that you grant us victory.\" And they would be granted victory. So when the Prophet ﷺ came from the descendants of Ishmael, peace be upon him, they recognized him and disbelieved in him after recognizing him. So the Almighty said: \"And they used to entreat, before, for victory over those who disbelieved, but when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it\" up to His saying: \"That they would disbelieve in what God has revealed, out of envy\" — meaning envy.\n\nThis is the ruling of envy concerning its prohibition.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال عز وجل \"ودوا لو تكفرون كما كفروا فتكونون سواء\" فأخبر تعالى أن حبهم زوال نعمة الإيمان حسد.</div></div></div>"}},"90":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"1.65","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.64","h":"2.48","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.99","c":"يَصِلُونَ","d":"yaṣilūna","e":"َnwُlِṣَy"},{"b":"2.6","h":"5.57","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"6.47","c":"قَوْمٍ","d":"qawmin","e":"ٍۭmْwَq"},{"b":"4.5","h":"8.16","c":"بَيْنَكُمْ","d":"baynakum","e":"ْmُkَnْyَb"},{"b":"5.6","h":"9.72","c":"وَبَيْنَهُمْ","d":"wabaynahum","e":"mُhَnْyَbَw"},{"b":"7.3","h":"11.9","c":"مِيثَاقٌ","d":"mīthāqun","e":"ٌqَٰhtyِّm"},{"b":"8.5","h":"13.93","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"14.57","c":"جَاءُوكُمْ","d":"jāūkum","e":"ْmُkwُءٓāَjg"},{"b":"11.3","h":"17.46","c":"حَصِرَتْ","d":"ḥaṣirat","e":"ْtَrِṣَḥ"},{"b":"12.1","h":"18.74","c":"صُدُورُهُمْ","d":"ṣudūruhum","e":"ْmُhُrwُdُṣ"},{"b":"13.3","h":"20.87","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"14.3","h":"21.82","c":"يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ","d":"yuqātilūkum","e":"ْmُkwُlِtَٰqُy"},{"b":"15.8","h":"24.58","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"16.1","h":"25.27","c":"يُقَاتِلُوا","d":"yuqātilū","e":"۟āwُlِtَٰqُy"},{"b":"17.4","h":"27.51","c":"قَوْمَهُمْ","d":"qawmahum","e":"ْmُhَmْwَq"},{"b":"18.8","h":"32.47","c":"وَلَوْ","d":"walaw","e":"ْwَlَw"},{"b":"19.3","h":"33.27","c":"شَاءَ","d":"shāa","e":"َءٓāَhs"},{"b":"21.0","h":"35.69","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"21.9","h":"37.16","c":"لَسَلَّطَهُمْ","d":"lasallaṭahum","e":"ْmُhَṭَّlَsَl"},{"b":"23.2","h":"39.32","c":"عَلَيْكُمْ","d":"ʿalaykum","e":"ْmُkْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"24.2","h":"41.03","c":"فَلَقَاتَلُوكُمْ","d":"falaqātalūkum","e":"ْmُkwُlَtَٰqَlَf"},{"b":"26.4","h":"47.05","c":"فَإِنِ","d":"fa-ini","e":"ِnِiʾَf"},{"b":"27.0","h":"47.68","c":"اعْتَزَلُوكُمْ","d":"iʿ'tazalūkum","e":"ْmُkwُlَzَtْʿعٱ"},{"b":"28.5","h":"49.97","c":"فَلَمْ","d":"falam","e":"ْmَlَf"},{"b":"29.0","h":"50.94","c":"يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ","d":"yuqātilūkum","e":"ْmُkwُlِtَٰqُy"},{"b":"30.7","h":"53.68","c":"وَأَلْقَوْا","d":"wa-alqaw","e":"۟āْwَqْlَaʾَw"},{"b":"31.7","h":"55.25","c":"إِلَيْكُمُ","d":"ilaykumu","e":"ُmُkْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"32.7","h":"56.75","c":"السَّلَمَ","d":"l-salama","e":"َmَlَّslٱ"},{"b":"33.5","h":"57.94","c":"فَمَا","d":"famā","e":"āَmَf"},{"b":"34.1","h":"58.95","c":"جَعَلَ","d":"jaʿala","e":"َlَʿعَjg"},{"b":"34.7","h":"59.89","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"35.6","h":"61.27","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"36.1","h":"62.18","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"37.1","h":"63.86","c":"سَبِيلًا","d":"sabīlan","e":"āًlyِbَs"}],"a":{"g":"Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting their own people.

So how [can it be otherwise] when He has commanded caution from the enemy, just as He commanded caution from the disbelievers, saying, the Most High: \"And let them take their precaution and their arms.\" So if it is incumbent upon you, by the command of Allah, to be cautious of the disbelieving enemy whom you see, then it is more incumbent upon you to be cautious of an enemy who sees you and you do not see him. Therefore, being occupied with Allah [al-istighlal bi-Allah] does not mean turning away from that which Allah has warned against, and by this, the doctrine of the second group is invalidated in their assumption that this detracts from trust [al-tawakkul]. For taking up the shield and weapon, gathering the troops, and digging the trench did not detract from the trust [tawakkul] of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, so how could fearing that which Allah has warned against and being cautious of that which He has commanded caution from detract from trust [al-tawakkul]? And We have mentioned in the Book of Trust [Kitab al-Tawakkul] what clarifies the error of those who claim that the meaning of trust [al-tawakkul] is to completely abandon means [al-asbab]. And His saying, the Most High: \"And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war\" does not contradict compliance with trust [al-tawakkul], as long as the heart [al-qalb] believes that the One who harms and benefits, the One who gives life and causes death, is Allah, the Most High. Likewise, one is cautious of Satan [al-Shaytan] while believing that the One who guides and leads astray is Allah, and sees the means [al-asbab] as subjugated intermediaries—as We have mentioned in the Book of Trust [Kitab al-Tawakkul].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>والقرآن من أوله إلى آخره تحذير من الشيطان فكيف وقد أمر بالحذر من العدو كما أمر بالحذر من الكفار فقال تعالى \"وليأخذوا حذرهم وأسلحتهم\" فإذا لزمك بأمر الله الحذر من العدو الكافر وأنت تراه فبأن يلزمك الحذر من عدو يراك ولا تراه أولى. فليس من الاشتغال بالله الأعراض عما حذر الله وبه يبطل مذهب الفرقة الثاني في ظنهم أن ذلك قادح في التوكل، فإن أخذ الترس والسلاح وجمع الجنود وحفر الخندق لم يقدح في توكل رسول الله ﷺ فكيف يقدح في التوكل الخوف مما خوف الله به والحذر مما أمر بالحذر منه؟ وقد ذكرنا في كتاب التوكل ما يبين غلط من زعم أن معنى التوكل النزوع عن الأسباب بالكلية وقوله تعالى \"وأعدوا لهم ما استطعتم من قوة ومن رباط الخيل\" لا يناقض امتثال التوكل، مهما اعتقد القلب أن الضار والنافع والمحيي والمميت هو الله تعالى، فكذلك يحذر الشيطان ويعتقد أن الهادي والمضل هو الله، ويرى الأسباب وسائط مسخرة - كما ذكرناه في التوكل.</div></div></div>"}},"103":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.45","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"0.88","h":"1.28","c":"قَضَيْتُمُ","d":"qaḍaytumu","e":"ُmُtْyَḍَq"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.61","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.07","c":"فَاذْكُرُوا","d":"fa-udh'kurū","e":"۟āwُrُkْhdٱَf"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.23","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.24","c":"قِيَامًا","d":"qiyāman","e":"āًmَٰyِq"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.48","c":"وَقُعُودًا","d":"waquʿūdan","e":"āًdwُʿعُqَw"},{"b":"7.2","h":"9.58","c":"وَعَلَى","d":"waʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿعَw"},{"b":"8.6","h":"11.32","c":"جُنُوبِكُمْ","d":"junūbikum","e":"ْmُkِbwُnُjg"},{"b":"10.","h":"14.95","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"10.","h":"15.48","c":"اطْمَأْنَنْتُمْ","d":"iṭ'manantum","e":"ْmُtnَnْaʾَmْṭٱ"},{"b":"13.0","h":"17.99","c":"فَأَقِيمُوا","d":"fa-aqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqَaʾَf"},{"b":"14.1","h":"19.48","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"15.1","h":"23.05","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"18.","h":"24.27","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"19.","h":"25.61","c":"كَانَتْ","d":"kānat","e":"ْtَnāَk"},{"b":"20.1","h":"26.81","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"20.5","h":"27.33","c":"الْمُؤْمِنِينَ","d":"l-mu'minīna","e":"َnyِnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"21.9","h":"29.23","c":"كِتَابًا","d":"kitāban","e":"āًbَٰtِk"},{"b":"22.8","h":"30.29","c":"مَوْقُوتًا","d":"mawqūtan","e":"āًtwُqْwَّm"}],"a":{"g":"And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides.

And we seek His forgiveness for our words which our deeds do not match. And we seek His forgiveness for what we claimed and displayed of knowledge [‘ilm] and insight [baṣīrah] into the religion of Allah, the Exalted, while falling short in it. And we seek His forgiveness for every knowledge [‘ilm] and action we intended by it His Noble Countenance, then something else became mixed with it. And we seek His forgiveness for every promise we made to ourselves, then fell short in fulfilling it. And we seek His forgiveness for every blessing [ni‘mah] He bestowed upon us, then we used it in disobedience to Him. And we seek His forgiveness for every explicit statement and allusion to the deficiency of one deficient and the shortcoming of one falling short, which we ourselves were characterized by. And we seek His forgiveness for every fleeting thought that called us to affectation and pretense, to adorn ourselves for people in a book we penned, or speech we composed, or knowledge [‘ilm] we imparted or received.\n\nAnd we hope, after seeking forgiveness for all of that in its entirety—for us and for whoever reads this book of ours, or writes it, or hears it—that we may be honored with forgiveness [maghfirah] and mercy [raḥmah] and pardon for all misdeeds, outward and inward. For generosity is vast, and mercy [raḥmah] is expansive, and bounty upon all varieties of creation is overflowing.

So he praised Allah and extolled Him in every state and said: I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, He fulfilled His promise [wa'd] and aided His servant ['abd] and defeated the confederates alone, so to Allah alone is all praise. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger and the seal of His prophets. And I bear witness that the Book is as He legislated, and the religion [din] is as He legislated, and the tradition [hadith] is as it was narrated, and the statement is as it was said, and that Allah is the Manifest Truth. O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad, Your servant and Your Messenger and Your Prophet and Your beloved and Your trustee and Your chosen one and Your elect, with the best of what You have sent as prayers upon any of Your creation. O Allah, and make Your prayers and Your safekeeping and Your mercy upon the master of the messengers and the seal of the prophets and the Imam of the God-conscious [muttaqin], Muhammad, the leader of good and the Imam of good and the Messenger of mercy. O Allah, bring near his proximity [zulfah] and magnify his proof [burhan] and honor his station [maqam] and resurrect him to a praiseworthy station [maqam mahmud] which the first and the last will envy. And benefit us by his praiseworthy station on the Day of Resurrection, and grant him succession among us in the world [dunya] and the Hereafter, and grant him the highest degree and the means of nearness in Paradise. O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, and bless Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent prayers and blessed Ibrahim, indeed You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. O people, indeed whoever was worshipping Muhammad, then Muhammad has died. And whoever was worshipping Allah, then Allah is Alive, He does not die. And indeed Allah has presented to you in His command, so do not call upon Him in panic, for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has chosen for His Prophet ﷺ what is with Him over what is with you, and took him to His reward, and left among you His Book and the tradition [sunnah] of His Prophet ﷺ.

For all of that is from what it is not permissible to plunge into, and it is forbidden. Most people sit together for amusement through conversation, and their speech does not go beyond jesting with the honor of people or plunging into falsehood [al-batil]. The types of falsehood [al-batil] cannot be enumerated due to their multitude and variety; therefore, there is no deliverance from them except by restricting oneself to what is of concern from the important matters of religion [din] and the world [dunya]. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who plunges most into falsehood [al-batil].\" And to this is the allusion by His saying, the Exalted: \"And we used to plunge with those who plunge.\" And by His saying, the Exalted: \"Then do not sit with them until they plunge into a discourse other than it; indeed, you would then be like them.\" And Salman said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who speaks most in disobedience to Allah.\" So this is plunging into falsehood [al-batil], and it is beyond what will come of backbiting, tale-bearing, obscenity, and others. Rather, it is plunging into the mention of prohibitions whose occurrence has preceded, or contemplating to find a way to them, without a religious need to mention them. And there also enters into it plunging into recounting innovations and corrupt doctrines, and recounting what occurred of the fighting among the Companions in a manner that suggests disparagement of some of them. And all of that is falsehood [al-batil], and plunging into it is plunging into falsehood [al-batil]. We ask Allah for good assistance through His gentleness and generosity.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى: ﴿ إنكم إذا مثلهم ﴾{} ولذلك قال ﭬ: (المغتاب والمستمع شريكان في الإثم[22]).</div></div></div>"}},"141":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"1.9","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.2","h":"3.59","c":"يَتَرَبَّصُونَ","d":"yatarabbaṣūna","e":"َnwُṣَّbَrَtَy"},{"b":"2.8","h":"6.3","c":"بِكُمْ","d":"bikum","e":"ْmُkِb"},{"b":"3.4","h":"7.2","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"nِiʾَf"},{"b":"4.5","h":"8.54","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"5.1","h":"9.62","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"5.7","h":"10.58","c":"فَتْحٌ","d":"fatḥun","e":"ٌḥْtَf"},{"b":"7.3","h":"12.43","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"7.6","h":"12.95","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"8.4","h":"14.26","c":"قَالُوا","d":"qālū","e":"۟āٓwُlāَq"},{"b":"10.3","h":"16.59","c":"أَلَمْ","d":"alam","e":"ْmَlَaʾ"},{"b":"10.9","h":"17.25","c":"نَكُنْ","d":"nakun","e":"nُkَn"},{"b":"11.6","h":"18.74","c":"مَعَكُمْ","d":"maʿakum","e":"ْmُkَʿعَّm"},{"b":"13.1","h":"20.33","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"14.1","h":"21.69","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"14.8","h":"22.77","c":"لِلْكَافِرِينَ","d":"lil'kāfirīna","e":"َnyِrِfَٰkْlِl"},{"b":"16.5","h":"25.38","c":"نَصِيبٌ","d":"naṣībun","e":"ٌbyِṣَn"},{"b":"18.3","h":"27.53","c":"قَالُوا","d":"qālū","e":"۟āٓwُlāَq"},{"b":"21.9","h":"41.7","c":"أَلَمْ","d":"alam","e":"ْmَlَaʾ"},{"b":"22.5","h":"42.35","c":"نَسْتَحْوِذْ","d":"nastaḥwidh","e":"ْhdِwْḥَtْsَn"},{"b":"23.7","h":"44.56","c":"عَلَيْكُمْ","d":"ʿalaykum","e":"ْmُkْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"24.8","h":"46.28","c":"وَنَمْنَعْكُمْ","d":"wanamnaʿkum","e":"mُkْʿعَnْmَnَw"},{"b":"26.5","h":"49.21","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"27.1","h":"49.79","c":"الْمُؤْمِنِينَ","d":"l-mu'minīna","e":"َnyِnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"30.0","h":"55.2","c":"فَاللَّهُ","d":"fal-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱَf"},{"b":"31.0","h":"56.78","c":"يَحْكُمُ","d":"yaḥkumu","e":"ُmُkْḥَy"},{"b":"31.9","h":"58.05","c":"بَيْنَكُمْ","d":"baynakum","e":"ْmُkَnْyَb"},{"b":"33","h":"59.69","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"33.5","h":"60.71","c":"الْقِيَامَةِ","d":"l-qiyāmati","e":"ِẗَmَٰyِqْlٱ"},{"b":"35.","h":"64.3","c":"وَلَنْ","d":"walan","e":"nَlَw"},{"b":"36.5","h":"65.46","c":"يَجْعَلَ","d":"yajʿala","e":"َlَʿعْjgَy"},{"b":"37.1","h":"66.7","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"38.0","h":"68.13","c":"لِلْكَافِرِينَ","d":"lil'kāfirīna","e":"َnyِrِfَٰkْlِl"},{"b":"39.5","h":"70.61","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"40.0","h":"71.32","c":"الْمُؤْمِنِينَ","d":"l-mu'minīna","e":"َnyِnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"41.","h":"73.65","c":"سَبِيلًا","d":"sabīlan","e":"āًlyِbَs"}],"a":{"g":"Those who wait [and watch] you.

And that does not remove the action from being truth [ḥaqq], just as one who repels the wrongdoer [ẓālim] from individual Muslims yet neglects his own father who is wronged among them—natural dispositions recoil from him, yet his repelling of the wrongdoer from the Muslim does not cease to be truth. From this it emerges that the sinner is not subject to commanding right [ḥisba] through admonition [wa'ẓ] upon one who knows his sinfulness, because he will not take admonition. And since that is not incumbent upon him, and it is known that it leads to prolonging the tongue in disparaging him through rebuke, we say: he does not have that right either. Thus, the discussion returns to the fact that one of the two types of commanding right—which is admonition—has been invalidated by sinfulness [fisq], and uprightness [ʿadāla] has been stipulated for it. As for coercive commanding right [ḥisba qahriyya], uprightness is not stipulated in it. So there is no blame upon the sinner in spilling wines, breaking instruments of diversion, and other such things if he is able. And this is the utmost fairness and unveiling in the matter.\n\nAs for the verses they used as proof, it is a rebuke of them for their abandoning of the recognized good [maʿrūf], not for their commanding it. But their commanding it indicates the strength of their knowledge [ʿilm], and the punishment of the knower [ʿālim] is more severe because he has no excuse with the strength of his knowledge. And His saying, exalted is He: \"Why do you say what you do not do?\"—the intent is the false promise. And His saying, mighty and majestic is He: \"And you forget yourselves\"—it is a rebuke for their forgetting themselves, not for their commanding others. But the mention of commanding others is used as evidence for their knowledge and to confirm the proof against them. And His saying: \"O son of Maryam, admonish yourself...\"—the ḥadīth is concerning commanding right through admonition, and we have conceded that the admonition of the sinner is of null benefit with one who knows his sinfulness. Then His saying: \"So be ashamed before Me\"—it does not indicate the prohibition of admonishing others. Rather, its meaning is: be ashamed before Me, so do not abandon the more important and occupy yourself with the less important, just as it is said: 'Preserve your father, then your neighbor; otherwise, be ashamed.'\n\nIf it is said: 'Then let it be permissible for the protected unbeliever [kāfir dhimmī] to command right upon the Muslim if he sees him fornicating, because his saying \"Do not fornicate\" is truth in itself, so it is impossible for it to be forbidden for him; rather, it should be permissible or obligatory.' We say: The unbeliever, if he prevents the Muslim by his action, that is an act of domination [tasalluṭ] over him, so he is prevented because it is domination, and \"Allah has not given the unbelievers over the believers any way.\" As for his mere saying \"Do not fornicate,\" it is not forbidden for him inasmuch as it is a prohibition of fornication, but inasmuch as it is a display of the authority [dāla] of passing judgment [iḥtikām] upon the Muslim, and in it is humiliation [idhlāl] for the one judged upon. And the sinner deserves humiliation, but not from the unbeliever who is more deserving of lowliness than he. This is the aspect of our preventing him from commanding right. Otherwise, we do not say that the unbeliever is punished because of his saying \"Do not fornicate\" inasmuch as he prohibited; rather, we say that if he does not say \"Do not fornicate,\" he is punished for it—if we consider addressing the unbeliever with the branches of the religion, and there is consideration in that which we have thoroughly covered in the legal discussions, and it is not suitable for our purpose now.\n\nThe fourth condition: that he be authorized from the side of the Imam and the ruler. Some have stipulated this condition and have not affirmed commanding right for the individuals among the subjects [raʿiyya]. And this stipulation is invalid, for the verses and reports we have cited indicate that whoever sees a wrong [munkar] and remains silent upon it has disobeyed, since forbidding it is obligatory wherever he sees it and however he sees it, in a general sense. So specifying it with the condition of delegation [tafwīḍ] from the Imam is arbitrary, having no basis. And it is astonishing that the Rāfiḍah increased upon this, saying: 'Commanding right is not permissible unless the infallible Imam emerges—and he is the rightful Imam according to them.' These are of the lowest rank to even be spoken to. Rather, the answer to them is to say to them: 'When you come to the judiciary seeking your rights in your blood and your wealth, our aiding you is commanding right, and extracting your rights from the hands of those who wronged you is forbidding wrong, and your seeking your right is from the totality of the recognized good. And is this not the time for forbidding wrong and seeking rights, because the rightful Imam has not yet emerged?'\n\nIf it is said: 'In commanding right is the affirmation of sovereignty [sulṭāna] and authority [wilāya] and passing judgment upon the one judged. Therefore, it was not affirmed for the unbeliever over the Muslim, even though it is truth in itself. So it should not be affirmed for individuals among the subjects except by delegation from the ruler and the one in authority.' We say: As for the unbeliever, he is prevented because of what it contains of domination and the honor of passing judgment, and the unbeliever is lowly, so he does not deserve to attain the honor of judging over the Muslim. As for the individuals among the Muslims, they deserve this honor by religion [dīn] and knowledge [maʿrifa]. And what it contains of the honor of sovereignty and passing judgment does not necessitate delegation, like the honor of teaching and making known, for there is no disagreement that making known the prohibition and obligation to one who is ignorant and proceeding towards wrong out of ignorance...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;
