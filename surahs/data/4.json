So they devised stratagems [hila] to repel rightful claims, and they misinterpreted weighty expressions, and were deluded by outward appearances [zawahir] and erred in them. This is from the category of error in legal verdicts [fatwa] and delusion therein, and error in verdicts is something that is frequent. But this type has become widespread among the masses except the discerning [akyaas] among them, so we point to examples: From that is their verdict that whenever a woman absolves [abara'at] from the dowry [sadaq], the husband is absolved between him and God, the Exalted. And that is an error. Rather, the husband may mistreat the wife such that he constricts her affairs with bad character, so she is compelled to seek deliverance, so she absolves the husband to be free of him. So it is an absolution [ibra'] not from a contented self [nafs]. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"But if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.\" And contentment of the self [tayyibat al-nafs] is other than contentment of the heart [qalb]. For a person may will with his heart what his self is not content with, for he wills cupping with his heart but his self dislikes it. And contentment of the self is only that her self permits the absolution, not from a necessity that confronts her, such that when she is placed between two harms, she chooses the lesser of them. This is, in truth, seizure [musadara] with inner compulsion [ikrah al-batin]. Yes, the judge [qadi] in this world [dunya] does not perceive the hearts and the intentions, so he looks to the outward absolution and that she was not coeraked by an outward cause, and inner compulsion is not something creation perceives. But whenever the Greatest Judge [al-Qadi al-Akbar] undertakes judgment on the plain of resurrection [qiyama], this will not be counted nor considered in establishing the absolution. And for that reason, it is not permissible to take a person's wealth except from a contented self of his. So if wealth were demanded from a person in front of people, and he felt ashamed before the people not to give it, and he wished the request had been in private so he would not give it, but he feared the pain of people's blame and he feared the pain of surrendering the wealth, and he weighed his soul [nafs] between them and chose the lesser of the two pains, which is the pain of surrender, and so he surrendered it—there is no difference between this and seizure. For the meaning of seizure is inflicting pain on the body with the whip until that becomes stronger than the pain of the heart in parting with wealth, so he chooses the lesser of the two pains. And the request in a situation of shame and ostentation is a strike upon the heart with a whip. And there is no difference between striking the inner [batin] and striking the outer [zahir] before God, the Exalted, for the inner before God, the Exalted, is outer. It is only the judge of this world who rules by the apparent [zahir] of his statement \"I have given it,\" because he cannot ascertain what is in the heart. Likewise, whoever gives for fear of the evil of his tongue or the evil of his slander, it is forbidden [haram] for him. And likewise, every wealth taken in this manner is forbidden. Do you not see what came in the story of David, peace be upon him, when he said—after he was forgiven—\"O Lord, how shall I deal with my adversary?\" So he was commanded to seek lawful release [istihlal] from him, and he was dead, so he was commanded to call him in the rock of the Sacred House. So he called: \"O Uriah!\" He answered him: \"At your service, O Prophet of God. You brought me out from Paradise, what do you want?\" He said: \"I wronged you in a matter, so forgive it for me.\" He said: \"I have done that, O Prophet of God.\" So he departed, having relied upon that. Then Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to him: \"Did you mention to him what you did?\" He said: \"Did I not forgive it for you?\" He said: \"Will you not ask me what that sin was?\" He said: \"What is it, O Prophet of God?\" He said: \"Such and such,\" and he mentioned the affair of the woman, and the answer was cut off. So he said, \"O Uriah, will you not answer me?\" He said: \"O Prophet of God, this is not how the Prophets act, until I stand with you before God.\" So David turned to weeping and wailing from the head until God promised him that He would ask it from him for him in the Hereafter [Akhira]. Thus, this alerts you that a gift [hiba] not from a contented heart [qalb] is of no benefit, and that contentment of the heart is not attained except through knowledge [ma'rifa]. So likewise, contentment of the heart does not occur in absolution, gift, and other matters except when a person is left to his own choice [ikhtiyar], until the motives [dawa'i] emanate from his very soul [nafs], not that his motives are compelled to act by stratagems and coercion.</div></div></div>"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.77","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"0.64","h":"1.66","c":"تُؤْتُوا","d":"tu'tū","e":"۟āwُtْwʾُt"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.7","c":"السُّفَهَاءَ","d":"l-sufahāa","e":"َءٓāَhَfُّslٱ"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.77","c":"أَمْوَالَكُمُ","d":"amwālakumu","e":"ُmُkَlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"5.3","h":"8.31","c":"الَّتِي","d":"allatī","e":"àِtَّlٱ"},{"b":"6.1","h":"9.86","c":"جَعَلَ","d":"jaʿala","e":"َlَʿعَjg"},{"b":"6.7","h":"10.84","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"7.6","h":"12.35","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"8.2","h":"13.34","c":"قِيَامًا","d":"qiyāman","e":"āًmَٰyِq"},{"b":"9.1","h":"14.71","c":"وَارْزُقُوهُمْ","d":"wa-ur'zuqūhum","e":"ْmُhwُqُzْrٱَw"},{"b":"11.2","h":"18.07","c":"فِيهَا","d":"fīhā","e":"āَhyِf"},{"b":"15.0","h":"19.66","c":"وَاكْسُوهُمْ","d":"wa-ik'sūhum","e":"ْmُhwُsْkٱَw"},{"b":"16.5","h":"21.76","c":"وَقُولُوا","d":"waqūlū","e":"۟āwُlwُqَw"},{"b":"17.6","h":"23.62","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"18.3","h":"24.64","c":"قَوْلًا","d":"qawlan","e":"āًlْwَq"},{"b":"18.9","h":"25.96","c":"مَعْرُوفًا","d":"maʿrūfan","e":"āًfwُrْʿعَّm"}],"a":{"g":"And do not give the weak-minded your property, which Allah has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 1</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: Do not hang jewels [jawāhir] around the necks of swine, for wisdom [ḥikma] is better than a jewel, and whoever dislikes it is worse than swine.

For they, in their ignorance [jahl] of its worth, have passed the night, so I will not spend the morning adorning cattle with it. If the Gentle [laṭīf] God, in His gentleness [luṭf], is gracious, and I encounter people fit for the sciences [‘ulūm] and the wisdom [ḥikam], I will disseminate what is beneficial and gain a legacy; otherwise, it remains stored with me and concealed. For whoever bestows knowledge [‘ilm] upon the ignorant [juhhāl] squanders it, and whoever withholds it from those who are deserving has indeed been unjust [ẓalama].</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"1.21","c":"وَابْتَلُوا","d":"wa-ib'talū","e":"۟āwُlَtْbٱَw"},{"b":"0.87","h":"2.57","c":"الْيَتَامَى","d":"l-yatāmā","e":"ٰàَmَٰtَyْlٱ"},{"b":"2.1","h":"4.45","c":"حَتَّى","d":"ḥattā","e":"ٰٓàَّtَḥ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"7.18","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"4.9","h":"8.25","c":"بَلَغُوا","d":"balaghū","e":"۟āwُغَlَb"},{"b":"5.6","h":"9.29","c":"النِّكَاحَ","d":"l-nikāḥa","e":"َḥāَkِّnlٱ"},{"b":"6.9","h":"11.54","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"ْnِiʾَf"},{"b":"7.6","h":"12.48","c":"ءَانَسْتُمْ","d":"ānastum","e":"mُtْsَnāَء"},{"b":"9.4","h":"15.16","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"10.2","h":"16.55","c":"رُشْدًا","d":"rush'dan","e":"āًdْhsُr"},{"b":"11.5","h":"18.39","c":"فَادْفَعُوا","d":"fa-id'faʿū","e":"۟āٓwُʿعَfْdٱَf"},{"b":"15.4","h":"21.14","c":"إِلَيْهِمْ","d":"ilayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"16.5","h":"22.95","c":"أَمْوَالَهُمْ","d":"amwālahum","e":"ْmُhَlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"18.4","h":"29.4","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"19.0","h":"30.35","c":"تَأْكُلُوهَا","d":"takulūhā","e":"ٓāَhwُlُkْaʾَt"},{"b":"21.7","h":"34.19","c":"إِسْرَافًا","d":"is'rāfan","e":"āًfāَrْsِiʾ"},{"b":"23.2","h":"36.33","c":"وَبِدَارًا","d":"wabidāran","e":"āًrāَdِbَw"},{"b":"25.1","h":"39.3","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"26.4","h":"40.92","c":"يَكْبَرُوا","d":"yakbarū","e":"۟āwُrَbْkَy"},{"b":"28.0","h":"44.4","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"29.3","h":"45.68","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"30.0","h":"46.86","c":"غَنِيًّا","d":"ghaniyyan","e":"āًّyِnَغ"},{"b":"31.6","h":"48.95","c":"فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ","d":"falyastaʿfif","e":"ْfِfْʿعَtْsَyْlَf"},{"b":"33.3","h":"52.21","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"34.4","h":"53.56","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"35.1","h":"54.69","c":"فَقِيرًا","d":"faqīran","e":"āًryِqَf"},{"b":"36.8","h":"57.04","c":"فَلْيَأْكُلْ","d":"falyakul","e":"ْlُkْaʾَyْlَf"},{"b":"38.1","h":"59.31","c":"بِالْمَعْرُوفِ","d":"bil-maʿrūfi","e":"ِfwُrْʿعَmْlٱِb"},{"b":"41.0","h":"64.9","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"41.9","h":"66.13","c":"دَفَعْتُمْ","d":"dafaʿtum","e":"ْmُtْʿعَfَd"},{"b":"43.1","h":"68.01","c":"إِلَيْهِمْ","d":"ilayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"44.1","h":"69.94","c":"أَمْوَالَهُمْ","d":"amwālahum","e":"ْmُhَlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"45.6","h":"72.48","c":"فَأَشْهِدُوا","d":"fa-ashhidū","e":"۟āwُdِhْhsَaʾَf"},{"b":"46.8","h":"74.63","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"48.3","h":"78.7","c":"وَكَفَى","d":"wakafā","e":"ٰàَfَkَw"},{"b":"49.2","h":"80.06","c":"بِاللَّهِ","d":"bil-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱِb"},{"b":"50.2","h":"81.97","c":"حَسِيبًا","d":"ḥasīban","e":"āًbyِsَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age.

Yes, whoever is overcome by a dominant, all-consuming state [hala] that leaves no room for anything else, and who possesses, with it, a wakefulness [yaqaza] and a penetrating, acute intelligence [dhaka'] by which he perceives the distant meanings [ma'ani] within the words—his spiritual passion [wajd] may be stirred by everything he hears. Like one for whom, upon hearing the words of the Almighty \"God instructs you concerning your children,\" the state [hala] of death arises—the death that necessitates the will—and that every person must inevitably leave behind his wealth and his children, and they are his two beloved things from the world [dunya], so he leaves one beloved for the other and abandons them both. Thus, fear [khawf] and anguish [jaza'] overcome him. Or he hears the mention of God in His words \"God instructs you concerning your children,\" and he is awestruck by the Name alone, oblivious to what precedes and follows it. Or the mercy [rahma] of God upon His servants and His compassion occur to him—that He Himself undertook the division of their inheritances, providing for them in their life and their death—so he says, \"If He looks after our children after our death, then we have no doubt that He looks after us.\" Then a state of hope [raja'] is stirred within him, and that bequeaths to him gladness [istibshar] and joy [surur]. Or it occurs to him from the words of the Almighty \"for the male the share of two females\" the preference [tafdil] of the male for being a man over the female, and that the virtue [fadl] in the Hereafter [akhira] is for men whom no commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God, and that whoever is distracted by other than God from God, he is from the females, not from the men, in truth [tahqiq]. So he fears that he may be veiled [hujiba] or delayed in the bliss [na'im] of the Hereafter as the female was delayed in the worldly [dunya] wealth. So the likes of this may stir spiritual passion [wajd]. But only for one in whom are two qualities: the first, an all-consuming, overwhelming, dominant state [hala]; and the second, a profound perception [tafattun] and a complete, intense wakefulness [yaqaza] for being alerted by proximate matters to distant meanings [ma'ani].</div></div></div>"}},"12":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.23","c":"وَلَكُمْ","d":"walakum","e":"ْmُkَlَw"},{"b":"0.78","h":"1.49","c":"نِصْفُ","d":"niṣ'fu","e":"ُfْṣِn"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.61","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.28","c":"تَرَكَ","d":"taraka","e":"َkَrَt"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.42","c":"أَزْوَاجُكُمْ","d":"azwājukum","e":"ْmُkُjgَٰwْzَaʾ"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.73","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"4.2","h":"7.16","c":"لَمْ","d":"lam","e":"ْmَّl"},{"b":"4.8","h":"8.03","c":"يَكُنْ","d":"yakun","e":"nُkَy"},{"b":"5.3","h":"9.02","c":"لَهُنَّ","d":"lahunna","e":"َّnُhَّl"},{"b":"6.9","h":"11.17","c":"وَلَدٌ","d":"waladun","e":"ٌdَlَw"},{"b":"7.9","h":"14.2","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"nِiʾَf"},{"b":"9.0","h":"15.5","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"9.7","h":"16.6","c":"لَهُنَّ","d":"lahunna","e":"َّnُhَl"},{"b":"11","h":"18.36","c":"وَلَدٌ","d":"waladun","e":"ٌdَlَw"},{"b":"12.","h":"20.01","c":"فَلَكُمُ","d":"falakumu","e":"ُmُkَlَf"},{"b":"13.2","h":"21.46","c":"الرُّبُعُ","d":"l-rubuʿu","e":"ُʿعُbُّrlٱ"},{"b":"14.1","h":"23.99","c":"مِمَّا","d":"mimmā","e":"āَّmِm"},{"b":"15.3","h":"24.68","c":"تَرَكْنَ","d":"tarakna","e":"َnْkَrَt"},{"b":"16.5","h":"28.72","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۢnِm"},{"b":"17.4","h":"29.74","c":"بَعْدِ","d":"baʿdi","e":"ِdْʿعَb"},{"b":"18.","h":"32.43","c":"وَصِيَّةٍ","d":"waṣiyyatin","e":"ٍẗَّyِṣَw"},{"b":"19.8","h":"34.31","c":"يُوصِينَ","d":"yūṣīna","e":"َnyِṣwُy"},{"b":"20.9","h":"36.83","c":"بِهَا","d":"bihā","e":"ٓāَhِb"},{"b":"21.1","h":"37.53","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"23.0","h":"43.18","c":"دَيْنٍ","d":"daynin","e":"ٍnْyَd"},{"b":"25.","h":"45.12","c":"وَلَهُنَّ","d":"walahunna","e":"َّnُhَlَw"},{"b":"26.","h":"47.58","c":"الرُّبُعُ","d":"l-rubuʿu","e":"ُʿعُbُّrlٱ"},{"b":"27.8","h":"48.27","c":"مِمَّا","d":"mimmā","e":"āَّmِm"},{"b":"28.9","h":"50.08","c":"تَرَكْتُمْ","d":"taraktum","e":"ْmُtْkَrَt"},{"b":"30.0","h":"50.39","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"30.2","h":"51.21","c":"لَمْ","d":"lam","e":"ْmَّl"},{"b":"30.8","h":"52.16","c":"يَكُنْ","d":"yakun","e":"nُkَy"},{"b":"31.3","h":"53.55","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَّl"},{"b":"32.2","h":"56.55","c":"وَلَدٌ","d":"waladun","e":"ٌdَlَw"},{"b":"33.3","h":"57.8","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"nِiʾَf"},{"b":"34.3","h":"58.94","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"35.0","h":"60.05","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"35.6","h":"61.83","c":"وَلَدٌ","d":"waladun","e":"ٌdَlَw"},{"b":"36.9","h":"63.88","c":"فَلَهُنَّ","d":"falahunna","e":"َّnُhَlَf"},{"b":"38.7","h":"66.33","c":"الثُّمُنُ","d":"l-thumunu","e":"ُnُmُّhtlٱ"},{"b":"39.5","h":"66.97","c":"مِمَّا","d":"mimmā","e":"āَّmِm"},{"b":"40.7","h":"70.34","c":"تَرَكْتُمْ","d":"taraktum","e":"mُtْkَrَt"},{"b":"42.3","h":"71.44","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۢnِّm"},{"b":"43.","h":"72.43","c":"بَعْدِ","d":"baʿdi","e":"ِdْʿعَb"},{"b":"44.0","h":"75.12","c":"وَصِيَّةٍ","d":"waṣiyyatin","e":"ٍẗَّyِṣَw"},{"b":"45.9","h":"77.13","c":"تُوصُونَ","d":"tūṣūna","e":"َnwُṣwُt"},{"b":"47.0","h":"79.41","c":"بِهَا","d":"bihā","e":"ٓāَhِb"},{"b":"48.8","h":"80.09","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"49.2","h":"85","c":"دَيْنٍ","d":"daynin","e":"ٍnْyَd"},{"b":"51.3","h":"86.3","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"52.5","h":"87.47","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"53.1","h":"89.2","c":"رَجُلٌ","d":"rajulun","e":"ٌlُjgَr"},{"b":"54.5","h":"90.49","c":"يُورَثُ","d":"yūrathu","e":"ُhtَrwُy"},{"b":"55.4","h":"92.53","c":"كَلَالَةً","d":"kalālatan","e":"ًẗَlَٰlَk"},{"b":"56.","h":"93.21","c":"أَوِ","d":"awi","e":"ِwَaʾ"},{"b":"57.2","h":"95.33","c":"امْرَأَةٌ","d":"im'ra-atun","e":"ٌẗَaʾَrْmٱ"},{"b":"58.4","h":"97.54","c":"وَلَهُ","d":"walahu","e":"ٓۥُhَlَw"},{"b":"60.5","h":"98.56","c":"أَخٌ","d":"akhun","e":"ٌhkَaʾ"},{"b":"61.2","h":"99.21","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"61.6","h":"101.02","c":"أُخْتٌ","d":"ukh'tun","e":"ٌtْhkُaʾ"},{"b":"62.8","h":"102.89","c":"فَلِكُلِّ","d":"falikulli","e":"ِّlُkِlَf"},{"b":"63.9","h":"104.88","c":"وَاحِدٍ","d":"wāḥidin","e":"ٍdِḥَٰw"},{"b":"67.9","h":"106.24","c":"مِنْهُمَا","d":"min'humā","e":"āَmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"68.7","h":"110.3","c":"السُّدُسُ","d":"l-sudusu","e":"ُsُdُّslٱ"},{"b":"69.6","h":"111.51","c":"فَإِنْ","d":"fa-in","e":"nِiʾَf"},{"b":"71.2","h":"112.69","c":"كَانُوا","d":"kānū","e":"۟āٓwُnāَk"},{"b":"73.2","h":"116.53","c":"أَكْثَرَ","d":"akthara","e":"َrَhtْkَaʾ"},{"b":"74.0","h":"117.89","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"74.9","h":"118.87","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"75.8","h":"121.73","c":"فَهُمْ","d":"fahum","e":"ْmُhَf"},{"b":"76.","h":"122.06","c":"شُرَكَاءُ","d":"shurakāu","e":"ُءٓāَkَrُhs"},{"b":"78.6","h":"125.15","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"78.9","h":"126.14","c":"الثُّلُثِ","d":"l-thuluthi","e":"ِhtُlُّhtlٱ"},{"b":"80.2","h":"127.16","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۢnِm"},{"b":"81.3","h":"129.69","c":"بَعْدِ","d":"baʿdi","e":"ِdْʿعَb"},{"b":"81.9","h":"131.31","c":"وَصِيَّةٍ","d":"waṣiyyatin","e":"ٍẗَّyِṣَw"},{"b":"83.",

For indeed Allah the Exalted has said: **\"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him [shirk], but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.\"** And He the Exalted said: **\"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy [rahma] of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'\"** And He the Exalted said: **\"And whoever does an evil or wrongs himself then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\"**\n\nAnd we seek forgiveness [istighfar] from Allah the Exalted for every slip of the foot or transgression of the pen in this book of ours and in all our books. And we seek His forgiveness for our words which our actions do not match. And we seek His forgiveness for what we claimed and displayed of knowledge [ilm] and insight [basira] into the religion of Allah the Exalted while being deficient in it. And we seek His forgiveness for every knowledge [ilm] and deed we intended for His Noble Countenance, then something else became mixed with it. And we seek His forgiveness for every promise we made to ourselves, then fell short in fulfilling. And we seek His forgiveness for every blessing [ni'ma] He bestowed upon us, then we employed it in disobedience to Him. And we seek His forgiveness for every explicit and implicit mention of the deficiency of a deficient one or the shortcoming of one who fell short, with which we were characterized. And we seek His forgiveness for every fleeting thought that called us to affectation and pretense, to adorn ourselves before people in a book we penned, or speech we composed, or knowledge [ilm] we imparted or received.\n\nAnd we hope, after seeking forgiveness for all of that—for us and for whoever reads this book of ours or writes it or hears it—that we are honored with forgiveness [maghfira] and mercy [rahma] and pardon for all sins, outward and inward. For generosity is immense, mercy [rahma] is vast, and bounty upon all kinds of creation is overflowing. And we are a creation from the creation of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic; we have no means to Him except His favor and His generosity. For indeed the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: **(Indeed, Allah the Exalted has one hundred mercies [rahma]; He sent down from them a single mercy [rahma] between the jinn, mankind, birds, beasts, and creeping things. Through it they show affection and through it they show mercy to one another. And He withheld ninety-nine mercies [rahma] by which He will show mercy to His servants on the Day of Resurrection.)** And it is narrated that **(When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah the Exalted will bring out a book from beneath the Throne, in it is: 'Indeed My mercy [rahma] has preceded My wrath, and I am the Most Merciful of the merciful.' Then He will bring out of the Fire the like of the people of Paradise.)** And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: **(Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will appear to us on the Day of Resurrection smiling, and He will say: 'Receive glad tidings, O community of Muslims, for there is not one of you except that I have placed in the Fire in his place a Jew or a Christian.')**</div></div></div>"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.65","c":"أَلَمْ","d":"alam","e":"ْmَlَaʾ"},{"b":"0.67","h":"1.11","c":"تَرَ","d":"tara","e":"َrَt"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.62","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.99","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.14","c":"يُزَكُّونَ","d":"yuzakkūna","e":"َnwُّkَzُy"},{"b":"3.7","h":"4.66","c":"أَنْفُسَهُمْ","d":"anfusahum","e":"mُhَsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"5.9","h":"8.4","c":"بَلِ","d":"bali","e":"ِlَb"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.81","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"7.1","h":"9.73","c":"يُزَكِّي","d":"yuzakkī","e":"àِّkَzُy"},{"b":"8.1","h":"10.97","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"9.1","h":"12.19","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"11.1","h":"14.04","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"11.7","h":"14.71","c":"يُظْلَمُونَ","d":"yuẓ'lamūna","e":"َnwُmَlْẓُy"},{"b":"12.9","h":"16.15","c":"فَتِيلًا","d":"fatīlan","e":"āًlyِtَf"}],"a":{"g":"Have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure?

And by this interpretation [ta'wil], if one were asked about a description of blame [wasf dham], it would not be proper to make an exception.</div></div></div>"}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.74","c":"انْظُرْ","d":"unẓur","e":"ْrُẓnٱ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.89","c":"كَيْفَ","d":"kayfa","e":"َfْyَk"},{"b":"2","h":"2.75","c":"يَفْتَرُونَ","d":"yaftarūna","e":"َnwُrَtْfَy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.99","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.58","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"5.52","c":"الْكَذِبَ","d":"l-kadhiba","e":"َbِhdَkْlٱ"},{"b":"5.3","h":"6.5","c":"وَكَفَى","d":"wakafā","e":"ٰàَfَkَw"},{"b":"6.3","h":"7.52","c":"بِهِ","d":"bihi","e":"ٓۦِhِb"},{"b":"7.9","h":"9.55","c":"إِثْمًا","d":"ith'man","e":"āًmْhtِiʾ"},{"b":"8.4","h":"10.33","c":"مُبِينًا","d":"mubīnan","e":"āًnyِbُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Look how they invent about Allah untruth, and sufficient is that as a manifest sin."}},"51":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.55","c":"أَلَمْ","d":"alam","e":"ْmَlَaʾ"},{"b":"0.55","h":"0.99","c":"تَرَ","d":"tara","e":"َrَt"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.54","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.91","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.04","c":"أُوتُوا","d":"ūtū","e":"۟āwُtwُaʾ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"3.96","c":"نَصِيبًا","d":"naṣīban","e":"āًbyِṣَn"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.04","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"4.9","h":"6.04","c":"الْكِتَابِ","d":"l-kitābi","e":"ِbَٰtِkْlٱ"},{"b":"5.9","h":"7.18","c":"يُؤْمِنُونَ","d":"yu'minūna","e":"َnwُnِmْwʾُy"},{"b":"7.2","h":"8.55","c":"بِالْجِبْتِ","d":"bil-jib'ti","e":"ِtْbِjgْlٱِb"},{"b":"8.2","h":"9.68","c":"وَالطَّاغُوتِ","d":"wal-ṭāghūti","e":"ِtwُغَّٰṭlٱَw"},{"b":"9.7","h":"11.39","c":"وَيَقُولُونَ","d":"wayaqūlūna","e":"َnwُlwُqَyَw"},{"b":"14.0","h":"12.95","c":"لِلَّذِينَ","d":"lilladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlِl"},{"b":"15.1","h":"14.22","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"۟āwُrَfَk"},{"b":"16.0","h":"15.39","c":"هَؤُلَاءِ","d":"hāulāi","e":"ِءٓāَlُwʾَٰٓh"},{"b":"19.6","h":"18.8","c":"أَهْدَى","d":"ahdā","e":"ٰàَdْhَaʾ"},{"b":"20.4","h":"19.76","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"20.7","h":"20.18","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"21.8","h":"21.26","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"22.","h":"22.56","c":"سَبِيلًا","d":"sabīlan","e":"āًlyِbَs"}],"a":{"g":"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, who believe in superstition and false objects of worship and say about the disbelievers, \"These are better guided than the believers as to the way\"?"}},"52":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.25","c":"أُولَئِكَ","d":"ulāika","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.4","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"3.4","h":"3.59","c":"لَعَنَهُمُ","d":"laʿanahumu","e":"ُmُhَnَʿعَl"},{"b":"4.4","h":"4.76","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"6.9","h":"7.85","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"8.5","h":"9.04","c":"يَلْعَنِ","d":"yalʿani","e":"ِnَʿعْlَy"},{"b":"8.9","h":"9.75","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.6","h":"10.59","c":"فَلَنْ","d":"falan","e":"nَlَf"},{"b":"10.9","h":"11.81","c":"تَجِدَ","d":"tajida","e":"َdِjgَt"},{"b":"11.6","h":"12.61","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"12.2","h":"13.05","c":"نَصِيرًا","d":"naṣīran","e":"āًryِṣَn"}],"a":{"g":"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; and he whom Allah curses - never will you find for him a helper."}},"53":{"w":[{"b":"0.09","h":"0.65","c":"أَمْ","d":"am","e":"ْmَaʾ"},{"b":"0.42","h":"1.02","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"0.96","h":"1.61","c":"نَصِيبٌ","d":"naṣībun","e":"ٌbyِṣَn"},{"b":"2.6","h":"3.42","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.77","c":"الْمُلْكِ","d":"l-mul'ki","e":"ِkْlُmْlٱ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.65","c":"فَإِذًا","d":"fa-idhan","e":"āًhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.39","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَّl"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.09","c":"يُؤْتُونَ","d":"yu'tūna","e":"َnwُtْwʾُy"},{"b":"5.8","h":"7.36","c":"النَّاسَ","d":"l-nāsa","e":"َsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"7.1","h":"8.69","c":"نَقِيرًا","d":"naqīran","e":"āًryِqَn"}],"a":{"g":"Or have they a share of dominion?

So supplication is a cause [sabab] for repelling affliction and for attracting mercy [rahma], just as the shield is a cause for repelling the arrow, and water is a cause for the emergence of plants from the earth. And just as the shield pushes against the arrow and they repel each other, so too do supplication and affliction contend with one another. And it is not a condition of affirming the decree [qada'] of God, the Exalted, that one should not carry a weapon, for He, the Exalted, has said: \"Take your precaution.\" Nor is it that one should not water the earth after scattering the seed, saying, \"If the decree [qada'] preceded it with growth, the seed will grow, and if it did not precede it, it will not grow.\" Rather, the linking of causes [asbab] to their effects [musabbabat] is the First Decree [al-qada' al-awwal], which is like the blinking of an eye, or even closer.

So the definition of envy is: disliking the blessing and desiring its removal from the one upon whom it was bestowed.\n\nAs for the first, it is forbidden in every circumstance, except for a blessing obtained by a wicked person or an unbeliever, which he uses to stir up strife [fitnah], corrupt relationships, and harm the truth. Then your dislike of it and your desire for its removal does not harm you, for you do not desire its removal insofar as it is a blessing, but rather insofar as it is an instrument of corruption. And if you were secure from his corruption, his blessing would not grieve you.\n\nThe prohibition of envy is indicated by the narrations we have transmitted, and by the fact that this dislike is displeasure with God's decree in preferring some of His servants over others. There is no excuse or concession for that. And what sin is greater than your dislike of a Muslim's comfort when no harm from it reaches you?\n\nThe Qur'an alludes to this in His saying: \"If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if evil strikes you, they rejoice at it.\" This rejoicing is malicious glee [shamatah], and envy and malicious glee are concomitant.\n\nAnd the Almighty said: \"Many of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after your belief, out of envy from themselves.\" So the Almighty informed that their love for the removal of the blessing of faith is envy.\n\nAnd the Almighty said: \"They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would be equal.\"\n\nAnd God the Almighty mentioned the envy of the brothers of Joseph, peace be upon him, and expressed what was in their hearts with His saying: \"When they said, 'Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you.'\" So when they disliked their father's love for him and it distressed them, and they desired its removal from him, they hid him from him.\n\nAnd He said: \"And they find within themselves no discomfort from what they were given\" — meaning their breasts are not constricted by it and they are not grieved — so He praised them for the absence of envy.\n\nAnd He said, in the context of reproach: \"Or do they envy people for what God has given them of His bounty?\"\n\nAnd He said: \"Mankind was one community\" up to His saying: \"Except those to whom it was given, after clear proofs had come to them, out of mutual envy.\" It is said in the interpretation: envy.\n\nAnd He said: \"And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves.\" So God sent down knowledge to unite them and bring them together in obedience to Him, and commanded them to unite through knowledge, but they envied one another and differed when each one of them desired to be alone with leadership and acceptance of speech, so they refuted one another.\n\nIbn Abbas said: The Jews, before the Prophet ﷺ was sent, when they fought a people, would say: \"We ask you by the Prophet you promised to send and by the Book you will reveal, that you grant us victory.\" And they would be granted victory. So when the Prophet ﷺ came from the descendants of Ishmael, peace be upon him, they recognized him and disbelieved in him after recognizing him. So the Almighty said: \"And they used to entreat, before, for victory over those who disbelieved, but when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it\" up to His saying: \"That they would disbelieve in what God has revealed, out of envy\" — meaning envy.\n\nThis is the ruling of envy concerning its prohibition.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book5a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Know that there is no envy [hasad] except concerning a blessing [ni'mah].

As for them in themselves, there is no basis for contentment with them in any state.</div></div></div>"}},"98":{"w":[{"b":"0.09","h":"0.95","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.65","h":"1.46","c":"الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ","d":"l-mus'taḍʿafīna","e":"َnyِfَʿعْḍَtْsُmْlٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.69","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.12","c":"الرِّجَالِ","d":"l-rijāli","e":"ِlāَjgِّrlٱ"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.31","c":"وَالنِّسَاءِ","d":"wal-nisāi","e":"ِءٓāَsِّnlٱَw"},{"b":"6.9","h":"8.35","c":"وَالْوِلْدَانِ","d":"wal-wil'dāni","e":"ِnَٰdْlِwْlٱَw"},{"b":"8.3","h":"10.04","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"8.6","h":"10.53","c":"يَسْتَطِيعُونَ","d":"yastaṭīʿūna","e":"َnwُʿعyِṭَtْsَy"},{"b":"10.2","h":"12.42","c":"حِيلَةً","d":"ḥīlatan","e":"ًẗَlyِḥ"},{"b":"14.","h":"14.22","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"15.7","h":"14.96","c":"يَهْتَدُونَ","d":"yahtadūna","e":"َnwُdَtْhَy"},{"b":"16.9","h":"16.34","c":"سَبِيلًا","d":"sabīlan","e":"āًlyِbَs"}],"a":{"g":"Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way -"}},"99":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0","c":"فَأُولَئِكَ","d":"fa-ulāika","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾَf"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.54","c":"عَسَى","d":"ʿasā","e":"àَsَʿع"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.22","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.22","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.24","c":"يَعْفُوَ","d":"yaʿfuwa","e":"َwُfْʿعَy"},{"b":"5.3","h":"7.08","c":"عَنْهُمْ","d":"ʿanhum","e":"ْmُhْnَʿع"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.75","c":"وَكَانَ","d":"wakāna","e":"َnāَkَw"},{"b":"7.1","h":"10.37","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"7.9","h":"11.41","c":"عَفُوًّا","d":"ʿafuwwan","e":"āًّwُfَʿع"},{"b":"9.0","h":"12.66","c":"غَفُورًا","d":"ghafūran","e":"āًrwُfَغ"}],"a":{"g":"For those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah is ever Pardoning and Forgiving."}},"100":{"w":[{"b":"0.95","h":"0.9","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.12","c":"يُهَاجِرْ","d":"yuhājir","e":"ْrِjgāَhُy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.21","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"3.6","h":"3.71","c":"سَبِيلِ","d":"sabīli","e":"ِlyِbَs"},{"b":"4.5","h":"4.81","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"5.2","h":"5.75","c":"يَجِدْ","d":"yajid","e":"ْdِjgَy"},{"b":"5.9","h":"6.43","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"6.1","h":"6.75","c":"الْأَرْضِ","d":"l-arḍi","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"6.9","h":"7.71","c":"مُرَاغَمًا","d":"murāghaman","e":"āًmَغَٰrُm"},{"b":"8.4","h":"9.73","c":"كَثِيرًا","d":"kathīran","e":"āًryِhtَk"},{"b":"9.3","h":"10.91","c":"وَسَعَةً","d":"wasaʿatan","e":"ًẗَʿعَsَw"},{"b":"11.3","h":"14.75","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"12.2","h":"15.89","c":"يَخْرُجْ","d":"yakhruj","e":"ْjgُrْhkَy"},{"b":"13.2","h":"16.8","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۢnِm"},{"b":"13.9","h":"17.78","c":"بَيْتِهِ","d":"baytihi","e":"ۦِhِtْyَb"},{"b":"15.0","h":"19.05","c":"مُهَاجِرًا","d":"muhājiran","e":"āًrِjgāَhُm"},{"b":"16.","h":"20.56","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"16.6","h":"21.03","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"17.4","h":"22.13","c":"وَرَسُولِهِ","d":"warasūlihi","e":"ۦِhِlwُsَrَw"},{"b":"18.8","h":"23.85","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"19.9","h":"25.05","c":"يُدْرِكْهُ","d":"yud'rik'hu","e":"ُhْkِrْdُy"},{"b":"20.9","h":"26.34","c":"الْمَوْتُ","d":"l-mawtu","e":"ُtْwَmْlٱ"},{"b":"26.4","h":"27.3","c":"فَقَدْ","d":"faqad","e":"ْdَqَf"},{"b":"26.9","h":"28.03","c":"وَقَعَ","d":"waqaʿa","e":"َʿعَqَw"},{"b":"27.7","h":"28.9","c":"أَجْرُهُ","d":"ajruhu","e":"ۥُhُrْjgَaʾ"},{"b":"28.6","h":"30.13","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"29.3","h":"30.72","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"31.1","h":"35.05","c":"وَكَانَ","d":"wakāna","e":"َnāَkَw"},{"b":"31.9","h":"35.68","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"32.8","h":"36.85","c":"غَفُورًا","d":"ghafūran","e":"āًrwُfَغ"},{"b":"33.","h":"37.89","c":"رَحِيمًا","d":"raḥīman","e":"āًmyِḥَّr"}],"a":{"g":"And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many [alternative] locations and abundance.

So how [can it be otherwise] when He has commanded caution from the enemy, just as He commanded caution from the disbelievers, saying, the Most High: \"And let them take their precaution and their arms.\" So if it is incumbent upon you, by the command of Allah, to be cautious of the disbelieving enemy whom you see, then it is more incumbent upon you to be cautious of an enemy who sees you and you do not see him. Therefore, being occupied with Allah [al-istighlal bi-Allah] does not mean turning away from that which Allah has warned against, and by this, the doctrine of the second group is invalidated in their assumption that this detracts from trust [al-tawakkul]. For taking up the shield and weapon, gathering the troops, and digging the trench did not detract from the trust [tawakkul] of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, so how could fearing that which Allah has warned against and being cautious of that which He has commanded caution from detract from trust [al-tawakkul]? And We have mentioned in the Book of Trust [Kitab al-Tawakkul] what clarifies the error of those who claim that the meaning of trust [al-tawakkul] is to completely abandon means [al-asbab]. And His saying, the Most High: \"And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war\" does not contradict compliance with trust [al-tawakkul], as long as the heart [al-qalb] believes that the One who harms and benefits, the One who gives life and causes death, is Allah, the Most High. Likewise, one is cautious of Satan [al-Shaytan] while believing that the One who guides and leads astray is Allah, and sees the means [al-asbab] as subjugated intermediaries—as We have mentioned in the Book of Trust [Kitab al-Tawakkul].</div></div></div>"}},"103":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.45","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"0.88","h":"1.28","c":"قَضَيْتُمُ","d":"qaḍaytumu","e":"ُmُtْyَḍَq"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.61","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.07","c":"فَاذْكُرُوا","d":"fa-udh'kurū","e":"۟āwُrُkْhdٱَf"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.23","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.24","c":"قِيَامًا","d":"qiyāman","e":"āًmَٰyِq"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.48","c":"وَقُعُودًا","d":"waquʿūdan","e":"āًdwُʿعُqَw"},{"b":"7.2","h":"9.58","c":"وَعَلَى","d":"waʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿعَw"},{"b":"8.6","h":"11.32","c":"جُنُوبِكُمْ","d":"junūbikum","e":"ْmُkِbwُnُjg"},{"b":"10.","h":"14.95","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"10.","h":"15.48","c":"اطْمَأْنَنْتُمْ","d":"iṭ'manantum","e":"ْmُtnَnْaʾَmْṭٱ"},{"b":"13.0","h":"17.99","c":"فَأَقِيمُوا","d":"fa-aqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqَaʾَf"},{"b":"14.1","h":"19.48","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"15.1","h":"23.05","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"18.","h":"24.27","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"19.","h":"25.61","c":"كَانَتْ","d":"kānat","e":"ْtَnāَk"},{"b":"20.1","h":"26.81","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"20.5","h":"27.33","c":"الْمُؤْمِنِينَ","d":"l-mu'minīna","e":"َnyِnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"21.9","h":"29.23","c":"كِتَابًا","d":"kitāban","e":"āًbَٰtِk"},{"b":"22.8","h":"30.29","c":"مَوْقُوتًا","d":"mawqūtan","e":"āًtwُqْwَّm"}],"a":{"g":"And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides.

And we are a creation [khalq] from among the creations of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic; we have no means to Him except His favor and His generosity.</div></div></div>"}},"111":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.17","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.74","c":"يَكْسِبْ","d":"yaksib","e":"ْbِsْkَy"},{"b":"2.2","h":"2.65","c":"إِثْمًا","d":"ith'man","e":"āًmْhtِiʾ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.43","c":"فَإِنَّمَا","d":"fa-innamā","e":"āَmَّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"5.3","h":"6.82","c":"يَكْسِبُهُ","d":"yaksibuhu","e":"ۥُhُbِsْkَy"},{"b":"6.4","h":"8.71","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"7.2","h":"9.81","c":"نَفْسِهِ","d":"nafsihi","e":"ۦِhِsْfَn"},{"b":"8.2","h":"12.3","c":"وَكَانَ","d":"wakāna","e":"َnāَkَw"},{"b":"9.1","h":"13.44","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.9","h":"14.79","c":"عَلِيمًا","d":"ʿalīman","e":"āًmyِlَʿع"},{"b":"10.9","h":"16.41","c":"حَكِيمًا","d":"ḥakīman","e":"āًmyِkَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And whoever commits a sin only earns it against himself.

And that does not remove the action from being truth [ḥaqq], just as one who repels the wrongdoer [ẓālim] from individual Muslims yet neglects his own father who is wronged among them—natural dispositions recoil from him, yet his repelling of the wrongdoer from the Muslim does not cease to be truth. From this it emerges that the sinner is not subject to commanding right [ḥisba] through admonition [wa'ẓ] upon one who knows his sinfulness, because he will not take admonition. And since that is not incumbent upon him, and it is known that it leads to prolonging the tongue in disparaging him through rebuke, we say: he does not have that right either. Thus, the discussion returns to the fact that one of the two types of commanding right—which is admonition—has been invalidated by sinfulness [fisq], and uprightness [ʿadāla] has been stipulated for it. As for coercive commanding right [ḥisba qahriyya], uprightness is not stipulated in it. So there is no blame upon the sinner in spilling wines, breaking instruments of diversion, and other such things if he is able. And this is the utmost fairness and unveiling in the matter.\n\nAs for the verses they used as proof, it is a rebuke of them for their abandoning of the recognized good [maʿrūf], not for their commanding it. But their commanding it indicates the strength of their knowledge [ʿilm], and the punishment of the knower [ʿālim] is more severe because he has no excuse with the strength of his knowledge. And His saying, exalted is He: \"Why do you say what you do not do?\"—the intent is the false promise. And His saying, mighty and majestic is He: \"And you forget yourselves\"—it is a rebuke for their forgetting themselves, not for their commanding others. But the mention of commanding others is used as evidence for their knowledge and to confirm the proof against them. And His saying: \"O son of Maryam, admonish yourself...\"—the ḥadīth is concerning commanding right through admonition, and we have conceded that the admonition of the sinner is of null benefit with one who knows his sinfulness. Then His saying: \"So be ashamed before Me\"—it does not indicate the prohibition of admonishing others. Rather, its meaning is: be ashamed before Me, so do not abandon the more important and occupy yourself with the less important, just as it is said: 'Preserve your father, then your neighbor; otherwise, be ashamed.'\n\nIf it is said: 'Then let it be permissible for the protected unbeliever [kāfir dhimmī] to command right upon the Muslim if he sees him fornicating, because his saying \"Do not fornicate\" is truth in itself, so it is impossible for it to be forbidden for him; rather, it should be permissible or obligatory.' We say: The unbeliever, if he prevents the Muslim by his action, that is an act of domination [tasalluṭ] over him, so he is prevented because it is domination, and \"Allah has not given the unbelievers over the believers any way.\" As for his mere saying \"Do not fornicate,\" it is not forbidden for him inasmuch as it is a prohibition of fornication, but inasmuch as it is a display of the authority [dāla] of passing judgment [iḥtikām] upon the Muslim, and in it is humiliation [idhlāl] for the one judged upon. And the sinner deserves humiliation, but not from the unbeliever who is more deserving of lowliness than he. This is the aspect of our preventing him from commanding right. Otherwise, we do not say that the unbeliever is punished because of his saying \"Do not fornicate\" inasmuch as he prohibited; rather, we say that if he does not say \"Do not fornicate,\" he is punished for it—if we consider addressing the unbeliever with the branches of the religion, and there is consideration in that which we have thoroughly covered in the legal discussions, and it is not suitable for our purpose now.\n\nThe fourth condition: that he be authorized from the side of the Imam and the ruler. Some have stipulated this condition and have not affirmed commanding right for the individuals among the subjects [raʿiyya]. And this stipulation is invalid, for the verses and reports we have cited indicate that whoever sees a wrong [munkar] and remains silent upon it has disobeyed, since forbidding it is obligatory wherever he sees it and however he sees it, in a general sense. So specifying it with the condition of delegation [tafwīḍ] from the Imam is arbitrary, having no basis. And it is astonishing that the Rāfiḍah increased upon this, saying: 'Commanding right is not permissible unless the infallible Imam emerges—and he is the rightful Imam according to them.' These are of the lowest rank to even be spoken to. Rather, the answer to them is to say to them: 'When you come to the judiciary seeking your rights in your blood and your wealth, our aiding you is commanding right, and extracting your rights from the hands of those who wronged you is forbidding wrong, and your seeking your right is from the totality of the recognized good. And is this not the time for forbidding wrong and seeking rights, because the rightful Imam has not yet emerged?'\n\nIf it is said: 'In commanding right is the affirmation of sovereignty [sulṭāna] and authority [wilāya] and passing judgment upon the one judged. Therefore, it was not affirmed for the unbeliever over the Muslim, even though it is truth in itself. So it should not be affirmed for individuals among the subjects except by delegation from the ruler and the one in authority.' We say: As for the unbeliever, he is prevented because of what it contains of domination and the honor of passing judgment, and the unbeliever is lowly, so he does not deserve to attain the honor of judging over the Muslim. As for the individuals among the Muslims, they deserve this honor by religion [dīn] and knowledge [maʿrifa]. And what it contains of the honor of sovereignty and passing judgment does not necessitate delegation, like the honor of teaching and making known, for there is no disagreement that making known the prohibition and obligation to one who is ignorant and proceeding towards wrong out of ignorance...</div></div></div>"}},"142":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"1.65","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3","c":"الْمُنَافِقِينَ","d":"l-munāfiqīna","e":"َnyِqِfَٰnُmْlٱ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"5.62","c":"يُخَادِعُونَ","d":"yukhādiʿūna","e":"َnwُʿعِdَٰhkُy"},{"b":"4.5","h":"7.95","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"5.3","h":"9.42","c":"وَهُوَ","d":"wahuwa","e":"َwُhَw"},{"b":"5.9","h":"10.41","c":"خَادِعُهُمْ","d":"khādiʿuhum","e":"ْmُhُʿعِdَٰhk"},{"b":"7.2","h":"12.69","c":"وَإِذَا","d":"wa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَw"},{"b":"8.0","h":"13.98","c":"قَامُوا","d":"qāmū","e":"۟āٓwُmāَq"},{"b":"9.8","h":"16.27","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"10.2","h":"16.83","c":"الصَّلَوةِ","d":"l-ṣalati","e":"ِẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"11.3","h":"18.59","c":"قَامُوا","d":"qāmū","e":"۟āwُmāَq"},{"b":"12.1","h":"20.14","c":"كُسَالَى","d":"kusālā","e":"ٰàَlāَsُk"},{"b":"15.6","h":"21.95","c":"يُرَاءُونَ","d":"yurāūna","e":"َnwُءٓāَrُy"},{"b":"18.5","h":"25.09","c":"النَّاسَ","d":"l-nāsa","e":"َsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"20.1","h":"46.7","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"20.8","h":"47.84","c":"يَذْكُرُونَ","d":"yadhkurūna","e":"َnwُrُkْhdَy"},{"b":"22.0","h":"49.96","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"22.8","h":"51.31","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"23.7","h":"52.82","c":"قَلِيلًا","d":"qalīlan","e":"āًlyِlَq"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them.
