And whenever some of the sun is uncovered, it has become customary to place a basin of water so that the sun may be seen in it and it becomes possible to look at it, so the water becomes a medium that slightly reduces the light of the sun until it can be endured to look at. Likewise, actions are a medium through which we witness the attributes of the Actor, and we are not dazzled by the lights of the Essence after we have distanced ourselves from it through the medium of actions. This is the secret of His saying, peace be upon him: 'Reflect upon the creation of Allah and do not reflect upon the Essence of Allah, Exalted.' Explanation of the manner of reflecting upon the creation of Allah, Exalted. Know that everything in existence other than Allah, Exalted, is the action and creation of Allah, and every atom of the atoms, whether substance, accident, attribute, or described thing, contains wonders and marvels through which the wisdom, power, majesty, and greatness of Allah appear. Enumerating that is not possible, for if the sea were ink for that, the sea would be exhausted before a tenth of its tenth is exhausted. But we point to a summary of it so that it may serve as an example for what is beyond it. So we say: The created existents are divided into that whose origin is not known, so we cannot reflect upon it, and how many existents are there that we do not know, as Allah, Exalted, said: 'And He creates what you do not know. Glory be to Him who created all pairs from what the earth grows and from themselves and from what they do not know.' And He said: 'And We will develop you in what you do not know.' And into that whose origin and summary is known but whose details are not known, so we can reflect upon its details. And it is divided into what we perceive by the sense of sight and into what we do not perceive by sight. As for what we do not perceive by sight, such as the angels, jinn, devils, the Throne (Al-'Arsh), the Footstool (Al-Kursi), and other than that, the field of thought in these things is narrow and obscure, so let us turn to what is closer to comprehension, which is what is perceived by the sense of sight, and that is the seven heavens and the earth and what is between them. So the heavens are observed with their stars, sun, moon, movement, and rotation in their rising and setting; and the earth is observed with what is in it of its mountains, minerals, rivers, seas, animals, and plants; and what is between the sky and the earth, which is the atmosphere, is perceived with its clouds, rains, snows, thunder, lightning, thunderbolts, meteors, and stormy winds. These are the observable genera from the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and every genus of them divides into species, and every species divides into categories, and every category branches into varieties, and there is no end to the branching and division of that in the differences of its attributes, forms, and apparent and hidden meanings, and all of that is a field for thought. So not an atom moves in the heavens...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ووجود الأشياء كلها نور من أنوار ذاته تعالى وتقدس إذ قوام وجود الأشياء بذاته القيوم بنفسه كما أن قوام نور الأجسام بنور الشمس المضيئة بنفسها ومهما انكشف بعض الشمس فقد جرت العادة بأن يوضع طشت ماء حتى ترى الشمس فيه ويمكن النظر إليها فيكون الماء واسطة يغض قليلا من نور الشمس حتى يطاق النظر إليها فكذلك الأفعال واسطة نشاهد فيها صفات الفاعل ولا نبهر بأنوار الذات بعد أن تباعدنا عنها بواسطة الأفعال فهذا سر قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم تفكروا في خلق الله ولا تتفكروا في ذات الله تعالى. بيان كيفية التفكر في خلق الله تعالى اعلم أن كل ما في الوجود مما سوى الله تعالى فهو فعل الله وخلقه وكل ذرة من الذرات من جوهر وعرض وصفة وموصوف فيها عجائب وغرائب تظهر بها حكمة الله وقدرته وجلاله وعظمته وإحصاء ذلك غير ممكن لأنه لو كان البحر مدادا لذلك لنفد البحر قبل أن ينفد عشر عشيره ولكنا نشير إلى جمل منه ليكون ذلك كالمثال لماعداه فنقول الموجودات المخلوقة منقسمة الى مالا يعرف أصلها فلا يمكننا التفكر فيها وكم من الموجودات التى لا نعلمها كما قال الله تعالى ويخلق ما لا تعلمون سبحان الذي خلق الأزواج كلها مما تنبت الأرض ومن أنفسهم ومما لا يعلمون وقال وننشئكم فيما لا تعلمون وإلى ما يعرف أصلها وجملتها ولا يعرف تفصيلها فيمكننا أن نتفكر في تفصيلها وهي منقسمة إلى ما أدركناه بحس البصر وإلى ما لا ندركه بالبصر أما الذي لا ندركه بالبصر فكالملائكة والجن والشياطين والعرش والكرسي وغير ذلك ومجال الفكر في هذه الأشياء مما يضيق ويغمض فلنعدل إلى الأقرب إلى الأفهام وهي المدركات بحس البصر وذلك هو السموات السبع والأرض وما بينهما فالسموات مشاهدة بكواكبها وشمسها وقمرها وحركتها ودورانها في طلوعها وغروبها والأرض مشاهدة بما فيها من جبالها ومعادنها وأنهارها وبحارها وحيوانها ونباتها وما بين السماء والأرض وهو الجو مدرك بغيومها وأمطارها وثلوجها ورعدها وبرقها وصواعقها وشهبها وعواصف رياحها فهذه هي الأجناس المشاهدة من السموات والأرض وما بينهما وكل جنس منها ينقسم إلى أنواع وكل نوع ينقسم إلى أقسام ويتشعب كل قسم إلى أصناف ولا نهاية لانشعاب ذلك وانقسامه في اختلاف صفاته وهيآته ومعانيه الظاهرة والباطنة وجميع ذلك مجال الفكر فلا تتحرك ذرة في السمو</div></div></div>"}},"9":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.31","c":"وَعَلَى","d":"waʿalā","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"0.69","h":"1.16","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ُdْṣَq"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.51","c":"قَصْدُ","d":"qaṣdu","e":"ِlyِbَّslٱ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.58","c":"السَّبِيلِ","d":"l-sabīli","e":"āَhْnِmَw"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.21","c":"وَمِنْهَا","d":"wamin'hā","e":"ٌrِyʾٓāَjg"},{"b":"4.7","h":"7.09","c":"جَائِرٌ","d":"jāirun","e":"ْwَlَw"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.92","c":"وَلَوْ","d":"walaw","e":"َءٓāَhs"},{"b":"8.2","h":"11.82","c":"شَاءَ","d":"shāa","e":"ْmُkٰàَdَhَl"},{"b":"10.3","h":"14.1","c":"لَهَدَاكُمْ","d":"lahadākum","e":"َnyِʿعَmْjgَaʾ"},{"b":"11.7","h":"16.25","c":"أَجْمَعِينَ","d":"ajmaʿīna","e":"َwُh"}],"a":{"g":"And upon Allah is the direction of the [right] way, and among the various paths are those deviating.

And an excellent dispeller of worry is certainty (Yaqin). And the consequence of lying is regret. And in truthfulness is safety. A distant lord is closer than a close one, and a stranger is one who has no beloved. And the truthful friend (Sadiq) is one who is truthful in his absence. And do not let a beloved be lacking in you due to bad suspicion. An excellent character is generosity (Takrim). And modesty (Haya) is a means to every beautiful thing. And the most secure bond is piety (Taqwa). And the most secure means you have taken is a means between you and Allah. Indeed, what you have from your worldly life is what you have rectified with your abode. And provision (Rizq) is of two types: provision you seek and provision that seeks you. So if you do not come to it, it will come to you. And if you are distressed over what has befallen you from what is in your hands, then do not be distressed over what has not reached you. And infer about what has not been from what has been, for matters are similar. And a person is pleased by attaining what would not have escaped him and is displeased by missing what he would not have attained. So what reaches you from your worldly life, do not excessively rejoice in it, and what escapes you from it, do not let your soul (Nafs) follow it with regret.

And were it not for His isolating us from aspiring with the eye of greed to encompass the essence of His blessings, we would have yearned to seek encompassing and exhaustive enumeration. But He, the Exalted, isolated us by the decree of overpowering and power, so He, the Exalted, said: \"And if you should count the blessings of Allah, you could not enumerate them\" (Quran 16:18). So if we speak, it is by His permission that we expand; and if we remain silent, it is by His overpowering that we contract, for there is no giver of what He has withheld nor withholder of what He has given. Because we, in every moment of the moments of life before death, hear with the hearing of the hearts (Qulūb) the call of the Compelling King: \"To whom belongs the dominion today? To Allah, the One, the Compeller\" (Quran 40:16).

Rather, the day and night are twenty-four hours, and in every hour there are about a thousand breaths, and every breath is about ten moments, so upon you in every moment are thousands upon thousands of blessings in every part of the parts of your body, nay in every part of the parts of the world. So look: is it conceivable to enumerate that or not? And when the reality of His saying, the Exalted, was revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: 'And if you count the blessings of Allah, you cannot enumerate them' (Quran 16:18), he said: 'My God, how can I thank You when for every hair on my body there are two blessings: that You softened its root and that You blunted its tip.' And likewise, it has come in the tradition that whoever does not recognize the blessings of Allah in his food and drink, then his knowledge has diminished and his punishment has drawn near. And all that we have mentioned returns to food and drink, so consider what is other than them from the blessings by it, for the insightful one does not cast his eye in the world upon anything, nor does his thought touch upon an existent, except that he realizes that Allah has in it a blessing upon him. So let us leave exhaustive detailing, for it is aspiration in what is not attainable.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وكما عرفت أن في كل طرفة عين نعما كثيرة فاعلم أن في كل نفس ينبسط وينقبض نعمتين إذ بانبساطه يخرج الدخان المحترق من القلب ولو لم يخرج لهلك وبانقبضه يجمع روح الهواء إلى القلب ولو سد متنفسه لاحترق قلبه بانقطاع روح الهواء وبرودته عنه وهلك بل اليوم والليلة أربع وعشرون ساعة وفي كل ساعة قريب من ألف نفس وكل نفس قريب من عشر لحظات فعليك في كل لحظة آلاف آلاف نعمة في كل جزء من أجزاء بدنك بل في كل جزء من أجزاء العالم فانظر هل يتصور إحصاء ذلك أم لا، ولما انكشف لموسى عليه السلام حقيقة قوله تعالى: ﴿ وإن تعدوا نعمة الله لا تحصوها ﴾ قال إلهى كيف أشكرك ولك في كل شعرة من جسدى نعمتان أن لينت أصلها وأن طمست رأسها وكذا ورد في الأثر أن من لم يعرف نعم الله في مطعمه ومشربه فقد قل علمه وحضر عذابه وجميع ما ذكرناه يرجع إلى المطعم والمشرب فاعتبر ما سواه من النعم به فإن البصير لا تقع عينه في العالم على شىء ولا يلم خاطره بموجود إلا ويتحقق أن لله فيه نعمة عليه فلنترك الاستقصاء والتفصيل فإنه طمع في غير مطمع.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book2.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Patience and Gratitude</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And since those causes are lengthy, a book like this cannot bear their exhaustive enumeration, so let us mention from them a model to understand by it the meaning of His saying, the Exalted: 'And if you count the blessings of Allah, you cannot enumerate them' (Quran 16:18). And by Allah is success. (Explanation of the aspect of the model in the abundance of Allah's blessings and their sequence and their departure from enumeration and counting) Know that we have gathered the blessings into sixteen types, and we made the health of the body a blessing from the blessings occurring in the later rank. So this single blessing, if we wanted to exhaustively enumerate the causes by which this blessing is completed, we would not be able to do so. But eating is one of the causes of health, so let us mention a portion from the totality of causes by which the blessing of eating is completed. It is not hidden that eating is an action, and every action of this type is a movement, and every movement necessarily has a moving body that is its instrument, and necessarily has a power (Qudrah) over the movement, and necessarily has a will (Iradah) for the movement, and necessarily has knowledge (Ilm) of what is intended and perception (Idrak) of it. And eating necessarily has food (Mā'kul), and the food necessarily has an origin from which it is obtained, and necessarily has a maker (Sāni') who prepares it. So let us mention the causes of perception, then the causes of wills, then the causes of power, then the causes of food, by way of allusion, not by way of exhaustive enumeration. (The first aspect in Allah's blessings in creating the causes of perception) Know that Allah, the Exalted, created the plant, and it is more complete in existence than the stone, the clay, the iron, the copper, and the rest of the jewels that do not grow and do not nourish, for the plant...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وإذا كانت تلك الأسباب طويلة لا يحتمل مثل هذا الكتاب استقصاءها فلنذكر منها أنموذجا ليعلم به معنى قوله تعالى: ﴿ وإن تعدوا نعمة الله لا تحصوها ﴾ وبالله التوفيق.

However, whoever knows something of this perceives a whiff of the meanings of His saying the Exalted: 'And if you should count the blessings of Allah, you could not enumerate them.' Then look how Allah the Exalted has tied the uprightness of these limbs and the uprightness of their benefits, their perceptions, and their powers to a subtle vapor that ascends from the four humors and is settled in the Heart (Qalb) and flows in all the body by means of the pulsating veins. So it does not reach a part from the parts of the body except that it causes, upon its arrival in those parts, what is needed from it of sensory power, perception, power of movement, and others, like the lamp that is circulated in the corners of the house. So it does not reach a part except that there occurs, due to its arrival, light upon the parts of the house from the creation of Allah the Exalted and His invention, but He made the lamp a cause for it by His wisdom. And this subtle vapor is what the physicians call the Spirit (Ruh), and its place is the Heart (Qalb), and its example is the fiery substance of the lamp, and the Heart (Qalb) is for it like the lamp-holder, and the black blood that is in the interior of the Heart (Qalb) is for it like the wick, and the nourishment is for it like the oil, and the apparent life in the rest of the body's limbs because of it is like the light for the lamp in the entirety of the house. And just as the lamp, if its oil is cut off, is extinguished, so the lamp of the Spirit (Ruh) also is extinguished whenever its nourishment is cut off. And just as the wick may burn and become ashes such that it does not accept the oil, so the lamp is extinguished with abundance of oil, likewise the blood that this vapor clings to in the Heart (Qalb) may burn due to excessive heat of the Heart (Qalb) and is extinguished with the presence of nourishment, for it does not accept the nourishment that</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وجملة ما عرفناه وعرفه الخلق كلهم بالإضافة إلى ما لم يعرفوه من نعم الله تعالى أقل من قطرة من بحر إلا أن من علم شيئا من هذا أدرك شمة من معانى قوله تعالى: ﴿ وإن تعدوا نعمة الله لا تحصوها ﴾ ثم انظر كيف ربط الله تعالى قوام هذه الأعضاء وقوام منافعها وإدراكاتها وقواها ببخار لطيف يتصاعد من الأخلاط الأربعة ومستقرة القلب ويسرى في جميع البدن بواسطة العروق الضوارب فلا ينتهى إلى جزء من أجزاء البدن إلا ويحدث عند وصوله في تلك الأجزاء ما يحتاج إليه من قوة حس وإدراك وقوة حركة وغيرها كالسراج الذى يدار في أطراف البيت فلا يصل إلى جزء إلا ويحصل بسبب وصوله ضوء على أجزاء البيت من خلق الله تعالى واختراعه ولكنه جعل السراج سببا له بحكمته وهذا البخار اللطيف هو الذى تسميه الأطباء الروح ومحله القلب ومثاله جرم نار السراج والقلب له كالمسرجة والدم الأسود الذى في باطن القلب له كالفتيلة والغذاء له كالزيت والحياة الظاهرة في سائر أعضاء البدن بسببه كالضوء للسراج في جملة البيت وكما ان السراج إذا انقطع زيته انطفأ فسراج الروح أيضا ينطفىء مهما انقطع غذاؤه وكما ان الفتيلة قد تحترق فتصير رمادا بحيث لا تقبل الزيت فينطفىء السراج مع كثرة الزيت فكذلك الدم الذى تشبث به هذا البخار في القلب قد يحترق بفرط حرارة القلب فينطفىء مع وجود الغذاء فإنه لا يقبل الغذاء الذى</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book6.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Love, Longing, and Intimacy</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And as for the second reason: which is his love for the one who has done good to him by supporting him with his wealth, speaking kindly to him, aiding him with his assistance, volunteering for his support, suppressing his enemies, undertaking to repel the harm of the wicked from him, and becoming a means to all his aspirations and purposes in himself, his children, and his relatives, then he is undoubtedly beloved to him.

In it have come the verses which contain censure of arrogance (Kibr) and the arrogant ones. Allah the Exalted said: 'And the angels will be spreading their hands' up to His saying: 'and you were arrogant (Tastakbirun) about His signs.' Then He said: 'Enter the gates of Hell, abiding eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant (Mutakabirin).' Then He informed that the most severely punished of the people of the Fire are the most insolent (Atiyan) against Allah the Exalted, so He said: 'Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were most insolent (Atiyan) against the Most Merciful.' And He the Exalted said: 'So those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts (Qulub) are denying (Munkirah) and they are arrogant (Mustakbirun).' And He the Mighty and Majestic said: 'Those who were oppressed say to those who were arrogant (Istakbaru): \"If not for you, we would have been believers.\"' And He the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those who are arrogant (Yastakbirun) about My worship will enter Hell in humiliation.' And He the Exalted said: 'I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant (Yatakabbarun) in the earth without right.' It is said in the interpretation (Tafsir): I will lift the understanding of the Quran from their hearts (Qulub). And in some interpretations (Tafsir): I will veil their hearts (Qulub) from the dominion (Malakut). And Ibn Juraij said: I will turn them away from reflecting upon them and taking admonition from them. And therefore, Jesus (Isa) peace be upon him said: Indeed, the crop grows in the plain and does not grow upon the rock, likewise wisdom (Hikmah) works in the heart (Qalb) of the humble one and does not work in the heart (Qalb) of the arrogant one (Mutakabbir). Do you not see that whoever raises his head to the ceiling strikes it, and whoever lowers it is shaded and sheltered. So this is a parable he struck for the arrogant ones (Mutakabirin) and how they are deprived of wisdom (Hikmah). And therefore, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) mentioned the rejection (Juhud) of the truth as part of the definition of arrogance (Kibr) and the uncovering of its reality, and he said: 'Whoever belittles the truth and looks down upon people.'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وشر أنواع الكبر ما يمنع من استفادة العلم وقبول الحق والانقياد له وفيه وردت الآيات التي فيها ذم الكبر والمتكبرين قال الله تعالى \"والملائكة باسطو أيديهم\" إلى قوله \"وكنتم عن آياته تستكبرون\" ثم قال \"ادخلوا أبواب جهنم خالدين فيها فبئس مثوى المتكبرين\" ثم أخبر أن أشد أهل النار عذاباً أشدهم عتياً على الله تعالى فقال \"ثم لننزعن من كل شبعة أيهم أشد على الرحمن عتياً\" وقال تعالى \"فالذين لا يؤمنون بالآخرة قلوبهم منكرة وهم مستكبرون\" وقال عز وجل \"يقول الذين استضعفوا للذين استكبروا لولا أنتم لكنا مؤمنين\" وقال تعالى \"إن الذين يستكبرون عن عبادتي سيدخلون جهنم داخرين\" وقال تعالى \"سأصرف عن آياتي الذين يتكبرون في الأرض بغير الحق\" قيل في التفسير: سأرفع فهم القرآن عن قلوبهم، وفي بعض التفاسير سأحجب قلوبهم عن الملكوت. وقال ابن جريج: سأصرفهم عن أن يتفكروا فيها ويعتبروا بها. ولذلك قال المسيح عليه السلام: إن الزرع ينبت في السهل ولا ينبت على الصفا، كذلك الحكمة تعمل في قلب المتواضع ولا تعمل في قلب المتكبر، ألا ترون أن من شمخ برأسه إلى السقف شجه، ومن طأطأ أظله وأكنه. فهذا مثل ضربه للمتكبرين وأنهم كيف يحرمون الحكمة، ولذلك ذكر رسول الله ﭬ جحود الحق في حد الكبر والكشف عن حقيقته وقال \"من سفه الحق وغمص الناس\"[45].</div></div></div>"}},"23":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"1.15","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َmَrَjg"},{"b":"0.53","h":"1.75","c":"جَرَمَ","d":"jarama","e":"َّnَaʾ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.79","c":"أَنَّ","d":"anna","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.1","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"ُmَlْʿعَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"5.37","c":"يَعْلَمُ","d":"yaʿlamu","e":"āَm"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.71","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"َnwُّrِsُy"},{"b":"4.7","h":"7.42","c":"يُسِرُّونَ","d":"yusirrūna","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"6.2","h":"9.38","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"َnwُnِlْʿعُy"},{"b":"6.9","h":"10.56","c":"يُعْلِنُونَ","d":"yuʿ'linūna","e":"ۥُhَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"9.9","h":"14.95","c":"إِنَّهُ","d":"innahu","e":"āَl"},{"b":"11.7","h":"16.92","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"ُّbِḥُy"},{"b":"12.1","h":"17.56","c":"يُحِبُّ","d":"yuḥibbu","e":"َnyِrِbْkَtْsُmْlٱ"},{"b":"13.1","h":"18.88","c":"الْمُسْتَكْبِرِينَ","d":"l-mus'takbirīna","e":"āَhdِiʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"Assuredly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare.

Allah the Exalted said: \"So take Him as a disposer of affairs (Wakil) and be patient over what they say.\" And He the Exalted said: \"And we will be patient over what you harm us, and upon Allah let the reliant ones rely (Yatawakkal).\" And He the Mighty and Majestic said: \"And leave their harm and rely (Tawakkul) upon Allah.\" And He the Blessed and Exalted said: \"So be patient as the possessors of resolve (Ulul-Azm) from the messengers were patient.\" And He the Exalted said: \"Excellent is the reward of the doers, those who were patient (Sabaru) and upon their Lord they rely (Yatawakkalun).\" And this is regarding the harm of people. As for patience over the harm of snakes, beasts, and scorpions, abandoning repelling them is not from reliance (Tawakkul) in anything, for there is no benefit in it, and the striving is not intended nor is the striving abandoned for its own sake but for aiding in the religion (Deen). And the arrangement of causes here is like their arrangement in earning and bringing benefits, so we do not prolong with repetition. And likewise in the causes repelling from wealth, reliance (Tawakkul) is not diminished by closing the door of the house when going out nor by tying the camel, because these are causes known by the Sunnah of Allah the Exalted, either certainly or presumptively. And for that reason, he ﷺ said to the Bedouin when he neglected the camel and said 'I have relied (Tawakkaltu) upon Allah': 'Tie it and rely (Tawakkul).' And He the Exalted said: 'Take your precaution.' And He said regarding the manner of the prayer of fear: 'And let them take their weapons.' And He the Blessed said: 'And prepare for them what you are able of power and of tethering horses.' And He the Exalted said to Musa, peace be upon him: 'So travel by night with My servants.' And fortifying by night is hiding from the eyes of enemies and a type of causing, and the hiding of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the cave is hiding from the eyes of enemies repelling harm. And taking weapons in prayer is not a repeller certainly like killing the snake and scorpion, for it is a repeller certainly, but taking weapons is a presumptive cause, and we have clarified that the presumptive is like the certain, and only the imagined is what reliance (Tawakkul) necessitates abandoning.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وترك الأسباب الدافعة وإن كانت مقطوعة وجه إذا ناله الضرر من إنسان، فإنه إذا أمكنه الصبر وأمكنه الدفع والتشفي فشرط التوكل الاحتمال والصبر، قال الله تعالى: \" فاتخذه وكيلاً واصبر على ما يقولون \". وقال تعالى: \" ولنصبرن على ما آذيتمونا وعلى الله فليتوكل المتوكلون \". وقال عز وجل: \" ودع أذاهم وتوكل على الله \". وقال سبحانه وتعالى: \" فاصبر كما صبر أولو العزم من الرسل \". وقال تعالى: \" نعم أجر العاملين الذين صبروا وعلى ربهم يتوكلون \" وهذا في أذى الناس، وأما الصبر على أذى الحيات والسباع والعقارب، فترك دفعها ليس من التوكل في شيء إذ لا فائدة فيه، ولا يراد السعي ولا يترك السعي لعينه بل لإعانته على الدين، وترتب الأسباب ههنا كترتبها في الكسب وجلب المنافع فلا نطول بالإعادة، وكذلك في الأسباب الدافعة عن المال، فلا ينقص التوكل بإغلاق باب البيت عند الخروج ولا بأن يعقل البعير، لأن هذه أسباب عرفت سنة الله تعالى إما قطعاً وإما ظناً، ولذلك قال ﷺ للأعرابي لما أن أهمل البعير وقال توكلت على الله \" اعقلها وتوكل\"[33]. وقال تعالى: \" خذوا حذركم \". وقال في كيفية صلاة الخوف: \" وليأخذوا أسلحتهم \". وقال سبحانه: \" وأعدوا لهم ما استطعتم من قوة ومن رباط الخيل \". وقال تعالى لموسى عليه السلام: \" فأسر بعبادي ليلاً \" والتحصن بالليل اختفاءً عن أعين الأعداء ونوع تسبب، واختفاء رسول الله ﷺ في الغار اختفاء عن أعين الأعداء دفعاً للضرر[34]، وأخذ السلاح في الصلاة فليس دافعاً قطعاً كقتل الحية والعقرب فإنه دافع قطعاً، ولكن أخذ السلاح سبب مظنون، وقد بينا أن المظنون كالمقطوع، وإنما الموهوم هو الذي يقتضي التوكل تركه.</div></div></div>"}},"43":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.21","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَnْlَsْrَaʾ"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.13","c":"أَرْسَلْنَا","d":"arsalnā","e":"nِm"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.18","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"َkِlْbَq"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.13","c":"قَبْلِكَ","d":"qablika","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"5.0","h":"6.45","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āًlāَjgِr"},{"b":"5.9","h":"7.75","c":"رِجَالًا","d":"rijālan","e":"ٓàِḥwُّn"},{"b":"6.5","h":"9.09","c":"نُوحِي","d":"nūḥī","e":"ْmِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"9.8","h":"12.3","c":"إِلَيْهِمْ","d":"ilayhim","e":"۟āٓwُlَٔـْsَf"},{"b":"11.2","h":"15.4","c":"فَسْءَلُوا","d":"fasalū","e":"َlْhَaʾ"},{"b":"13.7","h":"17.82","c":"أَهْلَ","d":"ahla","e":"ِrْkِّhdlٱ"},{"b":"14.3","h":"19.12","c":"الذِّكْرِ","d":"l-dhik'ri","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"15.2","h":"20.08","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"16.1","h":"21.14","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"āَl"},{"b":"17.9","h":"22.91","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَt"},{"b":"18.3","h":"23.68","c":"تَعْلَمُونَ","d":"taʿlamūna","e":"ِtَٰnِّyَbْlٱِb"}],"a":{"g":"And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed [Our message].

Sincerity in monotheism (tawhid) is opposed to association in divinity, and association is of two kinds: hidden and apparent, and likewise sincerity. Sincerity and its opposite come upon the heart (qalb), so its place is the heart, and that only occurs in intentions and purposes. And the reality of intention has been mentioned, that it returns to responding to motives. So whenever the motive is single in detachment, the action emanating from it is called sincerity relative to what is intended. So whoever gives charity and his aim is purely ostentation (riya), he is sincere, and whoever's aim is purely drawing near to Allah the Exalted, he is sincere. But custom is established in specifying the name sincerity (ikhlas) to mean purifying the intention of drawing near to Allah the Exalted from all impurities, just as deviation (ilhad) is an expression for inclination, but custom specified it as inclination away from the truth. And whoever's motive is purely ostentation is exposed to destruction, and we are not speaking about it since we have mentioned what pertains to it in the Book of Ostentation from the quarter of destructives, and the least of its matters is what came in the report that the ostentatious will be called on the Day of Resurrection with four names: 'O ostentatious, O deceiver, O associator, O disbeliever.'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن كل شىء يتصور أن يشوبه غيره فإذا صفا عن شوبه وخلص عنه سمى خالصا ويسمى الفعل المصفى المخلص إخلاصا قال الله تعالى من بين فرث ودم لبنا خالصا سائغا للشاربين فإنما خلوص اللبن أن لا يكون فيه شوب من الدم والفرث ومن كل ما يمكن أن يمتزج به والإخلاص يضاده الإشراك فمن ليس مخلصا فهو مشرك إلا أن الشرك درجات فالإخلاص في التوحيد يضاده التشريك في الإلهية والشرك منه خفي ومنه جلي وكذا الإخلاص والإخلاص وضده يتواردان على القلب فمحله القلب وإنما يكون ذلك في القصود والنيات وقد ذكر حقيقة النية وأنها ترجع إلى إجابة البواعث فمهما كان الباعث واحد على التجرد سمي الفعل الصادر عنه إخلاصا بالإضافة إلى المنوى فمن تصدق وغرضه محض الرياء فهو مخلص ومن كان غرضه محض التقرب إلى الله تعالى فهو مخلص ولكن العادة جارية بتخصيص اسم الإخلاص بتجريد قصد التقرب إلى الله تعالى عن جميع الشوائب كما أن الإلحاد عبارة عن الميل ولكن خصصته العادة بالميل عن الحق ومن كان باعثه مجرد الرياء فهو معرض للهلاك ولسنا نتكلم فيه إذ قد ذكرنا ما يتعلق به في كتاب الرياء من ربع المهلكات وأقل أموره ما ورد في الخبر من إن المرائي يدعى يوم القيامة بأربع أسام (يا مرائي يا مخادع يا مشرك يا كافر)[42]</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol4 book1</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Know the reality of sincerity [ikhlas]. Indeed, every thing that can be conceived of as being mixed with something else, when it becomes pure from its mixture and is free from it, is called pure [khalis]. And the action that is purified and made pure is called sincerity [ikhlas]. Allah the Exalted said: \"From between what is in the intestines and blood, pure milk [labanan khalisan], palatable for the drinkers.\" (16:66). The purity [khulus] of the milk is that there is no mixture in it of blood or what is in the intestines, nor of anything that can possibly mix with it. And sincerity [ikhlas] is the opposite of association [shirk]. So whoever is not sincere [mukhlis] is an associator [mushrik], except that association [shirk] has degrees. Sincerity [ikhlas] in divine oneness [tawhid] is the opposite of association [tashrik] in divinity [uluhiyyah]. And association [shirk] is of two kinds: hidden [khafi] and manifest [jali].

Then He restrained his desire (Shahwa) that opposes him from domination and aggression, and subdued it with what He obligated upon him of seeking lawful (Halal) sustenance, and defeated by breaking it the army of Satan who is girded for misguidance. Indeed, it used to flow in the son of Adam like flowing blood, so the honor of the lawful (Halal) narrowed its channel and scope, since nothing could pour it into the depths of the veins except the desire (Shahwa) inclined to overpowering and indulgence.

So giving thanks (Shukr) is obedience (Taa'a), and complaining (Shakwa) is ugly disobedience (Ma'siya) from the people of religion (Ahl al-Din). And how could complaining (Shakwa) not be ugly from the King of Kings (Malik al-Muluk) in whose hand is everything, to an owned slave (Abd Mamlook) who is not capable of anything? So it is more appropriate for the servant (Abd) that if he does not excel in patience (Sabr) upon the trial (Bala) and the decree (Qada), and weakness leads him to complaining (Shakwa), that his complaint (Shakwa) be to Allah the Exalted, for He is the One who afflicts (Al-Mubli) and is capable of removing the trial (Bala), and the humility (Dhull) of the servant (Abd) to his Master (Mawla) is glorious, and complaining (Shakwa) to other than Him is humility (Dhull), and showing humility (Dhull) to a servant (Abd) while he is a servant (Abd) like him is ugly humility (Dhull). Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from Allah provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him.' {} And He said: 'Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah are servants like you.' {} So giving thanks (Shukr) by the tongue (Lisan) is from the totality of giving thanks (Shukr).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وما كان قصدهم الرياء بإظهار الشوق وكل عبد سئل عن حال فهو بين ان يشكر او يشكو يسكت فالشكر طاعة والشكوى معصية قبيحة من اهل الدين وكيف لا تقبح الشكوى من ملك الملوك وبيده كل شيء الى عبد مملوك لا يقدر على شيء فالأحرى بالعبد ان لم يحسن الصبر على البلاء والقضاء وأفضي به الضعف الى الشكوى ان تكون شكواه الى الله تعالى فهو المبلى والقادر على ازالة البلاء وذل العبد لمولاه عز والشكوى الى غيره ذل وإظهار الذل للعبد مع كونه عبدا مثله ذل قبيح قال الله تعالى: ﴿ إن الذين تعبدون من دون الله لا يملكون لكم رزقا فابتغوا عند الله الرزق واعبدوه واشكروا له ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ إن الذين تدعون من دون الله عباد امثالكم ﴾ {} فالشكر باللسان من جملة الشكر.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-9a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Pride and Conceit</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>So he is compelled and humiliated; if left, he remains, and if snatched away, he perishes—a slave owned (abd mamluk) who cannot control anything of himself nor anything of others. What is more humiliated than him if he knew himself? And how does arrogance befit him except due to his ignorance? This is his intermediate state, so let him contemplate it. As for his end and destination, it is death, alluded to by the saying of the Exalted: 'Then He causes him to die and buries him, then when He wills, He resurrects him.' Its meaning is that He strips him of his Spirit (Ruh), hearing, sight, knowledge, power, sensation, perception, and movement, so he returns as inanimate matter as he was at first, nothing remains except the form of his limbs and his image—no sensation in it nor movement. Then he is placed in the earth and becomes a stinking, filthy corpse as he was initially a despised drop (nutfah). Then his limbs decay, his parts disintegrate, his bones rot, and he becomes scattered remains and fragments, and worms eat his parts, beginning with his pupils to pluck them out and his cheeks to cut them off, and with all his parts until he becomes dung in the bellies of worms and becomes a corpse from which animals flee and every human finds repulsive and flees from due to the intensity of the stench. The best of his states is that he returns to what he was and becomes earth from which cups are made and from which buildings are constructed, so he becomes non-existent after having been existent. And it becomes as if he had not flourished yesterday as a harvest, as he was in his first affair a long period. Would that he remained thus—how excellent if he were left as earth! No, rather He revives him after long decay to experience severe trial, so he emerges from his grave after gathering his scattered parts, and emerges.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فهو مضطر ذليل إن ترك بقي وإن اختطف فني، عبد مملوك لا يقدر على شيء من نفسه ولا شيء من غيره، فأي شيء أذل منه لو عرف نفسه؟ وأنى يليق الكبر به لولا جهله؟ فهذا أوسط أحواله فليتأمله. وأما آخره ومورده فهو الموت المشار إليه بقول تعالى \"ثم أماته فأقبره ثم إذا شاء أنشره\" ومعناه أنه يسلب روحه وسمعه وبصره وعلمه وقدرته وحسه وإدراكه وحركته، فيعود جماداً كما كان أول مرة، لا يبقى إلا شكل أعضائه وصورته لا حس فيه ولا حركة، ثم يوضع في التراب فيصير جيفة منتنة قذرة كما كان في الأول نطفة مذرة، ثم تبلى أعضاؤه وتتفتت أجزاؤه وتنخر عظامه ويصير رميماً رفاتاً، ويأكل الدود أجزاءه فيبتدئ بحدقتيه فيقلعهما وبخديه فيقطعهما، وبسائر أجزائه فيصير روثاً في أجواف الديدان ويكون جيفة يهرب منه الحيوان ويستقذره كل إنسان ويهرب منه لشدة الإنتان، وأحسن أحواله أن يعود إلى ما كان فيصير تراباً يعمل منه الكيزان ويعمل منه البنيان، فيصير مفقوداً بعدما كان موجوداً. وصار كأن لم يغن بالأمس حصيداً كما كان في أول أمره أمداً مديداً، وليته بقي كذلك فما أحسنه لو ترك تراباً. لا بل يحييه بعد طول البلى ليقاسي شديد البلاء، فيخرج من قبره بعد جمع أجزائه المتفرقة، ويخرج</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-9a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Pride and Conceit</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And you are nothing but a slave (abd) owned (mamluk) who cannot do anything. And whoever knows that, his arrogance must vanish. Its example: that the heedless one boasts of his strength, beauty, wealth, freedom, independence, spacious dwellings, and abundance of horses and servants, when two just witnesses testify against him before a fair judge that he is a slave (riq) to so-and-so and that his parents were owned (mamluk) by him, so that is known and the judge rules by it, then his owner (malik) comes and takes him, and takes all that is in his hand, and he with that fears that he will punish him and inflict harm upon him for his wastefulness in his wealth and his shortcoming in seeking his owner (malik) to know that he has an owner (malik). Then the slave (abd) looked and saw himself imprisoned in a dwelling that has been surrounded by snakes, scorpions, and vermin, and he is in every state in fear from each one of them, and he remains not owning himself nor his wealth nor knowing any way of escape at all. Do you think one in this state boasts of his power, wealth, strength, and perfection or humbles himself and submits? And this is the state of every intelligent person who becomes, for he sees himself thus, so he does not own his neck, body, limbs, and wealth, and he with that is among afflictions, desires, illnesses, and diseases that are like scorpions and snakes from which he fears destruction. So one in this state does not become arrogant with his strength and power since he knows that he has no power and no strength. This is the way of treating arrogance with external causes, and it is easier than treating arrogance with knowledge and action, for they are two perfections in the soul (nafs) worthy of rejoicing in them. Allah struck a similitude: a slave (abd) owned (mamluk) who cannot do anything, and one whom We have provided from Us a good provision, so he spends from it secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah.

Therefore, you see the child befriends the child and the adult befriends the adult, and the bird befriends its kind and shuns other kinds, and the scholar finds more companionship with the scholar than with the craftsman, and the carpenter finds more companionship with the carpenter than with the blacksmith. This meaning is what Allah the Exalted alluded to in His saying: {Allah sets forth a parable: a slave (ʿabd) owned (mamlūk) who has no power over anything, and one to whom We have given from Us a good provision (rizq) and he spends from it secretly and openly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. But most of them do not know.} [An-Naḥl: 75]. So the owned slave (al-mamlūk) owns nothing and has no power over anything, and the noble free person (al-ḥurr al-karīm) whom Allah has provided with a good provision (rizq) spends from it secretly and openly, so are they equal? They are not equal, because one is owned (mamlūk) and the other is free (ḥurr), and freedom (al-ḥurriyyah) is suitable for freedom, and ownedness (al-mamlūkiyyah) is suitable for ownedness. Likewise, the slave (al-ʿabd) who worships Allah the Exalted seeking Paradise or fearing Hell, and the slave (al-ʿabd) who worships Allah the Exalted out of love (ḥubb) for Him and reverence for His majesty (jalāl), are they equal? They are not equal, because one is a slave (ʿabd) of Allah the Exalted out of love (ḥubb), and the other is a slave (ʿabd) of Allah the Exalted out of greed (ṭamaʿ) or fear (khawf), and love (al-ḥubb) is suitable for love, and greed and fear are suitable for greed and fear.

And this, even if it is less than the first and second, is also great from two aspects. The first: that arrogance (Kibr), honor (Izz), majesty (Azamah), and loftiness (Ala') are not fitting except for the King (Malik) who is capable (Qadir). As for the servant (Abd) who is owned (Mamluk), weak (Da'if), incapable (Ajiz), who cannot do anything, then from where does arrogance (Kibr) befit his state? So whenever a servant (Abd) becomes arrogant (Takabbur), he has contended with Allah the Exalted in an attribute that is not fitting except for His majesty (Jalal). Its example: that a boy (Ghulam) takes the king's cap (Qalansuwah) and places it on his head and sits on his throne (Sarir), so how great is his deserving of contempt (Maqt) and how great is his exposure to disgrace (Khizy) and punishment (Nikal)! And how severe is his audacity (Istijra') towards his master (Mawlah) and how ugly is what he has undertaken! And to this meaning is the allusion in His saying the Exalted: \"Majesty (Azamah) is My lower garment (Izar) and arrogance (Kibriya') is My cloak (Rida'), so whoever contends with Me in them I will break him\" meaning that it is specific to My attribute and not fitting except for Me, and the contender in it contends in an attribute from My attributes. And if arrogance (Kibr) over His servants (Ibad) is not fitting except for Him, then whoever is arrogant (Takabbur) over His servants (Ibad) has wronged Him, since the one who despises the special servants (Khawass) of the king's boys (Ghulman), uses them, elevates himself over them, and monopolizes what it is the king's right to monopolize from them, he is contending with him in some of his affair, even if his degree does not reach the degree of one who wanted to sit on his throne (Sarir) and monopolize his kingdom. So all creation (Khalq) are servants (Ibad) of Allah and to Him belongs majesty (Azamah) and arrogance (Kibriya') over them, so whoever is arrogant (Takabbur) over a servant (Abd) from the servants (Ibad) of Allah has contended with Allah in His right. Yes, the difference between this contention and the contention of Nimrod and Pharaoh is the difference between contending with the king in belittling some of his servants (Abid) and using them and contending with him in the foundation of kingship. The second aspect: by which the vileness of arrogance (Takabbur) towards the servants (of Allah) is magnified is that Allah the Exalted struck for it a parable, saying: \"And Allah presents an example of two men: one of them is dumb (Abkam), unable to do anything, and he is a burden (Kall) upon his master (Mawlah) - wherever he directs him, he brings no good. Is he equal to one who commands justice (Adl) and is upon a straight path (Sirat Mustaqim)?\" So the one arrogant (Mutakabbir) towards the servants (of Allah) is like the dumb (Abkam) who cannot do anything, and he is a burden (Kall) upon his master (Mawlah), meaning a heavy load upon him, wherever he directs him he brings no good. So is he equal to one who commands justice (Adl) and is upon a straight path (Sirat Mustaqim)? So the one arrogant (Mutakabbir) towards the servants (of Allah) does not command justice (Adl) nor is he upon a straight path (Sirat Mustaqim), rather he is like the dumb (Abkam) who cannot do anything, and he is a burden (Kall) upon his master (Mawlah), meaning a heavy load upon Allah the Exalted, wherever he directs him he brings no good. So is he equal to one who commands justice (Adl) and is upon a straight path (Sirat Mustaqim)? So the one arrogant (Mutakabbir) towards the servants (of Allah) does not command justice (Adl) nor is he upon a straight path (Sirat Mustaqim), rather he is like the dumb (Abkam) who cannot do anything, and he is a burden (Kall) upon his master (Mawlah), meaning a heavy load upon Allah the Exalted, wherever he directs him he brings no good.

Know that from divine decree (Qada) is repelling affliction (Bala) through supplication (Dua), so supplication (Dua) is a cause for repelling affliction (Bala) and attracting mercy (Rahma) just as a shield is a cause for repelling an arrow and water is a cause for the emergence of plants from the earth. So just as the shield pushes the arrow and they repel each other, likewise supplication (Dua) and affliction (Bala) contend with each other. It is not a condition of acknowledging the divine decree (Qada) of Allah the Exalted to not carry weapons, and He the Exalted has said: 'Take your precautions' (Quran 4:71), and to not water the earth after sowing seeds, saying: If divine decree (Qada) preceded with growth, the seed will grow, and if it did not precede, it will not grow. Rather, linking causes (Asbab) to effects (Musabbabat) is the first divine decree (Qada) which is like the blink of an eye or it is nearer. And arranging the detailing of effects (Musabbabat) upon the details of causes (Asbab) with gradualness and measure is divine destiny (Qadar). And the One who decreed good decreed it with a cause, and the One who decreed evil decreed it to repel it with a cause. So there is no contradiction between these matters for one whose insight (Basira) has opened.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فإن قلت: فما فائدة الدعاء والقضاء لا مرد له. فاعلم أن من القضاء رد البلاء بالدعاء فالدعاء سبب لرد البلاء واستجلاب الرحمة كما أن الترس سبب لرد السهم والماء سبب لخروج النبات من الأرض فكما أن الترس يدفع السهم فيتدافعان فكذلك الدعاء والبلاء يتعالجان وليس من شرط الاعتراف بقضاء الله تعالى أن لا يحمل السلاح وقد قال تعالى: ﴿ خذوا حذركم ﴾ {} وأن لا يسقي الأرض بعد بث البذر فيقال إن سبق القضاء بالنبات نبت البذر وإن لم يسبق لم ينبت بل ربط الأسباب بالمسببات هو القضاء الأول الذي هو كلمح البصر أو هو أقرب وترتيب تفصيل المسببات على تفاصيل الأسباب على التدريج والتقدير هو القدر والذي قدر الخير قدره بسبب والذي قدر الشر قدر لدفعه سببا فلا تناقض بين هذه الأمور عند من انفتحت بصيرته</div></div></div>"}},"78":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"1.35","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"mُkَjgَrْhkَaʾ"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.72","c":"أَخْرَجَكُمْ","d":"akhrajakum","e":"ۢnِّm"},{"b":"3.2","h":"5.18","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ِnwُṭُb"},{"b":"4.1","h":"6.09","c":"بُطُونِ","d":"buṭūni","e":"ْmُkِtَٰhَّmُaʾ"},{"b":"5.2","h":"7.32","c":"أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ","d":"ummahātikum","e":"āَl"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.23","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَt"},{"b":"8.0","h":"10.81","c":"تَعْلَمُونَ","d":"taʿlamūna","e":"āًٔـْyَhs"},{"b":"9.4","h":"12.68","c":"شَيْئًا","d":"shayan","e":"َlَʿعَjgَw"},{"b":"10.2","h":"13.82","c":"وَجَعَلَ","d":"wajaʿala","e":"ُmُkَl"},{"b":"11.8","h":"15.68","c":"لَكُمُ","d":"lakumu","e":"َʿعْmَّslٱ"},{"b":"14.","h":"16.56","c":"السَّمْعَ","d":"l-samʿa","e":"َrَٰṣْbَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"15.6","h":"17.93","c":"وَالْأَبْصَارَ","d":"wal-abṣāra","e":"َẗَdِٔـْfَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"17.2","h":"20.13","c":"وَالْأَفْئِدَةَ","d":"wal-afidata","e":"ْmُkَّlَʿعَl"},{"b":"18.9","h":"22.3","c":"لَعَلَّكُمْ","d":"laʿallakum","e":"َnwُrُkْhsَt"},{"b":"20.3","h":"24.08","c":"تَشْكُرُونَ","d":"tashkurūna","e":"ْmَlَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And Allah has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing, and He made for you hearing and vision and intellect that perhaps you would be grateful."}},"79":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.5","c":"أَلَمْ","d":"alam","e":"۟āْwَrَy"},{"b":"0.61","h":"2.06","c":"يَرَوْا","d":"yaraw","e":"àَlِiʾ"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3.03","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ِrْyَّṭlٱ"},{"b":"1.7","h":"3.54","c":"الطَّيْرِ","d":"l-ṭayri","e":"ٍtَٰrَّhkَsُm"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.88","c":"مُسَخَّرَاتٍ","d":"musakharātin","e":"àِf"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.7","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ِّwَjg"},{"b":"6.0","h":"8.5","c":"جَوِّ","d":"jawwi","e":"ِءٓāَmَّslٱ"},{"b":"6.7","h":"9.39","c":"السَّمَاءِ","d":"l-samāi","e":"āَm"},{"b":"9.2","h":"12.11","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"َّnُhُkِsْmُy"},{"b":"9.7","h":"12.76","c":"يُمْسِكُهُنَّ","d":"yum'sikuhunna","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"12","h":"15.26","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"13","h":"16.23","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"15.","h":"20","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"àِf"},{"b":"16.3","h":"21.07","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"16.8","h":"21.76","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"ٍtَٰyāَءَl"},{"b":"17.8","h":"23.06","c":"لَءَايَاتٍ","d":"laāyātin","e":"ٍmْwَqِّl"},{"b":"19.3","h":"25.09","c":"لِقَوْمٍ","d":"liqawmin","e":"َnwُnِmْwʾُy"},{"b":"21.","h":"27.51","c":"يُؤْمِنُونَ","d":"yu'minūna","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky?

He also said: The bearer of the Quran is the bearer of the banner of Islam, so it is not fitting that he should play around with those who play around, nor be heedless with those who are heedless, nor engage in idle talk with those who engage in idle talk, out of reverence for the right of the Quran. And Sufyan al-Thawri said: When a man recites the Quran, the angel places it between his eyes. And Amr ibn Maymun said: Whoever opens a Quran when he prays the morning prayer and recites one hundred verses from it, Allah the Exalted will raise for him the equivalent of the deeds of all the people of the world. And it is narrated that (Khalid ibn Uqbah came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said: Recite the Quran to me.

And Allah the Exalted has commanded justice (Adl) and excellence (Ihsan) together. Justice (Adl) is the cause of salvation only, and it flows in trade like capital. Excellence (Ihsan) is the cause of triumph and attainment of happiness, and it flows in trade like profit. One is not considered among the heedless who is content in worldly transactions with his capital, so likewise in the transactions of the Hereafter. Therefore, it is not fitting for the religious person to limit himself to justice (Adl) and avoiding oppression (Zulm) and abandon the doors of excellence (Ihsan). And Allah has said: 'And do good (Ahsin) as Allah has done good (Ahsan) to you.' And the Mighty and Majestic said: 'Indeed, Allah commands justice (Adl) and excellence (Ihsan).' And He the Glorified said: 'Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good (Muhsinin).' And we mean by excellence (Ihsan) doing what benefits the transactor, and it is not obligatory upon him, but it is a favor from him. For the obligatory enters into the chapter of justice (Adl) and abandoning oppression (Zulm), and we have mentioned it. And the rank of excellence (Ihsan) is attained by one of six matters: The first is in overcharging (Mughabana). So one should not overcharge his companion with what is not customarily overcharged. As for the basis of overcharging (Mughabana), it is permitted because selling is for profit, and that is not possible except with some overcharging. But moderation is observed in it. If the buyer offers an increase over the customary profit, either due to intense desire or intense need for it at the moment, then one should refrain from accepting it, and that is from excellence (Ihsan). As long as there is no deception, taking the increase is not oppression (Zulm).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الباب الرابع في الإحسان في المعاملة وقد أمر الله تعالى بالعدل والإحسان جميعا والعدل سبب النجاة فقط وهو يجري من التجارة مجرى رأس المال والإحسان سبب الفوز ونيل السعادة وهو يجري من التجارة مجرى الربح ولا يعد من الغفلاء من قنع في معاملات الدنيا برأس ماله فكذا في معاملات الآخرة فلا ينبغي للمتدين أن يقتصر على العدل واجتناب الظلم ويدع أبواب الإحسان وقد قال الله وأحسن كما أحسن الله إليك وقال عز وجل إن الله يأمر بالعدل والإحسان وقال سبحانه إن رحمت الله قريب من المحسنين ونعني بالإحسان فعل ما ينتفع به المعامل وهو غير واجب عليه ولكنه تفضل منه فإن الواجب يدخل في باب العدل وترك الظلم وقد ذكرناه وتنال رتبة الإحسان بواحد من ستة أمور الأول في المغابنة فينبغي أن لا يغبن صاحبه بما لا يتغابن به في العادة فأما أصل المغابنة فمأذون فيه لأن البيع للربح ولا يمكن ذلك إلا بغبن ما ولكن يراعى فيه التقريب فإن بذل المشتري زيادة على الربح المعتاد إما لشدة رغبته أو لشدة حاجته في الحال إليه فينبغي أن يمتنع من قبوله فذلك من الإحسان ومهما لم يكن تلبيس لم يكن أخذ الزيادة ظلما</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 2: Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>He said: 'Indeed, I heard your father and your forefathers reciting this verse on the pulpit: \"Indeed, Allah commands justice (al-'adl) and excellence (al-ihsan) and giving to the near of kin, and forbids indecency (al-fahsha') and the reprehensible (al-munkar) and aggression (al-baghy).

And the likes of these admonishments in the Qur'an are innumerable. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, is the first and primary intended recipient of the admonishment and refinement [tahdhib]; then from him, the light [nur] shines upon all of creation. For he was refined by the Qur'an, and he refined creation by it. And for that reason he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"I was sent to perfect noble character [makarim al-akhlaq]\" — the hadith \"I was sent to perfect noble character\" — Ahmad, Al-Hakim, and Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. It has preceded in the chapter on the manners of companionship.\n\nThen He encouraged creation in the beauties of character by what We presented in the Book of the Disciplining of the Soul [riyadat al-nafs] and the Refinement of Character [tahdhib al-akhlaq], so We shall not repeat it.\n\nThen when Allah, the Exalted, completed his creation, He praised him, saying, the Exalted, \"And indeed, you are of a great character [khuluq 'azim].\" So glory be to Him, how magnificent is His affair and how perfect is His favor! Then look at the vastness of His gentleness [lutf] and the greatness of His bounty [fadl] — how He gave, then He praised! For He is the One who adorned him with noble character [al-khuluq al-karim], then attributed that to him, saying, \"And indeed, you are of a great character.\"\n\nThen the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, made clear to creation that Allah loves noble character [makarim al-akhlaq] and hates base character.

Go, for I have forgiven you.'\"\n\nWe ask God for a good end.\n\nAs for the narrations [āthār]: ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, may God be pleased with him, said to Kumayl: \"O Kumayl, knowledge [‘ilm] is better than wealth. Knowledge [‘ilm] guards you while you guard wealth. Knowledge [‘ilm] is a ruler and wealth is ruled over. Wealth decreases through spending, and knowledge [‘ilm] increases through spending.\"\n\nAnd ‘Alī, may God be pleased with him, also said: \"The scholar [‘ālim] is superior to the one who fasts, prays at night, and struggles [mujāhid]. And when a scholar [‘ālim] dies, a breach is made in Islam that nothing can fill except a successor from him.\"\n\nAnd he, may God be pleased with him, said in verse:\n\"Glory is only for the people of knowledge [ahl al-‘ilm]; indeed they\nAre guides to guidance for whoever seeks guidance.\nThe worth of every man is what he excels in,\nAnd the ignorant [al-jāhilūn] are enemies to the people of knowledge [ahl al-‘ilm].\nSo attain knowledge [‘ilm] and live eternally by it;\nPeople are dead, and the people of knowledge [ahl al-‘ilm] are alive.\"\n\nAnd Abū al-Aswad said: \"There is nothing more precious than knowledge [‘ilm].

And if this knowledge is not realized, it cannot be imagined that the desire for the sold item will vanish. Similarly, whoever knows that what is with Allah remains and that the Hereafter is better and more lasting, meaning its essence is better in itself and more lasting, just as jewels are better and more lasting than snow, for example. And it is not difficult for the owner of snow to sell it for jewels and pearls. Thus is the example of this world and the Hereafter: this world is like snow placed in the sun, constantly melting to extinction, and the Hereafter is like a jewel that has no perishing. So according to the strength of certainty and knowledge of the disparity between this world and the Hereafter, the desire for selling and transaction strengthens, until indeed whoever has strong certainty sells his soul (Nafs) and his wealth, as Allah the Exalted said: \"Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their souls (Anfus) and their wealth in exchange for Paradise for them.\" Then He clarified that their transaction is profitable, so He said: \"So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted.\" So what is needed from knowledge in asceticism (Zuhd) is only this amount: that the Hereafter is better and more lasting. And one may know that yet not be able to abandon this world, either due to weakness in his knowledge and certainty, or due to the domination of desire (Shahwa) in the moment over him and being overpowered in the hand of Satan, or due to his deception by the promises of Satan in procrastination day after day until death snatches him and nothing remains with him except regret after the passing: and to the definition of the baseness of this world, the indication is in His saying: \"Say, the enjoyment of this world is little.\" And to the definition of the preciousness of...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;

Thus did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) command that it be said during anger [23]. And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), when Aisha became angry, would take her by the nose and say: 'O little Aisha, say: O Allah, Lord of the Prophet Muhammad, forgive me my sin, remove the anger of my heart (Qalb), and deliver me from misleading trials (Fitnah)' [24]. It is recommended to say that. If it does not cease with that, then sit if you are standing, and lie down if you are sitting, and draw near to the earth from which you were created, so that you may recognize thereby the lowliness of your soul (Nafs). And seek through sitting and lying down tranquility, for the cause of anger is heat, and the cause of heat is movement. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Anger is an ember kindled in the heart (Qalb)' [25]. Have you not seen the swelling of his veins and the redness of his eyes? So if any of you finds something of that, then if he is standing, let him sit, and if he is sitting, let him lie down. If it does not cease with that, then let him perform ablution (Wudu) with cold water or bathe, for fire is not extinguished except by water. Indeed, he (peace be upon him) said: 'When one of you becomes angry, let him perform ablution (Wudu) with water, for indeed anger is from fire' [26]. And in a narration: 'Anger is from Satan (Shaytan), and Satan (Shaytan) was created from fire, and fire is only extinguished by water, so when one of you becomes angry, let him perform ablution (Wudu).' And Ibn Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'And when you become angry, be silent' [27]. And Abu Huraira said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), when he became angry while standing, would sit, and when he became angry while sitting, would lie down, and his anger would depart [28].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وأما العمل فإن تقول بلسانك أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم. هكذا أمر رسول الله ﷺ أن يقال عند الغيظ[23] وكان رسول الله ﷺ إذا غضبت عائشة أخذ بأنفها وقال \"يا عويش قولي اللهم رب النبي محمد اغفر لي ذنبي وأذهب غيظ قلبي وأجرني من مضلات الفتن\"[24] فيستحب أن تقول ذلك، فإن لم يزل بذلك فاجلس إن كنت قائماً واضجع إن كنت جالساً واقرب من الأرض التي منها خلقت لتعرف بذلك ذل نفسك، واطلب بالجلوس والاضجاع السكون فإن سبب الغضب الحرارة وسبب الحرارة الحركة. فقد قال رسول الله ﷺ \"إن الغضب جمرة توقد في القلب\"[25] ألم تروا إلى انتفاخ أوداجه وحمره عينيه، فإذا وجد أحدكم من ذلك شيئاً فإن كان قائماً فليجلس وإن كان جالساً فلينم، فإن لم يزل ذلك فليتوضاً بالماء البارد أو يغتسل، فإن النار لا يطفئها إلا الماء: فقد قال ﷺ \"إذا غضب أحدكم فليوضأ بالماء فإنما الغضب من النار\"[26] وفي ورارة \"إن الغضب من الشيطان وإن الشيطان خلق من النار وإنما تطفأ النار بالماء فإذا غضب أحدكم فليتوضأ\" وقال ابن عباس: قال رسول الله ﷺ \"وإذا غضبت فاسكت\"[27] وقال أبو هريرة: كان رسول الله ﷺ إذا غضب وهو قائم جلس وإذا غضب وهو جالس اضطجع فيذهب غضبه[28]</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-4.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Prayer</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And when you say 'I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan (Shaytan)', know that he is your enemy and lies in wait to divert your Heart (Qalb) from Allah the Exalted, out of envy toward you for your intimate conversation (Munajat) with Allah the Exalted and your prostration (Sujud) to Him, even though he was cursed due to a single prostration he abandoned and was not granted success in it. And your seeking refuge (Isti'adha) in Allah the Glorified from him is by abandoning what he loves and replacing it with what Allah the Exalted loves, not merely by your statement. For if one whom a predator or enemy intends to devour or kill says 'I seek refuge from you with that impregnable fortress' while remaining in his place, that will not benefit him; rather, nothing will grant him refuge except changing his location. Likewise, one who follows the desires (Shahawat) that are the pleasures of Satan and the displeasures of the Most Merciful (Al-Rahman) will not be helped by mere speech. So let his statement be accompanied by the determination (Al-'Azm) to seek refuge with the fortress of Allah the Exalted from the evil of Satan, and his fortress is 'There is no god but Allah (La ilaha illa Allah)', as He the Exalted said in what our Prophet (peace be upon him) reported: 'There is no god but Allah is my fortress, so whoever enters my fortress is safe from my punishment.' And the one who takes refuge in it has no object of worship except Allah the Glorified. As for one who takes his desire (Hawa) as his god, he is in the arena of Satan, not in the fortress of Allah the Exalted. And know that among his stratagems is to distract you in your prayer (Salah) with remembrance (Dhikr) of the Hereafter and planning good deeds to prevent you from understanding what you recite. Know that everything that distracts you from understanding the meanings of your recitation is whispering (Waswas).

But everything other than Allah the Exalted and other than what is related to Him may also be a field for the Satan (Shaytan), and the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah is what secures its side and makes known that there is no field for the Satan (Shaytan) in it. And a thing is not treated except by its opposite, and the opposite of all the whisperings (Waswasah) of the Satan (Shaytan) is the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah through seeking refuge (Isti'adha) and disavowal of power and strength, and that is the meaning of your saying: 'I seek refuge (A'udhu) in Allah from the accursed Satan (Shaytan) (Al-Rajim)', and 'There is no power nor strength except with Allah the Most High, the Most Great'. And that is not within the capability except of the God-fearing (Muttaqun) upon whom the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah the Exalted predominates. And indeed, the Satan (Shaytan) circulates around them in times of lapses (Falatat) by way of stealth. Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those who fear Allah (Yattaquna) – when an impulse (Ta'if) from the Satan (Shaytan) touches them, they remember (Tadhakkara) and at once they have insight (Mubsirun).' And Mujahid said regarding the meaning of Allah the Exalted's saying: 'From the evil of the retreating whisperer (Al-Waswas Al-Khannas)', he said: 'He is spread out over the Heart (Qalb), so when Allah the Exalted is remembered (Dhikr), he retreats (Khannasa) and contracts, and when he is heedless (Ghafla), he spreads out over his Heart (Qalb).' So the chasing away between the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah the Exalted and the whispering (Waswasah) of the Satan (Shaytan) is like the chasing away between light (Nur) and darkness (Zulmah), and between night (Layl) and day (Nahar). And due to their opposition, Allah the Exalted said: 'Satan (Shaytan) has overcome them and made them forget the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah.' And Anas said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Indeed, the Satan (Shaytan) places his snout (Khurtum) on the Heart (Qalb) of the son of Adam, so if he remembers (Dhikr) Allah the Exalted, he retreats (Khannasa), and if he forgets (Nasiya) Allah the Exalted, he swallows (Iltqama) his Heart (Qalb).'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولا يمحو وسوسة الشيطان من القلب إلا ذكر ما سوى ما يوسوس به لأنه إذا خطر في القلب ذكر شيء انعدم منه ما كان فيه من قبل ولكن كل شيء سوى الله تعالى وسوى ما يتعلق به فيجوز أيضا أن يكون مجالا للشيطان وذكر الله هو الذي يؤمن جانبه ويعلم أنه ليس للشيطان فيه مجال ولا يعالج الشيء إلا بضده وضد جميع وساوس الشيطان ذكر الله بالاستعاذة والتبري عن الحول والقوة وهو معنى قولك أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم ولا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله العلي العظيم وذلك لا يقدر عليه إلا المتقون الغالب عليهم ذكر الله تعالى وإنما الشيطان يطوف عليهم في أوقات الفلتات على سبيل الخلسة قال الله تعالى أن الذين اتقوا إذا مسهم طائف من الشيطان تذكروا فإذا هم مبصرون وقال مجاهد في معنى قول الله تعالى من شر الوسواس الخناس قال هو منبسط على القلب فإذا ذكر الله تعالى خنس وانقبض وإذا غفل انبسط على قلبه فالتطارد بين ذكر الله تعالى ووسوسة الشيطان كالتطارد بين النور والظلام وبين الليل والنهار ولتضادهما قال الله تعالى استحوذ عليهم الشيطان فأنساهم ذكر الله وقال أنس قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إن الشيطان واضع خرطومه على قلب ابن آدم فإن هو ذكر الله تعالى خنس وإن نسي الله تعالى التقم قلبه[46]</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 3: Wonders of the Heart</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And abandonment (Khudhlan). For different meanings require different names. The Angel (Malak) is an expression for a creation that Allah the Exalted created, its affair being the outpouring of good, imparting knowledge, unveiling truth, promising good, and commanding righteousness. He created it and subjugated it for that. And the Satan (Shaytan) is an expression for a creation whose affair is the opposite of that, which is promising evil, commanding indecency, and frightening when intending good with poverty. So whispering (Waswasa) is in opposition to inspiration (Ilham), and Satan is in opposition to the Angel, and success (Tawfiq) is in opposition to abandonment. To this is the allusion in His saying the Exalted: 'And of all things We created pairs' (51:49). For all existents are opposing, paired except Allah the Exalted, for He is singular with no opposite; rather, He is the One True (Al-Wahid Al-Haqq), Creator of all pairs. So the Heart (Qalb) is pulled between Satan and the Angel. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said regarding the Heart: 'There are two promptings (Lamatayn) in the Heart: a prompting from the Angel—promising good and confirming truth—so whoever finds that, let him know it is from Allah the Exalted and let him praise Allah; and a prompting from the enemy—promising evil, denying truth, and forbidding good—so whoever finds that, let him seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan.' Then he recited His saying the Exalted: 'Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to indecency' (2:268). And Al-Hasan said: 'They are but two thoughts (Hamman) that roam in the Heart: a thought from Allah the Exalted and a thought from the enemy. May Allah have mercy on a servant who pauses at his thought: if it is from Allah the Exalted, he proceeds with it; and if it is from his enemy, he fights it.' And for the pulling of the Heart between these two dominators, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'The Heart of the believer is between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful.' Allah is exalted above having a finger composed of flesh, blood, and nerves divided by fingertips. But the spirit (Ruh) of the finger is swift turning and the ability to move and change, for you do not want your finger for its entity but for its action in turning and repeating, just as you undertake actions with your fingers. And Allah the Exalted does what He does by employing the Angel and Satan, and they are subjugated by His power in turning the Hearts, just as your fingers are subjugated to you in turning bodies, for example. And the Heart, by original nature (Fitra), is suitable for accepting the effects of the Angel and for accepting the effects of Satan with equal suitability; neither outweighs the other. Rather, one of the two sides outweighs by following caprice (Hawa) and indulging in desires (Shahawat) or turning away from them and opposing them. For if a human follows the requirement of anger and desire, the domination of Satan appears through caprice, and the Heart becomes the nest and mine of Satan because</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وخذلانا فإن المعاني المختلفة تفتقر إلى أسامي مختلفة والملك عبارة عن خلق خلقه الله تعالى شأنه إفاضة الخير وإفادة العلم وكشف الحق والوعد بالخير والأمر بالمعروف وقد خلقه وسخره لذلك والشيطان عبارة عن خلق شأنه ضد ذلك وهو الوعد بالشر والأمر بالفحشاء والتخويف عند الهم بالخير بالفقر فالوسوسة في مقابلة الإلهام والشيطان في مقابلة الملك والتوفيق في مقابلة الخذلان وإليه الإشارة بقوله تعالى ومن كل شيء خلقنا زوجين فإن الموجودات كلها متقابلة مزدوجة إلا الله تعالى فإنه فرد لا مقابل له بل هو الواحد الحق الخالق للأزواج كلها فالقلب متجاذب بين الشيطان والملك وقد قال صلى الله عليه وسلم في القلب لمة من الملك إيعاد بالخير وتصديق بالحق فمن وجد ذلك فليعلم أنه من الله سبحانه وليحمد الله ولمة من العدو إيعاد بالشر وتكذيب بالحق ونهي عن الخير فمن وجد ذلك فليستعذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم ثم تلا قوله تعالى الشيطان يعدكم الفقر ويأمركم بالفحشاء[41] الآية وقال الحسن إنما هما همان يجولان في القلب هم من الله تعالى وهم من العدو فرحم الله عبدا وقف عند همه فما كان من الله تعالى أمضاه وما كان من عدوه جاهده ولتجاذب القلب بين هذين المسلطين قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلب المؤمن بين أصبعين من أصابع الرحمن[42] فالله يتعالى عن أن يكون له أصبع مركبة من لحم ودم وعصب منقسمة بالأنامل ولكن روح الأصبع سرعة التقليب والقدرة على التحريك والتغيير فإنك لا تريد أصبعك لشخصه بل لفعله في التقليب والترديد كما أنك تتعاطى الأفعال بأصابعك والله تعالى يفعل ما يفعل باستسخار الملك والشيطان وهما مسخران بقدرته في تقليب القلوب كما أن أصابعك مسخرة لك في تقليب الأجسام مثلا والقلب بأصل الفطرة صالح لقبول آثار الملك ولقبول آثار الشيطان صلاحا متساويا ليس يترجح أحدهما على الآخر وإنما يترجح أحد الجانبين باتباع الهوى والإكباب على الشهوات أو الإعراض عنها ومخالفتها فإن اتبع الإنسان مقتضى الغضب والشهوة ظهر تسلط الشيطان بواسطة الهوى وصار القلب عش الشيطان ومعدنه لأن</div></div></div>"}},"99":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"إِنَّهُ","d":"innahu","e":"َsْyَl"},{"b":"1.8","h":"2.25","c":"لَيْسَ","d":"laysa","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.14","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ٌnَٰṭْlُs"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.04","c":"سُلْطَانٌ","d":"sul'ṭānun","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"4.3","h":"5.93","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"4.8","h":"6.55","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"5.9","h":"8.09","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"ٰàَlَʿعَw"},{"b":"7.1","h":"9.27","c":"وَعَلَى","d":"waʿalā","e":"ْmِhِّbَr"},{"b":"7.9","h":"11.11","c":"رَبِّهِمْ","d":"rabbihim","e":"َnwُlَّkَwَtَy"},{"b":"8.9","h":"12.77","c":"يَتَوَكَّلُونَ","d":"yatawakkalūna","e":"āَmَّnِiʾ"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord."}},"100":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"ۥُhُnَٰṭْlُs"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.33","c":"سُلْطَانُهُ","d":"sul'ṭānuhu","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.53","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.13","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"ۥُhَnْwَّlَwَtَy"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.64","c":"يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ","d":"yatawallawnahu","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"},{"b":"6.6","h":"9.45","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"mُh"},{"b":"7.8","h":"11.31","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ۦِhِb"},{"b":"9.2","h":"12.4","c":"بِهِ","d":"bihi","e":"َnwُkِrْhsُm"},{"b":"9.8","h":"13.4","c":"مُشْرِكُونَ","d":"mush'rikūna","e":"āَhdِiʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah."}},"101":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.45","c":"وَإِذَا","d":"wa-idhā","e":"ٓāَnْlَّdَb"},{"b":"0.85","h":"1.59","c":"بَدَّلْنَا","d":"baddalnā","e":"ًẗَyāَء"},{"b":"3.9","h":"4.57","c":"ءَايَةً","d":"āyatan","e":"َnāَkَّm"},{"b":"5.6","h":"6.12","c":"مَكَانَ","d":"makāna","e":"ٍẗَyāَء"},{"b":"6.4","h":"7.92","c":"ءَايَةٍ","d":"āyatin","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"},{"b":"7.7","h":"10.21","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"ُmَlْʿعَaʾ"},{"b":"9.1","h":"11.7","c":"أَعْلَمُ","d":"aʿlamu","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"9.9","h":"12.91","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"ُlِّzَnُy"},{"b":"10.5","h":"13.8","c":"يُنَزِّلُ","d":"yunazzilu","e":"۟āٓwُlāَq"},{"b":"11.6","h":"15.43","c":"قَالُوا","d":"qālū","e":"ٓāَmَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"13.6","h":"17.84","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"َtnَaʾ"},{"b":"14.9","h":"20.78","c":"أَنْتَ","d":"anta","e":"ٍۭrَtْfُm"},{"b":"17.9","h":"22.14","c":"مُفْتَرٍ","d":"muf'tarin","e":"ْlَb"},{"b":"19.2","h":"25.85","c":"بَلْ","d":"bal","e":"ْmُhُrَhtْkَaʾ"},{"b":"19.","h":"26.43","c":"أَكْثَرُهُمْ","d":"aktharuhum","e":"āَl"},{"b":"20.","h":"28.35","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَy"},{"b":"21.2","h":"29.04","c":"يَعْلَمُونَ","d":"yaʿlamūna","e":"ْlُq"}],"a":{"g":"And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse -

Then He attributed guidance to Jibril, so the Exalted said: 'Say: The Spirit of Holiness (Ruh al-Qudus) has brought it down from your Lord with truth' {} and He said: 'He casts the Spirit (Ruh) from His command upon whom He wills of His servants' {} and He attributed misguidance to Iblis, so He said: 'To lead astray from His path' {} and misguidance is preventing the servants from reaching the ultimate wisdom. So see how He attributed it to the servant upon whom He is angry, and guidance is leading them to the ultimate goal, so see how He attributed it to the servant whom He loved. And you have in custom an example for it: if a king needs someone to give him drink and someone to perform cupping and clean the courtyard of his house from filth, and he has two servants, then he does not assign for cupping and cleaning except the ugliest and most base of them, and he does not entrust carrying the drink and perfume except to the best, most complete, and most beloved of them to him. And it is not fitting for you to say: 'This is my action, and was not his action without my action?' For you have erred when you attributed that to yourself; rather, it is He who directed your motivation to specify the disliked action with the disliked person and the beloved action with the beloved person, completing justice. For His justice (Adl) is sometimes accomplished through matters in which you have no involvement, and sometimes it is accomplished in you, for you are also from His actions. So your motivation, your capability, your knowledge, your action, and all the causes of your movements in expression are His action which He arranged with justice, an arrangement from which balanced actions issue, except that you see only yourself, so you think that what appears upon you in the world of witnessing (Alam al-Shahadah) has no cause.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;

Thus, the worldly life is his paradise, since paradise is an expression for the place that gathers all loves. His death is an exit from paradise and a barrier between him and what he desires, and the state of one who is barred between him and what he desires is not hidden. If he has no beloved except Allah, the Exalted, and except His Remembrance (Dhikr), knowledge of Him, and contemplation of Him, and the worldly life and its attachments distract him from the Beloved, then the worldly life is his prison, because prison is an expression for the place that prevents the imprisoned from finding relief in his loves. His death is a standing before his Beloved and a liberation from prison, and the state of one who escapes from prison and is left between him and his Beloved without any barrier or disturbance is not hidden. This is the first thing that everyone who departs from the worldly life encounters immediately after his death from reward and punishment, apart from what Allah has prepared for His righteous servants that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived, and apart from what Allah, the Exalted, has prepared for those who preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter and were pleased with it and felt secure in it—from shackles, chains, fetters, and various kinds of disgrace and punishment. So we ask Allah, the Exalted, to cause us to die as Muslims and join us with the righteous, and there is no hope in the answer to this supplication except by acquiring the love of Allah, the Exalted, and there is no way to it except by removing the love of other than Him from the Heart (Qalb) and cutting off attachments to everything other than Allah, the Exalted, from status, wealth, and homeland. Thus, it is best to supplicate with what our Prophet ﷺ supplicated when he said: 'O Allah, grant me Your love and the love of those who love You and the love of what brings me closer to Your love, and make Your love more beloved to me than cold water.' The purpose is that the dominance of hope at the time of death is better because it is more conducive to love, and the dominance of fear before death is better because it burns the fire of desires and suppresses the love of the worldly life from the Heart (Qalb). Therefore, he ﷺ said: 'Let none of you die except while having good thoughts of his Lord,' and Allah, the Exalted, said: 'I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think of Me what he wills.' And when the death of Sulayman al-Taymi approached, he said to his son: 'O my son, tell me the leniencies and remind me of hope so that I meet Allah with good thoughts of Him.' Likewise, when the death of al-Thawri approached and his distress intensified, he gathered scholars around him to give him hope, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, said to his son at the time of death: 'Remind me of the reports that contain hope and good thoughts.' The intended purpose of all that is that Allah, the Exalted, makes beloved...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فمهما كان القلب الغالب عليه عند الموت حب الأهل والولد والمال والمسكن والعقار والرفقاء والأصحاب فهذا رجل محابه كلها في الدنيا فالدنيا جنته إذ الجنة عبارة عن البقعة الجامعة لجميع المحاب فموته خروج من الجنة وحيلولة بينه وبين ما يشتهيه ولا يخفى حال من يحال بينه وبين ما يشتهيه فإذا لم يكن له محبوب سوى الله تعالى وسوى ذكره ومعرفته والفكر فيه والدنيا وعلائقها شاغلة له عن المحبوب فالدنيا إذن سجنه لأن السجن عبارة عن البقعة المانعة للمحبوس عن الاسترواح إلى محابه فموته قوم على محبوبه وخلاص من السجن ولا يخفى حال من أفلت من السجن وخلى بينه وبين محبوبه بلا مانع ولا مكدر فهذا أول ما يلقاه كل من فارق الدنيا عقيب موته من الثواب والعقاب فضلا عما أعده الله لعباده الصالحين مما لم تره عين ولا تسمعه أذن ولا خطر على قلب بشر وفضلا عما أعد الله تعالى للذين استحبوا الحياة الدنيا على الآخرة ورضوا بها واطمأنوا إليها من الأنكال والسلاسل والأغلال وضروب الخزى والنكال فنسأل الله تعالى أن يتوفانا مسلمين ويلحقنا بالصالحين ولا مطمع في إجابة هذا الدعاء إلا باكتساب حب الله تعالى ولا سبيل إليه إلا بإخراج حب غيره من القلب وقطع العلائق عن كل ما سوى الله تعالى من جاه ومال ووطن فالأولى أن تدعو بما دعا به نبينا ﷺ إذ قال: (اللهم ارزقني حبك وحب من أحبك وحب ما يقربني إلى حبك واجعل حبك أحب إلي من الماء البارد) والغرض أن غلبة الرجاء عند الموت أصلح لأنه أجلب للمحبة وغلبة الخوف قبل الموت أصلح لأنه أحرق لنار الشهوات وأقمع لمحبة الدنيا عن القلب ولذلك قال ﷺ: (لا يموتن أحدكم إلا وهو يحسن الظن بربه) وقال تعالى: (أنا عند ظن عبدي بي فليظن بي ما شاء). ولما حضرت سليمان التيمي الوفاة قال لابنه يا بني حدثني بالرخص واذكر لي الرجاء حتى ألقى الله على حسن الظن به وكذلك لما حضرت الثوري الوفاة واشتد جزعه جمع العلماء حوله يرجونه وقال أحمد بن حنبل رضي الله تعالى عنه لابنه عند الموت اذكر لي الأخبار التي فيها الرجاء وحسن الظن والمقصود من ذلك كله أن يحبب الله تعالى</div></div></div>"}},"108":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"1","c":"أُولَئِكَ","d":"ulāika","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.39","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َʿعَbَṭ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.81","c":"طَبَعَ","d":"ṭabaʿa","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.3","h":"5.74","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"5.1","h":"6.92","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ْmِhِbwُlُq"},{"b":"5.8","h":"7.95","c":"قُلُوبِهِمْ","d":"qulūbihim","e":"ْmِhِʿعْmَsَw"},{"b":"7.2","h":"9.89","c":"وَسَمْعِهِمْ","d":"wasamʿihim","e":"ْmِhِrَٰṣْbَaʾَw"},{"b":"8.6","h":"11.71","c":"وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ","d":"wa-abṣārihim","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾَw"},{"b":"10.","h":"16.82","c":"وَأُولَئِكَ","d":"wa-ulāika","e":"ُmُh"},{"b":"14.0","h":"19.79","c":"هُمُ","d":"humu","e":"َnwُlِfَٰغْlٱ"},{"b":"14.5","h":"20.54","c":"الْغَافِلُونَ","d":"l-ghāfilūna","e":"āَl"}],"a":{"g":"Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision Allah has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless."}},"109":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.45","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َmَrَjg"},{"b":"0.47","h":"1.04","c":"جَرَمَ","d":"jarama","e":"ْmُhَّnَaʾ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.95","c":"أَنَّهُمْ","d":"annahum","e":"àِf"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.77","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ِẗَrِhkāَءْlٱ"},{"b":"3","h":"4.16","c":"الْءَاخِرَةِ","d":"l-ākhirati","e":"ُmُh"},{"b":"4.2","h":"6","c":"هُمُ","d":"humu","e":"َnwُrِsَٰhkْlٱ"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.72","c":"الْخَاسِرُونَ","d":"l-khāsirūna","e":"َّmُht"}],"a":{"g":"Assuredly, it is they, in the Hereafter, who will be the losers.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-8a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Status and Ostentation</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>They desired the fleeting enjoyment (عرض) of this world and its elevation, and preferred it over the Hereafter (الآخرة), and humiliated the religion (الدين) for the sake of this world (الدنيا).

The first to establish the practice of calling the innovators [al-mubtadi'a] to the truth through argumentation was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, when he sent Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, to the Khawarij. He spoke to them, saying, \"What do you find fault with regarding your Imam?\" They said, \"He fought but did not take captives nor spoils.\" He said, \"That was in fighting the disbelievers. Tell me, if 'A'isha, may Allah be pleased with her, were to be taken as a captive in the share of one of you, would you deem lawful for her what you deem lawful from your spoils, when she is your mother according to the clear text of the Book?\" They said, \"No.\" So, two thousand of them returned to obedience due to his argumentation.\n\nAnd it is narrated that Al-Hasan debated a Qadari and he retracted from Qadr (denying divine decree). And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah honor his face, debated a man from the Qadariyya. And 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, debated Yazid ibn 'Umayra regarding faith [al-īmān]. 'Abdullah said, \"If I said I am a believer [mu'min], I would be saying I am in Paradise.\" Yazid ibn 'Umayra said to him, \"O companion of the Messenger of Allah, this is a slip from you. Is faith [al-īmān] not but that you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Resurrection, the Balance, and that you establish prayer, fasting, and zakah? And we have sins; if we knew they would be forgiven for us, we would know we are among the people of Paradise. It is for this reason we say we are believers [mu'minūn] and we do not say we are among the people of Paradise.\" Ibn Mas'ud said, \"You have spoken the truth, by Allah. It was indeed a slip from me.\"\n\nTherefore, it should be said: Their delving into it was little, not much; and short, not long; and when necessary, not by way of authoring books and teaching, and making it a craft. So it is said: As for the littleness of their delving into it, it was due to the rarity of the need, as innovation [al-bid'a] was not manifest in that time. As for its brevity, the goal was only to silence the opponent, his admission, the unveiling of the truth [ḥaqq], and the removal of doubt. So if the opponent's confusion or obstinacy was prolonged, their refutation would inevitably be prolonged, and they would not measure the extent of the need with a scale or a measure after embarking upon it. As for their not undertaking to teach and author books on it, such was their way in jurisprudence [al-fiqh], exegesis [al-tafsīr], and hadith as well. For if authoring books on jurisprudence and positing rare scenarios that only occur infrequently is permissible—either in preparation for their occurrence, even if rare, or to sharpen the intellects—then [the same applies here].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى: ﴿ وجادلهم بالتي هي أحسن ﴾ {} فالصحابة رضي الله عنهم أيضا كانوا يحاجون المنكرين ويجادلون ولكن عند الحاجة وكانت الحاجة إليه قليلة في زمانهم وأول من سن دعوة المبتدعة بالمجادلة إلى الحق علي ابن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه إذ بعث ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما إلى الخوارج فكلمهم فقال ما تنقمون على إمامكم قالوا قاتل ولم يسب ولم يغنم فقال ذلك في قتال الكفار أرأيتم لو سببت عائشة رضي الله عنها في سهم أحدكم أكنتم تستحلون منها ما تستحلون من ملككم وهي أمكم في نص الكتاب فقالوا لا فرجع منهم إلى الطاعة بمجادلته ألفان وروى أن الحسن ناظر قدريا فرجع عن القدر وناظر علي بن أبي طالب كرم الله وجهه رجلا من القدرية وناظر عبد الله بن مسعود رضي الله عنه يزيد بن عميرة في الإيمان قال عبد الله لو قلت إني مؤمن لقلت إني في الجنة فقال له يزيد بن عميرة يا صاحب رسول الله هذه زلة منك وهل الإيمان إلا أن تؤمن بالله وملائكته وكتبه ورسله والبعث والميزان وتقيم الصلاة والصوم والزكاة ولنا ذنوب لو نعلم أنها تغفر لنا لعلمنا أننا من أهل الجنة فمن أجل ذلك نقول إنا مؤمنون ولا نقول إنا من أهل الجنة فقال ابن مسعود صدقت والله إنها مني زلة فينبغي أن يقال كان خوضهم فيه قليلا لا كثيرا وقصيرا لا طويلا وعند الحاجة لا بطريق التصنيف والتدريس واتخاذه صناعة فيقال أما قلة خوضهم فيه فإنه كان لقلة الحاجة إذا لم تكن البدعة تظهر في ذلك الزمان وأما القصر فقد كان الغاية إفحام الخصم واعترافه وانكشاف الحق وإزالة الشبهة فلو طال إشكال الخصم أو لجاجه لطال لا محالة إلزامهم وما كانوا يقدرون قدر الحاجة بميزان ولا مكيال بعد الشروع فيها وأما عدم تصديهم للتدريس والتصنيف فيه فهكذا كان دأبهم في الفقه والتفسير والحديث أيضا فإن جاز تصنيف الفقه ووضع الصور النادرة التي لا تتفق إلا على الندور إما إدخار اليوم وقوعها وإن كان نادرا أو تشحيذا للخواطر</div></div></div>"}},"126":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.15","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"ْmُtْbَqāَʿع"},{"b":"0.62","h":"0.93","c":"عَاقَبْتُمْ","d":"ʿāqabtum","e":"۟āwُbِqāَʿعَf"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.36","c":"فَعَاقِبُوا","d":"faʿāqibū","e":"ِlْhtِmِb"},{"b":"3.2","h":"5.5","c":"بِمِثْلِ","d":"bimith'li","e":"āَm"},{"b":"4.1","h":"6.78","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"mُtْbِqwُʿع"},{"b":"4.4","h":"7.45","c":"عُوقِبْتُمْ","d":"ʿūqib'tum","e":"ۦِhِb"},{"b":"6.6","h":"10.36","c":"بِهِ","d":"bihi","e":"nِyʾَlَw"},{"b":"7.5","h":"12.75","c":"وَلَئِنْ","d":"wala-in","e":"ْmُtْrَbَṣ"},{"b":"9.2","h":"14.17","c":"صَبَرْتُمْ","d":"ṣabartum","e":"َwُhَl"},{"b":"10.3","h":"16.04","c":"لَهُوَ","d":"lahuwa","e":"ٌrْyَhk"},{"b":"10.9","h":"17.04","c":"خَيْرٌ","d":"khayrun","e":"َnyِrِbَّٰṣlِّl"},{"b":"11.8","h":"18.24","c":"لِلصَّابِرِينَ","d":"lilṣṣābirīna","e":"ْrِbْṣٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed.

And know, O my brother, that they do not curse anything, nor harm it, nor belittle it, nor act arrogantly toward it, nor envy anyone, nor are they preoccupied with the worldly life (Dunya). They are the best of people in goodness, the most gentle in disposition, and the most generous in soul (Nafs). Their sign is generosity, their nature is cheerfulness, and their attribute is safety. They are not today in fear and tomorrow in heedlessness, but rather they are constant in their outward state, and between them and their Lord, the raging winds and galloping horses do not reach them. Their hearts ascend with delight to Allah and longing for Him, and they are foremost in racing toward good deeds. \"Those are the party of Allah. Indeed, the party of Allah are the successful.\" The narrator said: So I said: O Abu al-Darda, I have not heard of a description more difficult for me than that description, and how can I attain it? He said: Between you and being in its broadest scope is nothing except that you hate the worldly life (Dunya). For if you hate the worldly life, you turn to the love (Hubb) of the Hereafter (Akhirah), and according to the measure of your love for the Hereafter, you abstain from the worldly life, and according to that measure, you perceive what benefits you. And when Allah knows from a servant (Abd) good seeking, He pours upon him correctness and surrounds him with protection. And know, O son of my brother, that this is in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, the Revealed: \"Indeed, Allah is with those who fear (Ittaqaw) and those who are doers of good (Muhsinun).\" Yahya ibn Kathir said: So we reflected on that, and the delighters have not delighted in anything like the love (Hubb) of Allah and seeking His pleasure. O Allah, make us among the lovers of those who love You, O Lord of the worlds, for none is suitable for Your love except whom You have approved.
