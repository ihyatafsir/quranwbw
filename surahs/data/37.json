The measure that the understanding of creation can bear is that they are an adornment for the heaven, so that the eye may take delight in looking upon them. And He alluded to this by His saying, the Most High: \"Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven [al-samā' al-dunyā] with an adornment of stars.\" (37:6) Thus, all parts of the world [al-ʿālam]—its heaven, its stars, its winds, its seas, its mountains, its minerals, its plants, its animals, and the limbs of its animals—not a single atom [dharrā] of its atoms is devoid of many wisdoms, from one, to ten, to a thousand, to ten thousand. And likewise, the limbs of the animal are divided, except for what is known of their wisdom, such as the knowledge [ʿilm] that the eye is for sight, not for striking, and the hand is for striking, not for walking, and the foot is for walking, not for smelling. But as for the internal limbs—the intestines, the gallbladder, the liver, the kidney, the individual veins, nerves, and muscles, and what is in them of cavities, convolutions, intertwinings, deviations, fineness, thickness, and all other attributes—their wisdom is not known by most people. And those who know them know of them only a very little amount in comparison to what is in the knowledge [ʿilm] of God, the Most High: \"And you have not been given of knowledge except a little.\"

Whoever was upright [istaqama] in this world on the Straight Path [al-Sirat al-Mustaqim] will find the Path of the Hereafter light and will be saved. And whoever deviated from uprightness [istiqama] in the world [dunya] and burdened his back with sins [awzar] and disobeyed will stumble at the first step on the Path and will fall.\n\nSo reflect now on what terror would settle in your heart [fu'ad] if you saw the Path and its fineness, then your sight fell upon the blackness of Hell beneath it, then your hearing was struck by the roaring of the Fire and its rage, and you were charged to walk on the Path despite the weakness of your state, the agitation of your heart [qalb], the trembling of your foot, and the heaviness of your back with sins [awzar] that prevent you from walking on the carpet of the earth, let alone the sharpness of the Path. How then will you be when you place one of your feet upon it and feel its sharpness, and you are compelled to lift the second foot, while the creatures before you are slipping and stumbling, and the guardians of Hell pull them down with hooks and grappling irons, and you look at them as they are turned upside down, their heads descending towards the Fire and their feet raised? Oh, what a sight, how dreadful it is! And what a difficult ascent! And what a narrow passage!\n\nSo look at your state as you crawl upon it and climb it, while you are burdened with your sins [awzar], turning right and left to the creatures as they plummet into the Fire, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, is saying: \"O Lord, grant safety, grant safety!\" And the cries of \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" have risen to you from the depths of Hell due to the multitude of creatures who slipped from the Path.\n\nHow then will you be if your foot slips and your regret does not benefit you, and you cry out \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" and say, \"This is what I used to fear! Oh, would that I had sent ahead for my life! Oh, would that I had taken with the Messenger a way! Oh, woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so as a friend! Oh, would that I were dust! Oh, would that I were forgotten, utterly forgotten! Oh, would that my mother had not borne me!\" And at that, the fires snatch you—we seek refuge in God—and the caller calls out: \"Be driven into it, and do not speak to Me!\" Then no way remains except screaming, groaning, panting, and calling for help.\n\nSo how do you see your intellect now, with these dangers before you? If you are not a believer in that, how long your stay will be with the disbelievers in the depths of Hell!

Whoever was upright [istaqama] in this world on the Straight Path [al-Sirat al-Mustaqim] will find the Path of the Hereafter light and will be saved. And whoever deviated from uprightness [istiqama] in the world [dunya] and burdened his back with sins [awzar] and disobeyed will stumble at the first step on the Path and will fall.\n\nSo reflect now on what terror would settle in your heart [fu'ad] if you saw the Path and its fineness, then your sight fell upon the blackness of Hell beneath it, then your hearing was struck by the roaring of the Fire and its rage, and you were charged to walk on the Path despite the weakness of your state, the agitation of your heart [qalb], the trembling of your foot, and the heaviness of your back with sins [awzar] that prevent you from walking on the carpet of the earth, let alone the sharpness of the Path. How then will you be when you place one of your feet upon it and feel its sharpness, and you are compelled to lift the second foot, while the creatures before you are slipping and stumbling, and the guardians of Hell pull them down with hooks and grappling irons, and you look at them as they are turned upside down, their heads descending towards the Fire and their feet raised? Oh, what a sight, how dreadful it is! And what a difficult ascent! And what a narrow passage!\n\nSo look at your state as you crawl upon it and climb it, while you are burdened with your sins [awzar], turning right and left to the creatures as they plummet into the Fire, and the Messenger, peace be upon him, is saying: \"O Lord, grant safety, grant safety!\" And the cries of \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" have risen to you from the depths of Hell due to the multitude of creatures who slipped from the Path.\n\nHow then will you be if your foot slips and your regret does not benefit you, and you cry out \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" and say, \"This is what I used to fear! Oh, would that I had sent ahead for my life! Oh, would that I had taken with the Messenger a way! Oh, woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so as a friend! Oh, would that I were dust! Oh, would that I were forgotten, utterly forgotten! Oh, would that my mother had not borne me!\" And at that, the fires snatch you—we seek refuge in God—and the caller calls out: \"Be driven into it, and do not speak to Me!\" Then no way remains except screaming, groaning, panting, and calling for help.\n\nSo how do you see your intellect now, with these dangers before you? If you are not a believer in that, how long your stay will be with the disbelievers in the depths of Hell! And if you are a believer in it, yet heedless of it and negligent in preparing for it, how great is your loss and your transgression! And what will benefit you?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فى قوله تعالى: ﴿ فاهدوهم إلى صراط الجحيم. وقفوهم إنهم مسئولون ﴾ فالناس من بعد هذه الأهوال يساقون إلى الصراط وهو جسر ممدود على متن النار أحد من السيف وأدق من الشعر فمن استقام فى هذا العالم على الصراط المستقيم خف على صراط الآخرة ونجا ومن عدل عن الاستقامة فى الدنيا وأثقل ظهره بالأوزار وعصى تعثر فى أول قدم من الصراط وتردى فتفكر الآن فيما يحل من الفزع بفؤادك إذا رأيت الصراط ودقته ثم وقع بصرك على سواد جهنم من تحته ثم قرع سمعك شهيق النار وتغيظها وقد كلفت أن تمشى على الصراط مع ضعف حالك واضطراب قلبك وتزلزل قدمك وثقل ظهرك بالأوزار المانعة لك عن المشى على بساط الأرض فضلا عن حدة الصراط فكيف بك إذا وضعت عليه إحدى رجليك فأحسست بحدته واضطررت إلى أن ترفع القدم الثانية والخلائق بين يديك يزلون ويتعثرون وتتنازلهم زبانية النار بالخطاطيف والكلاليب وانت تنظر إليهم كيف يتنكسون فتتسفل إلى جهة النار رءوسهم وتعلوا أرجلهم فياله من منظر ما أفظعه ومرتقى ما أصعبه ومجاز ما أضيقه فانظر إلى حالك وأنت تزحف عليه وتصعد إليه وأنت مثقل الظهر بأوزارك تلتفت يمينا وشمالا إلى الخلق وهم يتهافتون فى النار والرسول عليه السلام يقول: (يا رب سلم سلم) والزعقات بالويل والثبور قد ارتفعت إليك من قعر جهنم للكثرة من زل عن الصراط من الخلائق فكيف بك لو زلت قدمك ولم ينفعك ندمك فناديت بالويل والثبور وقلت هذا ما كنت أخافه فياليتنى قدمت لحياتي يا ليتنى اتخذت مع الرسول سبيلا يا ويلتا ليتنى لم اتخذ فلانا خليلا يا ليتنى كنت ترابا يا ليتنى كنت نسيا منسيا يا ليت أمى لم تلدنى، وعند ذلك تختطفك النيران والعياذ بالله وينادى المنادى اخسئوا فيها ولا تكلمون فلا يبقى سبيل إلا الصياح والأنين والتنفس والاستغاثة فكيف ترى الآن عقلك وهذه الأخطار بين يديك فإن كنت غير مؤمن بذلك فما أطول مقامك مع الكفار فى دركات جهنم وإن كنت به مؤمنا وعنه غافلا وبالاستعداد له متهاونا فما أعظم خسرانك وطغيانك وماذا ينفعك</div></div></div>"}},"24":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.17","c":"وَقِفُوهُمْ","d":"waqifūhum","e":"ْmُhwُfِqَw"},{"b":"1.8","h":"2.37","c":"إِنَّهُمْ","d":"innahum","e":"mُhَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.44","c":"مَسْءُولُونَ","d":"masūlūna","e":"َnwُlwُٔـْsَّm"}],"a":{"g":"And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned.\""}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.41","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"0.51","h":"1.07","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.12","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.79","c":"تَنَاصَرُونَ","d":"tanāṣarūna","e":"َnwُrَṣāَnَt"}],"a":{"g":"[They will be asked], \"What is [wrong] with you?

Foundation:** The knowledge [ma'rifa] that every originated thing in the world [al-'alam] is His act [fi'l], His creation [khalq], and His invention [ikhtira'], with no creator [khalq] for it other than Him and no originator [muhdith] for it except Him. He created the creation [al-khalq] and fashioned them, and He brought into existence their power [qudra] and their movement [haraka]. Thus, all the actions [af'al] of His servants are created [makhluqa] by Him and connected to His power [qudra], in confirmation of Him in His saying, the Most High: \"Allah is the Creator [Khaliq] of all things\" [39:62], and in His saying, the Most High: \"And Allah created you and what you do\" [37:96], and in His saying, the Most High: \"Whether you conceal your speech or proclaim it, indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts [sudur]\" [67:13]. \"Does He who created not know?\" [67:14] And He is the Subtle, the Acquainted. He commanded the servants to be cautious in their statements, their actions [af'al], their secrets [asrar], and their hidden thoughts, due to His knowledge ['ilm] of the sources of their actions [af'al]. And He argued for the knowledge ['ilm] through the creation [khalq].\n\nAnd how could He not be the Creator [Khaliq] of the servant's action [fi'l], when His power [qudra] is perfect, with no deficiency in it, and it is connected to the movement [haraka] of the servants' bodies? And the movements [harakat] are alike, and the connection of the power [qudra] to them is for their own essence. So what is it that restricts its connection from some movements [harakat] and not others, given their similarity? Or how could the animal be independent in invention [ikhtira'], when from the spider, the bee, and all other animals issue subtle crafts [sana'at] that confound the intellects [uqul] of those of understanding [al-albab]?
