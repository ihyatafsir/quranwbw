Its removal is an individual obligation [fard 'ayn], and it is not removed by mere wishing, but rather by treatment and the application of remedies that suppress it. In its treatment are two stations: the first is the eradication of its root from its origin and the uprooting of its tree from its planting in the heart [qalb].\n\nThe first station is in eradicating its root, and its treatment is both intellectual ['ilmi] and practical ['amali], and healing is not complete except by their combination.\n\nAs for the intellectual: it is that he knows himself and knows his Lord, the Most High, and that suffices him in removing arrogance [kibr]. For whenever he knows himself with true knowledge [ma'rifa], he knows that he is more abased than every abased one and lesser than every small thing, and that nothing befits him except humility [tawadu'], abasement [dhilla], and lowliness. And when he knows his Lord, he knows that grandeur ['azama] and majesty [kibriya'] are only befitting for Allah.\n\nAs for knowing himself, that is also lengthy, but we mention from it what is beneficial in arousing humility [tawadu'] and abasement [dhilla]. It suffices him to know the meaning of a single verse in the Book of Allah, for the Qur'an is the knowledge ['ilm] of the first and the last for one whose insight [basira] has been opened. And He, the Most High, has said: \"Perished is man [insan]; how ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He causes him to die and puts him in a grave. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" (76:1-3)\n\nThe verse has pointed to the first creation of man [insan]: he was not a thing mentioned, and he was in the realm of non-existence for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more vile and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was like that in pre-eternity. Then Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust, then from a sperm-drop [nutfa], then from a clinging clot ['alaqa], then from a lump of flesh [mudgha], then He made him bones, then He clothed the bones with flesh. This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned. He did not become a thing mentioned except while being upon the vilest of descriptions and attributes! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him as an inanimate, dead thing—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance before his knowledge ['ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance before his guidance, and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power.\n\nThis is the meaning of His saying: \"From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed?\" (76:2) and the meaning of His saying: \"Has there [not] come upon man [insan] a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man [insan] from a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed that We may try him...\" (76:1-2) Thus He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Then He made the way easy for him.\" (76:3) This is a reference to what was facilitated for him during the period of his life until death. And similarly He said: \"From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed that We may try him; so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful.\" (76:2-3)\n\nIts meaning is that He gave him life after he was an inanimate, dead thing—dust first and a sperm-drop [nutfa] second. And He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he was lacking vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge ['ilm] after ignorance, and created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence, and enriched him after poverty, and satiated him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him after misguidance.\n\nSo look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man [insan]—how ungrateful he is!—and to the ignorance of man [insan] how He made it manifest? So He said: \"Does not man [insan] see that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfa]? And at once he is a clear adversary. And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, suddenly you were human beings dispersing [throughout the earth].\" (36:77, 30:20)\n\nSo look at the favor [ni'ma] of Allah upon him, how He transferred him from that abasement [dhilla], insignificance, vileness, and filth to this elevation and honor, so he became existent after non-existence, alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing after ignorance, guided after misguidance, capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? He was, in his essence, nothing. And what thing is viler than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence? Then he became, by Allah, a thing.\n\nHe only created him from the abased dust [turab] that is trodden underfoot and the filthy sperm-drop [nutfa] after pure non-existence also to make him know the vileness of his essence, so that he may know himself by it. And He only perfected the favor [ni'ma] upon him so that he may know his Lord by it and know by it His grandeur ['azama] and majesty [jalal], and that majesty [kibriya'] is only befitting for Him, Glorified and Exalted. And for that reason, He bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Have We not made for him two eyes and a tongue and two lips? And have shown him the two ways?\" (90:8-10) And He made known his vileness first, saying: \"Was he not a sperm-drop [nutfa] from semen emitted? Then he was a clinging clot ['alaqa]...\" (75:37-38) Then He mentioned His favor [minna] upon him, saying: \"Then He created and proportioned. And made from him the two sexes, male and female.\" (75:38-39) So that his existence may continue through procreation, just as his existence first occurred through invention.\n\nSo, one whose beginning is this and whose states are these—from where does he get pride, arrogance [kibr], boasting, and haughtiness, when he is, in truth, the vilest of the vile and the weakest of the weak?</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book5</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, he who seeks sufficiency [al-kifayah] from other than Him and abandons reliance [al-tawakkul] is the one who denies this verse.

And the greatest wonder of all is of one who sees beautiful calligraphy or a beautiful design upon a wall, admires it, and then directs all his concern to pondering the designer and the calligrapher—how he designed it and wrote it, and how he mastered it. He continues to hold it in great esteem within himself, saying, \"How skillful he is! How perfect his craftsmanship! How excellent his ability!\" Then he looks upon these wonders within himself and in others, yet he is heedless of its Maker and its Fashioner. His majesty does not astonish him, nor does His grandeur and His wisdom confound him.\n\nThis is but a glimpse of the wonders of your own body, which cannot be fully enumerated. It is the closest field for your reflection [fikr] and the clearest witness to the majesty of your Creator. Yet you are heedless of that, preoccupied with your belly and your private parts. You know nothing of yourself except that you hunger so you eat, become satiated so you sleep, feel desire so you copulate, and become angry so you fight. All the beasts share with you in this knowledge. The specific characteristic of the human being, which the beasts are veiled from, is the knowledge [ma'rifah] of God, the Exalted, through contemplation of the dominion [mulk] of the heavens and the earth and the wonders of the horizons and the souls [anfus]. For through this, the servant enters the company of the angels brought near and is resurrected in the company of the prophets and the truthful, brought near to the Presence [hadrah] of the Lord of the worlds. This station is not for the beasts, nor is it for the human who is content with the desires [shahawat] of the beasts in this world [dunya]. For he is worse than the beasts by far, for the beast has no capacity for that, while he—God created for him the capacity, then he left it idle and was ungrateful for God's favor in it. Those are like cattle; rather, they are more astray in path.\n\nAnd when you know the path of reflection [fikr] within yourself, then reflect upon the earth, which is your resting place, then upon its rivers, its mountains, and its mines. Then ascend from it to the dominion [mulk] of the heavens.\n\nAs for the earth, among His signs is that He created the earth as a carpet and a cradle, and He placed therein broad roads, and He made it subservient that you may travel its tracts, and He made it stable, not moving, and He set therein mountains as pegs for it, preventing it from shaking. Then He expanded its expanses until the children of Adam fell short of reaching all its regions, even if their lifespans were long and their travels many. So the Exalted said: **\"And the heaven—We constructed it with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander. And the earth—We spread it, and excellent are the spreaders.\"** And He, the Exalted, said: **\"It is He who made the earth subservient for you, so walk through its tracts.\"** And He, the Exalted, said: **\"[He] who made for you the earth a carpet.\"** And He has frequently mentioned this in His Mighty Book.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 4</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>None</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 4</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, he who seeks sufficiency [al-kifayah] from other than Him and abandons reliance [al-tawakkul] is the one who denies this verse.

And what thing is more base and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was like this in eternity. Then Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust [turab], then from a drop [nutfah], then from a clinging clot [‘alaqah], then from a chewed lump [mudghah], then He made him bones [‘azman], then He clothed the bones with flesh [lahman]. This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned [shay'an madhkuran]. He did not become a thing mentioned except while in the most base of states and descriptions! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him as a lifeless, dead mineral [jumadan mayyitan]—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance [jahl] before his knowledge [‘ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance [dalalah] before his guidance [huda], and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power. This is the meaning of His saying, \"From what thing did We create man?

Indeed, We created man from a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] to test him.\" Likewise, He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Then the way [al-sabil] We made easy for him.\" And this is a reference to what was made easy for him during the period of his life until death. And likewise He said, \"From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] We test him, so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way [al-sabil]—whether he be grateful or ungrateful.\" Its meaning is that He gave him life after he was a lifeless, dead mineral, dust [turab] first and a drop [nutfah] second; and He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he was devoid of vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge [‘ilm] after ignorance [jahl]; and He created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence; and enriched him after poverty, and satisfied him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him [hadahu] after misguidance [dalalah]. So look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way [al-sabil] how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man how ungrateful he is, and to the ignorance [jahl] of man how He manifests it? So He said, \"Does man not consider that We created him from a drop [nutfah]? Then at once he is a clear adversary. And of His signs is that He created you from dust [turab]; then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.\" So look at the favor of Allah upon him, how He transferred him from that lowliness, insignificance, baseness, and filth to this elevation and honor—so he became existent after non-existence [‘adam], alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing [‘aliman] after ignorance [jahl], guided [mahdiyyan] after misguidance [dalalah], capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? For in his essence he was nothing [la shay'a]—and what thing is more base than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd]? Then, by Allah, he became something [shay'an]. He only created him from the lowly dust [al-turab al-dhalil] that is trodden underfoot and the filthy drop [al-nutfah al-qadirah] after pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd] also, so that He might make him know the baseness of his essence, that he may thereby know himself. And He only perfected the favor upon him so that he may know by it his Lord and know by it His greatness and majesty, and that grandeur [al-kibriya'] is not fitting except for Him, Glorified and Exalted. And for that reason, He bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Have We not made for him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips, and guided him [hadaynahu] to the two ways [al-najdayn]?\" And He made known his baseness first, saying, \"Was he not a drop of sperm emitted?

And knowledge [ma'rifa] of Him is not realized except through the total absorption of thought [fikr] in His Essence, His Attributes, and His Actions, for there is nothing in existence besides Him and His actions. And the continuity of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] will not be facilitated except by abandoning the world [dunya] and its desires, and restricting oneself from it to the measure of necessity. And that is not accomplished except by occupying all the times of night and day with the duties of remembrances [adhkar] and contemplations [afkar].\n\nThe soul [nafs], due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not have patience for a single pattern of the means of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr]. Rather, if it is returned to it, it shows aversion. And God, the Exalted, does not tire until you tire. So from the necessity of gentleness with it is to refresh it by moving from one mode to another and from one type to another according to each time, so that its pleasure [ladhdha] increases through the transition, its desire [raghba] is magnified by the pleasure, and its adherence [muwazaba] endures through the endurance of the desire. For that reason, the litanies [awrad] are divided into different divisions.\n\nAnd it is necessary that remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] occupy all times or most of them. For the soul [nafs], by its nature, is inclined to the pleasures [ladhadh] of the world [dunya]. So if the servant spends half of his times on the arrangements and permissible desires of the world [dunya] and the other half on acts of worship, the side of inclination to the world [dunya] outweighs due to its conformity with nature [tab'], since the time is equal. So how can they be balanced when nature [tab'] gives weight to one of them? For the outward and inward assist each other in the matters of the world [dunya], and the heart [qalb] becomes pure and single-minded in seeking it. As for being turned back to acts of worship, it is forced, and the sincerity [ikhlas] and presence [hudur] of the heart [qalb] in it are not safe except at some times.\n\nSo whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him occupy all his times in obedience [ta'a]. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to outweigh and the balances of his goodness to be heavy, let him occupy most of his times in obedience [ta'a]. If he mixes a righteous deed with another that is evil, then his affair is perilous. But hope is not cut off, and pardon from the generosity of God is awaited. Perhaps God, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty and generosity.\n\nThis is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [basira]. If you are not of its people, then look at the address of God, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [iman]. For God, the Exalted, has said: **\"And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening, and during the night prostrate to Him and glorify Him a long night.\"** This indicates that the path to God, the Exalted, is the vigilance over times and populating them with litanies [awrad] in a manner of continuity, to achieve the continuity of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] in all periods of night and day.

And constant remembrance and reflection will not be made easy except by bidding farewell to the world [dunya] and its desires and being content with it only to the extent of sufficiency and necessity, and all of that is not perfected except by immersing the times of night and day in the duties of remembrances and reflections. And the soul [nafs], due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not have patience for a single mode of the means that assist in remembrance and reflection; rather, if it is returned to one pattern, it displays boredom and a sense of burden, and indeed God, the Exalted, does not weary until you weary.

So they busied themselves with calling the creation to the True, Eternal Kingdom [al-Mulk al-Haqiqi] over the metaphorical kingdom [al-mulk al-majazi] which has no reality if it is safe, and no permanence at all. So they called out among them: **\"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah, you adhere heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya] from the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of the life of this world compared to the Hereafter except a little.\"** (Quran 9:38) So the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Criterion [al-Furqan], the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham, and every revealed Book—none was sent down except to call the creation to the Everlasting, Eternal Kingdom. And what is intended for them is that they be kings in this world and kings in the Hereafter. As for kingship in this world, it is through asceticism [zuhd] in it and contentment with the little of it. And as for kingship in the Hereafter, it is through nearness to Allah, the Most High, attained by a permanence [baqa'] in which there is no annihilation, and a might ['izz] in which there is no humiliation, and a coolness of the eye [qurrat 'ayn] concealed in this world, which no soul [nafs] among the souls knows. And Satan calls them to kingship in this world, knowing that the kingship of the Hereafter is lost by it, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives. And knowing that this world will not be safe for him either, for even if it were safe for him, he would envy it also. But kingship in this world is not free from disputes, disturbances, the length of worries in management, and likewise all the causes of status. Then, however much it is secured and the causes are perfected, the lifespan ends. **\"Until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people think that they have control over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday.\"** (Quran 10:24) So Allah, the Most High, struck a parable for it, saying, the Most High: **\"And present to them the example of the life of this world as [being] like water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds.\"** (Quran 18:45) And asceticism [zuhd] in this world, because it is a present kingship, Satan envied it and turned them away from it. And the meaning of asceticism is that the servant masters his passion [shahwa] and his anger [ghadab], so they become subservient to the motive of religion and the indication of faith.
