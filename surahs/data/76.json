From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj].\" The verse has pointed to the first creation of man: he was not a thing mentioned [shay'an madhkuran], and he was in the realm of non-existence [‘adam] for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more base and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was like this in eternity. Then Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust [turab], then from a drop [nutfah], then from a clinging clot [‘alaqah], then from a chewed lump [mudghah], then He made him bones [‘azman], then He clothed the bones with flesh [lahman]. This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned [shay'an madhkuran]. He did not become a thing mentioned except while in the most base of states and descriptions! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him as a lifeless, dead mineral [jumadan mayyitan]—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance [jahl] before his knowledge [‘ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance [dalalah] before his guidance [huda], and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power. This is the meaning of His saying, \"From what thing did We create man? From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj],\" and the meaning of His saying, \"Has there come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man from a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] to test him.\" Likewise, He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Then the way [al-sabil] We made easy for him.\" And this is a reference to what was made easy for him during the period of his life until death. And likewise He said, \"From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] We test him, so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way [al-sabil]—whether he be grateful or ungrateful.\" Its meaning is that He gave him life after he was a lifeless, dead mineral, dust [turab] first and a drop [nutfah] second; and He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he was devoid of vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge [‘ilm] after ignorance [jahl]; and He created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence; and enriched him after poverty, and satisfied him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him [hadahu] after misguidance [dalalah]. So look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way [al-sabil] how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man how ungrateful he is, and to the ignorance [jahl] of man how He manifests it? So He said, \"Does man not consider that We created him from a drop [nutfah]? Then at once he is a clear adversary. And of His signs is that He created you from dust [turab]; then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.\" So look at the favor of Allah upon him, how He transferred him from that lowliness, insignificance, baseness, and filth to this elevation and honor—so he became existent after non-existence [‘adam], alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing [‘aliman] after ignorance [jahl], guided [mahdiyyan] after misguidance [dalalah], capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? For in his essence he was nothing [la shay'a]—and what thing is more base than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd]? Then, by Allah, he became something [shay'an]. He only created him from the lowly dust [al-turab al-dhalil] that is trodden underfoot and the filthy drop [al-nutfah al-qadirah] after pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd] also, so that He might make him know the baseness of his essence, that he may thereby know himself. And He only perfected the favor upon him so that he may know by it his Lord and know by it His greatness and majesty, and that grandeur [al-kibriya'] is not fitting except for Him, Glorified and Exalted. And for that reason, He bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Have We not made for him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips, and guided him [hadaynahu] to the two ways [al-najdayn]?\" And He made known his baseness first, saying, \"Was he not a drop of sperm emitted? Then he was a clinging clot [‘alaqah].\" Then He mentioned His favor upon him, saying, \"Then He created and proportioned, and made from him the two sexes, male and female,\" so that his existence may continue through procreation, just as his existence first occurred through invention. So, he whose beginning is this and whose states are these—from where does he get arrogance, grandeur [al-kibriya'], pride, and boastfulness, when he is, in truth, the basest of the base and the weakest of the weak?\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"إِنَّا","d":"ʾinِāَّ","e":"innā"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.22","c":"هَدَيْنَاهُ","d":"hdَyَnْhَُٰ","e":"hadaynāhu"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.09","c":"السَّبِيلَ","d":"lٱsbَّyِlَ","e":"l-sabīla"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.66","c":"إِمَّا","d":"ʾimِāَّ","e":"immā"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.17","c":"شَاكِرًا","d":"shāَkrِāً","e":"shākiran"},{"b":"5.9","h":"8.64","c":"وَإِمَّا","d":"wʾَimِāَّ","e":"wa-immā"},{"b":"8.3","h":"11.26","c":"كَفُورًا","d":"kfَwُrāً","e":"kafūran"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful."}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"إِنَّا","d":"ʾinِāَّٓ","e":"innā"},{"b":"2.4","h":"1.19","c":"أَعْتَدْنَا","d":"ʾaعَʿtْdَnْāَ","e":"aʿtadnā"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.79","c":"لِلْكَافِرِينَ","d":"llِkْfَٰrِyِnَ","e":"lil'kāfirīna"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.3","c":"سَلَاسِلَا","d":"slَsَٰlِāَ۟","e":"salāsilā"},{"b":"6.1","h":"9.02","c":"وَأَغْلَالًا","d":"wʾَaغَlْlَٰāً","e":"wa-aghlālan"},{"b":"7.2","h":"11","c":"وَسَعِيرًا","d":"wsَعَʿyِrāً","e":"wasaʿīran"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze."}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.55","c":"إِنَّ","d":"ʾinَِّ","e":"inna"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.77","c":"الْأَبْرَارَ","d":"lٱʾْabَrْāَrَ","e":"l-abrāra"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.73","c":"يَشْرَبُونَ","d":"ysَhrْbَwُnَ","e":"yashrabūna"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.66","c":"مِنْ","d":"mnِ","e":"min"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.6","c":"كَأْسٍ","d":"kʾَasٍْ","e":"kasin"},{"b":"5.9","h":"8.33","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāَnَ","e":"kāna"},{"b":"6.6","h":"9.47","c":"مِزَاجُهَا","d":"mzِāَgjhُāَ","e":"mizājuhā"},{"b":"7.8","h":"11.52","c":"كَافُورًا","d":"kāَfwُrāً","e":"kāfūran"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, the righteous will drink from a cup [of wine] whose mixture is of Kafur,"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.2","c":"عَيْنًا","d":"عʿyَnْāً","e":"ʿaynan"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.08","c":"يَشْرَبُ","d":"ysَhrْbَُ","e":"yashrabu"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.07","c":"بِهَا","d":"bhِāَ","e":"bihā"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.01","c":"عِبَادُ","d":"عʿbِāَdُ","e":"ʿibādu"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.77","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"lٱlhَِّ","e":"l-lahi"},{"b":"4.5","h":"6.74","c":"يُفَجِّرُونَهَا","d":"yfُgَjrِّwُnhَāَ","e":"yufajjirūnahā"},{"b":"6.3","h":"9.69","c":"تَفْجِيرًا","d":"tfَgْjyِrāً","e":"tafjīran"}],"a":{"g":"A spring of which the [righteous] servants of Allah will drink;

font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; color: #777;\">\n                Indeed, love [mahabba] and intimacy [uns] are not attained except through the constant remembrance [dhikr] of the Beloved and persistence in it, and knowledge [ma'rifa] of God, glorified is He, is not attained except through constant reflection [fikr] upon Him and His attributes and His actions, for in existence there is nothing but God, the Exalted, and His actions. And constant remembrance and reflection will not be made easy except by bidding farewell to the world [dunya] and its desires and being content with it only to the extent of sufficiency and necessity, and all of that is not perfected except by immersing the times of night and day in the duties of remembrances and reflections. And the soul [nafs], due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not have patience for a single mode of the means that assist in remembrance and reflection; rather, if it is returned to one pattern, it displays boredom and a sense of burden, and indeed God, the Exalted, does not weary until you weary. So from the necessity of gentleness with it is that it be refreshed by shifting from one mode to another and from one type to another according to each time, so that its pleasure is increased by the transition, and its desire is magnified by the pleasure, and its persistence endures through the endurance of desire. Therefore, the litanies [awrad] are divided into different divisions, and remembrance and reflection should encompass all times or most of them. For the soul, by its nature, is inclined to the pleasures of the world; if the servant spends half his times on the arrangements of the world and its permissible desires, for example, and the other half on acts of worship, the side of inclination to the world is given weight because it agrees with his nature, since the time is equal—so how can they be balanced when nature gives weight to one of them, for the outward and inward cooperate in worldly matters and the heart [qalb] becomes pure and single-minded in seeking them? As for being turned back to acts of worship, it is forced, and the sincerity [ikhlas] of the heart and its presence therein is not safe except at some times. So whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him immerse his times in obedience. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to be given weight and the balances of his goodness to be heavy, let him occupy most of his times in obedience. If he mixes a righteous deed with another evil one, then his affair is perilous, but hope is not cut off, and pardon from the generosity of God is awaited; perhaps God, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty and generosity. This is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [basira]; if you are not of its people, then look to the address of God, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [iman], for God, the Exalted, has said: **\"And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening\"**, making clear that the path to God, the Exalted, is the observance of times and populating them with litanies on the path of constancy, to realize the constant remembrance and reflection which is the foundation of love and knowledge.\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"26":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"وَمِنَ","d":"wmَnَِ","e":"wamina"},{"b":"0.57","h":"1.3","c":"اللَّيْلِ","d":"lٱyَّlِْ","e":"al-layli"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.55","c":"فَاسْجُدْ","d":"fsٱَgْjdُْ","e":"fa-us'jud"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.88","c":"لَهُ","d":"lhَۥُ","e":"lahu"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.95","c":"وَسَبِّحْهُ","d":"wsَbَḥِّhُْ","e":"wasabbiḥ'hu"},{"b":"3.7","h":"7.02","c":"لَيْلًا","d":"lyَlْāً","e":"laylan"},{"b":"4.4","h":"8.73","c":"طَوِيلًا","d":"ṭwَyِlāً","e":"ṭawīlan"}],"a":{"g":"And during the night prostrate to Him and exalt Him a long [part of the] night."}},"27":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.55","c":"إِنَّ","d":"ʾinَِّ","e":"inna"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.02","c":"هَؤُلَاءِ","d":"hʾَٰٓwlُāَءِٓ","e":"hāulāi"},{"b":"5.1","h":"5.66","c":"يُحِبُّونَ","d":"yḥُbِwُّnَ","e":"yuḥibbūna"},{"b":"6.2","h":"7.78","c":"الْعَاجِلَةَ","d":"lٱعْʿāَgjlِẗََ","e":"l-ʿājilata"},{"b":"7.4","h":"9.94","c":"وَيَذَرُونَ","d":"wyَdَhrَwُnَ","e":"wayadharūna"},{"b":"8.6","h":"12.07","c":"وَرَاءَهُمْ","d":"wrَāَءٓhَmُْ","e":"warāahum"},{"b":"11.3","h":"14.97","c":"يَوْمًا","d":"ywَmْāً","e":"yawman"},{"b":"12.6","h":"16.82","c":"ثَقِيلًا","d":"thqَyِlāً","e":"thaqīlan"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, these [disbelievers] love the immediate and leave behind them a grave Day.","ihya":"\n        <div class=\"ihya-tafsir-box\" style=\"margin-top: 15px; border-top: 1px solid #eee; padding-top: 10px;\">\n            <h5 style=\"color: #91740c; font-family: Cabin, sans-serif;\">Tafsir Al-Ihya</h5>\n            <div class=\"ihya-arabic\" style=\"font-family: IndoPak; font-size: 18px; text-align: right; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #555;\">\n                ولما استطار مكر الشيطان في كافة الخلق ارسل الله الملائكة الى الرسل وأوحوا إليهم ما تم على الخلق من اهلاك العدو واغوائه فاشتغلوا بدعوة الخلق الى الملك الحقيقي عن الملك المجازي الذي لا اصل له ان سلم ولا دوام له اصلا فنادوا فيهم ﴿ يا ايها الذين امنوا ما لكم اذا قيل لكم انفروا في سبيل الله اثاقلتم الى الارض أرضيتم بالحياة الدنيا من الاخرة فما متاع الحياة الدنيا في الاخرة الا قليل ﴾ {} فالتوراة والانجيل والزبور والفرقان وصحف موسى وابراهيم وكل كتاب منزل ما أنزل إلالدعوة الخلق الى الملك الدائم المخلد والمراد منهم ان يكونوا ملوكا في الدنيا ملوكا في الآخرة اما ملك الدنيا فالزهد فيها والقناعة باليسير منها واما ملك الآخرة فبالقرب من الله تعالى يدرك بقاء لا فناء فيه وعزا لا ذل فيه وقرة عين اخفيت في هذا العالم لا تعلمها نفس من النفوس والشيطان يدعوهم الى ملك الدنيا لعلمه بان ملك الاخرة يفوت به اذ الدنيا والاخرة ضرتان ولعلمه بأن الدنيا لا تسلم له ايضا ولو كانت تسلم له لكان يحسده ايضا ولكن ملك الدنيا لا يخلو عن المنازعات والمكدرات وطول الهموم في التدبيرات وكذا سائر اسباب الجاه ثم مهما تسلم وتتم الاسباب ينقضي العمر ﴿ حتى اذا اخذت الارض زخرفها وازينت وظن اهلها انهم قادرون عليها اتاها امرنا ليلا او نهارا فجعلناها حصيدا كأن لم تغن بالأمس ﴾ {} فضرب الله تعالى لها مثلا فقال تعالى: ﴿ واضرب لهم مثل الحياة الدنيا كماء انزلناه من السماء فاختلط به نبات الأرض فأصبح هشيما تذروه الرياح ﴾ {} والزهد في الدنيا لما ان كان ملكا حاضرا حسده الشيطان عليه فصده عنه ومعنى الزهد ان يملك العبد شهوته وغضبه فينقادان لباعث الدين واشارة الايمان وهذا ملك بالاستحقاق اذ به يصير صاحبه حرا وباستيلاء الشهوة عليه يصير\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"ihya-english\" style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; color: #777;\">\n                Indeed, when the cunning [makr] of Satan spread among all creation, Allah sent the angels to the messengers and revealed to them what the enemy had accomplished in destroying and misleading the creation. So they busied themselves with calling the creation to the True, Eternal Kingdom [al-Mulk al-Haqiqi] over the metaphorical kingdom [al-mulk al-majazi] which has no reality if it is safe, and no permanence at all. So they called out among them: **\"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah, you adhere heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya] from the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of the life of this world compared to the Hereafter except a little.\"** (Quran 9:38) So the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Criterion [al-Furqan], the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham, and every revealed Book—none was sent down except to call the creation to the Everlasting, Eternal Kingdom. And what is intended for them is that they be kings in this world and kings in the Hereafter. As for kingship in this world, it is through asceticism [zuhd] in it and contentment with the little of it. And as for kingship in the Hereafter, it is through nearness to Allah, the Most High, attained by a permanence [baqa'] in which there is no annihilation, and a might ['izz] in which there is no humiliation, and a coolness of the eye [qurrat 'ayn] concealed in this world, which no soul [nafs] among the souls knows. And Satan calls them to kingship in this world, knowing that the kingship of the Hereafter is lost by it, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives. And knowing that this world will not be safe for him either, for even if it were safe for him, he would envy it also. But kingship in this world is not free from disputes, disturbances, the length of worries in management, and likewise all the causes of status. Then, however much it is secured and the causes are perfected, the lifespan ends. **\"Until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people think that they have control over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday.\"** (Quran 10:24) So Allah, the Most High, struck a parable for it, saying, the Most High: **\"And present to them the example of the life of this world as [being] like water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds.\"** (Quran 18:45) And asceticism [zuhd] in this world, because it is a present kingship, Satan envied it and turned them away from it. And the meaning of asceticism is that the servant masters his passion [shahwa] and his anger [ghadab], so they become subservient to the motive of religion and the indication of faith. And this is a kingship by deserving [istihqaq], for by it its possessor becomes free, and by the domination of passion over him, he becomes...\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"28":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.9","c":"نَحْنُ","d":"nḥَّnُْ","e":"naḥnu"},{"b":"0.55","h":"1.67","c":"خَلَقْنَاهُمْ","d":"khlَqَnْhَٰmُْ","e":"khalaqnāhum"},{"b":"1.9","h":"4.08","c":"وَشَدَدْنَا","d":"wsَhdَdَnْāَٓ","e":"washadadnā"},{"b":"2.6","h":"5.74","c":"أَسْرَهُمْ","d":"ʾasَrْhَmُْ","e":"asrahum"},{"b":"6.1","h":"8.68","c":"وَإِذَا","d":"wʾَidِhāَ","e":"wa-idhā"},{"b":"6.8","h":"10.07","c":"شِئْنَا","d":"shʾِynْāَ","e":"shi'nā"},{"b":"7.6","h":"11.6","c":"بَدَّلْنَا","d":"bdَlَّnْāَٓ","e":"baddalnā"},{"b":"8.4","h":"13.09","c":"أَمْثَالَهُمْ","d":"ʾamَtْhlَٰhَmُْ","e":"amthālahum"},{"b":"11.","h":"16.92","c":"تَبْدِيلًا","d":"tbَdْyِlāً","e":"tabdīlan"}],"a":{"g":"We have created them and strengthened their forms, and when We will, We can change their likenesses with [complete] alteration."}},"29":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"إِنَّ","d":"ʾinَِّ","e":"inna"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.84","c":"هَذِهِ","d":"hdَٰhhِۦِ","e":"hādhihi"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.63","c":"تَذْكِرَةٌ","d":"tdَhkْrِẗٌَ","e":"tadhkiratun"},{"b":"3.5","h":"7.35","c":"فَمَنْ","d":"fmَnَ","e":"faman"},{"b":"4.7","h":"8.5","c":"شَاءَ","d":"shāَءَٓ","e":"shāa"},{"b":"6.5","h":"10.55","c":"اتَّخَذَ","d":"tٱkَّhdَhَ","e":"ittakhadha"},{"b":"7.4","h":"11.93","c":"إِلَى","d":"ʾilِàَٰ","e":"ilā"},{"b":"7.9","h":"12.97","c":"رَبِّهِ","d":"rbَhِّۦِ","e":"rabbihi"},{"b":"8.9","h":"14.8","c":"سَبِيلًا","d":"sbَyِlāً","e":"sabīlan"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, this is a reminder, so he who wills may take to his Lord a way."}},"30":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.74","c":"وَمَا","d":"wmَāَ","e":"wamā"},{"b":"0.57","h":"1.59","c":"تَشَاءُونَ","d":"tsَhāَءٓwُnَ","e":"tashāūna"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.55","c":"إِلَّا","d":"ʾilِāَّٓ","e":"illā"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.94","c":"أَنْ","d":"ʾanَ","e":"an"},{"b":"6.2","h":"8.1","c":"يَشَاءَ","d":"ysَhāَءَٓ","e":"yashāa"},{"b":"8.7","h":"10.67","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"lٱlhَُّ","e":"l-lahu"},{"b":"11.0","h":"14.45","c":"إِنَّ","d":"ʾinَِّ","e":"inna"},{"b":"11.9","h":"15.7","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"lٱlhََّ","e":"l-laha"},{"b":"12.7","h":"17.13","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāَnَ","e":"kāna"},{"b":"13.3","h":"18.1","c":"عَلِيمًا","d":"عʿlَyِmāً","e":"ʿalīman"},{"b":"14.2","h":"19.87","c":"حَكِيمًا","d":"ḥkَyِmāً","e":"ḥakīman"}],"a":{"g":"And you do not will except that Allah wills.
