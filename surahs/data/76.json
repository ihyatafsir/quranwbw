Its removal is an individual obligation [fard 'ayn], and it is not removed by mere wishing, but rather by treatment and the application of remedies that suppress it. In its treatment are two stations: the first is the eradication of its root from its origin and the uprooting of its tree from its planting in the heart [qalb].\n\nThe first station is in eradicating its root, and its treatment is both intellectual ['ilmi] and practical ['amali], and healing is not complete except by their combination.\n\nAs for the intellectual: it is that he knows himself and knows his Lord, the Most High, and that suffices him in removing arrogance [kibr]. For whenever he knows himself with true knowledge [ma'rifa], he knows that he is more abased than every abased one and lesser than every small thing, and that nothing befits him except humility [tawadu'], abasement [dhilla], and lowliness. And when he knows his Lord, he knows that grandeur ['azama] and majesty [kibriya'] are only befitting for Allah.\n\nAs for knowing himself, that is also lengthy, but we mention from it what is beneficial in arousing humility [tawadu'] and abasement [dhilla]. It suffices him to know the meaning of a single verse in the Book of Allah, for the Qur'an is the knowledge ['ilm] of the first and the last for one whose insight [basira] has been opened. And He, the Most High, has said: \"Perished is man [insan]; how ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He causes him to die and puts him in a grave. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" (76:1-3)\n\nThe verse has pointed to the first creation of man [insan]: he was not a thing mentioned, and he was in the realm of non-existence for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more vile and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was like that in pre-eternity. Then Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust, then from a sperm-drop [nutfa], then from a clinging clot ['alaqa], then from a lump of flesh [mudgha], then He made him bones, then He clothed the bones with flesh. This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned. He did not become a thing mentioned except while being upon the vilest of descriptions and attributes! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him as an inanimate, dead thing—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance before his knowledge ['ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance before his guidance, and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power.\n\nThis is the meaning of His saying: \"From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed?\" (76:2) and the meaning of His saying: \"Has there [not] come upon man [insan] a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man [insan] from a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed that We may try him...\" (76:1-2) Thus He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Then He made the way easy for him.\" (76:3) This is a reference to what was facilitated for him during the period of his life until death. And similarly He said: \"From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed that We may try him; so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful.\" (76:2-3)\n\nIts meaning is that He gave him life after he was an inanimate, dead thing—dust first and a sperm-drop [nutfa] second. And He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he was lacking vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge ['ilm] after ignorance, and created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence, and enriched him after poverty, and satiated him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him after misguidance.\n\nSo look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man [insan]—how ungrateful he is!—and to the ignorance of man [insan] how He made it manifest? So He said: \"Does not man [insan] see that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfa]? And at once he is a clear adversary. And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, suddenly you were human beings dispersing [throughout the earth].\" (36:77, 30:20)\n\nSo look at the favor [ni'ma] of Allah upon him, how He transferred him from that abasement [dhilla], insignificance, vileness, and filth to this elevation and honor, so he became existent after non-existence, alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing after ignorance, guided after misguidance, capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? He was, in his essence, nothing. And what thing is viler than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence? Then he became, by Allah, a thing.\n\nHe only created him from the abased dust [turab] that is trodden underfoot and the filthy sperm-drop [nutfa] after pure non-existence also to make him know the vileness of his essence, so that he may know himself by it. And He only perfected the favor [ni'ma] upon him so that he may know his Lord by it and know by it His grandeur ['azama] and majesty [jalal], and that majesty [kibriya'] is only befitting for Him, Glorified and Exalted. And for that reason, He bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Have We not made for him two eyes and a tongue and two lips? And have shown him the two ways?\" (90:8-10) And He made known his vileness first, saying: \"Was he not a sperm-drop [nutfa] from semen emitted? Then he was a clinging clot ['alaqa]...\" (75:37-38) Then He mentioned His favor [minna] upon him, saying: \"Then He created and proportioned. And made from him the two sexes, male and female.\" (75:38-39) So that his existence may continue through procreation, just as his existence first occurred through invention.\n\nSo, one whose beginning is this and whose states are these—from where does he get pride, arrogance [kibr], boasting, and haughtiness, when he is, in truth, the vilest of the vile and the weakest of the weak?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن الكبر من المهلكات ولا يخلو أحد من الخلق عن شيء منه، وإزالته فرض عين ولا يزول بمجرد التمني بل بالمعالجة واستعمال الأدوية القامعة له. وفي معالجته مقامان أحدهما استئصال أصله من سنخه وقلع شجرته من مغرسها في القلب. المقام الأول في استئصال أصله، وعلاجه علمي وعملي، ولا يتم الشفاء إلا بمجموعهما: أما العلمي: فهو أن يعرف نفسه ويعرف ربه تعالى ويكفيه ذلك في إزالة الكبر، فإنه مهما عرف نفسه حق المعرفة علم أنه أذل من كل ذليل وأقل من كل قليل، وأنه لا يليق به إلا التواضع والذلة والمهانة، وإذا عرف ربه علم أنه لا تليق العظمة والكبرياء إلا بالله، وأما معرفته نفسه فهو أيضاً يطول ولكن نذكر من ذلك ما ينفع في إثارة التواضع والمذلة، ويكفيه أن يعرف معنى آية واحدة في كتاب الله فإن القرآن علم الأولين والآخرين لمن فتحت بصيرته وقد قال تعالى \"قتل الإنسان ما أكفره من أي شيء خلقه من نطفة خلقه فقدره ثم السبيل يسره ثم أماته فأقبره ثم إذا شاء أنشره\" فقد أشارت الآية إلى أول خلق الإنسان فهو أنه لم يكن شيئاً مذكوراً وقد كان في حيز العدم دهوراً بل لم يكن لعدمه أول وأي شيء أخس وأقل من المحو والعدم؟ وقد كان كذلك في القدم، ثم خلقه الله من أرذل الأشياء، ثم من أقذرها إذ قد خلقه من تراب، ثم من نطفة، ثم من علقة، ثم من مضغة، ثم جعله عظماً، ثم كسا العظم لحماً، فقد كان هذا بداية وجوده حيث كانت شيئاً مذكوراً، فما صار شيئاً مذكوراً إلا وهو على أخس الأوصاف والنعوت! إذ لم يخلق في ابتدائه كاملاً بل خلقه جماداً ميتاً لا يسمع ولا يبصر ولا يحس ولا يتحرك ولا ينطق ولا يبطش ولا يدرك ولا يعلم، فبدأ بموته قبل حياته وبضعفه قبل قوته وبجهله قبل علمه وبعماه قبل بصره وبصممه قبل سمعه وببكمه قبل نطقه وبضلالته قبل هداه وبفقره قبل غناه وبعجزه قبل قدرته. فهذا معنى قوله \"من أي شيء خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج\" ومعنى قوله \"هل أتى على الإنسان حين من الدهر لم يكن شيئاً مذكوراً إنا خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج نبتليه\" كذلك خلقه أولاً ثم أمنن عليه فقال \"ثم السبيل يسره\" وهذا إشارة إلى ما تيسر له في مدة حياته إلى الموت. وكذلك قال \"من نطفة أمشاج نبتليه فجعلناه سميعاً بصيراً إنا هديناه السبيل إما شاكراً وإما كفورا\" ومعناه أنه أحياه بعد أن كان جماداً ميتاً تراباً أولاً ونطفة ثانياً، وأسمعه بعد ما كان أصم، وبصره بعدما كان فاقداً للبصر وقواه بعد الضعف، وعلمه بعد الجهل، وخلق له الأعضاء بما فيها من العجائب والآيات بعد الفقد لها، وأغناه بعد الفقر، وأشبعه بعد الجوع، وكساه بعد العري، وهداه بعد الضلال. فانظر كيف دبره وصوره وإلى السبيل كيف يسره وإلى طغيان الإنسان ما أكفره وإلى جهل الإنسان كيف أظهره؟ فقال \"أو لم ير الإنسان أنا خلقناه من نطفة فإذا هو خصيم مبين ومن آياته أن خلقكم من تراب ثم إذا أنتم تنتشرون\" فانظر إلى نعمة الله عليه كيف نقله من تلك الذلة والقلة والخسة والقذارة إلى هذه الرفعة والكرامة فصار موجوداً بعد العدم وحياً بعد الموت وناطقاً بعد البكم وبصيراً بعد العمى وقوياً بعد الضعف وعالماً بعد الجهل ومهدياً بعد الضلال وقادراً بعد العجز وغنياً بعد الفقر؟ فكان في ذاته لا شيء وأي شيء أخس من لا شيء؟ وأي قلة أقل من العدم المحض؟ ثم صار بالله شيئاً. وإنما خلقه من التراب الذليل الذي يوطأ بالأقدام والنطفة القذرة بعد العدم المحض أيضاً ليعرفه خسة ذاته فيعرف به نفسه، وإنما أكمل النعمة عليه ليعرف بها ربه ويعلم بها عظمته وجلاله وأنه لا يليق الكبرياء إلا به جل وعلا. ولذلك امتن عليه فقال \"ألم نجعل له عينين ولساناً وشفتين وهديناه النجدين\" وعرف خسته أولاً فقال \"ألم يك نطفة من مني يمنى ثم كان علقة\" ثم ذكر منته عليه فقال \"فخلق فسوى فجعل منه الزوجين الذكر والأنثى\" ليدوم وجوده بالتناسل كما حصل وجوده أولاً بالاختراع. فمن كان هذا بدؤه وهذه أحواله فمن أين له البطر والكبرياء والفخر والخيلاء وهو على التحقيق أخس الأخساء وأضعف الضعفاء؟</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book5.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Tawhid and Trust</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, he who seeks sufficiency [al-kifayah] from other than Him and abandons reliance [al-tawakkul] is the one who denies this verse.

And the greatest wonder of all is of one who sees beautiful calligraphy or a beautiful design upon a wall, admires it, and then directs all his concern to pondering the designer and the calligrapher—how he designed it and wrote it, and how he mastered it. He continues to hold it in great esteem within himself, saying, \"How skillful he is! How perfect his craftsmanship! How excellent his ability!\" Then he looks upon these wonders within himself and in others, yet he is heedless of its Maker and its Fashioner. His majesty does not astonish him, nor does His grandeur and His wisdom confound him.\n\nThis is but a glimpse of the wonders of your own body, which cannot be fully enumerated. It is the closest field for your reflection [fikr] and the clearest witness to the majesty of your Creator. Yet you are heedless of that, preoccupied with your belly and your private parts. You know nothing of yourself except that you hunger so you eat, become satiated so you sleep, feel desire so you copulate, and become angry so you fight. All the beasts share with you in this knowledge. The specific characteristic of the human being, which the beasts are veiled from, is the knowledge [ma'rifah] of God, the Exalted, through contemplation of the dominion [mulk] of the heavens and the earth and the wonders of the horizons and the souls [anfus]. For through this, the servant enters the company of the angels brought near and is resurrected in the company of the prophets and the truthful, brought near to the Presence [hadrah] of the Lord of the worlds. This station is not for the beasts, nor is it for the human who is content with the desires [shahawat] of the beasts in this world [dunya]. For he is worse than the beasts by far, for the beast has no capacity for that, while he—God created for him the capacity, then he left it idle and was ungrateful for God's favor in it. Those are like cattle; rather, they are more astray in path.\n\nAnd when you know the path of reflection [fikr] within yourself, then reflect upon the earth, which is your resting place, then upon its rivers, its mountains, and its mines. Then ascend from it to the dominion [mulk] of the heavens.\n\nAs for the earth, among His signs is that He created the earth as a carpet and a cradle, and He placed therein broad roads, and He made it subservient that you may travel its tracts, and He made it stable, not moving, and He set therein mountains as pegs for it, preventing it from shaking. Then He expanded its expanses until the children of Adam fell short of reaching all its regions, even if their lifespans were long and their travels many. So the Exalted said: **\"And the heaven—We constructed it with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander. And the earth—We spread it, and excellent are the spreaders.\"** And He, the Exalted, said: **\"It is He who made the earth subservient for you, so walk through its tracts.\"** And He, the Exalted, said: **\"[He] who made for you the earth a carpet.\"** And He has frequently mentioned this in His Mighty Book.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فانظر إلى اللطف والكرم ثم إلى القدرة والحكمة تبهرك عجائب الحضرة الربانية والعجب كل العجب ممن يرى خطا حسنا أو نقشا حسنا على حائط فيستحسنه فيصرف جميع همه إلى التفكر فى النقاش والخطاط وأنه كيف نقشه وخطه وكيف اقتدر عليه ولا يزال يستعظمه فى نفسه ويقول ما أحذقه وما أكمل صنعته وأحسن قدرته ثم ينظر إلى هذه العجائب فى نفسه وفى غيره ثم يغفل عن صانعه ومصوره فلا تدهشه عظمته ولا يحيره جلاله وحكمته فهذه نبذة من عجائب بدنك التى لا يمكن استقصاؤها فهو أقرب مجال لفكرك وأجلى شاهد على عظمة خالقك وأنت غافل عن ذلك مشغول ببطنك وفرجك ولا تعرف من نفسك إلا أن تجوع فتأكل وتشبع فينام وتشتهى فتجامع وتغضب فتقاتل والبهائم كلها تشاركك فى معرفة ذلك وإنما خاصية الإنسان التى حجبت البهائم عنها معرفةالله تعالى بالنظر فى ملكوت السموات والأرض وعجائب الافاق والأنفس إذ بها يدخل العبد فى زمرة الملائكة المقربين ويحشر فى زمرة النبيين والصديقين مقربا من حضرة رب العالمين وليست هذه المنزلة للبهائم ولا لإنسان رضى من الدنيا بشهوات البهائم فإنه شر من البهائم بكثير إذ لا قدرة للبهيمة على ذلك وأما هو فقد خلق الله له القدرة ثم عطلها وكفر نعمة الله فيها فأولئك كالأنعام بل هم أضل سبيلا وإذا عرفت طريق الفكر فى نفسك فتفكر فى الأرض التى هى مقرك ثم فى أنهارها وجبالها ومعادتها ثم ارتفع منها إلى ملكوت السموات أما الأرض فمن آياته أن خلق الأرض فراشا ومهادا وسلك فيها سبلا فجاجا وجعلها ذلولا لتمشوا فى مناكبها وجعلها قارة لا تتحرك وأرسى فيها الجبال أوتادا لها تمنعها من أن تميد ثم وسع أكنافها حتى عجز الآدميون عن بلوغ جميع جوانبها وإن طالت إعمارهم وكثر تطوافهم فقال تعالى والسماء بنيناها بأيد وإنا لموسعون والأرض فرشناها فنعم الماهدون وقال تعالى هو الذى جعل لكم الأرض ذلولا فامشوا فى مناكبها وقال تعالى الذى جعل لكم الأرض فراشا وقد أكثر فى كتابه العزيز ممن ذكر</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 4: Meditation</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Then look at how He (Allah) granted him (the human) capability, discernment, intellect (Aql), and guidance gradually until he reached and became complete, becoming an adolescent then a youth then middle-aged then an elder, either ungrateful (Kafir) or grateful (Shakir), obedient or disobedient, believing or disbelieving, confirming His (Allah's) saying, the Most High: 'Has there come upon the human a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned?

From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj].\" The verse has pointed to the first creation of man: he was not a thing mentioned [shay'an madhkuran], and he was in the realm of non-existence [‘adam] for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more base and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was like this in eternity. Then Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust [turab], then from a drop [nutfah], then from a clinging clot [‘alaqah], then from a chewed lump [mudghah], then He made him bones [‘azman], then He clothed the bones with flesh [lahman]. This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned [shay'an madhkuran]. He did not become a thing mentioned except while in the most base of states and descriptions! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him as a lifeless, dead mineral [jumadan mayyitan]—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance [jahl] before his knowledge [‘ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance [dalalah] before his guidance [huda], and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power. This is the meaning of His saying, \"From what thing did We create man? From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj],\" and the meaning of His saying, \"Has there come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man from a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] to test him.\" Likewise, He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Then the way [al-sabil] We made easy for him.\" And this is a reference to what was made easy for him during the period of his life until death. And likewise He said, \"From a mixed drop [nutfah amshaj] We test him, so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way [al-sabil]—whether he be grateful or ungrateful.\" Its meaning is that He gave him life after he was a lifeless, dead mineral, dust [turab] first and a drop [nutfah] second; and He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he was devoid of vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge [‘ilm] after ignorance [jahl]; and He created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence; and enriched him after poverty, and satisfied him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him [hadahu] after misguidance [dalalah]. So look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way [al-sabil] how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man how ungrateful he is, and to the ignorance [jahl] of man how He manifests it? So He said, \"Does man not consider that We created him from a drop [nutfah]? Then at once he is a clear adversary. And of His signs is that He created you from dust [turab]; then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.\" So look at the favor of Allah upon him, how He transferred him from that lowliness, insignificance, baseness, and filth to this elevation and honor—so he became existent after non-existence [‘adam], alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing [‘aliman] after ignorance [jahl], guided [mahdiyyan] after misguidance [dalalah], capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? For in his essence he was nothing [la shay'a]—and what thing is more base than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd]? Then, by Allah, he became something [shay'an]. He only created him from the lowly dust [al-turab al-dhalil] that is trodden underfoot and the filthy drop [al-nutfah al-qadirah] after pure non-existence [al-‘adam al-mahd] also, so that He might make him know the baseness of his essence, that he may thereby know himself. And He only perfected the favor upon him so that he may know by it his Lord and know by it His greatness and majesty, and that grandeur [al-kibriya'] is not fitting except for Him, Glorified and Exalted. And for that reason, He bestowed favor upon him, saying, \"Have We not made for him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips, and guided him [hadaynahu] to the two ways [al-najdayn]?\" And He made known his baseness first, saying, \"Was he not a drop of sperm emitted? Then he was a clinging clot [‘alaqah].\" Then He mentioned His favor upon him, saying, \"Then He created and proportioned, and made from him the two sexes, male and female,\" so that his existence may continue through procreation, just as his existence first occurred through invention. So, he whose beginning is this and whose states are these—from where does he get arrogance, grandeur [al-kibriya'], pride, and boastfulness, when he is, in truth, the basest of the base and the weakest of the weak?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فهذا معنى قوله \"من أي شيء خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج\" فقد أشارت الآية إلى أول خلق الإنسان فهو أنه لم يكن شيئاً مذكوراً وقد كان في حيز العدم دهوراً بل لم يكن لعدمه أول وأي شيء أخس وأقل من المحو والعدم؟ وقد كان كذلك في القدم، ثم خلقه الله من أرذل الأشياء، ثم من أقذرها إذ قد خلقه من تراب، ثم من نطفة، ثم من علقة، ثم من مضغة، ثم جعله عظماً، ثم كسا العظم لحماً، فقد كان هذا بداية وجوده حيث كانت شيئاً مذكوراً، فما صار شيئاً مذكوراً إلا وهو على أخس الأوصاف والنعوت! إذ لم يخلق في ابتدائه كاملاً بل خلقه جماداً ميتاً لا يسمع ولا يبصر ولا يحس ولا يتحرك ولا ينطق ولا يبطش ولا يدرك ولا يعلم، فبدأ بموته قبل حياته وبضعفه قبل قوته وبجهله قبل علمه وبعماه قبل بصره وبصممه قبل سمعه وببكمه قبل نطقه وبضلالته قبل هداه وبفقره قبل غناه وبعجزه قبل قدرته. فهذا معنى قوله \"من أي شيء خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج\" ومعنى قوله \"هل أتى على الإنسان حين من الدهر لم يكن شيئاً مذكوراً إنا خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج نبتليه\" كذلك خلقه أولاً ثم أمنن عليه فقال \"ثم السبيل يسره\" وهذا إشارة إلى ما تيسر له في مدة حياته إلى الموت. وكذلك قال \"من نطفة أمشاج نبتليه فجعلناه سميعاً بصيراً إنا هديناه السبيل إما شاكراً وإما كفورا\" ومعناه أنه أحياه بعد أن كان جماداً ميتاً تراباً أولاً ونطفة ثانياً، وأسمعه بعد ما كان أصم، وبصره بعدما كان فاقداً للبصر وقواه بعد الضعف، وعلمه بعد الجهل، وخلق له الأعضاء بما فيها من العجائب والآيات بعد الفقد لها، وأغناه بعد الفقر، وأشبعه بعد الجوع، وكساه بعد العري، وهداه بعد الضلال. فانظر كيف دبره وصوره وإلى السبيل كيف يسره وإلى طغيان الإنسان ما أكفره وإلى جهل الإنسان كيف أظهره؟ فقال \"أو لم ير الإنسان أنا خلقناه من نطفة فإذا هو خصيم مبين ومن آياته أن خلقكم من تراب ثم إذا أنتم تنتشرون\" فانظر إلى نعمة الله عليه كيف نقله من تلك الذلة والقلة والخسة والقذارة إلى هذه الرفعة والكرامة فصار موجوداً بعد العدم وحياً بعد الموت وناطقاً بعد البكم وبصيراً بعد العمى وقوياً بعد الضعف وعالماً بعد الجهل ومهدياً بعد الضلال وقادراً بعد العجز وغنياً بعد الفقر؟ فكان في ذاته لا شيء وأي شيء أخس من لا شيء؟ وأي قلة أقل من العدم المحض؟ ثم صار بالله شيئاً. وإنما خلقه من التراب الذليل الذي يوطأ بالأقدام والنطفة القذرة بعد العدم المحض أيضاً ليعرفه خسة ذاته فيعرف به نفسه، وإنما أكمل النعمة عليه ليعرف بها ربه ويعلم بها عظمته وجلاله وأنه لا يليق الكبرياء إلا به جل وعلا. ولذلك امتن عليه فقال \"ألم نجعل له عينين ولساناً وشفتين وهديناه النجدين\" وعرف خسته أولاً فقال \"ألم يك نطفة من مني يمنى ثم كان علقة\" ثم ذكر منته عليه فقال \"فخلق فسوى فجعل منه الزوجين الذكر والأنثى\" ليدوم وجوده بالتناسل كما حصل وجوده أولاً بالاختراع. فمن كان هذا بدؤه وهذه أحواله فمن أين له البطر والكبرياء والفخر والخيلاء وهو على التحقيق أخس الأخساء وأضعف الضعفاء؟</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 4: Meditation</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Then look how He provided him with capability, discernment, intellect, and guidance gradually until he reached maturity and became complete, turning into an adolescent, then a youth, then middle-aged, then an elder—either ungrateful or grateful, obedient or disobedient, believing or disbelieving—confirming His saying, the Most High: 'Has there come upon man a period of time when he was a thing unremembered?

And knowledge [ma'rifa] of Him is not realized except through the total absorption of thought [fikr] in His Essence, His Attributes, and His Actions, for there is nothing in existence besides Him and His actions. And the continuity of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] will not be facilitated except by abandoning the world [dunya] and its desires, and restricting oneself from it to the measure of necessity. And that is not accomplished except by occupying all the times of night and day with the duties of remembrances [adhkar] and contemplations [afkar].\n\nThe soul [nafs], due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not have patience for a single pattern of the means of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr]. Rather, if it is returned to it, it shows aversion. And God, the Exalted, does not tire until you tire. So from the necessity of gentleness with it is to refresh it by moving from one mode to another and from one type to another according to each time, so that its pleasure [ladhdha] increases through the transition, its desire [raghba] is magnified by the pleasure, and its adherence [muwazaba] endures through the endurance of the desire. For that reason, the litanies [awrad] are divided into different divisions.\n\nAnd it is necessary that remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] occupy all times or most of them. For the soul [nafs], by its nature, is inclined to the pleasures [ladhadh] of the world [dunya]. So if the servant spends half of his times on the arrangements and permissible desires of the world [dunya] and the other half on acts of worship, the side of inclination to the world [dunya] outweighs due to its conformity with nature [tab'], since the time is equal. So how can they be balanced when nature [tab'] gives weight to one of them? For the outward and inward assist each other in the matters of the world [dunya], and the heart [qalb] becomes pure and single-minded in seeking it. As for being turned back to acts of worship, it is forced, and the sincerity [ikhlas] and presence [hudur] of the heart [qalb] in it are not safe except at some times.\n\nSo whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him occupy all his times in obedience [ta'a]. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to outweigh and the balances of his goodness to be heavy, let him occupy most of his times in obedience [ta'a]. If he mixes a righteous deed with another that is evil, then his affair is perilous. But hope is not cut off, and pardon from the generosity of God is awaited. Perhaps God, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty and generosity.\n\nThis is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [basira]. If you are not of its people, then look at the address of God, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [iman]. For God, the Exalted, has said: **\"And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening, and during the night prostrate to Him and glorify Him a long night.\"** This indicates that the path to God, the Exalted, is the vigilance over times and populating them with litanies [awrad] in a manner of continuity, to achieve the continuity of remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] in all periods of night and day. Thus the heart [qalb] becomes occupied with intimate communion [uns] and love [mahabba], detached from the pleasures of the world [dunya], and absorbed in seeking the Countenance of the Most Generous.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>إن المحبة والأنس بالله تعالى لا تحصل إلا بدوام ذكر المحبوب والمواظبة عليه، والمعرفة به لا تتحقق إلا باستغراق الفكر في ذاته وصفاته وأفعاله، إذ ليس في الوجود سواه وأفعاله. ولن يتيسر دوام الذكر والفكر إلا بترك الدنيا وشهواتها والاقتصار منها على قدر الضرورة، وذلك لا يتم إلا باستيعاب أوقات الليل والنهار في وظائف الأذكار والأفكار. والنفس لما جبلت عليه من السآمة والملال لا تصبر على نمط واحد من أسباب الذكر والفكر، بل إذا رُدت إليه أظهرت الاستثقال، والله تعالى لا يمل حتى تملوا، فمن ضرورة اللطف بها أن تروح بالتنقل من فن إلى فن ومن نوع إلى نوع بحسب كل وقت لتغزر بالانتقال لذتها وتعظم باللذة رغبتها وتدوم بدوام الرغبة مواظبتها. فلذلك تقسم الأوراد قسمة مختلفة، ويجب أن يستغرق الذكر والفكر جميع الأوقات أو أكثرها، فإن النفس بطبعها مائلة إلى ملاذ الدنيا، فإذا صرف العبد شطر أوقاته إلى تدبيرات الدنيا وشهواتها المباحة والشطر الآخر إلى العبادات، رجح جانب الميل إلى الدنيا لموافقتها الطبع، إذ يكون الوقت متساويا، فأنى يتقاومان والطبع لأحدهما مرجح، إذ الظاهر والباطن يتساعدان على أمور الدنيا ويصفو في طلبها القلب ويتجرد. وأما الرد إلى العبادات فمتكلف ولا يسلم إخلاص القلب فيه وحضوره إلا في بعض الأوقات. فمن أراد أن يدخل الجنة بغير حساب فليستغرق أوقاته في الطاعة، ومن أراد أن تترجح كفة حسناته وتثقل موازين خيراته فليستوعب في الطاعة أكثر أوقاته، فإن خلط عملا صالحا وآخر سيئا فأمره مخطر، ولكن الرجاء غير منقطع والعفو من كرم الله منتظر، فعسى الله تعالى أن يغفر له بجوده وكرمه. وهذا ما انكشف للناظرين بنور البصيرة، فإن لم تكن من أهله فانظر إلى خطاب الله تعالى لرسوله واقتبسه بنور الإيمان، فقد قال الله تعالى: ﴿ واذكر اسم ربك بكرة وأصيلا ومن الليل فاسجد له وسبحه ليلا طويلا ﴾، فدل ذلك على أن الطريق إلى الله تعالى مراقبة الأوقات وعمارتها بالأوراد على سبيل الدوام، لتحقيق دوام الذكر والفكر في جميع آناء الليل والنهار، فيصبح القلب مشغولا بالأنس والمحبة، متجردا عن ملاذ الدنيا، مستغرقا في طلب وجه الكريم.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Arrangement of Litanies</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>If you are not from its people, then look at the address of Allah the Exalted to His Messenger and take it with the light of faith.

And the human being was created hasty (ʿajūlan), desiring the immediate (al-ʿājila). So Satan came and approached him through the medium of haste that is in his nature, and he seduced him with the immediate (al-ʿājila) and adorned for him the present, and he approached him through the medium of foolishness (al-ḥamq) and promised him delusion in the Hereafter, and tempted him with the kingdom of the Hereafter along with the kingdom of this world, as He said: (And the foolish one is he who follows his soul's (Nafs) desires and wishes upon Allah vain hopes). So the deceived one was deluded by his deception and busied himself with seeking the glory and kingdom of this world to the extent of his capability. And the successful one did not cling to the rope of his deception, for he knew the entrances of his cunning, so he turned away from the immediate (al-ʿājila). Thus He expressed about the deceived ones with His saying, the Exalted: 'No! But you love the immediate (al-ʿājila) and leave the Hereafter.' And He said, the Exalted: 'Indeed, these love the immediate (al-ʿājila) and leave behind them a heavy day.' And He said, the Exalted: 'So turn away from him who turns away from Our Remembrance (Dhikr) and desires not except the life of this world. That is their extent of knowledge.' And when the cunning of Satan spread among all creation, Allah sent the angels to the messengers and they revealed to them what had befallen creation from the destruction of the enemy and his seduction. So they busied themselves with calling creation to the true kingdom over the metaphorical kingdom that has no foundation if it is safe, nor any permanence at all. So they called out to them: 'O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when it is said to you, \"Go forth in the way of Allah,\" you adhere heavily to the earth?
