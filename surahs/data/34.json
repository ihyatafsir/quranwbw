[15] And the master of the truthful ones (may God be pleased with him) said: 'Incapacity to grasp perception is perception.' Glory be to Him who did not make for the creation a way to know Him except through incapacity to know Him. So I wonder, who denies the possibility of loving God (Allah) in reality and makes it metaphorical? Does he deny that these attributes are from the attributes of beauty and praiseworthiness and the descriptions of perfection and beauties? Does he deny that God is described by them or deny that perfection is beloved? If perfection is beloved, then God is absolute perfection, so how can He not be beloved? Then He said: 'Say: Call upon those whom you claim besides God; they do not possess an atom's weight in the heavens nor in the earth, nor have they any partnership in them, nor has He among them any supporter.'

Then know that every Muslim is awaiting the intercession of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the relative is also worthy of hoping for it, but on the condition that he fears Allah that He may become angry with him, for if He becomes angry with him, then He does not permit anyone in his intercession, because sins are divided into that which necessitates wrath, so intercession is not permitted for him, and into that which is forgiven due to intercession, like sins with the kings of the world, for every person of status with the king cannot intercede in that upon which the king's anger has intensified. So among sins is that from which intercession does not save, and about it is the expression by His saying, the Most High, \"Nor do they intercede except for whom He approves,\" and by His saying, \"Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?\" and by His saying, \"And intercession does not benefit with Him except for whom He permits,\" and by His saying, \"So their intercession will not benefit them.\" And if sins are divided into that in which intercession is made and into that in which intercession is not made, then fear and apprehension are obligatory without doubt. And if there were a sin in which intercession is accepted, He would not have commanded the Quraysh with obedience, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have prohibited Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) from disobedience, and He would have permitted her to follow desires to complete her self (Nafs) in this world, then intercede for her in the Hereafter to complete her self (Nafs) in the Hereafter. So immersion in sins and abandoning piety (Taqwa) relying on the hope of intercession resembles the immersion of the sick person in his desires depending on a skilled doctor who is close and compassionate like a father or brother or other, and that is ignorance because the effort of the doctor, his diligence, and his skill benefit in removing some illnesses, not all of them. So it is not permissible to abandon precaution absolutely relying on mere medicine, rather the doctor has an effect in general but in mild illnesses and when the balance of temperament (Mizaj) predominates. Thus, you should understand the care of intercessors from the prophets and the righteous for relatives and strangers, for it is certainly like that, and that does not remove fear and caution, and how can it remove when the best of creation after the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) are his companions, and they used to wish they were beasts out of fear of the Hereafter with the perfection of their piety (Taqwa), the goodness of their deeds, the purity of their hearts (Qulub), and what they heard from the promise of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to them of Paradise.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فإن قلت: فقد قال ﭬ بعد قوله لفاطمة وصفية \"إني لا إني عنكما من الله شيئاً إلا أن لكم رحماً سأبلها ببلاها\"[96] وقال عليه الصلاة والسلام \"أترجو سليم شفاعتي ولا يرجوها بنو عبد المطلب\"[97] فذلك يدل على أنه سيخصص قرابته بالشفاعة؟ فاعلم أن كل مسلم فهو منتظر شفاعة رسول الله ﭬ، والنسيب أيضاً جدير بأن يرجوها لكن بشرط أن يتقي الله أن يغضب عليه، فإنه إن يغضب عليه فلا يأذن لأحد في شفاعته، لأن الذنوب منقسمة إلى ما يوجب المقت فلا يؤذن في الشفاعة له، وإلى ما يعفى عنه بسبب الشفاعة، كالذنوب عند ملوك الدنيا فإن كل ذي مكانة عند الملك لا يقدر على الشفاعة فيما اشتد عليه غضب الملك، فمن الذنوب ما لا تنجي منه الشفاعة وعنه العبارة بقوله تعالى \"ولا يشفعون إلا لمن ارتضى\" وبقوله \"من ذا الذي يشفع عند إلا بإذنه\" وبقوله \"ولا تنفع الشفاعة عنده إلا لمن أذن له\" وبقوله \"فما تنفعهم شفاعة الشافعين\" وإذا انقسمت الذنوب إلا ما يشفع فيه وإلى ما لا يشفع فيه وجب الخوف والإشفاق لا محالة، ولو كان ذنب تقبل فيه الشفاعة لما أمر قريشاً بالطاعة ولما نهى رسول الله ﭬ فاطمة رضي الله عنها عن المعصية، ولكان يأذن لها في اتباع الشهوات لتكمل لذاتها في الدنيا ثم يشفع لها في الآخرة لتكمل لذاتها في الآخرة. فالانهماك في الذنوب وترك التقوى اتكالاً على رجاء الشفاعة يضاهي انهماك المريض في شهواته اعتماداً على طبيب حاذق قريب مشفق من أب أو أخ أو غيره، وذلك جهل لأن سعي الطبيب وهمته وحذقه تنفع في إزالة بعض الأمراض لا في كلها، فلا يجوز ترك الحمية مطلقاً اعتماداً على مجرد الطب، بل للطبيب أثر على الجملة ولكن في الأمراض الخفيفة وعند وغلبة اعتدال المزاج. فهكذا ينبغي أن تفهم عناية الشفعاء من الأنبياء والصلحاء للأقارب والأجانب، فإنه كذلك قطعاً، وذلك لا يزيل الخوف والحذر، وكيف يزيل وخير الخلق بعد رسول الله ﭬ أصحابه وقد كانوا يتمنون أن يكونوا بهائم من خوف الآخرة مع كمال تقواهم وحسن أعمالهم وصفاء قلوبهم وما سمعوه من وعد رسول الله ﭬ إياهم بالجن</div></div></div>"}},"24":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.7","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"0.41","h":"1.07","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.12","c":"يَرْزُقُكُمْ","d":"yarzuqukum","e":"mُkُqُzْrَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.32","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.51","c":"السَّمَاوَاتِ","d":"l-samāwāti","e":"ِtَٰwَٰmَّslٱ"},{"b":"4.8","h":"6.5","c":"وَالْأَرْضِ","d":"wal-arḍi","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"5.7","h":"9.3","c":"قُلِ","d":"quli","e":"ِlُq"},{"b":"6.1","h":"9.7","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"8.8","h":"13.1","c":"وَإِنَّا","d":"wa-innā","e":"ٓāَّnِiʾَw"},{"b":"11.6","h":"15.98","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"12.0","h":"16.47","c":"إِيَّاكُمْ","d":"iyyākum","e":"ْmُkāَّyِiʾ"},{"b":"13.1","h":"18.1","c":"لَعَلَى","d":"laʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿعَl"},{"b":"13.8","h":"19.1","c":"هُدًى","d":"hudan","e":"àًdُh"},{"b":"14.4","h":"20","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"14.7","h":"20.41","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"15.1","h":"20.94","c":"ضَلَالٍ","d":"ḍalālin","e":"ٍlَٰlَḍ"},{"b":"16.9","h":"23","c":"مُبِينٍ","d":"mubīnin","e":"ٍnyِbُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allah.

If there is weakness in your faith (Iman), then strengthen the faith (Iman) by looking at the first creation, for the second is like it and easier than it. And if you are strong in faith (Iman) in it, then make your heart (Qalb) feel those fears and dangers, and increase in it contemplation (Tafakkur) and consideration (I'tibar) to strip from your heart (Qalb) comfort and settlement, so you busy yourself with preparing for the presentation before the Almighty (Al-Jabbar). And contemplate first in what strikes the hearing of the inhabitants of the graves from the intensity of the blowing of the Trumpet (As-Sur), for it is a single shout by which the graves split open from the heads of the dead, and they rise up all at once. So imagine yourself having leapt up, your face changed, your body dusty from your scalp to your feet from the dust of your grave, stunned from the intensity of the blow, your eye fixed toward the call. And the creation has risen up in one uprising from the graves in which their tribulation (Bala') has been prolonged, and alarm and terror have agitated them, added to what they had of sorrows and griefs and intense waiting for the outcome of the matter, as the Exalted said: 'And the Trumpet (As-Sur) will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.' And the Exalted said: 'And when the Horn (An-Naqur) is blown, that Day will be a difficult day for the disbelievers; not easy.' And the Exalted said: 'And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\" They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing. And they will not be able to make a testament, nor to their people will they return. And the Horn (As-Sur) will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten. They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping place? This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.\"' So if there were not before the dead except the terror of that blowing, it would be worthy of being guarded against, for it is a blowing and a shout by which those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning they die by it except whom Allah wills, and that is some of the angels. And for that reason, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'How can I be at ease when the possessor of the Trumpet (As-Sur) has taken the horn (Al-Qarn) in his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow?' Maqatil said: The Trumpet (As-Sur) is the horn (Al-Qarn), and that is because Israfil (upon him be peace) has placed his mouth on the horn (Al-Qarn) like the form of a trumpet, and the circle of the head of the horn (Al-Qarn) is like the expanse of the heavens and the earth, and he is fixing his gaze toward the Throne (Al-'Arsh), waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first blowing. And when he blows, those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning every animal dies from the intensity of the alarm except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt). Then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded to take the soul (Ruh) of Jibril, then the soul (Ruh) of Mika'il, then the soul (Ruh) of Israfil, then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blowing in the Barzakh for forty years, then Allah the Exalted revives Israfil and commands.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em;

And its cure is what we mentioned regarding arrogance (Al-Kibr), which is that he should reflect upon his weakness and their weakness and that all of them are weak slaves ('Ibad 'Ujaza) who do not possess for themselves harm nor benefit. 'How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah' (Quran 2:249). Then how can he be proud of them when they will separate from him when he dies, so he is buried in his grave humbled, forsaken, alone—no household member accompanies him, nor child, nor relative, nor intimate friend, nor tribesman—so they deliver him to decay and snakes and scorpions and worms, and they avail him nothing at the time he is most in need of them. And likewise they flee from him on the Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-Qiyamah): 'The Day a man will flee from his brother and his mother and his father and his companion and his sons' (Quran 80:34-36), the verse. So what good is there in one who parts from you in your most severe states and flees from you? And how can you be proud of him when he does not benefit you in the grave and the Resurrection and on the Bridge (Al-Sirat) to your deeds and the favor of Allah the Exalted? So how do you rely on one who does not benefit you, and forget the favors of the One who possesses your benefit and your harm and your death and your life?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>السادس العجب بكثرة العدد من الأولاد والخدم والغلمان والعشيرة والأقارب والأنصار والأتباع كما قال الكفار \"نحن أكثر أموالاً وأولاداً\" وكما قال المؤمنون يوم حنين: لا نغلب اليوم من قلة، وعلاجه ما ذكرناه في الكبر وهو أن يتفكر في ضعفه وضعفهم وأن كلهم عبيد عجزة لا يملكون لأنفسهم ضراً ولا نفعاً. \"كم من فئة قليلة غلبت فئة كثيرة بإذن الله\" ثم كيف يعجب بهم وأنهم سيفترقون عنه إذا مات فيدفن في قبره ذليلاً معيناً وحده لا يرافقه أهل ولا ولد ولا قريب ولا حميم ولا عشير، فيسلمونه إلى البلى والحيات والعقارب والديدان ولا يغنون عنه شيئاً وفي أحوج أوقاته إليهم، وكذلك يهربون منه يوم القيامة \"يوم يفر المرء من أخيه وأمه وأبيه وصاحبته وبنيه\" الآية. فأي خير فيمن يفارقك في أشد أحوالك ويهرب منك؟ وكيف تعجب به ولا ينفعك في القبر والقيامة وعلى الصراط إلى عملك وفضل الله تعالى؟ فكيف تتكل على من لا ينفعك، وتنسى نعم من يملك نفعك وضرك وموتك وحياتك.</div></div></div>"}},"36":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.75","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"0.37","h":"1.24","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.62","c":"رَبِّي","d":"rabbī","e":"àِّbَr"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.11","c":"يَبْسُطُ","d":"yabsuṭu","e":"ُṭُsْbَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"5.33","c":"الرِّزْقَ","d":"l-riz'qa","e":"َqْzِّrlٱ"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.63","c":"لِمَنْ","d":"liman","e":"nَmِl"},{"b":"5.3","h":"8.04","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"7.3","h":"10.24","c":"وَيَقْدِرُ","d":"wayaqdiru","e":"ُrِdْqَyَw"},{"b":"8.3","h":"11.77","c":"وَلَكِنَّ","d":"walākinna","e":"َّnِkَٰlَw"},{"b":"9.8","h":"14.04","c":"أَكْثَرَ","d":"akthara","e":"َrَhtْkَaʾ"},{"b":"10.6","h":"15.29","c":"النَّاسِ","d":"l-nāsi","e":"ِsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"12.0","h":"17.12","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"12.3","h":"17.78","c":"يَعْلَمُونَ","d":"yaʿlamūna","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَy"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it], but most of the people do not know.\""}},"37":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.82","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.84","c":"أَمْوَالُكُمْ","d":"amwālukum","e":"ْmُkُlَٰwْmَaʾ"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.08","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"ٓāَlَw"},{"b":"4.6","h":"7.04","c":"أَوْلَادُكُمْ","d":"awlādukum","e":"mُkُdَٰlْwَaʾ"},{"b":"8.2","h":"9.67","c":"بِالَّتِي","d":"bi-allatī","e":"àِtَّlٱِb"},{"b":"9.2","h":"11.2","c":"تُقَرِّبُكُمْ","d":"tuqarribukum","e":"ْmُkُbِّrَqُt"},{"b":"10.","h":"13.33","c":"عِنْدَنَا","d":"ʿindanā","e":"āَnَdnِʿع"},{"b":"12.1","h":"15.4","c":"زُلْفَى","d":"zul'fā","e":"ٰٓàَfْlُz"},{"b":"14.5","h":"16.24","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"16.8","h":"19.12","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"ْnَm"},{"b":"17.2","h":"19.76","c":"ءَامَنَ","d":"āmana","e":"َnَmāَء"},{"b":"18","h":"21.04","c":"وَعَمِلَ","d":"waʿamila","e":"َlِmَʿعَw"},{"b":"18.6","h":"22.22","c":"صَالِحًا","d":"ṣāliḥan","e":"āًḥِlَٰṣ"},{"b":"20.3","h":"33.67","c":"فَأُولَئِكَ","d":"fa-ulāika","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾَf"},{"b":"22.6","h":"36.83","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"23.2","h":"37.72","c":"جَزَاءُ","d":"jazāu","e":"ُءٓāَzَjg"},{"b":"25.3","h":"39.88","c":"الضِّعْفِ","d":"l-ḍiʿ'fi","e":"ِfْʿعِّḍlٱ"},{"b":"26.0","h":"41.25","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"26.5","h":"42.07","c":"عَمِلُوا","d":"ʿamilū","e":"۟āwُlِmَʿع"},{"b":"35.2","h":"43.62","c":"وَهُمْ","d":"wahum","e":"ْmُhَw"},{"b":"35.8","h":"44.47","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"36.0","h":"44.85","c":"الْغُرُفَاتِ","d":"l-ghurufāti","e":"ِtَٰfُrُغْlٱ"},{"b":"37.2","h":"46.92","c":"ءَامِنُونَ","d":"āminūna","e":"َnwُnِmāَء"}],"a":{"g":"And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us in position, but it is [by being] one who has believed and done righteousness.
