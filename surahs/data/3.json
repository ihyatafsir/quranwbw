For among them is that which is praised in its little and its much, like health and beauty; and among them is that which is blameworthy in its little and its much, like ugliness and bad character; and among them is that wherein moderation is praised, like the spending of wealth, for extravagance is not praised in it, though it is a form of spending; and like courage, for recklessness is not praised in it, though it is of the genus of courage. So it is with knowledge.\n\nThe blameworthy division of it, in its little and its much, is that which has no benefit in religion [din] or in this world [dunya], for in it is harm that overcomes its benefit, like the knowledge of magic, talismans, and astrology. Some of it has no benefit at all, and to devote one's lifetime—which is the most precious thing a human possesses—to it is waste, and wasting the precious is blameworthy. And some of it contains harm that outweighs what is imagined to be gained from it in fulfilling worldly desires, for that is not considered in comparison to the harm that results from it.\n\nAs for the division that is praiseworthy to the utmost limits of exhaustive pursuit, it is the knowledge [ma‘rifa] of God, Exalted is He, and His attributes, His actions, His way [sunnah] in His creation, and His wisdom in arranging the Hereafter [akhirah] upon this world [dunya]. For this is knowledge sought for its own sake and to attain through it the happiness of the Hereafter. To expend one's utmost capability in it to the extreme of effort is a shortcoming from the limit of what is obligatory, for it is an ocean whose depths are not reached. The seekers only circle upon its shores and its edges according to what is made easy for them. None have plunged into its depths except the Prophets, the saints [awliya’], and those firmly grounded in knowledge [al-rasikhun fi al-‘ilm], differing in their degrees according to the difference in their strength and the varying decree of God, Exalted is He, concerning them. This is the treasured knowledge [al-‘ilm al-maknun] which is not written in books. What aids in becoming alert to it is learning and observing the states of the scholars of the Hereafter—as their signs will come—this in the beginning of the matter. And what aids in it in the end is striving [mujahadah], spiritual discipline [riyadah], purifying the heart [qalb], and emptying it from the attachments of this world [dunya], and emulating therein the Prophets and the saints, so that from it may become clear to every seeker of it according to the measure of provision [rizq], not according to the measure of effort. But there is no dispensing in it from exertion [ijtihad], for striving [mujahadah] is the key to guidance [hidayah]; there is no key to it other than it.\n\nAs for the sciences wherein only a specific measure is praised, they are the sciences we mentioned among the communal obligations [fara’id al-kifayat]. For in every science of them there is a limit, which is the minimum; and a moderation, which is the middle; and an exhaustive pursuit beyond that moderation which has no end until the end of one's life. So be one of two men: either occupied with yourself, or free for others after being free from yourself. And beware of occupying yourself with what rectifies others before rectifying yourself. If you are the one occupied with yourself, then occupy yourself only with the knowledge that is an obligation upon you according to what your state requires, and what pertains to it from the outward actions, like learning the prayer, purification, and fasting. Yet the most important, which everyone has neglected, is the knowledge of the attributes of the heart [qalb], and what among them is praiseworthy and what is blameworthy, for no human is free from blameworthy attributes like greed, envy, ostentation, arrogance, self-admiration, and their sisters—all of which are destroyers. And neglecting them is from the obligations, while occupying oneself with outward actions resembles occupying oneself with plastering the exterior of the body when afflicted with scabies and boils, while being negligent in expelling the morbid matter by cupping and purging. The superficial scholars [hashwiyyat al-‘ulama’] point to outward actions, just as the methodical physicians point to plastering the exterior of the body. But the scholars of the Hereafter point only to purifying the interior [batin] and cutting off the sources of evil by corrupting their roots and uprooting their plantings from the heart [qalb]. The majority have resorted to outward actions over purifying the hearts due to the ease of the actions of the limbs and the perceived difficulty of the actions of the hearts, just as one who finds it difficult to drink bitter medicines resorts to plastering the exterior. Thus, he continues to toil in plastering while the morbid matter increases and the diseases multiply upon him.\n\nIf you are a desirer of the Hereafter [akhirah], a seeker of salvation, and a fugitive from eternal destruction, then occupy yourself with the knowledge of the inward maladies and their treatment, as we have detailed in the Quarter of the Destroyers.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>بيان القدر المحمود من العلوم المحمودة اعلم أن العلم بهذا الاعتبار ثلاثة أقسام قسم هو مذموم قليله وكثيره وقسم هو محمود قليله وكثيرة وكلما كان أكثر كان أحسن وأفضل وقسم يحمد منه مقدار الكفاية ولا يحمد الفاضل عليه والاستقصاء فيه وهو مثل أحوال البدن فإن منها ما يحمد قليله وكثيره كالصحة والجمال ومنها ما يذم قليله وكثيره كالقبح وسوء الخلق ومنها ما يحمد الاقتصاد فيه كبذل المال فإن التبذير لا يحمد فيه وهو بذل وكالشجاعة فإن التهور لا يحمد فيها وإن كان من جنس الشجاعة فكذلك العلم فالقسم المذموم منه قليله وكثيره هو ما لا فائدة فيه في دين ولا دنيا إذ فيه ضرر يغلب نفعه كعلم السحر والطلسمات والنجوم فبعضه لا فائدة فيه أصلا وصرف العمر الذي هو أنفس ما يملكه الإنسان إليه إضاعة وإضاعة النفيس مذمومة ومنه ما فيه ضرر يزيد على ما يظن أنه يحصل به من قضاء وطر في الدنيا فإن ذلك لا يعتد به بالإضافة إلى الضرر الحاصل عنه وأما القسم المحمود إلى أقصى غايات الاستقصاء فهو العلم بالله تعالى وبصفاته وأفعاله وسنته في خلقه وحكمته في ترتيب الآخرة على الدنيا فإن هذا علم مطلوب لذاته وللتوصل به إلى سعادة الآخرة وبذل المقدور فيه إلى أقصى الجهد قصور عن حد الواجب فإنه البحر الذي لا يدرك غوره وإنما يحوم الحائمون على سواحله وأطرافه بقدر ما يسر لهم وما خاض أطرافه إلا الأنبياء والأولياء والراسخون في العلم على اختلاف درجاتهم بحسب اختلاف قوتهم وتفاوت تقدير الله تعالى في حقهم وهذا هو العلم المكنون الذي لا يسطر في الكتب ويعين على التنبه له التعلم ومشاهدة أحوال علماء الآخرة كما سيأتي علامتهم هذا في أول الأمر ويعين عليه في الآخرة المجاهدة والرياضة وتصفية القلب وتفريغه عن علائق الدنيا والتشبه فيها بالأنبياء والأولياء ليتضح منه لكل ساع إلى طلبه بقدر الرزق لا بقدر الجهد ولكن لا غنى فيه عن الاجتهاد فالمجاهدة مفتاح الهداية لا مفتاح لها سواها وأما العلوم التي لا يحمد منها إلا مقدار مخصوص فهي العلوم التي أوردناها في فروض الكفايات فإن في كل علم منها اقتصارا وهو الأقل واقتصادا وهو الوسط واستقصاء وراء ذلك الاقتصاد لا مرد له إلى آخر العمر فكن أحد رجلين إما مشغولا بنفسك وإما متفرغا لغيرك بعد الفراغ من نفسك وإياك أن تشتغل بما يصلح غيرك قبل إصلاح نفسك فإن كنت المشغول بنفسك فلا تشتغل إلا بالعلم الذي هو فرض عليك بحسب ما يقتضيه حالك وما يتعلق منه بالأعمال الظاهرة من تعلم الصلاة والطهارة والصوم وإنما الأهم الذي أهمله الكل علم صفات القلب وما يحمد منها وما يذم إذ لا ينفك بشر عن الصفات المذمومة مثل الحرص والحسد والرياء والكبر والعجب وأخواتها وجميع ذلك مهلكات وإهمالها من الواجبات مع أن الاشتغال بالأعمال الظاهرة يضاهي الاشتغال بطلاء ظاهر البدن عند التأذي بالجرب والدماميل والتهاون بإخراج المادة بالفصد والإسهال وحشوية العلماء يشيرون بالأعمال الظاهرة كما يشير الطرقية من الأطباء بطلاء ظاهر البدن وعلماء الآخرة لا يشيرون إلا بتطهير الباطن وقطع مواد الشر بإفساد منابتها وقلع مغارسها من القلب وإنما فزع الأكثرون إلى الأعمال الظاهرة عن تطهير القلوب لسهولة أعمال الجوارح واستصعاب أعمال القلوب كما يفزع إلى طلاء الظاهر من يستصعب شرب الأدوية المرة فلا يزال يتعب في الطلاء ويزيد في المواد وتتضاعف به الأمراض فإن كنت مريدا للآخرة وطالبا للنجاة وهاربا من الهلاك الأبدي فاشتغل بعلم العلل الباطنة وعلاجها على ما فصلناه في ربع المهلكات</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.96","c":"رَبَّنَا","d":"rabbanā","e":"āَnَّbَr"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.52","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"1.5","h":"3.11","c":"تُزِغْ","d":"tuzigh","e":"ْغِzُt"},{"b":"2.1","h":"4.18","c":"قُلُوبَنَا","d":"qulūbanā","e":"āَnَbwُlُq"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.16","c":"بَعْدَ","d":"baʿda","e":"َdْʿعَb"},{"b":"4.1","h":"7.17","c":"إِذْ","d":"idh","e":"ْhdِiʾ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"7.76","c":"هَدَيْتَنَا","d":"hadaytanā","e":"āَnَtْyَdَh"},{"b":"5.9","h":"9.81","c":"وَهَبْ","d":"wahab","e":"ْbَhَw"},{"b":"6.6","h":"10.76","c":"لَنَا","d":"lanā","e":"āَnَl"},{"b":"7.3","h":"11.86","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"7.4","h":"12.18","c":"لَدُنْكَ","d":"ladunka","e":"َknُdَّl"},{"b":"9.5","h":"14.12","c":"رَحْمَةً","d":"raḥmatan","e":"ًẗَmْḥَr"},{"b":"10.8","h":"17","c":"إِنَّكَ","d":"innaka","e":"َkَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"12.3","h":"18.84","c":"أَنْتَ","d":"anta","e":"َtnَaʾ"},{"b":"13.7","h":"20.43","c":"الْوَهَّابُ","d":"l-wahābu","e":"ُbāَّhَwْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"[Who say], \"Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy.

Then he lay down until I thought he had slept for as long as he had prayed. Then he awoke and said what he had said the first time and did what he had done the first time.

And Abu al-Walid ibn Mughith narrated in the *Book of Prayer* from the narration of Ishaq ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Abi Talhah that a man said, \"I will closely observe the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,\" and he mentioned the narration, and in it is that he took his tooth-stick from behind the saddle.

Indeed, You are over all things competent.\" For in this verse is a reminder [tadhkir] that the true kingdom [mulk] and the complete disposal of affairs belong to Allah alone, so it behooves the servant ['abd] to submit to His decree [qada'] and to be humble in seeking honor ['izza] and good [khayr], for they are in His hand, Glorified is He, not by the power [hawl] of humans and their strength [quwwa].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>إنَّ تَكْرَارَ الذِّكْرِ وَالدُّعَاءِ بِقَدْرٍ يَسِيرٍ مَعَ الْمُدَاوَمَةِ أَفْضَلُ مِنْ كَثِيرٍ مُتَفَرِّقٍ، لِأَنَّ الْقَلْبَ يَتَأَثَّرُ بِالدَّوَامِ كَتَأَثُّرِ الْأَرْضِ بِالْقَطَرَاتِ الْمُتَتَابِعَةِ الَّتِي تُحْدِثُ فِيهَا حُفْرَةً، وَمِنْ أَجَلِّ مَا يُدَاوَمُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلُ: قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتَنْزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَنْ تَشَاءُ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، فَفِي هَذِهِ الْآيَةِ تَذْكِيرٌ بِأَنَّ الْمُلْكَ الْحَقِيقِيَّ وَالتَّصَرُّفَ التَّامَّ لِلَّهِ وَحْدَهُ، فَيَنْبَغِي لِلْعَبْدِ أَنْ يَسْتَسْلِمَ لِقَضَائِهِ وَيَتَوَاضَعَ فِي طَلَبِ الْعِزَّةِ وَالْخَيْرِ، لِأَنَّهُمَا بِيدِهِ سُبْحَانَهُ لَا بِحَوْلِ الْبَشَرِ وَقُوَّتِهِمْ.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Arrangement of Litanies</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, say: \"O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty [al-mulk], You grant sovereignty [al-mulk] to whom You will and You strip sovereignty [al-mulk] from whom You will.

And Allah warns you of Himself. So the possessors of insight [arbab al-basa'ir] from among the servants knew that Allah, Exalted is He, lies in wait for them, and that they will be questioned in the reckoning [hisab] and held accountable for the weight of an atom [mithqal al-dharr] from passing thoughts [khawatir] and glances [lahazat]. And they realized that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning [muhasaba] and sincere self-observation [muraqaba], and holding the soul [nafs] to account for every breath [anfas] and movement [harakat], and reckoning with it for every passing thought [khawatir] and glance [lahazat]. For whoever holds his soul [nafs] to account before he is held to account, his reckoning [hisab] on the Day of Standing [al-qiyamah] will be light, his answer will be present when questioned, and his return [ma'ab] and outcome [manqalab] will be good. And whoever does not hold his soul [nafs] to account, his regrets [hasrat] will be prolonged, and his halts [waqfat] in the plains ['arasat] of the Day of Standing [al-qiyamah] will be lengthy, and his evil deeds [sayyi'at] will lead him to disgrace [khizy] and contempt [maqt]. So when this was unveiled to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to Allah. And He has commanded them to patience [sabr] and steadfast vigilance [murabata], so He, Mighty and Majestic, said: \"O you who have believed, be patient and endure and remain steadfast and fear Allah that you may be successful.\" So they made their souls [anfus] steadfast first by mutual pledging [musharata], then by self-observation [muraqaba], then by self-reckoning [muhasaba], then by self-punishment [mu'aqaba], then by striving [mujahada], then by self-reproof [mu'ataba]. Thus, for them in steadfast vigilance [murabata] were six stations [maqamat], and it is necessary to explain them and clarify their reality [haqiqa] and virtue [fadila] and detail the works [a'mal] within them. The foundation [asl] of that is self-reckoning [muhasaba], but every reckoning [hisab] is after mutual pledging [musharata] and self-observation [muraqaba], and it is followed, in case of loss [khusran], by self-reproof [mu'ataba] and self-punishment [mu'aqaba]. So let us mention the explanation of these stations [maqamat], and with Allah is success [tawfiq].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى يوم تجد كل نفس ما عملت من خير محضرا وما عملت من سوء تود لو أن بينها وبينه أمدا بعيدا ويحذركم الله نفسه فعرف أرباب البصائر من جملة العباد أن الله تعالى لهم بالمرصاد وأنهم سيناقشون في الحساب ويطالبون بمثاقيل الذر من الخطرات واللحظات وتحققوا أنه لا ينجيهم من هذه الأخطار إلا لزوم المحاسبة وصدق المراقبة ومطالبة النفس في الأنفاس والحركات ومحاسبتها في الخطرات واللحظات فمن حاسب نفسه قبل أن يحاسب خف في القيامة حسابه وحضر عند السؤال جوابه وحسن منقلبه ومآبه ومن لم يحاسب نفسه دامت حسراته وطالت في عرصات القيامة وقفاته وقادته إلى الخزى والمقت سيئاته فلما انكشف لهم ذلك علموا أنه لا ينجيهم منه إلا طاعة الله وقد أمرهم بالصبر والمرابطة فقال عز من قائل يا أيها الذين آمنو اصبروا وصابروا ورابطوا فرابطوا أنفسهم أولا بالمشارطة ثم بالمراقبة ثم بالمحاسبة ثم بالمعاقبة ثم بالمجاهدة ثم بالمعاتبة فكانت لهم في المرابطة ست مقامات ولا بد من شرحها وبيان حقيقتها وفضيلتها وتفصيل الأعمال فيها وأصل ذلك المحاسبة ولكن كل حساب فبعد مشارطة ومراقبة ويتبعه عند الخسران المعاتبة والمعاقبة.</div></div></div>"}},"31":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.6","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"0.48","h":"0.93","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.13","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"2.9","h":"3.67","c":"تُحِبُّونَ","d":"tuḥibbūna","e":"َnwُّbِḥُt"},{"b":"4.2","h":"5.19","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"5.0","h":"6.15","c":"فَاتَّبِعُونِي","d":"fa-ittabiʿūnī","e":"àِnwُʿعِbَّtٱَf"},{"b":"6.8","h":"8.32","c":"يُحْبِبْكُمُ","d":"yuḥ'bib'kumu","e":"ُmُkْbِbْḥُy"},{"b":"8.0","h":"9.81","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"10.76","c":"وَيَغْفِرْ","d":"wayaghfir","e":"ْrِfْغَyَw"},{"b":"9.9","h":"12.01","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"10.5","h":"12.74","c":"ذُنُوبَكُمْ","d":"dhunūbakum","e":"ْmُkَbwُnُhd"},{"b":"12.3","h":"16.61","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"},{"b":"13.3","h":"17.74","c":"غَفُورٌ","d":"ghafūrun","e":"ٌrwُfَغ"},{"b":"13.","h":"19.08","c":"رَحِيمٌ","d":"raḥīmun","e":"ٌmyِḥَّr"}],"a":{"g":"Say, [O Muhammad], \"If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins.

For the origin of this delusion [ghurur] is ignorance [jahl] of Allah and His attributes. For whoever knows Him [man 'arafahu] does not feel secure from His devising [makkir], nor is he deluded by such false imaginings. And look to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, and to the kings of the earth, and what befell them—how Allah was gracious to them at first, then utterly destroyed them! So the Almighty said, \"Do you perceive from them anyone?\" (Quran 44:28). And Allah the Almighty has warned of His devising [makkir] and His gradual enticement [istidraj], saying, \"So none feels secure from the devising [makkir] of Allah except the people who are the losers\" (Quran 7:99). And the Almighty said, \"And they devised a devising [makkir], and We devised a devising [makkir], while they were not aware\" (Quran 27:50). And the Almighty said, \"And they devised [makarū], and Allah devised [makar], and Allah is the best of devisers [khayru al-mākirīn]\" (Quran 3:54). And the Almighty said, \"Indeed, they are planning a plan [kayd], and I am planning a plan [kayd]. So give respite to the disbelievers; respite them a little\" (Quran 86:15-17). So just as it is not permissible for a neglected servant to infer from his master's neglect of him and enabling him with blessings that the master loves him—rather, he should fear that this may be a devising [makkir] and a plot [kayd] from him, even though the master did not warn him of his own devising—then how much more incumbent is this regarding Allah the Almighty, with His warning of His gradual enticement [istidraj]! Therefore, whoever feels secure from the devising [makkir] of Allah is deluded [maghṭurr]. And the origin of this delusion [ghurur] is that he inferred from the blessings of the world [ni'am al-dunyā] that he is honored [karīm] with that Bestower, while it is possible that this is evidence of degradation [hawan]. But that possibility does not accord with desire [hawā]. So Satan, through the medium of desire [hawā], inclines the heart [qalb] towards what agrees with it, which is believing its indication of honor [karāmah].

Its weakness is due to heedlessness [ghafla] and the weakness of faith. Heedlessness is only removed by reminder and admonition, and by persistent reflection on the terrors of the Day of Resurrection and the varieties of punishment in the Hereafter. It is also removed by looking upon those who fear, keeping their company, and witnessing their states. If witnessing is missed, then hearing is not devoid of effect. As for the second, which is the higher, it is that Allah is the One feared—meaning that the servant fears the veil [hijab] from Him and hopes for proximity to Him. Dhu al-Nun, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"The fear of Hell, in the presence of the fear of separation, is like a drop dripped into a vast ocean.\" This is the awe [khashya] of the learned, as Allah the Exalted said: \"Only those of His servants who have knowledge fear Allah.\" The general believers also have a share of this awe, but it is merely by imitation [taqlid]—it is like a child's fear of a snake, imitating his father. That is not based on insight [basira], so it is no wonder it weakens and vanishes quickly. Indeed, the child may see the snake-charmer proceed to take the snake, look at him, be deceived by him, and dare to take it, imitating him, just as he refrained from taking it by imitating his father. Imitative beliefs are generally weak, unless they are strengthened by constantly witnessing their confirming causes and by persisting in their requirements—in multiplying acts of obedience and avoiding sins for a long duration, continuously. Therefore, whoever ascends to the pinnacle of knowledge [ma'rifa] and knows Allah the Exalted, fears Him by necessity. He does not need a remedy to bring about fear, just as one who knows the lion and sees himself fallen into its claws does not need a remedy to bring fear to his heart. Rather, he fears it by necessity, whether he wills or not. For this reason, Allah the Exalted inspired to David, peace be upon him: \"Fear Me as you fear the predatory lion.\" There is no means to bring about fear of the predatory lion except knowing the lion and knowing one has fallen into its claws. So he needs no means. Thus, whoever knows Allah the Exalted knows that He does what He wills and does not care, and He decrees what He desires and does not fear. He brought the angels near without a prior means, and He banished Iblis without a past crime. Rather, His attribute is what His statement translates: \"These are in Paradise, and I do not care.\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وإنما كان استغفاره عن أحوال هي درجات بعد بالإضافة إلى ما بعدها وإن كانت قربا بالإضافة إلى ما قبلها فلا قرب إلا ويبقى وراءه قرب لا نهاية له إذ سبيل السلوك إلى الله تعالى غير متناه والوصول إلى أقصى درجات القرب محال والمعنى الثالث أن ينظر في مبادئ أحواله فيرتضيها ثم ينظر في عوافيها فيزدريها لاطلاعه على خفايا الغرور فيها فيرى ذلك من الله تعالى فيستمع البيت في حق الله تعالى شكاية من القضاء والقدر وهذا كفر كما سبق بيانه وما من بيت إلا ويمكن تنزيله على معان وذلك بقدر غزارة علم المستمع وصفاء قلبه الحالة الرابعة سماع من جاوز الأحوال والمقامات فعزب عن فهم ما سوى الله تعالى حتى عزب عن نفسه واحوالها ومعاملاتها وكان كالمدهوش الغائص في بحر عين الشهود الذي يضاهي حاله حال النسوة اللاتي قطعن ايديهن في مشاهدة جمال يوسف عليه السلام حتى دهشن وسقط احساسهن وعن مثل هذه الحالة تعبر الصوفية بأنه قد فنى عن نفسه ومهما فنى عن نفسه فهو عن غيره أفنى فكأنه فنى عن كل شيء إلا عن الواحد المشهود وفنى أيضا عن الشهود فإن القلب أيضا إذا التفت إلى الشهود وإلى نفسه بأنه مشاهد فقد غفل عن المشهود فالمستهتر بالمرئي لا التفات له في حال استغراقه إلى رؤيته ولا إلى عينه التي بها رؤيته ولا إلى قلبه الذي به لذته فالسكران لا خبر</div></div></div>"}},"103":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.53","c":"وَاعْتَصِمُوا","d":"wa-iʿ'taṣimū","e":"۟āwُmِṣَtْʿعٱَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.07","c":"بِحَبْلِ","d":"biḥabli","e":"ِlْbَḥِb"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.08","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.13","c":"جَمِيعًا","d":"jamīʿan","e":"āًʿعyِmَjg"},{"b":"4","h":"5.37","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"5.5","h":"6.9","c":"تَفَرَّقُوا","d":"tafarraqū","e":"۟āwُqَّrَfَt"},{"b":"7.7","h":"10.3","c":"وَاذْكُرُوا","d":"wa-udh'kurū","e":"۟āwُrُkْhdٱَw"},{"b":"8.8","h":"11.53","c":"نِعْمَتَ","d":"niʿ'mata","e":"َtَmْʿعِn"},{"b":"9.7","h":"12.71","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"10.5","h":"13.75","c":"عَلَيْكُمْ","d":"ʿalaykum","e":"ْmُkْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"11.","h":"15.24","c":"إِذْ","d":"idh","e":"ْhdِiʾ"},{"b":"12.0","h":"15.75","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"13.9","h":"17.52","c":"أَعْدَاءً","d":"aʿdāan","e":"ًءٓāَdْʿعَaʾ"},{"b":"17.4","h":"20.82","c":"فَأَلَّفَ","d":"fa-allafa","e":"َfَّlَaʾَf"},{"b":"18.6","h":"22.35","c":"بَيْنَ","d":"bayna","e":"َnْyَb"},{"b":"19.2","h":"23.15","c":"قُلُوبِكُمْ","d":"qulūbikum","e":"ْmُkِbwُlُq"},{"b":"20.6","h":"24.8","c":"فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ","d":"fa-aṣbaḥtum","e":"mُtْḥَbْṣَaʾَf"},{"b":"22.9","h":"27.4","c":"بِنِعْمَتِهِ","d":"biniʿ'matihi","e":"ٓۦِhِtَmْʿعِnِb"},{"b":"25.9","h":"30.6","c":"إِخْوَانًا","d":"ikh'wānan","e":"āًnَٰwْhkِiʾ"},{"b":"33.","h":"35.2","c":"وَكُنْتُمْ","d":"wakuntum","e":"ْmُtnُkَw"},{"b":"36.3","h":"36.97","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"37.0","h":"37.89","c":"شَفَا","d":"shafā","e":"āَfَhs"},{"b":"37.7","h":"38.84","c":"حُفْرَةٍ","d":"ḥuf'ratin","e":"ٍẗَrْfُḥ"},{"b":"39.","h":"40.6","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"39.9","h":"41.36","c":"النَّارِ","d":"l-nāri","e":"ِrāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"41.2","h":"42.86","c":"فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ","d":"fa-anqadhakum","e":"mُkَhdَqnَaʾَf"},{"b":"44.2","h":"46.12","c":"مِنْهَا","d":"min'hā","e":"āَhْnِّm"},{"b":"45.","h":"50.45","c":"كَذَلِكَ","d":"kadhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhdَk"},{"b":"46.9","h":"51.56","c":"يُبَيِّنُ","d":"yubayyinu","e":"ُnِّyَbُy"},{"b":"48.3","h":"52.89","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"49.0","h":"53.85","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"ْmُkَl"},{"b":"49.7","h":"54.69","c":"ءَايَاتِهِ","d":"āyātihi","e":"ۦِhِtَٰyāَء"},{"b":"51.4","h":"56.84","c":"لَعَلَّكُمْ","d":"laʿallakum","e":"ْmُkَّlَʿعَl"},{"b":"52.8","h":"58.52","c":"تَهْتَدُونَ","d":"tahtadūna","e":"َnwُdَtْhَt"}],"a":{"g":"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.

Then they did not encompass all of its fruits, but each one mentioned from its fruits what occurred to him and what was present in his mind, and they did not devote care to mentioning its definition and its reality with all of its fruits in detail and comprehensiveness. And lifting the veil from the reality is more important than transmitting differing statements.\n\nSo We say: *Khulq* and *khalq* are two expressions used together. It is said: 'So-and-so is of good *khulq* and *khalq*'—meaning good in the inward [batin] and the outward [zahir]. For *khalq* is intended as the outward form, and *khulq* is intended as the inward form. That is because the human is composed of a body perceived by sight [basar] and of a spirit [ruh] and soul [nafs] perceived by insight [basira]. And each one of them has a state [haya] and a form [sura], either ugly or beautiful. And the soul [nafs] perceived by insight is of greater stature than the body perceived by sight. And for that, Allah magnified its affair by attributing it to Himself when He, the Exalted, said: \"Indeed, I am creating a human from clay. So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My spirit [ruh], then fall down to him in prostration.\" Thus He pointed out that the body is ascribed to the clay and the spirit [ruh] to the Lord of the worlds. And what is intended by spirit [ruh] and soul [nafs] in this context is one.\n\nThus, character [khuluq] is an expression for a firmly established state [haya] in the soul [nafs], from which actions issue forth with ease and facility, without need for thought and deliberation. If the state is such that beautiful, praiseworthy actions—by reason [aql] and by law [shar']—issue forth from it, that state is called good character [khuluq hasan]. And if what issues forth from it are ugly actions, the state which is the source is called bad character [khuluq sayyi']. And We only said it is a firmly established state because one from whom spending wealth occurs rarely due to a transient need is not said to have the character [khuluq] of generosity, unless that becomes firmly established in his soul [nafs] with firm rootedness.\n\nAnd We stipulated that actions issue forth from it with ease. And He, the Exalted, said: \"And those who restrain anger [ghayz] and pardon the people,\" and He did not say 'those devoid of anger.' Thus, He returned anger [ghadab] and desire [shahwa] to a state of moderation [i'tidal] such that neither of them overpowers the intellect [aql] nor overcomes it. Rather, the intellect [aql] is the controller of them and the dominant over them—this is possible. And that is what is intended by changing character [taghyir al-khuluq], for perhaps desire [shahwa] may gain mastery over a person such that his intellect [aql] is not strong enough to repel it, and he proceeds to indulge in indecencies. And through spiritual discipline [riyada] it returns to a state of moderation [i'tidal]. Thus, it indicates that this is possible, and experience [tajriba] and observation [mushahada] indicate that with an indication in which there is no doubt.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>و الكاظمين الغيظ ولم يقل و الفاقدين الغيظ وهذا لأن العادة لا تنتهي إلى أن يجرح الإنسان فلا يتألم بل تنتهي إلى أن يصبر عليه ويحتمل وكما أن التألم بالجرح مقتضى طبع البدن فالتألم بأسباب الغضب طبع القلب ولا يمكن قلعه ولكن ضبطه وكظمه و العمل بخلاف مقتضاه فإنه يقتضي التشفي و الانتقام و المكافأة وترك العمل بمقتضاه ممكن</div></div></div>"}},"135":{"w":[{"b":"0.09","h":"0.41","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.13","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.14","c":"فَعَلُوا","d":"faʿalū","e":"۟āwُlَʿعَf"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.53","c":"فَاحِشَةً","d":"fāḥishatan","e":"ًẗَhsِḥَٰf"},{"b":"4.2","h":"6.68","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"7.21","c":"ظَلَمُوا","d":"ẓalamū","e":"۟āٓwُmَlَẓ"},{"b":"6.8","h":"9.84","c":"أَنْفُسَهُمْ","d":"anfusahum","e":"ْmُhَsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"12.25","c":"ذَكَرُوا","d":"dhakarū","e":"۟āwُrَkَhd"},{"b":"13.9","h":"13.31","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"14.6","h":"14.5","c":"فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا","d":"fa-is'taghfarū","e":"۟āwُrَfْغَtْsٱَf"},{"b":"16.","h":"16.85","c":"لِذُنُوبِهِمْ","d":"lidhunūbihim","e":"ْmِhِbwُnُhdِl"},{"b":"17.","h":"19.06","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"19.1","h":"20.58","c":"يَغْفِرُ","d":"yaghfiru","e":"ُrِfْغَy"},{"b":"19.9","h":"21.76","c":"الذُّنُوبَ","d":"l-dhunūba","e":"َbwُnُّhdlٱ"},{"b":"21.0","h":"23.46","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"21.6","h":"24.43","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"33.0","h":"36.59","c":"وَلَمْ","d":"walam","e":"ْmَlَw"},{"b":"33.5","h":"37.49","c":"يُصِرُّوا","d":"yuṣirrū","e":"۟āwُّrِṣُy"},{"b":"34.6","h":"39.28","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"35.4","h":"40.41","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"35.7","h":"41","c":"فَعَلُوا","d":"faʿalū","e":"۟āwُlَʿعَf"},{"b":"36.","h":"42.53","c":"وَهُمْ","d":"wahum","e":"ْmُhَw"},{"b":"37.4","h":"43.48","c":"يَعْلَمُونَ","d":"yaʿlamūna","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَy"}],"a":{"g":"And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-9.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Invocations and Supplications</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, He, the Exalted, says: \"And those who, when they commit an immorality [fahisha] or wrong themselves [zalamu anfusahum], remember Allah and seek forgiveness [istaghfaru] for their sins...\" (3:135).

Indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance [tawwāban].\" (110:3). And He, the Exalted, says: \"And those who seek forgiveness [mustaghfirīn] before dawn [asḥār].\" (3:17).\n\nAnd He, peace and blessings be upon him, would frequently say: \"Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. O Allah, forgive me. Indeed, You are the Accepter of Repentance [al-Tawwāb], the Merciful [al-Rahīm].\" And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever increases in seeking forgiveness [istighfār], Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will make for him from every worry a relief, and from every hardship a way out, and will provide for him from where he does not expect.\" And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, I seek forgiveness [astaghfir] from Allah, the Exalted, and repent [atūbu] to Him seventy times a day.\" This, despite the fact that He, peace and blessings be upon him, was forgiven for what preceded of his sin and what would follow. And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, a veil [ghayyān] covers my heart [qalbī] until I seek forgiveness [astaghfir] from Allah, the Exalted, one hundred times every day.\" And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Whoever says when he retires to his bed: 'I seek forgiveness [astaghfir] from Allah, the Supreme, besides whom there is no deity, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I repent [atūbu] to Him' three times, Allah will forgive him his sins, even if they were like the foam of the sea, or the number of the sand of 'Alij, or the number of leaves on the trees, or the number of the days of the world [dunyā].\" And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said in another narration: \"Whoever says that, his sins are forgiven, even if he was one who fled from the battlefield.\" And Hudhayfah said: \"I was sharp-tongued with my family, so I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I fear my tongue will enter me into the Fire.' So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'So where are you from seeking forgiveness [istighfār]?

As for remaining perpetually with the party of the angels or with the party of Satan, that is rare from both sides. And these acts of obedience [ta'at] and these acts of disobedience [ma'asi] appear from the treasuries of the unseen [ghayb] to the world of witnessing [shahada] by means of the treasury of the heart [qalb], for it is from the treasuries of the dominion [malakut]. And they, when they appear, are signs by which the possessors of hearts [arbab al-qulub] know the precedent decree [sabiq al-qada']. For he who is created for Paradise, the means of obedience [ta'at] are made easy for him, and he who is created for the Fire, the means of disobedience [ma'asi] are made easy for him, and evil companions are given authority over him, and the judgment [hukm] of Satan is cast into his heart [qalb]. For he, with various judgments [ahkam], deceives the foolish by saying, \"Indeed, God is Merciful, so do not care,\" and, \"Indeed, all people do not fear God, so do not oppose them,\" and, \"Indeed, life is long, so be patient until you repent tomorrow.\" He promises them and gives them false hopes, and Satan promises them nothing but delusion [ghurur]. He promises them repentance [tawba] and gives them false hopes of forgiveness [maghfira], so he destroys them by the permission of God, the Exalted, with these tricks and what is similar to them, and he expands his heart [qalb] to accept delusion [ghurur] and constricts it from accepting the truth [haqq]. And all of that is by a decree [qada'] and a measure [qadar] from God. So whom God wills to guide, He expands his breast [sadr] for submission [islam], and whom He wills to lead astray, He makes his breast [sadr] tight and constricted, as if he were climbing into the sky. \"If God gives you victory, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, who is there that can help you after Him?\" He is the Guide and the Misguider. He does what He wills and decrees what He intends. There is none to repel His decree [hukm] and none to reverse His judgment [qada']. He created Paradise and created for it its people, so He employed them with obedience [ta'a]. And He created the Fire and created for it its people, so He employed him with disobedience [ma'asi]. And He made known to creation the sign of the people of Paradise and the people of the Fire, saying, \"Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss, and indeed, the wicked will be in a Blazing Fire.\" Then He, the Exalted, said—as narrated from His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him—\"These are in Paradise, and I do not care, and these are in the Fire, and I do not care.\" So exalted is God, the True Sovereign; He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>قلب المؤمن بين أصبعين من أصابع الرحمن أي بين تجاذب هذين الجندين وهو الغالب أعني التقليب والانتقال من حزب إلى حزب أما الثبات على الدوام مع حزب الملائكة أو مع حزب الشيطان فنادر من الجانبين وهذه الطاعات والمعاصي تظهر من خزائن الغيب إلى عالم الشهادة بواسطة خزانة القلب فإنه من خزائن الملكوت وهي أيضا إذا ظهرت كانت علامات تعرف أرباب القلوب سابق القضاء فمن خلق للجنة يسرت له أسباب الطاعات ومن خلق للنار يسرت له أسباب المعاصي وسلط عليه أقران السوء وألقى في قلبه حكم الشيطان فإنه بأنواع الحكم يغر الحمقى بقوله إن الله رحيم فلا تبال وإن الناس كلهم ما يخافون الله فلا تخالفهم وإن العمر طويل فاصبر حتى تتوب غدا يعدهم ويمنيهم وما يعدهم الشيطان إلا غرورا يعدهم التوبة ويمنيهم المغفرة فيهلكهم بإذن الله تعالى بهذه الحيل وما يجري مجراها فيوسع قلبه لقبول الغرور ويضيقه عن قبول الحق وكل ذلك بقضاء من الله وقدر فمن يرد الله أن يهديه يشرح صدره للإسلام ومن يرد أن يضله يجعل صدره ضيقا حرجا كأنما يصعد في السماء إن ينصركم الله فلا غالب لكم وإن يخذلكم فمن ذا الذي ينصركم من بعده فهو الهادي والمضل يفعل ما يشاء ويحكم ما يريد لا راد لحكمه ولا معقب لقضائه خلق الجنة وخلق لها أهلا فاستعملهم بالطاعة وخلق النار وخلق لها أهلا فاستعمله بالمعاصي وعرف الخلق علامة أهل الجنة وأهل النار فقال إن الأبرار لفي نعيم وإن الفجار لفي جحيم ثم قال تعالى فيما روى عن نبيه صلى الله عليه وسلم هؤلاء في الجنة ولا أبالي وهؤلاء في النار ولا أبالي فتعالى الله الملك الحق لا يسئل عما يفعل وهم يسئلون</div></div></div>"}},"161":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.21","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"0.7","h":"1.08","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.23","c":"لِنَبِيٍّ","d":"linabiyyin","e":"ٍّàِbَnِl"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.32","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.55","c":"يَغُلَّ","d":"yaghulla","e":"َّlُغَy"},{"b":"5.2","h":"8.2","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"6.5","h":"9.57","c":"يَغْلُلْ","d":"yaghlul","e":"ْlُlْغَy"},{"b":"7.1","h":"10.78","c":"يَأْتِ","d":"yati","e":"ِtْaʾَy"},{"b":"7.9","h":"11.87","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"8.5","h":"12.98","c":"غَلَّ","d":"ghalla","e":"َّlَغ"},{"b":"9.1","h":"13.92","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"9.7","h":"15.02","c":"الْقِيَامَةِ","d":"l-qiyāmati","e":"ِẗَmَٰyِqْlٱ"},{"b":"11.4","h":"18.95","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"12.6","h":"20.11","c":"تُوَفَّى","d":"tuwaffā","e":"ٰàَّfَwُt"},{"b":"13.7","h":"22.01","c":"كُلُّ","d":"kullu","e":"ُّlُk"},{"b":"14.","h":"23.15","c":"نَفْسٍ","d":"nafsin","e":"ٍsْfَn"},{"b":"15.","h":"25.04","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَّm"},{"b":"16.0","h":"25.59","c":"كَسَبَتْ","d":"kasabat","e":"ْtَbَsَk"},{"b":"16.8","h":"26.92","c":"وَهُمْ","d":"wahum","e":"ْmُhَw"},{"b":"17.5","h":"28.28","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"17.9","h":"29.05","c":"يُظْلَمُونَ","d":"yuẓ'lamūna","e":"َnwُmَlْẓُy"}],"a":{"g":"It is not [attributable] to any prophet that he would act unfaithfully [in regard to war booty].

He is only granted respite so that he may increase in sin [ithm] and his punishment ['iqab] be prolonged, as the Most High has said: \"We only grant them respite that they may increase in sin [ithm].\" As for the acts of disobedience [ma'asi], from where do you know that in the world ['alam] there is one who is more disobedient than you? Perhaps a thought [khatir] of poor etiquette concerning Allah, the Most High, and His attributes is greater and more grievous than drinking wine, fornication [zina], and all other sins [ma'asi] of the limbs. For this reason, the Most High said concerning its like: \"And you consider it trivial, but it is, with Allah, immense.\" So from where do you know that another is more disobedient than you? Then perhaps his punishment ['iqab] has been delayed for the Hereafter [Akhira], while your punishment ['iqab] was hastened in this world [dunya]. So why do you not give thanks [shukr] to Allah, the Most High, for that? This is the third aspect of thankfulness [shukr], which is that there is no punishment ['iqab] except that it is conceivable for it to be delayed until the Hereafter [Akhira]. The afflictions [masa'ib] of this world [dunya] are consoled by other means which lessen the affliction [musiba], so its impact is lightened. But the affliction [musiba] of the Hereafter [Akhira] is everlasting, and even if it were not everlasting, there is no way to lighten it through consolation, for the means of consolation are completely cut off in the Hereafter [Akhira] for those being punished. And for one whose punishment ['iqab] was hastened in this world [dunya], he is not punished a second time, for the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, when a servant ['abd] commits a sin [dhanb] and is then afflicted with hardship or tribulation in this world [dunya], Allah is more Noble than to punish him a second time.\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى \"إنما نملي لهم ليزدادوا إثماً\" وفي تفسير قوله تعالى \"سنستدرجهم من حيث لا يعلمون\" أنهم كلما أحدثوا ذنباً أحدثنا لهم نعمة ليزدادوا غرورهم وقال تعالى \"إنما نملي لهم ليزدادوا إثماً\".</div></div></div>"}},"179":{"w":[{"b":"0.14","h":"0.61","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَّm"},{"b":"0.55","h":"1.09","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.17","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.47","c":"لِيَذَرَ","d":"liyadhara","e":"َrَhdَyِl"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.64","c":"الْمُؤْمِنِينَ","d":"l-mu'minīna","e":"َnyِnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"6.67","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"5.3","h":"7.8","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"7.2","h":"9.58","c":"أَنْتُمْ","d":"antum","e":"ْmُtnَaʾ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"11.29","c":"عَلَيْهِ","d":"ʿalayhi","e":"ِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"9.7","h":"12.52","c":"حَتَّى","d":"ḥattā","e":"ٰàَّtَḥ"},{"b":"10.6","h":"13.93","c":"يَمِيزَ","d":"yamīza","e":"َzyِmَy"},{"b":"11.5","h":"15.23","c":"الْخَبِيثَ","d":"l-khabītha","e":"َhtyِbَhkْlٱ"},{"b":"12.7","h":"16.75","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"13.1","h":"17.28","c":"الطَّيِّبِ","d":"l-ṭayibi","e":"ِbِّyَّṭlٱ"},{"b":"14.6","h":"21.1","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"15.3","h":"21.94","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"16.0","h":"22.92","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"17.0","h":"24.29","c":"لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ","d":"liyuṭ'liʿakum","e":"ْmُkَʿعِlْṭُyِl"},{"b":"18.5","h":"26.46","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"19.0","h":"27.2","c":"الْغَيْبِ","d":"l-ghaybi","e":"ِbْyَغْlٱ"},{"b":"19.9","h":"28.54","c":"وَلَكِنَّ","d":"walākinna","e":"َّnِkَٰlَw"},{"b":"21.","h":"31.13","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"22.7","h":"32.37","c":"يَجْتَبِي","d":"yajtabī","e":"àِbَtْjgَy"},{"b":"23.9","h":"33.97","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"24.0","h":"34.13","c":"رُسُلِهِ","d":"rusulihi","e":"ۦِhِlُsُّr"},{"b":"25.4","h":"36.23","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"26.4","h":"37.1","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"29.6","h":"42.25","c":"فَءَامِنُوا","d":"faāminū","e":"۟āwُnِmāَٔـَf"},{"b":"31.0","h":"44.17","c":"بِاللَّهِ","d":"bil-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱِb"},{"b":"32.1","h":"45.77","c":"وَرُسُلِهِ","d":"warusulihi","e":"ۦِhِlُsُrَw"},{"b":"33.5","h":"49.51","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"nِiʾَw"},{"b":"34.6","h":"50.79","c":"تُؤْمِنُوا","d":"tu'minū","e":"۟āwُnِmْwʾُt"},{"b":"35.9","h":"52.65","c":"وَتَتَّقُوا","d":"watattaqū","e":"۟āwُqَّtَtَw"},{"b":"37.1","h":"54.57","c":"فَلَكُمْ","d":"falakum","e":"ْmُkَlَf"},{"b":"38.1","h":"55.92","c":"أَجْرٌ","d":"ajrun","e":"ٌrْjgَaʾ"},{"b":"38.9","h":"57.06","c":"عَظِيمٌ","d":"ʿaẓīmun","e":"ٌmyِẓَʿع"}],"a":{"g":"Allah would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separates the evil from the good.

When they drew you near, they took you as an axis [qutb] upon which the millstone of their injustice revolves, and as a bridge [jisr] over which they cross to their calamity, and as a ladder [sullam] upon which they ascend to their misguidance.

And they have realized with certainty [tahaqqu] that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning [luzum al-muhasaba] and sincerity in self-vigilance [sidq al-muraqaba], and holding the soul [nafs] to account for every breath [anfas] and movement [harakat], and reckoning with it for every passing thought [khawatir] and glance [lahthat]. For whoever holds his soul to account before he is held to account, his reckoning on the Day of Standing [al-qiyamah] will be lightened, his answer will be present when questioned, and his return and his final destination [ma'ab] will be good. And whoever does not hold his soul to account, his regrets [hasrat] will be prolonged, and his stations [waqfat] in the plains ['arasat] of the Day of Standing will be lengthy, and his misdeeds [sayyi'at] will lead him to disgrace and contempt. When this was unveiled to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to God. And He had commanded them to patience [sabr] and steadfast vigilance [murabata], so He, Mighty and Majestic is He, said: \"O you who believe, be patient, and vie in patience, and be steadfast, and fear God, that you may succeed.\" So they made their souls steadfastly vigilant [rabatu anfusahum] first through mutual pledging [al-musharata], then through self-vigilance [al-muraqaba], then through self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], then through self-chastisement [al-mu'aqaba], then through spiritual struggle [al-mujahada], then through self-admonition [al-mu'ataba]. Thus, for them in steadfast vigilance [al-murabata] were six stations [maqamat], and it is necessary to explain them, clarify their reality [haqiqa] and their virtue [fadila], and detail the works within them. The foundation of all that is self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], but every reckoning [hisab] comes after mutual pledging [musharata] and self-vigilance [muraqaba], and is followed, in case of loss [khusran], by self-admonition [mu'ataba] and self-chastisement [mu'aqaba].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد قيل في معنى قوله تعالى: ﴿ اصبروا وصابروا ورابطوا ﴾ اصبروا في الله وصابروا بالله ورابطوا مع الله وقيل الصبر لله غناء والصبر بالله بقاء والصبر مع الله وفاء والصبر عن الله جفاء وقد قيل في معناه والصبر عنك فمذموم عواقبه والصبر في سائر الاشياء محمود وقيل ايضا: الصبر يحمل في المواطن كلها الا عليك فانه لا يجمل</div></div></div>"}}}
