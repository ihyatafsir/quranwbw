As for the delusion of the disbelievers concerning Allah: its example is the statement of some of them within themselves and with their tongues: \"If there is from Allah a return [ma'ad], then we are more deserving of it than others and we have a greater share in it and a happier state,\" just as Allah the Exalted informed about him from the statement of the two neighboring men when he said, **\"And I do not think the Hour will occur. And if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find better than it as a destination.\"** And the entirety of their affair, as is related in the interpretation [tafsir]: that the disbeliever of the two built a palace for a thousand dinars and bought an orchard for a thousand dinars and servants for a thousand dinars and married a woman for a thousand dinars, and in all of that the believer admonishes him and says: \"You bought a palace that perishes and is ruined—why did you not buy a palace in Paradise that does not perish! And you bought an orchard that is ruined and perishes—why did you not buy an orchard in Paradise that does not perish, and servants who do not perish nor die, and a wife from the wide-eyed maidens [hur al-'ayn] who does not die!\" And in all of that the disbeliever replies to him and says: \"There is nothing there, and what is said of that is lies! And if it is, then surely for me in Paradise will be better than this.\" And likewise, Allah the Exalted described the statement of the disobedient 'As ibn Wa'il when he says, **\"I will surely be given wealth and children,\"** so Allah the Exalted said in reply to him, **\"Has he perceived the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise? No!\"** And it is narrated from Khabbab ibn al-Aratt that he said: \"I had a debt due from al-'As ibn Wa'il, so I came to demand it from him, but he did not settle it for me, so I said: 'I will take it in the Hereafter [Akhirah]'; so he said to me: 'When you reach the Hereafter, then indeed I will have there wealth and children, and I will settle you from it.'\" So Allah the Exalted revealed His saying, **\"Then have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, 'I will surely be given wealth and children'?\"** And Allah the Exalted said, **\"And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, 'This is due to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; but if I am returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best.'\"** And all of this is from delusion [ghurur] concerning Allah.</div></div></div>"}},"13":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"وَبَنِينَ","d":"wabanīna","e":"َnyِnَbَw"},{"b":"0.94","h":"2.23","c":"شُهُودًا","d":"shuhūdan","e":"āًdwُhُhs"}],"a":{"g":"And children present [with him]","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book 10a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>None</div></div></div>"}},"14":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"وَمَهَّدْتُ","d":"wamahhadttu","e":"ُّtdَّhَmَw"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.84","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.77","c":"تَمْهِيدًا","d":"tamhīdan","e":"āًdyِhْmَt"}],"a":{"g":"And spread [everything] before him, easing [his life]."}},"15":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.05","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.4","c":"يَطْمَعُ","d":"yaṭmaʿu","e":"ُʿعَmْṭَy"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.8","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"ْnَaʾ"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.42","c":"أَزِيدَ","d":"azīda","e":"َdyِzَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"Then he desires that I should add more."}},"16":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"ٓāَّlَk"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.84","c":"إِنَّهُ","d":"innahu","e":"ۥُhَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.62","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.69","c":"لِءَايَاتِنَا","d":"liāyātinā","e":"āَnِtَٰyāَءِl"},{"b":"5.0","h":"8.49","c":"عَنِيدًا","d":"ʿanīdan","e":"āًdyِnَʿع"}],"a":{"g":"No!

Allah, the Exalted, says: \"And none knows the armies of your Lord except Him.\" For Allah, glorified is He, has in the hearts [qulub] and the spirits [arwah] and other realms, marshalled armies whose true reality and detailed number none knows except Him. And we now point to some of the armies of the heart [qalb], for it is what pertains to our purpose. And it has two armies: an army seen with the eyes, and an army not seen except with the insights [basair]. And it is in the position of the king, and the armies are in the position of servants and helpers. This is the meaning of the army.\n\nAs for its army witnessed by the eye, it is the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear, the tongue, and all the outward and inward limbs. For all of them are servants to the heart [qalb] and subjugated for it. It is the one directing them and turning them. They were created molded for its obedience, unable to oppose it or rebel against it. If it commands the eye to open, it opens. If it commands the foot to move, it moves. If it commands the tongue to speak and firmly judges for it to speak, it speaks, and likewise all the limbs. And the subjugation of the limbs and senses to the heart [qalb] resembles, in one aspect, the subjugation of the angels to Allah, the Exalted, for they are molded for obedience, unable to oppose Him—rather, they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them and they do what they are commanded. They only differ in one thing, which is that the angels, peace be upon them, are aware of their obedience and compliance, while the eyelids obey the heart [qalb] in opening and closing by way of subjugation, and they have no awareness of themselves or of their obedience to the heart [qalb].\n\nThe heart [qalb] only needed these armies due to its need for the mount and the provision for its journey, for which it was created—and that is the journey to Allah, glorified is He, and traversing the waystations to meeting Him. For this purpose the hearts [qulub] were created. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\" Its mount is the body, and its provision is knowledge [ilm]. And the means that deliver it to the provision and enable it to take provision from it are righteous deeds. And the servant cannot reach Allah, glorified is He, unless he resides in the body and traverses the world [dunya], for the lower waystation must be traversed to reach the farthest waystation. The world [dunya] is the field for the Hereafter [akhirah], and it is a waystation from among the waystations of guidance. It is only called *dunya* because it is the lower of the two waystations. So it was compelled to take provision from this world [alam]. The body is its mount by which it reaches this world [alam]. So it needed to tend to the body and preserve it. And the body is only preserved by bringing to it what agrees with it from nourishment and other things, and by repelling from it what is harmful from causes.</div></div></div>"}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"0.84","h":"0.97","c":"وَالْقَمَرِ","d":"wal-qamari","e":"ِrَmَqْlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"No!

If you say: Then where is the place of hope [raja'] and its praiseworthy position? Know that it is praiseworthy in two places:\n\nThe first: In the case of the disobedient one who is immersed [in sin], when the thought of repentance [tawba] occurs to him, and Satan says to him: \"How could your repentance be accepted?\" causing him to despair [qunut] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is necessary to suppress despair with hope [raja'] and to remember, \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins,\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.' And turn to your Lord.\" He commanded them to turn [inaba]. And He, the Exalted, says: \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\" So if one anticipates forgiveness [maghfira] with repentance, he is hopeful [raji]. But if one anticipates forgiveness while persisting [in sin], he is deluded.\n\nThe second: That one's soul [nafs] becomes sluggish concerning the virtues of deeds and confines itself to the obligatory acts. So he should make his soul hope for the bliss [na'im] of Allah, the Exalted, and what He has promised the righteous, so that from hope [raja'] a vigor for worship may spring forth, and he may turn to the virtuous deeds and remember His saying, the Exalted: \"Certainly will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly submissive\" to His saying: \"Those are the inheritors Who will inherit Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.\"\n\nSo the first hope [raja'] suppresses the despair [qunut] that prevents repentance [tawba]. The second hope suppresses the sluggishness [futur] that prevents vigor and exertion. Thus, every anticipation that urges towards repentance or towards exertion in worship is hope [raja']. And every hope that causes sluggishness in worship and contentment with idleness is delusion [ghurra].</div></div></div>"}},"39":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.6","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ٓāَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"2.0","h":"2.64","c":"أَصْحَابَ","d":"aṣḥāba","e":"َbَٰḥْṣَaʾ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"3.66","c":"الْيَمِينِ","d":"l-yamīni","e":"ِnyِmَyْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Except the companions of the right,"}},"40":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.35","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"0.41","h":"0.67","c":"جَنَّاتٍ","d":"jannātin","e":"ٍtَّٰnَjg"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.04","c":"يَتَسَاءَلُونَ","d":"yatasāalūna","e":"َnwُlَءٓāَsَtَy"}],"a":{"g":"[Who will be] in gardens, questioning each other"}},"41":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.2","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"0.48","h":"0","c":"الْمُجْرِمِينَ","d":"l-muj'rimīna","e":"َnyِmِrْjgُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"About the criminals,"}},"42":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.45","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"0.41","h":"0.73","c":"سَلَكَكُمْ","d":"salakakum","e":"ْmُkَkَlَs"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.85","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.33","c":"سَقَرَ","d":"saqara","e":"َrَqَs"}],"a":{"g":"[And asking them], \"What put you into Saqar?\"","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 4</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, therefore, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said concerning their opposites: \"What has caused you to enter Saqar?\" They will say, \"We were not of those who prayed [al-musallin].\" (74:42-43)\n\nThus, those who pray [al-musallin] are the inheritors of Paradise [al-Firdaws], and they are the ones who witness the Light [nur] of Allah, the Exalted, and who delight in His proximity and nearness to their hearts [qulub].</div></div></div>"}},"43":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.55","c":"قَالُوا","d":"qālū","e":"۟āwُlāَq"},{"b":"0.72","h":"1.32","c":"لَمْ","d":"lam","e":"ْmَl"},{"b":"0.94","h":"1.55","c":"نَكُ","d":"naku","e":"ُkَn"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.16","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"1.8","h":"2.51","c":"الْمُصَلِّينَ","d":"l-muṣalīna","e":"َnyِّlَṣُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"They will say, \"We were not of those who prayed,"}},"44":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَلَمْ","d":"walam","e":"ْmَlَw"},{"b":"0.39","h":"0.47","c":"نَكُ","d":"naku","e":"ُkَn"},{"b":"0.93","h":"1.05","c":"نُطْعِمُ","d":"nuṭ'ʿimu","e":"ُmِʿعْṭُn"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.85","c":"الْمِسْكِينَ","d":"l-mis'kīna","e":"َnyِkْsِmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Nor did we used to feed the poor."}},"45":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"وَكُنَّا","d":"wakunnā","e":"āَّnُkَw"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.72","c":"نَخُوضُ","d":"nakhūḍu","e":"ُḍwُhkَn"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.62","c":"مَعَ","d":"maʿa","e":"َʿعَm"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.04","c":"الْخَائِضِينَ","d":"l-khāiḍīna","e":"َnyِḍِyʾٓāَhkْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged [in it],","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book4a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>The third affliction is plunging into falsehood [al-batil], which is speech concerning sins, such as recounting the affairs of women, gatherings of wine-drinking, the stations of the dissolute, the luxuries of the wealthy, the tyranny of kings and their blameworthy customs and their detestable conditions.

The types of falsehood [al-batil] cannot be enumerated due to their multitude and variety; therefore, there is no deliverance from them except by restricting oneself to what concerns the important matters of religion [din] and the worldly life [dunya]. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who plunges most into falsehood [al-batil].\" And the indication to this is in His saying, the Most High: \"And we used to plunge with those who plunge,\" and in His saying, the Most High: \"So do not sit with them until they plunge into a discourse other than it; for indeed you would then be like them.\" And Salman said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who speaks most concerning disobedience to Allah.\" So this is plunging into falsehood [al-batil], and it is beyond what will come of backbiting, tale-bearing, obscenity, and others. Rather, it is plunging into the mention of prohibitions whose occurrence has preceded, or contemplating how to reach them without a religious need to mention them. And there also enters into it plunging into recounting innovations and corrupt doctrines, and recounting what occurred of fighting among the Companions in a manner that suggests disparagement of some of them. And all of that is falsehood [al-batil], and plunging into it is plunging into falsehood [al-batil]. We ask Allah for goodly assistance through His gentleness and generosity.</div></div></div>"}},"46":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.2","c":"وَكُنَّا","d":"wakunnā","e":"āَّnُkَw"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.75","c":"نُكَذِّبُ","d":"nukadhibu","e":"ُbِّhdَkُn"},{"b":"2.5","h":"2.87","c":"بِيَوْمِ","d":"biyawmi","e":"ِmْwَyِb"},{"b":"3.3","h":"3.72","c":"الدِّينِ","d":"l-dīni","e":"ِnyِّdlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And we used to deny the Day of Recompense"}},"47":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0","c":"حَتَّى","d":"ḥattā","e":"ٰٓàَّtَḥ"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.13","c":"أَتَانَا","d":"atānā","e":"āَnٰàَtَaʾ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"3.08","c":"الْيَقِينُ","d":"l-yaqīnu","e":"ُnyِqَyْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Until there came to us the certainty.\""}},"48":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"فَمَا","d":"famā","e":"āَmَf"},{"b":"0.52","h":"0.8","c":"تَنْفَعُهُمْ","d":"tanfaʿuhum","e":"ْmُhُʿعَfnَt"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.68","c":"شَفَاعَةُ","d":"shafāʿatu","e":"ُẗَʿعَٰfَhs"},{"b":"3.5","h":"3.84","c":"الشَّافِعِينَ","d":"l-shāfiʿīna","e":"َnyِʿعِfَّٰhslٱ"}],"a":{"g":"So there will not benefit them the intercession of [any] intercessors.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book 9a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, among sins are those from which intercession [shafa'a] offers no salvation, and concerning them is the expression in His saying, the Most High: \"Nor will intercession avail except from one who has been granted permission\" [Quran 20:109], and in His saying: \"Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?\" [Quran 2:255], and in His saying: \"And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits\" [Quran 34:23], and in His saying: \"So the intercession of intercessors will not benefit them\" [Quran 74:48]. And when sins are divided into those for which there is intercession and those for which there is no intercession, fear [khawf] and apprehension are inevitably obligatory. If there were a sin for which intercession is accepted, He would not have commanded the Quraysh to obey, nor would the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, have forbidden Fatima, may God be pleased with her, from disobedience; and He would have permitted her to follow her desires to perfect her pleasure in this world [dunya], then interceded for her in the Hereafter [akhira] to perfect her pleasure in the Hereafter. Therefore, immersion in sins and abandoning piety [taqwa] in reliance on the hope of intercession resembles the immersion of a sick person in his desires, relying on a skilled, nearby, compassionate physician, be it a father, brother, or other. That is ignorance, for the effort, diligence, and skill of the physician are beneficial in removing some illnesses, not all of them. It is not permissible to abandon precautionary measures [himiya] absolutely, relying merely on medicine. Rather, the physician has an effect in general, but only in mild illnesses and when the dominance of a balanced temperament prevails. Thus should you understand the concern of the intercessors [shufa'a'] from among the prophets and the righteous for relatives and strangers, for it is certainly like that. And that does not remove fear [khawf] and caution. How could it remove it, when the best of creation after the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, were his Companions, and they used to wish they were cattle out of fear of the Hereafter [akhira], despite the perfection of their piety [taqwa], the goodness of their deeds, the purity of their hearts [qulub], and what they heard from the promise of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to them of Paradise specifically, and to the rest of the Muslims of intercession [shafa'a] generally? Yet they did not rely upon it, and fear [khawf] and humility did not depart their hearts [qulub]. So how can one who does not have the like of their companionship and precedence admire himself and rely on intercession [shafa'a]?</div></div></div>"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"فَمَا","d":"famā","e":"āَmَf"},{"b":"0.59","h":"0.95","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.51","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.96","c":"التَّذْكِرَةِ","d":"l-tadhkirati","e":"ِẗَrِkْhdَّtlٱ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.22","c":"مُعْرِضِينَ","d":"muʿ'riḍīna","e":"َnyِḍِrْʿعُm"}],"a":{"g":"Then what is [the matter] with them that they are, from the reminder, turning away"}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"كَأَنَّهُمْ","d":"ka-annahum","e":"ْmُhَّnَaʾَk"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.66","c":"حُمُرٌ","d":"ḥumurun","e":"ٌrُmُḥ"},{"b":"2.8","h":"3.14","c":"مُسْتَنْفِرَةٌ","d":"mus'tanfiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِfnَtْsُّm"}],"a":{"g":"As if they were alarmed donkeys"}},"51":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"فَرَّتْ","d":"farrat","e":"ْtَّrَf"},{"b":"0.75","h":"0.92","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"1.9","h":"1.85","c":"قَسْوَرَةٍ","d":"qaswaratin","e":"ٍۭẗَrَwْsَq"}],"a":{"g":"Fleeing from a lion?"}},"52":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.6","c":"بَلْ","d":"bal","e":"ْlَb"},{"b":"0.36","h":"0.83","c":"يُرِيدُ","d":"yurīdu","e":"ُdyِrُy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.71","c":"كُلُّ","d":"kullu","e":"ُّlُk"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.4","c":"امْرِئٍ","d":"im'ri-in","e":"ٍyʾِrْmٱ"},{"b":"3.3","h":"3.92","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"3.9","h":"4.69","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"5","h":"5.77","c":"يُؤْتَى","d":"yu'tā","e":"ٰàَtْwʾُy"},{"b":"5.6","h":"6.54","c":"صُحُفًا","d":"ṣuḥufan","e":"āًfُḥُṣ"},{"b":"7.5","h":"8.03","c":"مُنَشَّرَةً","d":"munasharatan","e":"ًẗَrَّhsَnُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Rather, every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about."}},"53":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.7","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.44","c":"بَلْ","d":"bal","e":"lَb"},{"b":"1.7","h":"1.65","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَّl"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.29","c":"يَخَافُونَ","d":"yakhāfūna","e":"َnwُfāَhkَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"3.71","c":"الْءَاخِرَةَ","d":"l-ākhirata","e":"َẗَrِhkāَءْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"No!
