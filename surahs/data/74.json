And if there were nothing before the dead except the terror of that Blast, that alone would be worthy of being guarded against. For it is a Blast and a Shout by which all in the heavens and the earth are struck unconscious [yus'aqu]—meaning they die by it—except whom Allah wills, and that is some of the angels. And for that reason, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"How can I be at ease when the bearer of the Horn [as-sur] has placed the Horn to his mouth, bent his forehead, and inclined his ear, awaiting when he will be commanded to blow?\" Muqatil said: The Horn [as-sur] is the Trumpet [al-qarn]. That is because Israfil, upon him be peace, places his mouth upon the Trumpet like the form of a trumpet, and the circumference of the head of the Trumpet is like the expanse of the heavens and the earth. And he is staring with his gaze towards the Throne, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first Blast. And when he blows, all in the heavens and the earth are struck unconscious—meaning every living creature dies from the intensity of the terror—except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death. Then He commands the Angel of Death to seize the spirit [ruh] of Jibril, then the spirit of Mika'il, then the spirit of Israfil. Then He commands the Angel of Death, and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first Blast in the Barzakh for forty years. Then Allah, exalted is He, revives Israfil and commands him to blow the second time. And that is His saying, exalted is He: \"Then it will be blown into it another time, and at once they will be standing, looking on\"—standing on their feet, looking at the Resurrection. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: \"When I was sent, I was sent to the bearer of the Horn, and he gestured with it to his mouth, and placed one foot forward and the other back, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow. So beware of the Blast.\" So reflect upon the creation and their humiliation, their brokenness, and their submission at the time of being raised up, in fear of this striking unconscious and in anticipation of what will be decreed for them of felicity [sa'ada] or wretchedness [shaqawa]. And you are among them, broken like their brokenness, bewildered like their bewilderment. Rather, if you were in the world [ad-dunya] among the luxurious and the wealthy who live in comfort, then the kings of the earth on that Day are the most humiliated people of the gathering place, the smallest of them, and the most contemptible. They are trampled underfoot like dust. And at that time, the wild beasts from the deserts and the mountains come forth, their heads lowered, mingled with the creation after their wildness, humbled for the Day of Resurrection [an-nushur], without any sin by which they were defiled. But their gathering was due to the intensity of the striking unconscious and the terror of the Blast, and that preoccupied them from fleeing from the creation and being wild towards them.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى: ﴿ فإذا نقر فى الناقور فذلك يومئذ يوم عسير على الكافرين غير يسير ﴾ {} فلو لم يكن بين يدي الموتي إلا هول تلك النفخة لكان ذلك جديرا بأن يتقى فإنها نفخة وصيحة يصعق بها من فى السموات والأرض يعنى يموتون بها إلا من شاء الله وهو بعض الملائكة ولذلك قال رسول الله ﭬ: (كيف أنعم وصاحب الصور قد التقم القرن وحنى الجبهة وأصغى بالأذن متى يؤمر فينفخ[144]) قال مقاتل: الصور هو القرن وذلك أن إسرافيل عليه السلام واضع فاه على القرن كهيئة البوق ودائرة رأس القرن كعرض السموات والأرض وهو شاخص بصره نحو العرش ينتظر متى يؤمر فينفخ النفخة الأولى فإذا نفخ صعق من فى السموات والأرض أى مات كل حيوان من شدة الفزع إلا من شاء الله وهو جبريل وميكائيل وإسرافيل وملك الموت ثم يأمر ملك الموت أن يقبض روح جبريل ثم روح ميكائيل ثم روح إسرافيل ثم يأمر ملك الموت فيموت ثم يلبث الخلق بعد النفخة الأولى فى البرزخ أربعين سنة ثم يحيى الله تعالى إسرافيل فيأمره أن ينفخ الثانية فذلك قوله تعالى: ﴿ ثم نفخ فيه أخرى فإذا هم قيام ينظرون ﴾ {} على أرجلهم ينظرون إلى البعث وقال رسول الله ﭬ: (حين بعث إلى بعث إلى صاحب الصور فأهوى به إلى فيه وقدم رجلا وأخر أخرى ينتظر متى يؤمر بالنفخ ألا فاتقوا النفخة[145]) فتفكر فى الخلائق وذلهم وانكسارهم واستكانتهم عند الانبعاث خوفا من هذه الصعقة وانتظارا لما يقضى عليهم من سعادة أو شقاوة وأنت فيما بينهم منكسر كانكسارهم متحير كتحيرهم بل إن كنت فى الدنيا من المترفهين والأغنياء المتنعمين فملوك الأرض فى ذلك اليوم أذل أهل أرض الجمع وأصغرهم وأحقرهم يوطئون بالأقدام مثل الذرة وعند ذلك تقبل الوحوش</div></div></div>"}},"9":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.6","c":"فَذَلِكَ","d":"fadhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhdَf"},{"b":"0.92","h":"2.09","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.39","c":"يَوْمٌ","d":"yawmun","e":"ٌmْwَy"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.51","c":"عَسِيرٌ","d":"ʿasīrun","e":"ٌryِsَʿع"}],"a":{"g":"That Day will be a difficult day"}},"10":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.05","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"0.39","h":"0.57","c":"الْكَافِرِينَ","d":"l-kāfirīna","e":"َnyِrِfَٰkْlٱ"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.98","c":"غَيْرُ","d":"ghayru","e":"ُrْyَغ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.11","c":"يَسِيرٍ","d":"yasīrin","e":"ٍryِsَy"}],"a":{"g":"For the disbelievers - not easy."}},"11":{"w":[{"b":"0.15","h":"0.6","c":"ذَرْنِي","d":"dharnī","e":"àِnْrَhd"},{"b":"0.94","h":"1.85","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"ْnَmَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.71","c":"خَلَقْتُ","d":"khalaqtu","e":"ُtْqَlَhk"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.11","c":"وَحِيدًا","d":"waḥīdan","e":"āًdyِḥَw"}],"a":{"g":"Leave Me with the one I created alone"}},"12":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"وَجَعَلْتُ","d":"wajaʿaltu","e":"ُtْlَʿعَjgَw"},{"b":"0.96","h":"1.75","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.73","c":"مَالًا","d":"mālan","e":"āًlāَm"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.44","c":"مَمْدُودًا","d":"mamdūdan","e":"āًdwُdْmَّm"}],"a":{"g":"And to whom I granted extensive wealth","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-10a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Self-Delusion</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And let us mention for delusion [ghurur] concerning Allah two examples from the delusion of the disbelievers and the disobedient. As for the delusion of the disbelievers concerning Allah: its example is the statement of some of them within themselves and with their tongues: \"If there is from Allah a return [ma'ad], then we are more deserving of it than others and we have a greater share in it and a happier state,\" just as Allah the Exalted informed about him from the statement of the two neighboring men when he said, **\"And I do not think the Hour will occur. And if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find better than it as a destination.\"** And the entirety of their affair, as is related in the interpretation [tafsir]: that the disbeliever of the two built a palace for a thousand dinars and bought an orchard for a thousand dinars and servants for a thousand dinars and married a woman for a thousand dinars, and in all of that the believer admonishes him and says: \"You bought a palace that perishes and is ruined—why did you not buy a palace in Paradise that does not perish! And you bought an orchard that is ruined and perishes—why did you not buy an orchard in Paradise that does not perish, and servants who do not perish nor die, and a wife from the wide-eyed maidens [hur al-'ayn] who does not die!\" And in all of that the disbeliever replies to him and says: \"There is nothing there, and what is said of that is lies! And if it is, then surely for me in Paradise will be better than this.\" And likewise, Allah the Exalted described the statement of the disobedient 'As ibn Wa'il when he says, **\"I will surely be given wealth and children,\"** so Allah the Exalted said in reply to him, **\"Has he perceived the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise? No!\"** And it is narrated from Khabbab ibn al-Aratt that he said: \"I had a debt due from al-'As ibn Wa'il, so I came to demand it from him, but he did not settle it for me, so I said: 'I will take it in the Hereafter [Akhirah]'; so he said to me: 'When you reach the Hereafter, then indeed I will have there wealth and children, and I will settle you from it.'\" So Allah the Exalted revealed His saying, **\"Then have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, 'I will surely be given wealth and children'?\"** And Allah the Exalted said, **\"And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, 'This is due to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; but if I am returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best.'\"** And all of this is from delusion [ghurur] concerning Allah.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولنذكر للغرور بالله مثالين من غرور الكافرين والعاصين. فأما غرور الكفار بالله: فمثاله قول بعضهم في أنفسهم وبألسنتهم: إنه لو كان لله من معاد فنحن أحق به من غيرنا ونحن أوفر حظاً فيه وأسعد حالاً، كما أخبر الله تعالى عنه من قول الرجلين المتجاورين إذ قال \"وما أظن الساعة قائمة ولئن رددت إلى ربي لأجدن خيراً منها منقلباً\" وجملة أمرهما كما نقل في التفسير: أن الكافر منهما بنى قصراً بألف دينار واشترى بستاناً بألف دينار وخدماً بألف دينار وتزوج امرأة على ألف دينار، وفي ذلك كله يعظه المؤمن ويقول: اشتريت قصراً يفنى ويخرب ألا اشتريت قصراً في الجنة لا يفنى! واشتريت بستاناً يخرب ويفنى ألا اشتريت بستاناً في الجنة لا يفنى وخدماً لا يفنون ولا يموتون وزوجة من الحور العين لا تموت! وفي كل ذلك يرد عليه الكافر ويقول: ما هناك شيء وما قيل من ذلك فهو أكاذيب! وإن كان فليكونن لي في الجنة خير من هذا. وكذلك وصف الله تعالى قول العاص ابن وائل إذ يقول \"لأوتين مالاً وولداً\" فقال الله تعالى رداً عليه \"أطلع الغيب أم اتخذ عند الرحمن عهداً كلا\" وروي عن خباب بن الأرت أنه قال: كان لي على العاص بن وائل دين فجئت أتقاضاه فلم يقض لي فقلت: إني آخذه في الآخرة؛ فقال لي: إذا صرت إلى الآخرة فإن لي هناك مالاً وولداً أقضيك منه. فأنزل الله تعالى قوله \"أفرأيت الذي كفر بآياتنا وقال لأوتين مالاً وولداً\"[6] وقال الله تعالى \"ولئن أذقناه رحمة منا من بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن هذا لي وما أظن الساعة قائمة ولئن رجعت إلى ربي إن لي عند للحسنى\" وهذا كله من الغرور بالله.</div></div></div>"}},"13":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"وَبَنِينَ","d":"wabanīna","e":"َnyِnَbَw"},{"b":"0.94","h":"2.23","c":"شُهُودًا","d":"shuhūdan","e":"āًdwُhُhs"}],"a":{"g":"And children present [with him]","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-10a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol3 book 10a</a></div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>SKIPPED_NOT_FOUND</div></div></div>"}},"14":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"وَمَهَّدْتُ","d":"wamahhadttu","e":"ُّtdَّhَmَw"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.84","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.77","c":"تَمْهِيدًا","d":"tamhīdan","e":"āًdyِhْmَt"}],"a":{"g":"And spread [everything] before him, easing [his life]."}},"15":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.05","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.4","c":"يَطْمَعُ","d":"yaṭmaʿu","e":"ُʿعَmْṭَy"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.8","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"ْnَaʾ"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.42","c":"أَزِيدَ","d":"azīda","e":"َdyِzَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"Then he desires that I should add more."}},"16":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"ٓāَّlَk"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.84","c":"إِنَّهُ","d":"innahu","e":"ۥُhَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.62","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.69","c":"لِءَايَاتِنَا","d":"liāyātinā","e":"āَnِtَٰyāَءِl"},{"b":"5.0","h":"8.49","c":"عَنِيدًا","d":"ʿanīdan","e":"āًdyِnَʿع"}],"a":{"g":"No!

Allah, the Exalted, says: \"And none knows the armies of your Lord except Him.\" For Allah, glorified is He, has in the hearts [qulub] and the spirits [arwah] and other realms, marshalled armies whose true reality and detailed number none knows except Him. And we now point to some of the armies of the heart [qalb], for it is what pertains to our purpose. And it has two armies: an army seen with the eyes, and an army not seen except with the insights [basair]. And it is in the position of the king, and the armies are in the position of servants and helpers. This is the meaning of the army.\n\nAs for its army witnessed by the eye, it is the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear, the tongue, and all the outward and inward limbs. For all of them are servants to the heart [qalb] and subjugated for it. It is the one directing them and turning them. They were created molded for its obedience, unable to oppose it or rebel against it. If it commands the eye to open, it opens. If it commands the foot to move, it moves. If it commands the tongue to speak and firmly judges for it to speak, it speaks, and likewise all the limbs. And the subjugation of the limbs and senses to the heart [qalb] resembles, in one aspect, the subjugation of the angels to Allah, the Exalted, for they are molded for obedience, unable to oppose Him—rather, they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them and they do what they are commanded. They only differ in one thing, which is that the angels, peace be upon them, are aware of their obedience and compliance, while the eyelids obey the heart [qalb] in opening and closing by way of subjugation, and they have no awareness of themselves or of their obedience to the heart [qalb].\n\nThe heart [qalb] only needed these armies due to its need for the mount and the provision for its journey, for which it was created—and that is the journey to Allah, glorified is He, and traversing the waystations to meeting Him. For this purpose the hearts [qulub] were created. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\" Its mount is the body, and its provision is knowledge [ilm]. And the means that deliver it to the provision and enable it to take provision from it are righteous deeds. And the servant cannot reach Allah, glorified is He, unless he resides in the body and traverses the world [dunya], for the lower waystation must be traversed to reach the farthest waystation. The world [dunya] is the field for the Hereafter [akhirah], and it is a waystation from among the waystations of guidance. It is only called *dunya* because it is the lower of the two waystations. So it was compelled to take provision from this world [alam]. The body is its mount by which it reaches this world [alam]. So it needed to tend to the body and preserve it. And the body is only preserved by bringing to it what agrees with it from nourishment and other things, and by repelling from it what is harmful from causes.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>بيان جنود القلب قال الله تعالى وما يعلم جنود ربك إلا هو فلله سبحانه في القلوب والأرواح وغيرها من العوالم جنود مجندة لا يعرف حقيقتها وتفصيل عددها إلا هو ونحن الآن نشير إلى بعض جنود القلب فهو الذي يتعلق بغرضنا وله جندان جند يرى بالأبصار وجند لا يرى إلا بالبصائر وهو في حكم الملك والجنود في حكم الخدم والأعوان فهذا معنى الجند فأما جنده المشاهد بالعين فهو اليد والرجل والعين والأذن واللسان وسائر الأعضاء الظاهرة والباطنة فإن جميعها خادمة للقلب ومسخرة له فهو المتصرف فيها والمردد لها وقد خلقت مجبولة على طاعته لا تستطيع له خلافا ولا عليه تمردا فإذا أمر العين بالانفتاح انفتحت وإذا أمر الرجل بالحركة تحركت وإذا أمر اللسان بالكلام وجزم الحكم به تكلم وكذا سائر الأعضاء وتسخير الأعضاء والحواس للقلب يشبه من وجه تسخير الملائكة لله تعالى فإنهم مجبولون على الطاعة لا يستطيعون له خلافا بل لا يعصون الله ما أمرهم ويفعلون ما يؤمرون وإنما يفترقان في شيء وهو أن الملائكة عليهم السلام عالمة بطاعتها وامتثالها والأجفان تطيع القلب في الانفتاح والانطباق على سبيل التسخير ولا خبر لها من نفسها ومن طاعتها للقلب وإنما افتقر القلب إلى هذه الجنود من حيث افتقاره إلى المركب والزاد لسفره الذي لأجله خلق وهو السفر إلى الله سبحانه وقطع المنازل إلى لقائه فلأجله خلقت القلوب قال الله تعالى وما خلقت الجن والإنس إلا ليعبدون وإنما مركبه البدن وزاده العلم وإنما الأسباب التي توصله إلى الزاد وتمكنه من التزود منه هو العمل الصالح وليس يمكن العبد أن يصل إلى الله سبحانه ما لم يسكن البدن ولم يجاوز الدنيا فإن المنزل الأدنى لا بد من قطعه للوصول إلى المنزل الأقصى فالدنيا مزرعة الآخرة وهي منزل من منازل الهدى وإنما سميت دنيا لأنها أدنى المنزلتين فاضطر إلى أن يتزود من هذا العالم فالبدن مركبه الذي يصل به إلى هذا العالم فافتقر إلى تعهد البدن وحفظه وإنما يحفظ البدن بأن يجلب إليه ما يوافقه من الغذاء وغيره وأن يدفع عنه ما ينافيه من أسباب</div></div></div>"}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"0.84","h":"0.97","c":"وَالْقَمَرِ","d":"wal-qamari","e":"ِrَmَqْlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"No!

If you say: Then where is the place of hope [raja'] and its praiseworthy position? Know that it is praiseworthy in two places:\n\nThe first: In the case of the disobedient one who is immersed [in sin], when the thought of repentance [tawba] occurs to him, and Satan says to him: \"How could your repentance be accepted?\" causing him to despair [qunut] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is necessary to suppress despair with hope [raja'] and to remember, \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins,\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.' And turn to your Lord.\" He commanded them to turn [inaba]. And He, the Exalted, says: \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\" So if one anticipates forgiveness [maghfira] with repentance, he is hopeful [raji]. But if one anticipates forgiveness while persisting [in sin], he is deluded.\n\nThe second: That one's soul [nafs] becomes sluggish concerning the virtues of deeds and confines itself to the obligatory acts. So he should make his soul hope for the bliss [na'im] of Allah, the Exalted, and what He has promised the righteous, so that from hope [raja'] a vigor for worship may spring forth, and he may turn to the virtuous deeds and remember His saying, the Exalted: \"Certainly will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly submissive\" to His saying: \"Those are the inheritors Who will inherit Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.\"\n\nSo the first hope [raja'] suppresses the despair [qunut] that prevents repentance [tawba].

For all of that is from what it is not permissible to plunge into, and it is forbidden. Most people sit together for amusement through conversation, and their speech does not go beyond jesting with the honor of people or plunging into falsehood [al-batil]. The types of falsehood [al-batil] cannot be enumerated due to their multitude and variety; therefore, there is no deliverance from them except by restricting oneself to what concerns the important matters of religion [din] and the worldly life [dunya]. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who plunges most into falsehood [al-batil].\" And the indication to this is in His saying, the Most High: \"And we used to plunge with those who plunge,\" and in His saying, the Most High: \"So do not sit with them until they plunge into a discourse other than it; for indeed you would then be like them.\" And Salman said: \"The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who speaks most concerning disobedience to Allah.\" So this is plunging into falsehood [al-batil], and it is beyond what will come of backbiting, tale-bearing, obscenity, and others. Rather, it is plunging into the mention of prohibitions whose occurrence has preceded, or contemplating how to reach them without a religious need to mention them. And there also enters into it plunging into recounting innovations and corrupt doctrines, and recounting what occurred of fighting among the Companions in a manner that suggests disparagement of some of them. And all of that is falsehood [al-batil], and plunging into it is plunging into falsehood [al-batil].

And when sins are divided into those for which there is intercession and those for which there is no intercession, fear [khawf] and apprehension are inevitably obligatory. If there were a sin for which intercession is accepted, He would not have commanded the Quraysh to obey, nor would the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, have forbidden Fatima, may God be pleased with her, from disobedience; and He would have permitted her to follow her desires to perfect her pleasure in this world [dunya], then interceded for her in the Hereafter [akhira] to perfect her pleasure in the Hereafter. Therefore, immersion in sins and abandoning piety [taqwa] in reliance on the hope of intercession resembles the immersion of a sick person in his desires, relying on a skilled, nearby, compassionate physician, be it a father, brother, or other. That is ignorance, for the effort, diligence, and skill of the physician are beneficial in removing some illnesses, not all of them. It is not permissible to abandon precautionary measures [himiya] absolutely, relying merely on medicine. Rather, the physician has an effect in general, but only in mild illnesses and when the dominance of a balanced temperament prevails. Thus should you understand the concern of the intercessors [shufa'a'] from among the prophets and the righteous for relatives and strangers, for it is certainly like that. And that does not remove fear [khawf] and caution. How could it remove it, when the best of creation after the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, were his Companions, and they used to wish they were cattle out of fear of the Hereafter [akhira], despite the perfection of their piety [taqwa], the goodness of their deeds, the purity of their hearts [qulub], and what they heard from the promise of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to them of Paradise specifically, and to the rest of the Muslims of intercession [shafa'a] generally? Yet they did not rely upon it, and fear [khawf] and humility did not depart their hearts [qulub]. So how can one who does not have the like of their companionship and precedence admire himself and rely on intercession [shafa'a]?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فمن الذنوب ما لا تنجي منه الشفاعة وعنه العبارة بقوله تعالى \"ولا يشفعون إلا لمن ارتضى\" وبقوله \"من ذا الذي يشفع عند إلا بإذنه\" وبقوله \"ولا تنفع الشفاعة عنده إلا لمن أذن له\" وبقوله \"فما تنفعهم شفاعة الشافعين\" وإذا انقسمت الذنوب إلا ما يشفع فيه وإلى ما لا يشفع فيه وجب الخوف والإشفاق لا محالة، ولو كان ذنب تقبل فيه الشفاعة لما أمر قريشاً بالطاعة ولما نهى رسول الله ﭬ فاطمة رضي الله عنها عن المعصية، ولكان يأذن لها في اتباع الشهوات لتكمل لذاتها في الدنيا ثم يشفع لها في الآخرة لتكمل لذاتها في الآخرة. فالانهماك في الذنوب وترك التقوى اتكالاً على رجاء الشفاعة يضاهي انهماك المريض في شهواته اعتماداً على طبيب حاذق قريب مشفق من أب أو أخ أو غيره، وذلك جهل لأن سعي الطبيب وهمته وحذقه تنفع في إزالة بعض الأمراض لا في كلها، فلا يجوز ترك الحمية مطلقاً اعتماداً على مجرد الطب، بل للطبيب أثر على الجملة ولكن في الأمراض الخفيفة وعند وغلبة اعتدال المزاج. فهكذا ينبغي أن تفهم عناية الشفعاء من الأنبياء والصلحاء للأقارب والأجانب، فإنه كذلك قطعاً، وذلك لا يزيل الخوف والحذر، وكيف يزيل وخير الخلق بعد رسول الله ﭬ أصحابه وقد كانوا يتمنون أن يكونوا بهائم من خوف الآخرة مع كمال تقواهم وحسن أعمالهم وصفاء قلوبهم وما سمعوه من وعد رسول الله ﭬ إياهم بالجنة خاصة وسائر المسلمين بالشفاعة عامة ولم يتكلوا عليه ولم يفارق الخوف والخشوع قلوبهم؟ فكيف يعجب بنفسه ويتكل على الشفاعة من ليس له مثل صحبتهم وسابقتهم؟</div></div></div>"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.4","c":"فَمَا","d":"famā","e":"āَmَf"},{"b":"0.59","h":"0.95","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.51","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.96","c":"التَّذْكِرَةِ","d":"l-tadhkirati","e":"ِẗَrِkْhdَّtlٱ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.22","c":"مُعْرِضِينَ","d":"muʿ'riḍīna","e":"َnyِḍِrْʿعُm"}],"a":{"g":"Then what is [the matter] with them that they are, from the reminder, turning away"}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"كَأَنَّهُمْ","d":"ka-annahum","e":"ْmُhَّnَaʾَk"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.66","c":"حُمُرٌ","d":"ḥumurun","e":"ٌrُmُḥ"},{"b":"2.8","h":"3.14","c":"مُسْتَنْفِرَةٌ","d":"mus'tanfiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِfnَtْsُّm"}],"a":{"g":"As if they were alarmed donkeys"}},"51":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"فَرَّتْ","d":"farrat","e":"ْtَّrَf"},{"b":"0.75","h":"0.92","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"1.9","h":"1.85","c":"قَسْوَرَةٍ","d":"qaswaratin","e":"ٍۭẗَrَwْsَq"}],"a":{"g":"Fleeing from a lion?"}},"52":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.6","c":"بَلْ","d":"bal","e":"ْlَb"},{"b":"0.36","h":"0.83","c":"يُرِيدُ","d":"yurīdu","e":"ُdyِrُy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.71","c":"كُلُّ","d":"kullu","e":"ُّlُk"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.4","c":"امْرِئٍ","d":"im'ri-in","e":"ٍyʾِrْmٱ"},{"b":"3.3","h":"3.92","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"3.9","h":"4.69","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"5","h":"5.77","c":"يُؤْتَى","d":"yu'tā","e":"ٰàَtْwʾُy"},{"b":"5.6","h":"6.54","c":"صُحُفًا","d":"ṣuḥufan","e":"āًfُḥُṣ"},{"b":"7.5","h":"8.03","c":"مُنَشَّرَةً","d":"munasharatan","e":"ًẗَrَّhsَnُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Rather, every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about."}},"53":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.7","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.44","c":"بَلْ","d":"bal","e":"lَb"},{"b":"1.7","h":"1.65","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَّl"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.29","c":"يَخَافُونَ","d":"yakhāfūna","e":"َnwُfāَhkَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"3.71","c":"الْءَاخِرَةَ","d":"l-ākhirata","e":"َẗَrِhkāَءْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"No!
