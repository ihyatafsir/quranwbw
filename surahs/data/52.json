And that is not perfected except by immersing the times of night and day in the duties of remembrances and contemplations. And the soul [nafs], due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not persevere with a single mode of the means that aid in remembrance and contemplation. Rather, if it is returned to a single pattern, it displays boredom and a sense of burden. And from the necessity of being gentle with it is to refresh it by shifting from one mode to another and from one type to another according to each time, so that its pleasure is increased by the transition, its desire is magnified by the pleasure, and its constancy endures by the endurance of the desire. Therefore, the litanies [awrad] are divided into a varied division, and remembrance and contemplation should encompass all times or most of them.\n\nFor the soul, by its nature, is inclined to the pleasures of the world. So if the servant spends half his times on the arrangements and permissible desires of the world, and the other half on acts of worship, the side of inclination to the world is weighted, because it agrees with his nature, since the time is equal. How then can they be balanced when the nature gives weight to one of them? For the outward and inward cooperate in the matters of the world, and the heart [qalb] becomes pure and single-minded in seeking it. As for being turned back to acts of worship, it is contrived, and the sincerity [ikhlas] of the heart and its presence therein is not sound except at some times.\n\nSo whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him immerse his times in obedience. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to be weighted and the balances of his goodness to be heavy, let him occupy most of his times in obedience. If he mixes a righteous deed with another evil one, then his affair is perilous. But hope is not cut off, and pardon from the generosity of Allah is awaited. Perhaps Allah, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty and generosity.\n\nThis is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [basira]. If you are not of its people, then look to the address of Allah, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [iman]. For Allah, the Exalted, has said: *\"And glorify the praise of your Lord when you rise [from sleep], and at night glorify Him, and at the setting of the stars.\"* So He made clear that the purpose of the sun and moon running in a precise, ordered system, and of the creation of shadow and light and the stars, is not to seek help through them in the matters of the world, but rather to know by them the measures of times so that one may occupy them with acts of obedience and trade for the Abode of the Hereafter [akhira]. His statement, the Exalted, indicates this to you: *\"And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude.\"* Meaning, one succeeds the other so that what was missed in one may be made up in the other. And He made clear that this necessitates watching over the times and populating them with litanies on the path of continuity, to realize the continuity of remembrance and contemplation, and salvation from the perils of mixing the righteous and the evil.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>And indeed, some of the Knowers [al-'arifun] had in his pocket a slip of paper he would take out every hour and contemplate, and upon it was written: **\"And be patient for the judgment of your Lord, for indeed, you are within Our Eyes.\"**</div></div></div>"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَمِنَ","d":"wamina","e":"َnِmَw"},{"b":"0.68","h":"0.9","c":"اللَّيْلِ","d":"al-layli","e":"ِlْyَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.09","c":"فَسَبِّحْهُ","d":"fasabbiḥ'hu","e":"ُhْḥِّbَsَf"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.13","c":"وَإِدْبَارَ","d":"wa-id'bāra","e":"َrَٰbْdِiʾَw"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.13","c":"النُّجُومِ","d":"l-nujūmi","e":"ِmwُjgُّnlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And in a part of the night exalt Him and after [the setting of] the stars.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 10</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, the soul [nafs], as it is created upon weariness and boredom, cannot persevere with a single mode from among the means that aid in remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr]. Rather, it shows aversion if it is returned to one pattern. And from the necessity of gentleness with it is that it should be refreshed by shifting from one mode to another according to each time, so that its pleasure may increase through the transition and its desire may grow great, and thus its constancy may endure. For that reason, the litanies [awrad] are divided into different divisions, and remembrance [dhikr] and contemplation [fikr] occupy all times or most of them.\n\nFor the soul [nafs], by its nature, is inclined to the pleasures of the world [dunya].

So how can they be balanced when nature gives weight to one of them? For the outward [zahir] and the inward [batin] cooperate in worldly matters and the heart [qalb] becomes pure in seeking them. As for being turned back to acts of worship, it is contrived, and the sincerity [ikhlas] of the heart [qalb] in it is not safe except in some times.\n\nTherefore, whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him occupy his times completely in obedience [ta'a]. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to be made weighty, let him encompass in obedience [ta'a] most of his times. This clarifies that the path to God, Exalted is He, is the vigilant observance of times and populating them with litanies [awrad] on the basis of continuity, just as He, Exalted is He, said: \"And in the night glorify Him, and at the fading of the stars\" — to indicate that the purpose of creating the stars is not merely to seek help through them in worldly matters, but rather to know by them the measures of times, so that one may occupy oneself in them with acts of obedience [ta'a] and trade for the Abode of the Hereafter [akhira]. For the night and the day are a succession for whoever wishes to remember or wishes to be grateful, so that one may recover in one of them what was missed in the other.</div></div></div>"}}}
