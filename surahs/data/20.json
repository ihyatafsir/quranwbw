And opinion encompasses both correct and corrupt, and what conforms to desire may be specifically named as opinion.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وتارة قد يكون له غرض صحيح فيطلب له دليلا من القرآن ويستدل عليه مما يعلم أنه ما أريد به كمن يدعو إلى الاستغفار بالأسحار فيستدل بقوله ﭬ: (تسحروا فإن في السحور بركة[56]) ويزعم أن المراد به التسحر بالذكر وهو يعلم أن المراد به الأكل وكالذي يدعو إلى مجاهدة القلب القاسي فيقول قال الله عز وجل ﴿ إذهب إلى فرعون إنه طغى ﴾  {} ويشير إلى قلبه ويومئ إلى أنه المراد بفرعون وهذا الجنس قد يستعمله بعض الوعاظ في المقاصد الصحيحة تحسينا للكلام وترغيبا للمستمع وهو ممنوع وقد تستعمله الباطنية في المقاصد الفاسدة لتغرير الناس ودعوتهم إلى مذهبهم الباطل فينزلون القرآن على وفق رأيهم ومذهبهم على أمور يعلمون قطعا أنها غير مرادة به فهذه الفنون أحد وجهي المنع من التفسير بالرأي ويكون المراد بالرأي الرأي الفاسد الموافق للهوى دون الاجتهاد الصحيح والرأي يتناول الصحيح والفاسد والموافق للهوى قد يخصص باسم الرأي.</div></div></div>"}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.75","c":"قَالَ","d":"qāla","e":"ِّbَr"},{"b":"0.74","h":"1.61","c":"رَبِّ","d":"rabbi","e":"ْḥَrْhsٱ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.4","c":"اشْرَحْ","d":"ish'raḥ","e":"àِl"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.26","c":"لِي","d":"lī","e":"àِrْdَṣ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.03","c":"صَدْرِي","d":"ṣadrī","e":"ْrِّsَyَw"}],"a":{"g":"[Moses] said, \"My Lord, expand for me my breast [with assurance]","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-9.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Invocations and Supplications</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, expand for me my breast [sadri] and ease for me my affair [amri].

Then he was called: 'Beware of overstepping the necks of the Truthful Ones (SIDDIQIN). Return to the Greatest Truthful One (SIDDIQ AL-AKBAR) and follow him.

And when the strength of the Muslims weakened on the day of Badr, he (the Prophet) said: 'O Allah, if You destroy this group, there will remain no one on the face of the earth who worships You.' So Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'Leave off your supplication to your Lord, for He is faithful to you with what He promised you.' So the station (Maqam) of the Truthful One (Al-Siddiq), may Allah be pleased with him, was the station of trust in the promise of Allah, and the station of the Messenger of Allah was the station of fear from the plotting (Makar) of Allah, and it is more complete because it does not issue except from the perfection of knowledge (Ma'rifah) of the secrets (Asrar) of Allah the Exalted and the hidden aspects (Khafa'ya) of His actions and the meanings (Ma'ani) of His attributes (Sifat) which some of what issues from them is expressed as plotting (Makar), and no one from humankind has the ability to stand upon the reality (Kunh) of the attributes (Sifat) of Allah the Exalted. And whoever knows the reality (Haqiqah) of knowledge (Ma'rifah) [knows] the deficiency of his knowledge (Ma'rifah) from encompassing the reality (Kunh) of matters, his fear inevitably increases. And for that reason, Jesus said when it was said to him: 'Did you say to the people, \"Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah\"? He said, \"Glory be to You! It is not for me to say what I have no right to. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within my Soul (Nafs), and I do not know what is within Your Soul (Nafs).\"' And he said: 'If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants, and if You forgive them...' the verse.

So there is no benefit in will, capability (Qudrah), and means (Asbāb) except after guidance (Hidayah). And therefore, Allah the Exalted said: 'Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its creation (Khalq), then guided (Hidā)' (20:50). And He said: 'And were it not for the favor (Fadl) of Allah upon you and His mercy (Rahmah), none of you would ever have been purified (Zakkā), but Allah purifies whom He wills' (24:21). And He said (peace be upon him): 'No one enters Paradise except by the mercy (Rahmah) of Allah the Exalted, meaning by His guidance (Hidāyah).' It was said: 'Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Not even me.' And guidance (Hidāyah) has three stations (Manāzil): The first is knowledge of the path of good and evil, referred to by His saying: 'And We have guided him to the two ways (Najdayn)' (90:10). And Allah the Exalted has bestowed this upon all His servants, some of it through intellect ('Aql) and some of it upon the tongue of the messengers (Rusul). And therefore, He said: 'And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness ('Amā) over guidance (Hudā)' (41:17). So the means (Asbāb) of guidance (Hudā) are the Book (Kitāb), the messengers (Rusul), and the insights (Basā'ir) of intellects ('Uqūl), and they are made available, and nothing prevents from them except envy (Hasad), arrogance (Kibr), love of the worldly life (Hubb al-Dunyā), and the means (Asbāb) that blind (Tu'mī) the hearts (Qulūb) even though they do not blind the eyesights (Absār). He said: 'For indeed, it is not the eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts (Qulūb) which are within the breasts (Sudūr)' (22:46). And among the blinding things (Ma'miyyāt) are familiarity (Ilf) and habit ('Ādah) and the love of adhering to them, and from it is the expression by His saying: 'Indeed, we found our fathers upon a community (Ummah)' (43:22) the verse. And from arrogance (Kibr) and envy (Hasad) is the expression by His saying: 'And they said, \"Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon a great man from one of the two cities?\"' (43:31) and His saying: 'Shall we follow one human being (Bashar) among us?'

And when the strength of the Muslims weakened on the day of Badr, he (the Prophet) said: 'O Allah, if You destroy this group, there will remain on the face of the earth no one who worships You.' So Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 'Leave off your supplication to your Lord, for He is faithful to you with what He promised you.' So the station (Maqam) of the Truthful One (Al-Siddiq) (may Allah be pleased with him) was the station of trust (Thiqa) in the promise of Allah, and the station of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was the station of fear (Khauf) from the deception (Makar) of Allah, and it is more complete because it does not issue except from perfection of knowledge (Ma'rifah) of the secrets (Asrar) of Allah the Exalted and the hidden aspects (Khafa'ya) of His actions and the meanings (Ma'ani) of His attributes (Sifat) which some of what issues from them is expressed as deception (Makar), and no one from humankind has the ability to stand upon the reality (Kunh) of the attributes (Sifat) of Allah the Exalted. And whoever knows the reality (Haqiqah) of knowledge (Ma'rifah) [knows] the deficiency of his knowledge (Ma'rifah) from encompassing the reality (Kunh) of matters, his fear (Khauf) necessarily becomes great. And for that reason, Jesus (peace be upon him) said when it was said to him: 'Did you say to the people, \"Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?\" He said, \"Exalted are You! It is not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it.

Just as one who sees a human at dawn does not increase in certainty at sunrise that it is a human, but increases in clarity regarding the details of his form. The example of those who have spiritual unveiling (Mukashifin) and those who merely hold beliefs (Mu'taqidin) is none other than like the magicians of Pharaoh with the followers of the Samiri. For the magicians of Pharaoh, because they were aware of the ultimate effect of magic due to their long observation and experience, saw from Moses, peace be upon him, what exceeded the limits of magic, and the truth of the matter was unveiled to them. Thus, they did not heed Pharaoh's statement, 'I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides,' but rather, 'They said: \"We will never prefer you over what has come to us of the clear proofs and the One who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life.\"' For explanation (Bayan) and unveiling (Kashf) prevent change. As for the followers of the Samiri, since their faith was from looking at the apparent serpent, when they looked at the calf of the Samiri and heard its lowing, they changed and heard his saying, 'This is your god and the god of Moses,' and they forgot that it does not respond to them with speech, nor does it possess for them harm or benefit. Thus, everyone who believes by looking at a serpent will inevitably disbelieve if he looks at a calf, because both are from the world of witnessing (Alam al-Shahadah) and difference and opposition in the world of witnessing is abundant. As for the world of the dominion (Alam al-Malakut), it is from God, the Exalted, therefore we do not find in it any difference or opposition at all.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وأما الذي شاهد الطريق وسلكه بنفسه فلا يخاف عليه شيء من ذلك بل لو كشف الغطاء لما ازداد يقيناً وإن كان يزداد وضوحاً، كما أن الذي يرى إنساناً في وقت الإسفار لا يزداد يقيناً عند طلوع الشمس بأنه إنسان ولكن يزداد وضوحاً في تفصيل خلقته، وما مثال المكاشفين والمعتقدين إلا كسحرة فرعون مع أصحاب السامري؛ فإن سحرة فرعون لما كانوا مطلعين على منتهى تأثير السحر لطول مشاهدتهم وتجربتهم رأوا من موسى عليه السلام ما جاوز حدود السحر وانكشف لهم حقيقة الأمر فلم يكترثوا بقول فرعون \" لأقطعن أيديكم وأرجلكم من خلاف \" بل \" قالوا لن نؤثرك على ما جاءنا من البينات والذي فطرنا فاقض ما أنت قاض إنما تقضي هذه الحياة الدنيا \" فإن البيان والكشف يمنع التغيير وأما أصحاب السامري لما كان إيمانهم عن النظر إلى ظاهر الثعبان، فلما نظروا إلى عجل السامري وسمعوا خواره تغيروا وسمعوا قوله \" هذا إلهكم وإله موسى \" ونسوا أنه لا يرجع إليهم قولاً ولا يملك لهم ضراً ولا نفعاً: فكل من آمن بالنظر إلى ثعبان يكفر لا محالة إذا نظر إلى عجل، لأن كليهما من عالم الشهادة والاختلاف والتضاد في عالم الشهادة كثير. وأما عالم الملكوت فهو من عند الله تعالى فلذلك لا نجد فيه اختلافاً وتضاداً أصلاً.</div></div></div>"}},"73":{"w":[{"b":"0.17","h":"0.2","c":"إِنَّا","d":"innā","e":"āَّnَmāَء"},{"b":"2.0","h":"1.45","c":"ءَامَنَّا","d":"āmannā","e":"āَnِّbَrِb"},{"b":"5.1","h":"5.47","c":"بِرَبِّنَا","d":"birabbinā","e":"َrِfْغَyِl"},{"b":"6.5","h":"7.32","c":"لِيَغْفِرَ","d":"liyaghfira","e":"āَnَl"},{"b":"7.7","h":"8.86","c":"لَنَا","d":"lanā","e":"āَnَٰyَٰṭَhk"},{"b":"8.3","h":"9.65","c":"خَطَايَانَا","d":"khaṭāyānā","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"10.0","h":"12.08","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَnَtْhَrْkَaʾ"},{"b":"10.3","h":"14.02","c":"أَكْرَهْتَنَا","d":"akrahtanā","e":"ِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"14","h":"16.18","c":"عَلَيْهِ","d":"ʿalayhi","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"14.8","h":"17.5","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"ِrْḥِّslٱ"},{"b":"15.2","h":"18.02","c":"السِّحْرِ","d":"l-siḥ'ri","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"},{"b":"16.5","h":"20.63","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"ٌrْyَhk"},{"b":"17.6","h":"22.08","c":"خَيْرٌ","d":"khayrun","e":"ٰٓàَqْbَaʾَw"},{"b":"19.0","h":"23.72","c":"وَأَبْقَى","d":"wa-abqā","e":"ۥُhَّnِiʾ"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic.

Allah the Exalted said: \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteous work then is guided.\" And Allah the Exalted said: \"Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good.\" Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Excellence (Ihsan) is that you worship Allah as if you see Him.\" And Allah the Exalted said: \"By time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed and done righteous works and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.\" So the promise of forgiveness in all the Book of Allah the Exalted is tied to faith and righteous work together, not to faith alone, so these are also deceived, I mean those who are content with the worldly life, joyful in it, indulgent in its pleasures, loving it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولنرجع إلى الغرض المطلوب فالمقصود أن غرور الشيطان بأن الآخرة شك يدفع إما بيقين تقليدي، وأما ببصيرة ومشاهدة من جهة الباطن، والمؤمنين بألسنتهم وبعقائدهم إذا ضيعوا أوامر الله تعالى وهجروا الأعمال الصالحة ولابسوا الشهوات والمعاصي فهم مشاركون للكفار في هذا الغرور من النار ولو بعد حين، ولكنهم أيضاً من المغرورين فإنهم اعترفوا بأن الآخرة خير من الدنيا ولكنهم مالوا إلى الدنيا وآثروها، ومجرد الإيمان لا يكفي للفوز قال تعالى \"وإني لغفار لمن تاب وآمن وعمل صالحاً ثم اهتدى\" وقال تعالى \"إن رحمت الله قريب من المحسنين\" ثم قال النبي ﭬ \"الإحسان أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه\"[5] وقال تعالى \"والعصر إن الإنسان لفي خسر إلا الذين آمنوا وعملوا الصالحات وتواصوا بالحق وتواصوا بالصبر\" فوعد المغفرة في جميع كتاب الله تعالى منوط بالإيمان والعمل الصالح جميعاً لا بالإيمان وحده، فهؤلاء أيضاً مغرورون أعني المطمئنين إلى الدنيا الفرحين بها المترفين بنعيمها المحبين لها.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-10a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Self-Delusion</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>If you say: So where is the place of hope (Rajā') and its praiseworthy location? Know that it is praiseworthy in two places: The first: Regarding the immersed sinner when repentance occurs to him, and Satan says to him: How will your repentance be accepted? So he despairs of the mercy of Allah the Exalted. \"At this point, he must suppress despair with hope and remember 'Indeed, Allah forgives all sins' and that Allah is generous in accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an obedience that expiates sins. Allah the Exalted said: 'Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And turn in repentance to your Lord' - He commanded them to turn in repentance (Inābah). And He said: 'And indeed, I am Forgiving (Ghaffār) to whoever repents and believes and does righteous work (ʿAmal Ṣāliḥ) then is guided.' So if he expects forgiveness with repentance, he is hopeful (Rāj), and if he expects forgiveness with persistence (in sin), he is deluded (Maghrūr), just as one for whom the time of Friday prayer becomes tight while he is in the market, and it occurs to him to hasten to the Friday prayer, and Satan says to him: You will not catch the Friday prayer, so stay in your place. So he disbelieves Satan and goes running while hoping to catch the Friday prayer - he is hopeful. And if he continues with trade and begins to hope for the Imam to delay the prayer for his sake until the middle of the time, or for the sake of another, or for a reason among the reasons he does not know, he is deluded.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فإن قلت: فأين مظنة الرجاء وموضعه المحمود؟ فاعلم أنه محمود في موضعين: أحدهما: في حق العاصي المنهمك إذا خطرت له التوبة فقال له الشيطان: وأنى تقبل توبتك فيقنطه من رحمة الله تعالى \"فيجب عند هذا أن يقمع القنوط بالرجاء ويتذكر \"إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً\" وأن الله كريم يقبل التوبة عن عباده وأن التوبة طاعة تكفر الذنوب قال الله تعالى \"قل يا عبادي الذين أسرفوا على أنفسهم لا تقنطوا من رحمة الله إن الله يغفر الذنوب جميعاً إنه هو الغفور الرحيم وأنيبوا إلى ربكم\" أمرهم بالإنابة وقال تعالى \"وإني لغفار لمن تاب وآمن وعمل صالحاً ثم اهتدى\" فإذا توقع المغفرة مع التوبة فهو راج، وإن توقع المغفرة مع الإصرار فهو مغرور، كما أن من ضاق عليه وقت الجمعة وهو في السوق فخطر له أن يسعى إلى الجمعة فقال له الشيطان: إنك لا تدرك الجمعة فأقم على موضعك فكذب الشيطان ومر يعدو وهو يرجو أن يدرك الجمعة فهو راج، وإن استمر على التجارة وأخذ يرجو تأخير الإمام للصلاة لأجله إلى وسط الوقت أو لأجل غيره أو لسبب من الأسباب التي لا يعرفها فهو مغرور.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book3.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Fear and Hope</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And the Quran from its beginning to its end contains fears for whoever reads it with contemplation, and even if there were nothing in it except His saying, the Exalted: 'And indeed I am Forgiving (Ghaffar) for whoever repents (Taba) and believes (Amana) and does righteous work (Amila Salihan) then is guided (Ihtada)' {} it would be sufficient, since He made forgiveness (Maghfirah) conditional upon four conditions that the servant (Al-Abd) is incapable of fulfilling individually.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>والقرآن من أوله إلى آخره مخاوف لمن قرأه بتدبر ولو لم يكن فيه إلا قوله تعالى: ﴿ وإني لغفار لمن تاب وآمن وعمل صالحا ثم اهتدى ﴾ {} لكان كافيا إذ علق المغفرة على أربعة شروط يعجز العبد عن آحادها</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-2.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Foundations of Belief</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>As for the Mu'tazilites, their evidence is His saying, the Exalted: 'And indeed, I am Forgiving (Ghaffār) to the one who repents (Tāba) and believes (Āmana) and does righteous work (ʿAmila Ṣāliḥan) then is guided (Ihtadā)' and His saying, the Exalted: 'By time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except those who have believed (Āmanū) and done righteous deeds (ʿAmilū al-Ṣāliḥāt)' and His saying, the Exalted: 'And there is none of you except he will enter it.

Indeed, this is mockery of the king, for he did not intend closeness to the king through his service, but rather intended by that a servant from his servants. So what contempt increases beyond that the servant intends by obedience to Allah the Exalted the showing-off (Riya') to a weak servant who does not possess for him harm nor benefit? And is that except because he thinks that that servant is more capable of attaining his objectives than Allah? And that he is more deserving of closeness to him than Allah since he preferred him over the King of Kings and made him the intended object of his worship? And what mockery increases beyond raising the servant above the Master (Mawla)? So this is from the great destructive sins, and for this the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) called it the minor polytheism (Shirk al-Asghar). Yes, some degrees of showing-off (Riya') are more severe than others - as will come its clarification in the degrees of showing-off (Riya') if Allah the Exalted wills - and nothing of it is devoid of grave or light sin according to what is in the showing-off (Riya'), and if there were not in showing-off (Riya') except that he prostrates and bows to other than Allah, it would be sufficient. For indeed, even if he did not intend closeness to Allah, he has intended other than Allah. By my life, if he magnified other than Allah with prostration, he would disbelieve with clear disbelief (Kufr Jali), except that showing-off (Riya') is the hidden disbelief (Kufr Khafi) because the show-off (Mura'i) has magnified in his heart (Qalb) the people, so that magnification necessitated that he prostrates and bows, so the people were the magnified ones by the prostration from one aspect. And whenever the intention of magnifying Allah by the prostration vanishes and the magnification of the creation (Khalq) remains, that was close to polytheism (Shirk), except that he intended the magnification of himself in the heart (Qalb) of the one magnified by him through his showing from himself the image of magnification for Allah. So from this it was hidden polytheism (Shirk Khafi), not clear polytheism (Shirk Jali), and that is the utmost ignorance, and none proceeds upon it except whom the Satan (Shaytan) has deceived and made him imagine that the servants possess from his harm and benefit.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ومثاله أن يتمثل بين يدي ملك من الملوك طول النهار كما جرت عادة الخدم وإنما وقوفه لملاحظة جارية من جواري الملك أو غلام من غلمانه، فإن هذا استهزاء بالملك إذ لم يقصد التقريب إلى الملك بخدمته بل قصد بذلك عبداً من عبيده، فأي استحقار يزيد على أن يقصد العبد بطاعة الله تعالى مراءاة عبد ضعيف لا يملك له ضراً ولا نفعاً؟ وهل ذلك إلا لأنه يظن أن ذلك العبد أقدر على تحصيل أغراضه من الله؟ وأنه أولى بالتقريب إليه من الله إذ آثره على ملك الملوك فجعله مقصود عبادته؟ وأي استهزاء يزيد على رفع العبد فوق المولى؟ فهذا من كبائر المهلكات ولهذا سماه رسول الله ﭬ الشرك الأصغر[39]. نعم بعض درجات الرياء أشد من بعض -كما سيأتي بيانه في درجات الرياء إن شاء الله تعالى- ولا يخلو شيء منه عن إثم غليظ أو خفيف بحسب ما به المراءاة ولو لم يكن في الرياء إلا أنه يسجد ويركع لغير الله لكان فيه كفاية، فإنه وإن لم يقصد التقرب إلى الله فقد قصد غير الله، ولعمري لو عظم غير الله بالسجود لكفر كفراً جلياً، إلا أن الرياء هو الكفر الخفي لأن المرائي عظم في قلبه الناس، فاقتضت تلك العظمة أن يسجد ويركع فكان الناس هم المعظمون بالسجود من وجه، ومهما زال قصد تعظيم الله بالسجود وبقي تعظيم الخلق كان ذلك قريباً من الشرك، إلا أنه قصد تعظيم نفسه في قلب من عظم عنده بإظهاره من نفسه صورة التعظيم لله، فعن هذا كان شركاً خفياً لا شركاً جلياً، وذلك غاية الجهل ولا يقدم عليه إلا من خدعه الشيطان وأوهم عنده أن العباد يملكون من ضره ونفعه</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book5.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Tawhid and Trust</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>As for the companions of the Samiri, when their faith was based on looking at the outward appearance of the serpent, then when they looked at the calf of the Samiri and heard its lowing, they changed and heard his saying \"This is your god and the god of Moses\" and they forgot that it does not return to them a word nor does it possess for them harm or benefit: So everyone who believed by looking at a serpent disbelieves inevitably if he looks at a calf, because both of them are from the world of witnessing (Shahadah) and difference and opposition in the world of witnessing (Shahadah) is abundant.

The Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah) is one of what is mentioned in it, and Allah has described some of its calamities and multiplied its names so that we may stand, through the multiplicity of its names, upon the multiplicity of its meanings, for the purpose of the multiplicity of names is not the repetition of names and titles, but the aim is to alert those of understanding (Ulul Albab), for under every name of the names of the Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah) there is a secret and in it...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>يوم تنسف فيه الجبال نسفا فتترك قاعا صفصفا لا ترى فيها عوجا ولا أمتا، يوم ترى الجبال تحسبها جامدة وهى تمر مر السحاب، يوم تنشق فيه السماء فتكون وردة كالدهان، فيومئذ لا يسئل عن ذنبه إنس ولا جان، يوم يمنع فيه العاصى من الكلام ولا يسئل فيه عن الأجرام بل يؤخذ بالنواصى والأقدام، يوم تجد كل نفس ما عملت من خير محضرا وما عملت من سوء تود لو أن بينها وبينه أمدا بعيدا، يوم تعلم فيه كل نفس ما أحضرت وتشهد ما قدمت وأخرت يوم تخرس فيه الألسن وتنطق الجوارح يوم شيب ذكره سيد المرسلين إذ قال له الصديق رضى الله عنه: أراك قد شبت يا رسول الله قال: (شيبتنى هود وأخواتها[155]) وهى الواقعة والمرسلات وعم يتساءلون وإذا الشمس كورت فيا أيها القارىء العاجز إنما حظك من قراءتك أن تمجمج القرآن وتحرك به اللسان ولو كنت متفكرا فيما تقرؤه لكنت جديرا بأن تنشق مرارتك مما شاب منه شعر سيد المرسلين وإذا قنعت بحركة اللسان فقد حرمت ثمرة القرآن فالقيامة أحد ما ذكر فيه وقد وصف الله بعض دواهيها وأكثر من أساميها لنقف بكثرة أساميها على كثرة معانيها فليس المقصود بكثرة الأسامى تكرير الأسامى والألقاب بل الغرض تنبيه أولى الألباب فتحت كل اسم من أسماء القيامة سر وفى ك</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Then look at how they are driven after the Resurrection (al-Ba'th) and the Rising (al-Nushur), barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, to the land of the Gathering (Ard al-Mahshar), a white land, a level plain, you will see in it no crookedness (la tara fiha 'iwajan) nor any depression (wa-la amtan), nor will you see upon it a hill behind which a human can hide, nor a valley that lowers from the eyes in it; rather, it is a single, simple, level ground with no variation in it; they are driven to it in groups. So glory be to the One who gathers the creatures despite the difference of their kinds from the corners of the earth when He drives them with the Shaking (al-Rajifah) followed by the Following (al-Radifah); and the Shaking is the first Blast (al-Nafkhah al-Ula) and the Following is the second Blast (al-Nafkhah al-Thaniyah). And it is fitting for those Hearts (Qulub) to be trembling (wajifah) at that time, and for those Eyes (Absar) to be humbled (khashi'ah). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'The people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-Qiyamah) on a white, pale land like a pure loaf, with no landmark for anyone.' The narrator said: And the paleness is a whiteness that is not bright, and the pure is that which is pure from husk and bran, and landmark means no building to conceal nor variation to repel the sight. And do not think that that land is like the land of the world; rather, it does not equal it except in name. Allah the Exalted said: 'On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and the heavens.' Ibn Abbas said: It increases in it and decreases, and its trees, mountains, valleys, and what is in it go away, and it stretches like the stretching of the Adim al-'Akkazi, a white land like silver, upon which no blood has been spilled nor any sin committed; and the heavens, their sun, moon, and stars go away.

For whenever He created heedlessness (ghaflah) and desire (shahwah) and the ability to fulfill the desire, the action occurred by necessity through them. If He distanced him because he disobeyed Him, then what compelled him to the disobedience? Is that due to a prior disobedience until it regresses to infinity, or it inevitably stops at a first cause that has no cause from the side of the servant? Rather, it was decreed for him in pre-eternity. And about this meaning, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Adam and Moses (peace be upon them both) argued before their Lord, and Adam overcame Moses (peace be upon him). Moses said: 'You are Adam whom Allah created with His Hand, breathed into you from His Spirit (Ruh), made His angels prostrate to you, and settled you in His Garden, then you caused the people to descend to the earth by your sin.' Adam said: 'You are Moses whom Allah chose with His message and His speech, gave you the Tablets in which is the explanation of everything, and brought you near as a confidant. For how long did you find that Allah wrote the Torah before I was created?' Moses said: 'Forty years.' Adam said: 'Then did you find in it: \"And Adam disobeyed (عصى) his Lord and went astray (فغوى)\"? He said: 'Yes.' Adam said: 'Then do you blame me for doing an act that Allah wrote upon me before I did it and before He created me by forty years?' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'So Adam overcame Moses.' So whoever knows the cause in this matter with a knowledge emanating from the light of guidance, he is from the special knowers (al-'arifin) who are aware of the secret of divine decree (al-qadr). And whoever hears this and believes in it and affirms it by mere hearing, he is from the general believers. And fear (khawf) occurs for each one of the two groups. For if he is a servant, he is fallen into the grasp of divine power like the fall of the weak child into the claws of the lion, and the lion may be heedless by coincidence and leave him, and it may attack him and devour him, and that is according to what coincides. And that coincidence has causes arranged by a known decree. But if it is attributed to one who does not know it, it is called coincidence, and if it is attributed to the knowledge of Allah, it is not permissible to call it coincidence. And the one fallen into the claws of the lion, if his knowledge were complete, he would not fear the lion because the lion is subjugated: if hunger is imposed upon it, it devours, and if heedlessness is imposed upon it, it leaves and abandons.

I do not say that the example of fear from Allah the Exalted is fear from the lion, but when the veil is lifted, it is known that fear from the lion is the very fear from Allah the Exalted because the destroyer through the medium of the lion is Allah.

The stomach, in truth, is the spring of desires (shahawat) and the source of diseases and afflictions, for it is followed by the desire (shahwa) of the private parts and intense lust (shiddat al-shabaq) for women; then following the desire (shahwa) for food and intercourse comes intense craving for status and wealth, which are means to expansion in women and foods; then following the accumulation of wealth and status come various foolishnesses and types of rivalries and envies; then between them is generated the affliction of hypocrisy (riya') and the consequence of boasting, competition, and arrogance (kibriya'), then that leads to rancor, envy, enmity, and hatred, then that brings its possessor to plunge into oppression, evil, and indecency, and all of that is the fruit of neglecting the stomach and what is generated from it of the insolence of satiety and fullness. If the servant (al-'abd) had subdued his soul (nafs) with hunger and narrowed with it the channels of Satan, it would have submitted to the obedience of Allah (the Mighty and Majestic) and not taken the path of insolence and transgression, and it would not have led to immersion in the worldly life and preferring the immediate over the hereafter, and it would not have rushed with all this rushing upon the worldly life. And if the affliction of the desire (shahwa) of the stomach has reached this extent, it is obligatory to explain its dangers and afflictions as a warning from it, and it is obligatory to clarify the way of striving (mujahada) against it and to point out its virtue as an encouragement toward it, and likewise explaining the desire (shahwa) of the private parts, for it follows it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>أما بعد: فأعظم المهلكات لابن آدم شهوة البطن، فبها أخرج آدم عليه السلام وحواء من دار القرار إلى دار الذل والافتقار؛ إذ نهيا عن الشجرة فغلبتهما شهواتهما حتى أكلا منها فبدت لهما سوآتهما. والبطن على التحقيق ينبوع الشهوات ومنبت الأدواء والآفات، إذ يتبعها شهوة الفرج وشدة الشبق إلى المنكوحات؛ ثم تتبع شهوة الطعام والنكاح شدة الرغبة في الجاه والمال اللذين هما وسيلة إلى التوسع في المنكوحات والمطعومات؛ ثم يتبع استكثار المال والجاه أنواع الرعونات وضروب المنافسات والمحاسدات؛ ثم يتولد بينهما آفة الرياء وغائلة التفاخر والتكاثر والكبرياء، ثم يتداعى ذلك إلى الحقد والحسد والعداوة والبغضاء، ثم يفضي ذلك بصاحبه إلى اقتحام البغي والمنكر والفحشاء، وكل ذلك ثمرة إهمال المعدة وما يتولد منها من بطر الشبع والامتلاء، ولو ذلل العبد نفسه بالجوع وضيق به مجاري الشيطان لأذعنت لطاعة الله عز وجل ولم تسلك سبيل البطر والطغيان، ولم ينجز به ذلك إلى الانهماك في الدنيا وإيثار العاجلة على العقبى ولم يتكالب كل هذا التكالب على الدنيا، وإذا عظمت آفة شهوة البطن إلى هذا الحد وجب شرح غوائلها وآفاتها تحذيراً منها، ووجب إيضاح طريق المجاهدة لها والتنبيه على فضلها ترغيباً فيها، وكذلك شرح شهوة الفرج فإنها تابعة لها.</div></div></div>"}},"122":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.25","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"ُhَٰbَtْjgٱ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.38","c":"اجْتَبَاهُ","d":"ij'tabāhu","e":"ۥُhُّbَr"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.02","c":"رَبُّهُ","d":"rabbuhu","e":"َbāَtَf"},{"b":"3.3","h":"4.63","c":"فَتَابَ","d":"fatāba","e":"ِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.95","c":"عَلَيْهِ","d":"ʿalayhi","e":"ٰàَdَhَw"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.56","c":"وَهَدَى","d":"wahadā","e":"َlāَq"}],"a":{"g":"Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him]."}},"123":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"قَالَ","d":"qāla","e":"āَṭِbْhٱ"},{"b":"0.54","h":"0.98","c":"اهْبِطَا","d":"ih'biṭā","e":"āَhْnِm"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.37","c":"مِنْهَا","d":"min'hā","e":"āًۢʿعyِmَjg"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.68","c":"جَمِيعًا","d":"jamīʿan","e":"ْmُkُḍْʿعَb"},{"b":"3.8","h":"7.1","c":"بَعْضُكُمْ","d":"baʿḍukum","e":"ٍḍْʿعَbِl"},{"b":"4.9","h":"8.64","c":"لِبَعْضٍ","d":"libaʿḍin","e":"ٌّwُdَʿع"},{"b":"5.8","h":"10.15","c":"عَدُوٌّ","d":"ʿaduwwun","e":"āَّmِiʾَf"},{"b":"7.0","h":"12.7","c":"فَإِمَّا","d":"fa-immā","e":"mُkَّnَyِtْaʾَy"},{"b":"8.5","h":"14.49","c":"يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ","d":"yatiyannakum","e":"àِّnِّm"},{"b":"11.2","h":"17.94","c":"مِنِّي","d":"minnī","e":"àًdُh"},{"b":"12.","h":"19.47","c":"هُدًى","d":"hudan","e":"ِnَmَf"},{"b":"13.6","h":"20.78","c":"فَمَنِ","d":"famani","e":"َʿعَbَّtٱ"},{"b":"14.2","h":"21.78","c":"اتَّبَعَ","d":"ittabaʿa","e":"َàāَdُh"},{"b":"15.","h":"23.1","c":"هُدَايَ","d":"hudāya","e":"āَlَf"},{"b":"15.9","h":"24.68","c":"فَلَا","d":"falā","e":"ُّlِḍَy"},{"b":"16.","h":"25.51","c":"يَضِلُّ","d":"yaḍillu","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"17.6","h":"26.96","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"ٰàَqْhsَy"},{"b":"18.2","h":"28.03","c":"يَشْقَى","d":"yashqā","e":"ْnَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"[Allah] said, \"Descend from Paradise - all, [your descendants] being enemies to one another.

They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: The punishment of the disbeliever in his grave; there are unleashed upon him ninety-nine dragons (tinnin). Do you know what the dragon (tinnin) is? Ninety-nine snakes (hayya), each snake has nine heads, they scratch him, lick him, and blow into his body until the day they are resurrected. And one should not be astonished at this number in particular, for the numbers of these snakes and scorpions are according to the number of blameworthy character traits (akhlaq al-madhmuma) from arrogance (kibr), hypocrisy (riya'), envy (hasad), rancor (ghill), malice (hiqd), and other attributes (sifat). For they have countable roots, then branches spread from them that are countable, then their branches divide into divisions, and those attributes in their very essences are the destroyers (al-muhlikat), and in their very essences they transform into scorpions and snakes. The strong among them stings with the sting of the dragon (tinnin), and the weak stings with the sting of the scorpion (aqrab), and what is between them harms with the harm of the snake (hayya). And the possessors of hearts (arbab al-qulub) and insights (al-basa'ir) witness with the light of insight (nur al-basira) these destroyers and their branching offshoots, except that the measure of their number cannot be ascertained except by the light of prophethood (nur al-nubuwwa). So, the likes of these reports have sound outward appearances (zawahir sahiha) and hidden secrets (asrar khafiya), but they are clear to the possessors of insights (arbab al-basa'ir).

It is what is intended by the saying of Allah the Exalted: 'Their sides forsake their beds' (Quran 32:16) {}. That was narrated from Al-Hasan and Ibn Abi Ziyad attributed it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (that he was asked about this verse and he ﷺ said: The prayer between the two evening prayers, then he ﷺ said: Upon you is the prayer between the two evening prayers, for it removes the frivolities (Malaghat) of the day and refines its end [42]). And 'Malaghat' is the plural of 'Malgha' from 'Laghw' (frivolity, idle talk). And Anas, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked about one who sleeps between the two evening prayers, and he said: Do not do it, for it is the hour intended by the saying of Allah the Exalted: 'Their sides forsake their beds' (Quran 32:16) {}. And the virtue of reviving what is between the two evening prayers will come in the second chapter. And the order of this devotional practice (Wird) is that he prays after Maghrib two units (Rak'atain) first, reciting in them 'Say, O disbelievers' (Surah Al-Kafirun) and 'Say, He is Allah, the One' (Surah Al-Ikhlas), and he prays them immediately after Maghrib without interruption of speech or occupation, then he prays four units (Arba'a) prolonging them, then he prays until the disappearance of the twilight what is easy for him, and if the mosque is near the house, then there is no harm in praying them in his house if his intention (Azm) is not to stay in the mosque, and if he intends to stay in waiting for the late evening prayer (Atama), then it is the best if he is safe from affectation (Tasannu') and showing off (Riya).
