Patience (Sabr) regarding that by abandoning retaliation is sometimes obligatory and sometimes a virtue. Some of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, said: 'We did not consider a man's faith (Iman) to be faith if he did not have patience (Sabr) upon harm.' And Allah the Exalted said: 'And we will certainly have patience (Sabr) upon what you harm us, and upon Allah let the reliant ones rely.' (Quran 14:12). (And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, once distributed wealth, so some of the Bedouin Muslims said: 'This is a distribution not intended by it the Face of Allah,' so the Messenger of Allah was informed, and his cheeks reddened, then he said: 'May Allah have mercy on my brother Musa; he was harmed more than this and had patience (Sabr).' [24]). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And leave their harm and rely upon Allah.' (Quran 73:10). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And have patience (Sabr) upon what they say and abandon them with a beautiful abandonment.' (Quran 73:10). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And indeed We know that your chest is constrained by what they say, so glorify with the praise of your Lord.' (Quran 15:97) the verse. And Allah the Exalted said: 'And you will certainly hear from those who were given the Book before you and from those who associate partners much harm, and if you have patience (Sabr) and are God-fearing (Taqwa), then indeed that is from the matters of determination.' (Quran 3:186) meaning have patience (Sabr) from retaliation. And for that reason, Allah the Exalted praised those who pardon from their rights in retaliation (Qisas) and other than it, so He the Exalted said: 'And if you punish, then punish with the like of that with which you were punished, but if you have patience (Sabr), it is better for the patient ones (Sabirin).' (Quran 16:126). And he, peace be upon him, said: 'Maintain ties with the one who cuts you off, give to the one who deprives you, and pardon the one who wrongs you.' [25] And I saw in the Gospel, Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him, said: 'Indeed it was said to you before: An eye for an eye and a nose for a nose, but I say to you: Do not resist evil, but whoever strikes your right cheek, turn to him the left cheek, and whoever takes your cloak, give him your garment, and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two miles.' And all of that is a command to have patience (Sabr) upon harm. So patience (Sabr) upon the harm of people is from the highest levels of patience (Sabr) because in it cooperate the motivator of the religion (Din) and the motivator of desire (Shahwa) and anger (Ghadab) all together.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>القسم الثاني: مالا يرتبط هجومه باختياره وله اختيار في دفعه كما لو أوذي بفعل أو قول وجنى عليه في نفسه أو ماله، فالصبر على ذلك بترك المكافأة تارة يكون واجبا وتارة يكون فضيلة. قال بعض الصحابة رضوان الله عليهم: ما كنا نعدّ إيمان الرجل ايمانا إذا لم يصبر على الأذى، وقال تعالى: ﴿ ولنصبرنّ على ما آذيتمونا وعلى الله فليتوكل المتوكلون ﴾ {}.

Allah the Exalted said: \"So take Him as your trustee and have patience (Sabr) upon what they say.\" And He said: \"And we will have patience (Sabr) upon what you harm us, and upon Allah let the reliant ones rely (Tawakkul).\" And He the Mighty and Majestic said: \"And leave their harm and rely (Tawakkul) upon Allah.\" And He the Blessed and Exalted said: \"So have patience (Sabr) as the possessors of resolve from the messengers had patience (Sabr).\" And He said: \"Excellent is the reward of the workers who had patience (Sabr) and upon their Lord they rely (Tawakkul).\" And this is regarding the harm of people. As for having patience (Sabr) upon the harm of snakes, beasts, and scorpions, abandoning repelling them is not from reliance (Tawakkul) in anything, for there is no benefit in it, and striving is not intended nor is striving abandoned for its own sake but to aid in the religion (Deen). The arrangement of causes here is like their arrangement in earning and bringing benefits, so we do not prolong with repetition. Likewise, in the causes repelling from wealth, reliance (Tawakkul) is not diminished by closing the door of the house when leaving nor by tying the camel, because these are causes known by the Sunnah of Allah the Exalted, either certainly or presumably. And for that reason, he ﷺ said to the Bedouin when he neglected the camel and said 'I have relied (Tawakkul) upon Allah': 'Tie it and rely (Tawakkul).' And He said: 'Take your precaution.' And He said regarding the manner of the prayer of fear: 'And let them take their weapons.' And He the Blessed said: 'And prepare for them what you are able of strength and of tying the horses.' And He said to Musa, peace be upon him: 'So travel by night with My servants.'
