Allah the Exalted has said: **\"Woe to the defrauders [al-mutaffifin]—those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, but when they measure or weigh for them, they give less.\"** (83:1-3). And one is not saved from this except by giving more when he gives and taking less when he takes, for true justice [al-'adl al-haqiqi] is scarcely conceivable. So let him seek the clear evidence of increase and decrease. For whoever exacts his right in its entirety is on the verge of transgressing it.\n\nAnd some of them would say: \"I will not purchase Woe from Allah for a single grain.\" So when he would take, he would decrease by half a grain, and when he would give, he would increase by a grain. And he would say: \"Woe to him who sells for a single grain a Paradise whose width is the heavens and the earth. And how great is the loss of him who sells bliss [tuba] for woe [wil]!\"\n\nAnd they were excessive in guarding against this and its like because they are injustices [mazalim] from which repentance is not possible, for the owners of the grains are not known so that one could gather them and fulfill their rights. And for that reason, when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, purchased something, he said to the weigher as he was weighing its price: \"Weigh, and give more.\" A hadith states: He said to the weigher, \"Weigh, and give more.\" Narrated by the compilers of the Sunan and al-Hakim from the hadith of Suwayd ibn Qays. Al-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\" And al-Hakim said: \"Sahih according to the conditions of Muslim.\"\n\nAnd Fudayl looked at his son as he was washing a dinar, intending to exchange it and remove its blackening and purify it so that its weight would not increase because of that, and he said: \"O my son, your doing this is better than two Hajj pilgrimages and twenty 'Umrahs.\"\n\nAnd some of the predecessors said: \"I am amazed at the merchant and the seller—how can he be saved? He weighs and swears by day, and sleeps by night.\"\n\nAnd Sulayman, peace be upon him, said to his son: \"O my son, just as a grain enters between two stones, so does a sin enter between the two parties in a transaction.\"\n\nAnd one of the righteous prayed over an effeminate man, and it was said to him: \"He was a sinner [fasiq].\" So he remained silent. It was repeated to him, and he said: \"It is as if you are telling me he was the owner of two scales: he would give with one and take with the other.\" He indicated by this that his sin was an injustice between him and Allah the Exalted. And this is from the injustices against servants [mazalim al-'ibad], and being lax and forgiving in it is more remote. And the severity in the matter of the scale is great, and salvation from it is achieved by a grain and half a grain.\n\nAnd in the recitation of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him: **\"Do not transgress in the measure, and establish the weight with fairness, and do not diminish the measure\"**—meaning the tongue of the scale, for decrease and increase appear by its inclination.\n\nAnd in summary, everyone who demands full justice for himself from others, even in a word, but does not give justice in like manner, he falls under the saying of Allah the Exalted: **\"Woe to the defrauders—those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full...\"** (83:1-3). For the prohibition of that in what is measured is not because it is something measured, but because it is a quantified matter in which justice and fairness have been abandoned. Thus, it applies to all actions.\n\nSo the owner of the scale is in danger of the Woe, and every legally responsible person is an owner of scales in his actions, his words, and his thoughts. So the Woe is for him if he deviates from justice [al-'adl] and inclines away from uprightness [al-istiqamah]. And were it not for the difficulty and near-impossibility of this, His saying, the Exalted, would not have come: **\"And there is none of you but will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.\"** (19:71). So no servant is free—who is not protected from sin—from inclining away from uprightness, except that the degrees of inclination vary with a great variation. Therefore, the duration of their stay in the Fire varies until the time of deliverance, so that some remain only for the duration of fulfilling an oath, and some remain for a thousand and thousands of years. So we ask Allah the Exalted to bring us close to uprightness and justice, for adhering firmly to the straight path [al-sirat al-mustaqim] without any deviation from it is not something to be hoped for, for it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. And were it not for that, the one upright upon it would not be able to cross the Sirat stretched over the midst of the Fire, whose description is that it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. And according to one's uprightness on this straight path, the servant is lightened on the Day of Resurrection upon the Sirat.\n\nAnd everyone who mixes food with dirt or other, then measures it, he is from the defrauders in measuring. And every butcher who weighs bone with meat in a manner not customary, he is from the defrauders in weighing. And judge by this all other estimations, even in the cubit measurement undertaken by the cloth merchant. For when he buys, he releases the cloth at the time of measuring and does not stretch it fully, and when he sells it, he stretches it in the measurement to make it appear more.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وويل له في نص كتاب الله تعالى حيث قال ويل للمطففين الذين إذا أكتالوا على الناس يستوفون وإذا كالوهم أو وزنوهم يخسرون وكل من يلتمس من الإنصاف اكثر مما تسمح به نفسه فهو داخل تحت مقتضى هذه الآية</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>j2 k05</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, and woe [wa-wail] for him in the explicit text of the Book of Allah, the Exalted, where He said: \"Woe to the defrauders [al-mutaffifin]—those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, but when they measure or weigh for them, they give less.\" And everyone who seeks from fairness [al-insaf] more than what his own soul [nafs] permits, he falls under the implication of this verse. And the origin of the shortcoming in covering the private parts [satr al-'awrah] or striving to expose them is the hidden disease [al-da' al-dafin] within the inner self [al-batin], which is rancor [al-hiqd] and envy [al-hasad]. For the rancorous, envious one fills his inner self [batin] with malice [al-khabath], but he restrains it within his inner self and conceals it, and does not reveal it as long as he does not find an opportunity for it. And when he finds an opening, the bond is loosened and modesty [al-haya'] is lifted, and the inner self seeps with its hidden malice.

شرط مسلم ونظر فضيل إلى ابنه وهو يغسل دينارا يريد أن يصرفه ويزيل تكحيله وينقيه حتى لا يزيد وزنه بسبب ذلك فقال يا بني فعلك هذا أفضل من حجتين وعشرين عمرة وقال بعض السلف عجبت للتاجر والبائع كيف ينجو يزن ويحلف بالنهار وينام بالليل وقال سليمان عليه السلام لابنه يا بني كما تدخل الحبة بين الحجرين كذلك تدخل الخطيئة بين المتبايعين وصلى بعض الصالحين على مخنث فقيل له إنه كان فاسقا فسكت فأعيد عليه فقال كأنك

يقدر على جواز الصراط الممدود على متن النار الذي من صفته أنه أدق من الشعرة وأحد من السيف وبقدر الاستقامة على هذا الصراط المستقيم يخف العبد يوم القيامة على الصراط وكل من خلط بالطعام ترابا أو غيره ثم

And He, the Mighty and Majestic, says: \"If We willed, We could strike them for their sins and seal [natba'u] their hearts [qulub], and they would not hear.\" (7:100). Thus, He linked the absence of hearing to the sealing [tab'] due to sins, just as He linked hearing to God-consciousness [taqwa], saying: \"And be conscious of God and listen.\" (5:108), and \"And be conscious of God, and God will teach you.\" (2:282). Whenever sins accumulate, the heart [qalb] is sealed [yutba'u], and at that point the heart [qalb] becomes blind to perceiving the truth [haqq] and the rectitude of religion [din], and it belittles the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira] and magnifies the matter of the world [dunya], and its concern becomes restricted to it. So when its ear is struck with the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira] and the perils within it, it enters one ear and exits the other, and it does not settle in the heart [qalb] nor move it to repentance [tawba] and recovery. Those have despaired of the Hereafter [Akhira] as the disbelievers despair of the companions of the graves. This is the meaning of the heart's [qalb] blackening by sins, as declared by the Quran and the Sunnah. Maymun ibn Mihran said: \"When a servant commits a sin, a black spot is imprinted on his heart [qalb]. If he desists and repents, it is polished. But if he returns, it is increased in him until it covers his heart [qalb]—that is the stain [rayn].\" And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"The heart [qalb] of the believer is bare, with a shining lamp within it. And the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever is black, inverted.\" Obedience to God, glorified is He, by opposing desires is a polisher for the heart [qalb], and His disobediences blacken it. So whoever inclines to disobediences, his heart [qalb] blackens. And whoever follows a bad deed with a good deed and erases its trace, his heart [qalb] is not darkened, but its light [nur] diminishes, like a mirror into which one breathes, then it is wiped, then one breathes, then it is wiped—it is not free from cloudiness. And he, peace be upon him, said: \"Hearts [qulub] are of four kinds: a bare heart [qalb] with a shining lamp within it—that is the heart [qalb] of the believer; a black, inverted heart [qalb]—that is the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever; a wrapped heart [qalb], bound upon its covering—that is the heart [qalb] of the hypocrite; and a layered heart [qalb] containing faith [iman] and hypocrisy [nifaq]—the likeness of faith [iman] within it is like a plant nourished by pure water, and the likeness of hypocrisy [nifaq] within it is like an ulcer nourished by pus and blood. Whichever of the two nourishments prevails over him, he is judged by it.\" And in a narration: \"It takes him away.\" Allah the Exalted says: \"Indeed, those who are conscious of God [muttaqun]—when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember [dhikr] and at once they have insight [basar].\" (7:201). He informed that the polishing [jala'] of the heart [qalb] and its insight [basar] are attained through remembrance [dhikr], and that none can attain it except those who are conscious [ittaqaw].

Whenever sins accumulate, the heart [qalb] is sealed [yutba'u], and at that point the heart [qalb] becomes blind to perceiving the truth [haqq] and the rectitude of religion [din], and it belittles the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira] and magnifies the matter of the world [dunya], and its concern becomes restricted to it.

And the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever is black, inverted.\" Obedience to God, glorified is He, by opposing desires is a polisher for the heart [qalb], and His disobediences blacken it. So whoever inclines to disobediences, his heart [qalb] blackens. And whoever follows a bad deed with a good deed and erases its trace, his heart [qalb] is not darkened, but its light [nur] diminishes, like a mirror into which one breathes, then it is wiped, then one breathes, then it is wiped—it is not free from cloudiness. And he, peace be upon him, said: \"Hearts [qulub] are of four kinds: a bare heart [qalb] with a shining lamp within it—that is the heart [qalb] of the believer; a black, inverted heart [qalb]—that is the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever; a wrapped heart [qalb], bound upon its covering—that is the heart [qalb] of the hypocrite; and a layered heart [qalb] containing faith [iman] and hypocrisy [nifaq]—the likeness of faith [iman] within it is like a plant nourished by pure water, and the likeness of hypocrisy [nifaq] within it is like an ulcer nourished by pus and blood.

And just as the righteous find increase in their state and their knowledge [ma'rifa] through their proximity to those brought near and their witnessing of them, so too will be their state in the Hereafter: \"He did not create you nor resurrect you except as a single soul. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it.\" And as the Almighty said: \"A reward in accordance [jaza'an wifaqan]\" — meaning the reward corresponded to their deeds. So the pure was met with the pure from the drink, and the mixed was met with the mixed. And the mixture [shawb] of every drink is according to the measure of what preceded of mixture in his love [hubb] and his deeds. \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.\" — \"And indeed, Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.\" — \"Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight. And if there is a good deed, He multiplies it.\" — \"And if it is the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountants.\" So whoever, in this world [dunya], his love was his hope for the bliss of Paradise, the maidens with large, [beautiful] eyes, and the palaces, he is granted power in Paradise to settle wherever he wishes, to play with the eternal youths and enjoy the women. There, in the Hereafter, his pleasure ends, for indeed, every person is given in love what his soul [nafs] desires and his eye delights in. But whoever his aim was the Lord of the Abode and the Owner of Sovereignty, and nothing dominated him except his love with sincerity [ikhlas] and truthfulness [sidq], he is settled \"in a seat of honor near a Sovereign, Perfect in Ability.\" Thus, the righteous graze in the gardens and delight in the Paradises with the maidens and the eternal youths, while those brought near are constant in the Presence [al-hadra], devoted, their gaze fixed upon It. They consider the bliss of Paradise insignificant compared to an atom of It. For some people are preoccupied with satisfying the appetite of the belly and the private parts, and for companionship there are other people. And for this reason, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The majority of the inhabitants of Paradise are the simple-minded, and 'Illiyyun is for the people of understanding.\" And when understandings fell short of grasping the meaning of 'Illiyyun, He magnified its matter, saying: \"And what can make you know what is 'Illiyyun?\" just as the Almighty said: \"The Striking Calamity - what is the Striking Calamity?
