Allah the Exalted has said: **\"Woe to the defrauders [al-mutaffifin]—those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, but when they measure or weigh for them, they give less.\"** (83:1-3). And one is not saved from this except by giving more when he gives and taking less when he takes, for true justice [al-'adl al-haqiqi] is scarcely conceivable. So let him seek the clear evidence of increase and decrease. For whoever exacts his right in its entirety is on the verge of transgressing it.\n\nAnd some of them would say: \"I will not purchase Woe from Allah for a single grain.\" So when he would take, he would decrease by half a grain, and when he would give, he would increase by a grain. And he would say: \"Woe to him who sells for a single grain a Paradise whose width is the heavens and the earth. And how great is the loss of him who sells bliss [tuba] for woe [wil]!\"\n\nAnd they were excessive in guarding against this and its like because they are injustices [mazalim] from which repentance is not possible, for the owners of the grains are not known so that one could gather them and fulfill their rights. And for that reason, when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, purchased something, he said to the weigher as he was weighing its price: \"Weigh, and give more.\" A hadith states: He said to the weigher, \"Weigh, and give more.\" Narrated by the compilers of the Sunan and al-Hakim from the hadith of Suwayd ibn Qays. Al-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\" And al-Hakim said: \"Sahih according to the conditions of Muslim.\"\n\nAnd Fudayl looked at his son as he was washing a dinar, intending to exchange it and remove its blackening and purify it so that its weight would not increase because of that, and he said: \"O my son, your doing this is better than two Hajj pilgrimages and twenty 'Umrahs.\"\n\nAnd some of the predecessors said: \"I am amazed at the merchant and the seller—how can he be saved? He weighs and swears by day, and sleeps by night.\"\n\nAnd Sulayman, peace be upon him, said to his son: \"O my son, just as a grain enters between two stones, so does a sin enter between the two parties in a transaction.\"\n\nAnd one of the righteous prayed over an effeminate man, and it was said to him: \"He was a sinner [fasiq].\" So he remained silent. It was repeated to him, and he said: \"It is as if you are telling me he was the owner of two scales: he would give with one and take with the other.\" He indicated by this that his sin was an injustice between him and Allah the Exalted. And this is from the injustices against servants [mazalim al-'ibad], and being lax and forgiving in it is more remote. And the severity in the matter of the scale is great, and salvation from it is achieved by a grain and half a grain.\n\nAnd in the recitation of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him: **\"Do not transgress in the measure, and establish the weight with fairness, and do not diminish the measure\"**—meaning the tongue of the scale, for decrease and increase appear by its inclination.\n\nAnd in summary, everyone who demands full justice for himself from others, even in a word, but does not give justice in like manner, he falls under the saying of Allah the Exalted: **\"Woe to the defrauders—those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full...\"** (83:1-3). For the prohibition of that in what is measured is not because it is something measured, but because it is a quantified matter in which justice and fairness have been abandoned. Thus, it applies to all actions.\n\nSo the owner of the scale is in danger of the Woe, and every legally responsible person is an owner of scales in his actions, his words, and his thoughts. So the Woe is for him if he deviates from justice [al-'adl] and inclines away from uprightness [al-istiqamah]. And were it not for the difficulty and near-impossibility of this, His saying, the Exalted, would not have come: **\"And there is none of you but will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.\"** (19:71). So no servant is free—who is not protected from sin—from inclining away from uprightness, except that the degrees of inclination vary with a great variation. Therefore, the duration of their stay in the Fire varies until the time of deliverance, so that some remain only for the duration of fulfilling an oath, and some remain for a thousand and thousands of years. So we ask Allah the Exalted to bring us close to uprightness and justice, for adhering firmly to the straight path [al-sirat al-mustaqim] without any deviation from it is not something to be hoped for, for it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. And were it not for that, the one upright upon it would not be able to cross the Sirat stretched over the midst of the Fire, whose description is that it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. And according to one's uprightness on this straight path, the servant is lightened on the Day of Resurrection upon the Sirat.\n\nAnd everyone who mixes food with dirt or other, then measures it, he is from the defrauders in measuring. And every butcher who weighs bone with meat in a manner not customary, he is from the defrauders in weighing. And judge by this all other estimations, even in the cubit measurement undertaken by the cloth merchant. For when he buys, he releases the cloth at the time of measuring and does not stretch it fully, and when he sells it, he stretches it in the measurement to make it appear more.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وويل له في نص كتاب الله تعالى حيث قال ويل للمطففين الذين إذا أكتالوا على الناس يستوفون وإذا كالوهم أو وزنوهم يخسرون وكل من يلتمس من الإنصاف اكثر مما تسمح به نفسه فهو داخل تحت مقتضى هذه الآية</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 2: Etiquette of Companionship</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And woe to him in the explicit text of the Book of Allah (the Quran) where He said: 'Woe to the defrauders (Al-Mutaffifin) who, when they take by measure from people, take in full, but when they measure to them or weigh for them, they give less.' And everyone who seeks from justice more than what his soul (Nafs) permits is included under the implication of this verse. The origin of deficiency in covering faults (Satr Al-Awrah) or striving to uncover them is the hidden disease in the inner self (Al-Batin), which is rancor (Al-Hiqd) and envy (Al-Hasad). For the rancorous envier fills his inner self (Batin) with wickedness but restrains it within his inner self (Batin) and conceals it and does not manifest it as long as he does not find an opportunity for it. And when he finds an opportunity, the bond is dissolved and modesty (Al-Haya) is lifted, and the inner self (Al-Batin) seeps with its hidden wickedness. And whenever the inner self (Al-Batin) contains rancor and envy, then severance is preferable.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وويل له في نص كتاب الله تعالى حيث قال ويل للمطففين الذين إذا أكتالوا على الناس يستوفون وإذا كالوهم أو وزنوهم يخسرون وكل من يلتمس من الإنصاف اكثر مما تسمح به نفسه فهو داخل تحت مقتضى هذه الآية ومنشأ التقصير في ستر العورة أو السعي في كشفها الداء الدفين في الباطن وهو الحقد والحسن فإن الحقود الحسود يملأ باطنه بالخبث ولكن يحبسه في باطنه ويخفيه ولا يبديه مهما لم يجد له مجالا وإذا وجد فرصة انحلت الرابطة وارتفع الحياء ويترشح الباطن بخبثه الدفين ومهما انطوى الباطن على حقد وحسد فالانقطاع أولى</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 2: Etiquette of Earning a Livelihood</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>The third [principle] is not to conceal anything in the measure, and that is by adjusting the scale and being cautious in it and in measuring. One should measure as one would be measured. Allah the Exalted said: 'Woe to the defrauders (Al-Mutaffifin) who, when they take by measure from people, take in full, but when they measure to them or weigh to them, they give less.' And one is not free from this except by returning when given and decreasing when taking, since true justice (Al-Adl) is rarely conceivable. So let him seek evidence through the appearance of increase and decrease, for whoever exacts his right in its entirety is likely to transgress it. And some of them would say: 'I do not buy the Woe from Allah for a grain.' So when he would take, he would decrease half a grain, and when he would give, he would increase a grain. And he would say: 'Woe to him who sells for a grain a garden whose width is the heavens and the earth. And how great is the loss of him who sells bliss for woe.' And they only exaggerated in guarding against this and its like because they are injustices from which repentance is not possible, since the owners of the grains are not known until they are gathered and their rights are fulfilled. And for that reason, when the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, bought something, he said to the weigher when he was weighing its price: 'Weigh and give more.' The hadith: 'He said to the weigher: Weigh and give more' was narrated by the compilers of the Sunan and Al-Hakim from the hadith of Suwayd ibn Qays.

For the prohibition of that in measuring is not because it is measuring, but because it is an intended matter of abandoning justice (Al-Adl) and fairness (An-Nisfah) in it, so it applies to all actions. The possessor of the scale is in danger of the woe, and every legally responsible person (Mukallaf) is a possessor of scales in his actions, his words, and his thoughts. So woe to him if he deviates from justice (Al-Adl) and inclines away from uprightness (Al-Istiqamah). Were it not for the difficulty and impossibility of this, His saying, exalted is He, would not have come: 'And there is none of you except he will come to it; it is upon your Lord a decree determined.' So no servant (Abd) who is not infallible (Ma'sum) is free from inclination away from uprightness (Al-Istiqamah), except that the degrees of inclination vary with great variation. Therefore, the duration of their stay in the Fire varies until the time of deliverance, so that some of them remain only for the duration of fulfilling the oath, and some of them remain for a thousand and thousands of years. So we ask Allah, exalted is He, to bring us closer to uprightness (Al-Istiqamah) and justice (Al-Adl), for strict adherence to the path of the straight (As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim) without deviation from it is not to be hoped for, for it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. Were it not for that, the one upright (Mustaqim) upon it would not be able to cross the bridge (As-Sirat) stretched over the surface of the Fire, whose attribute is that it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. And according to the uprightness (Al-Istiqamah) on this straight path (As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim), the servant (Abd) is lightened on the Day of Resurrection on the bridge (As-Sirat).

The sun shone upon them, and its heat had multiplied and changed from what it was in lightness of its matter. Then it was brought near to the heads of the worlds like the distance of two bow-lengths, so there remained on the earth no shade except the shade of the Lord of the Worlds (Rabb al-'Alamin), and none could take shade in it except the ones brought near (al-Muqarrabun). So between one taking shade under the Throne (al-'Arsh) and one exposed to the sun's heat, which has melted him with its heat, and his distress and grief have intensified from its blaze. Then the creatures pushed one another and some pushed others due to the severity of the crowding and the difference in feet, and added to it is the severity of shame and modesty (al-Haya') from exposure and shrinking back at the presentation before the Compeller of the sky. So the blaze of the sun, the heat of breaths, and the burning of the hearts (al-Qulub) with the fire of modesty (al-Haya') and fear (al-Khawf) gathered, so sweat flowed from the root of every hair until it streamed on the plain of the Resurrection (al-Qiyamah).

Ka'b and Qatadah said: 'On the Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds' (Quran 83:6). They said: They will stand for the measure of three hundred years. Rather, Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) recited this verse then said: 'How will you be when Allah gathers you as arrows are gathered in a quiver for fifty thousand years and does not look at you?' And Al-Hasan said: What do you think of a day when they stood on their feet for the measure of fifty thousand years, not eating a meal in it nor drinking a drink in it, until when their necks were cut off from thirst and their bellies burned from hunger, they were turned to the Fire and given to drink from a spring whose heat had come and its blaze intensified. When their exertion reached what they had no power for, some of them spoke to each other seeking one honored by his Master to intercede for their right, but they did not cling to any prophet except he pushed them away and said: Leave me, my soul (Nafs), my soul (Nafs), my affair has preoccupied me from the affair of others. And each one excused himself with the intensity of the anger of Allah the Exalted, saying: Today our Lord has become angry with an anger like which He has not become angry before nor will become angry after it, until our Prophet (peace be upon him) intercedes for whom permission is given to him in it: 'They will not possess intercession except for whom the Most Merciful has given permission and is pleased with his speech' (Quran 20:109).

Allah the Exalted says: \"No! Rather, what they have earned has stained their hearts [qulub].\" (83:14). And He, the Mighty and Majestic, says: \"If We willed, We could strike them for their sins and seal [natba'u] their hearts [qulub], and they would not hear.\" (7:100). Thus, He linked the absence of hearing to the sealing [tab'] due to sins, just as He linked hearing to God-consciousness [taqwa], saying: \"And be conscious of God and listen.\" (5:108), and \"And be conscious of God, and God will teach you.\" (2:282). Whenever sins accumulate, the heart [qalb] is sealed [yutba'u], and at that point the heart [qalb] becomes blind to perceiving the truth [haqq] and the rectitude of religion [din], and it belittles the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira] and magnifies the matter of the world [dunya], and its concern becomes restricted to it. So when its ear is struck with the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira] and the perils within it, it enters one ear and exits the other, and it does not settle in the heart [qalb] nor move it to repentance [tawba] and recovery. Those have despaired of the Hereafter [Akhira] as the disbelievers despair of the companions of the graves. This is the meaning of the heart's [qalb] blackening by sins, as declared by the Quran and the Sunnah. Maymun ibn Mihran said: \"When a servant commits a sin, a black spot is imprinted on his heart [qalb]. If he desists and repents, it is polished. But if he returns, it is increased in him until it covers his heart [qalb]—that is the stain [rayn].\" And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: \"The heart [qalb] of the believer is bare, with a shining lamp within it. And the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever is black, inverted.\" Obedience to God, glorified is He, by opposing desires is a polisher for the heart [qalb], and His disobediences blacken it. So whoever inclines to disobediences, his heart [qalb] blackens. And whoever follows a bad deed with a good deed and erases its trace, his heart [qalb] is not darkened, but its light [nur] diminishes, like a mirror into which one breathes, then it is wiped, then one breathes, then it is wiped—it is not free from cloudiness. And he, peace be upon him, said: \"Hearts [qulub] are of four kinds: a bare heart [qalb] with a shining lamp within it—that is the heart [qalb] of the believer; a black, inverted heart [qalb]—that is the heart [qalb] of the disbeliever; a wrapped heart [qalb], bound upon its covering—that is the heart [qalb] of the hypocrite; and a layered heart [qalb] containing faith [iman] and hypocrisy [nifaq]—the likeness of faith [iman] within it is like a plant nourished by pure water, and the likeness of hypocrisy [nifaq] within it is like an ulcer nourished by pus and blood. Whichever of the two nourishments prevails over him, he is judged by it.\" And in a narration: \"It takes him away.\" Allah the Exalted says: \"Indeed, those who are conscious of God [muttaqun]—when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember [dhikr] and at once they have insight [basar].\" (7:201). He informed that the polishing [jala'] of the heart [qalb] and its insight [basar] are attained through remembrance [dhikr], and that none can attain it except those who are conscious [ittaqaw]. So God-consciousness [taqwa] is the gate to remembrance [dhikr], and remembrance [dhikr] is the gate to unveiling [kashf], and unveiling [kashf] is the gate to the greatest success [fawz al-akbar], which is success in meeting Allah the Exalted.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولهذا قال علي كرم الله وجهه إن الإيمان ليبدو لمعة بيضاء فإذا عمل العبد الصالحات نمت فزادت حتى يبيض القلب كله وإن النفاق ليبدو نكتة سوداء فإذا انتهك الحرمات نمت وزادت حتى يسود القلب كله فيطبع عليه فذلك هو الختم وتلا قوله تعالى: ﴿ كلا بل ران على قلوبهم ﴾ الآية.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-9.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Invocations and Supplications</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And Abu Hurairah narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: 'Verily, when a believer commits a sin, a black spot appears in his Heart (Qalb).

For the indication of this on the outcome is like the indication of rain on vegetation and the indication of smoke on fire. Indeed, Allah the Exalted has said: 'Indeed, the Righteous (Al-Abrar) are in Bliss (Na'im), and indeed, the Wicked (Al-Fujjar) are in Blazing Fire (Jahim).'

And with this, Allah described His allies (awliya') when He said: Those who are burdened with My love as a child is burdened with a thing, and they take refuge in My remembrance (dhikr) as an eagle takes refuge in its nest, and they become angry for My prohibitions as a tiger becomes angry when enraged, for he does not care whether people are few or many. So look at this example: For the child, if burdened with a thing, does not leave it at all, and if it is taken from him, he has no occupation except crying and shouting until it is returned to him. If he sleeps, he takes it with him in his clothes, and when he wakes, he returns and clings to it. Whenever he is separated from it, he cries, and whenever he finds it, he laughs. Whoever disputes him in it, he hates him, and whoever gives it to him, he loves him. As for the tiger, he cannot control himself when angry until he reaches such intensity of anger that he destroys himself. These are the signs of love (muhabbah). So whoever has these signs completed in him, then his love has been completed and his love has become pure, so his drink (sharab) becomes pure in the Hereafter and his drink becomes sweet. And whoever mixes with his love love for other than Allah, he enjoys in the Hereafter according to his love, for his drink is mixed with a measure of the drink of the close ones (al-muqarrabun), as Allah the Exalted said concerning the righteous (al-abrar): \"Indeed, the righteous are in delight (na'im).\" Then He said: \"They will be given to drink from a pure wine sealed with musk, and for this let the competitors compete. And its mixture is of Tasnim, a spring from which those near to Allah will drink.\" So if the drink of the righteous becomes pleasant due to the mixing of the pure drink that is for the close ones. And the drink is an expression for the entirety of the delight of Paradise (al-jinan), just as the Book expressed by it all the deeds, saying: \"Indeed, the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyyun.\" Then He said: \"Witnessed by those brought near.\" So it was a sign of the cause of their record that it rose to where those brought near witness it. And just as the righteous find increase in their state and knowledge by their proximity to the close ones and their witnessing of them, so will be their state in the Hereafter: \"He did not create you nor resurrect you except as a single soul, as We began the first creation, We will repeat it.\" And as Allah the Exalted said: \"A reward matching.\" That is, the reward matched their deeds, so the pure was met with the pure from the drink, and the mixed was met with the mixed, and the mixing of every drink is according to what preceded of mixing in his love and his deeds: \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it - And Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves - Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight. And if there is [any] good, He multiplies it - And if it should be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth, and sufficient are We as accountant.\" So whoever his love in this world is his hope for the delight of Paradise and the houris.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ومنها أن يكون مشفقاً على جميع عباد الله رحيماً بهم شديداً على جميع أعداء الله وعلى كل من يقارف شيئاً مما يكرهه كما قال الله تعالى: \"أشداء على الكفار رحماء بينهم\" ولا تأخذه لومة لائم ولا يصرفه عن الغضب لله صارف، وبه وصف الله أولياؤه إذ قال الذين يكلفون بحبي كما يكلف الصبي بالشيء ويأوون إلى ذكري كما يأوي النسر إلى وكره، ويغضبون لمحارمه كما يغضب النمر إذا حرد فإنه لا يبالي قل الناس أو كثروا، فانظر إلى هذا المثال فإن الصبي إذا كلف بالشيء لم يفارقه أصلاً، وإن أخذ منه لم يكن له شغل إلا البكاء والصياح حتى يرد إليه، فإن نام أخذه معه في ثيابه، فإذا انتبه عاد وتمسك به ومهما فارقه بكى ومهما وجده ضحك، ومن نازعه فيه أبغضه ومن أعطاه أحبه. وأما النمر فإنه لا يملك نفسه عند الغضب حتى يبلغ من شدة غضبه أنه يهلك نفسه. فهذه علامات المحبة، فمن تمت فيه هذه العلامات فقد تمت محبته وخلص حبه فصفا في الآخرة شرابه وعذب مشربه، ومن امتزج بحبه حب غير الله تنعم في الآخرة بقدر حبه، إذ يمزج شرابه بقدر من شراب المقربين كما قال تعالى في الأبرار: \"إن الأبرار لفي نعيم\" ثم قال: \"يسقون من رحيق مختوم مسك وفي ذلك فليتنافس المتنافسون ومزاجه من تسنيم عيناً يشرب بها المقربون\" فإذا طاب شراب الأبرار لشوب الشراب الصرف الذي هو للمقربين. والشراب عبارة عن جملة نعيم الجنان، كما أن الكتاب عبر به عن جميع الأعمال فقال: \"إن كتاب الأبرار لفي عليين\" ثم قال: \"يشهده المقربون\" فكان أمارة علة كتابهم أنه ارتفع إلى حيث يشهده المقربون، وكما أن الأبرار يجدون المزيد في حالهم ومعرفتهم بقربهم من المقربين ومشاهدتهم لهم، فكذلك يكون حالهم في الآخرة \"ما خلقكم ولا بعثكم إلا كنفس واحدة كما بدأنا أول خلق نعيده\"، وكما قال تعالى: \"جزاء وفاقاً\" أي وافق الجزاء أعمالهم فقوبل الخالص بالصرف من الشراب وقوبل المشوب بالمشوب، وشوب كل شراب على قدر ما سبق من الشوب في حبه وأعماله \"فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيراً يره ومن يعمل مثقال ذرة شراً يره - وإن الله لا يغير ما بقوم حتى يغيروا ما بأنفسهم - إن الله لا يظلم مثقال ذرة وإن تك حسنة يضاعفها - وإن كان مثقال حبة من خردل أتينا بها وكفى بنا حاسبين\" فمن كان حبه في الدنيا رجاءه لنعيم الجنة والحور العين</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 3: Wonders of the Heart</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>He created Paradise and created its people, then employed them in obedience, and He created Hell and created its people, then employed them in disobedience.

Indeed, the race is when fearing loss, and it is like two servants racing to serve their master; for each one grieves that his companion precedes him and attains with his master a status that he does not attain. How much more so when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ explicitly stated that, saying: \"There is no envy (Hasad) except in two: a man whom Allah has given wealth and empowered him to spend it in truth, and a man whom Allah, the Exalted, has given knowledge and he acts upon it and teaches it to the people.\" Then he explained that in the hadith of Abu Kabshah Al-Atmari, saying: \"The likeness of this nation is like four: a man whom Allah has given wealth and knowledge, so he acts upon his knowledge with his wealth; and a man whom Allah has given knowledge but has not given him wealth, so he says: 'O Lord, if I had wealth like the wealth of so-and-so, I would act in it with the like of his action' - so they are equal in reward. And this is from him a love to have the like of his wealth to act as he acts, without love for the removal of the blessing from him, he said - and a man whom Allah has given wealth but has not given him knowledge, so he spends it in disobedience to Allah; and a man whom He has not given knowledge and has not given him wealth, so he says: 'If I had the like of the wealth of so-and-so, I would spend it in the like of what he spends it in of disobedience' - so they are equal in sin.\" So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ censured him from the aspect of his wishing for disobedience, not from the aspect of his love to have from the blessing the like of what he has.
