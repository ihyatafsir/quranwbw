Then will come to you Munkar and Nakir, and they will make you sit and rebuke you. So if Allah is with you, then there is no despair, nor loneliness, nor need.

And the second perfection is to observe the meaning of truthfulness [sidq] in the words with which he converses with his Lord, like His saying, \"I have turned my face [wajh] to the One who created the heavens and the earth.\" For if his heart [qalb] is turned away from God, exalted is He, preoccupied with the hopes of this world [dunya] and its desires, then it is falsehood. And like his saying, \"You alone we worship,\" and his saying, \"I am the servant ['abd] of God.\" For if he is not characterized by the reality of servitude ['ubudiyya] and has a desire other than God, then his speech is not truthful. And if he were called to account on the Day of Resurrection for the truthfulness in his statement \"I am the servant of God,\" he would be incapable of verifying it. For if he is a servant to his own self [nafs], or a servant to this world, or a servant to his desires, then he is not truthful in his statement. And everything the servant binds himself to, he is a servant to it, as Jesus, peace be upon him, said, \"O servants of the world,\" and our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"Wretched is the servant of the world, wretched is the servant of the dirham, the servant of the garment, and the servant of the fine cloak.\" He named everyone whose heart is bound to something a servant to it. The true servant for God, mighty and majestic, is he who is first freed from other than God, exalted is He, and thus became absolutely free. When this freedom [hurriyya] precedes, the heart becomes empty, and servitude to God settles within it, occupying it with God and His love, and binding his inner and outer being to His obedience, so that he has no object of desire except God, exalted is He. Then he transcends this to another station, more sublime than it, called freedom [hurriyya], which is that he is also freed from desiring God *for himself*; rather, he is content with what God wills for him, be it drawing near or being distanced, so his will [irada] is annihilated in the will of God, exalted is He. This is a servant who was freed from other than God and became free, then returned and was freed from his own self and became free, and became lost to himself, existing for his Master and Lord. If he moves, he moves; if he is still, he is still; if He afflicts him, he is pleased. No room remains in him for seeking, searching, or objection. Rather, he is before God like the dead before the washer. This is the ultimate truthfulness [sidq] in servitude to God, exalted is He. So the true servant is he whose existence is for his Master, not for himself. And this is the station of the truthful ones [siddiqun]. As for freedom from other than God, it is the stations of the truthful ones [sadiqun], and after it, servitude to God, exalted is He, is realized. And before this, its possessor does not deserve to be called truthful [sadiq] nor truthful one [siddiq]. This, then, is the meaning of truthfulness in speech.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فالكمال الأول في اللفظ أن يحترز عن صريح اللفظ وعن المعاريض أيضا إلا عند الضرورة والكمال الثاني أن يراعي معنى الصدق في ألفاظه التى يناجي بها ربه كقوله (وجهت وجهي للذي فطر السموات والأرض) فإن قلبه إن كان منصرفا عن الله تعالى مشغولا بأماني الدنيا وشهواته فهو كذب وكقوله (إياك نعبد) وقوله (أنا عبد الله) فإنه إذا لم يتصف بحقيقة العبودية وكان له مطلب سوى الله لم يكن كلامه صدقا ولو طولب يوم القيامة بالصدق في قوله أنا عبد الله لعجز تحقيقه فإنه إن كان عبدا لنفسه أو عبدا لدنيا أو عبدا لشهواته لم يكن صادقا في قوله. وكل ما تقيد العبد به فهو عبد له كما قال عيسى عليه السلام يا عبيد الدنيا وقال نبينا صلى الله عليه وسلم (تعس عبد الدنيا وتعس عبد الدرهم وعبد الحلة وعبد الخميصة) فسمى كل من تقيد قلبه بشىء عبدا له وإنما العبد الحق لله عز وجل من أعتق أولا من غير الله تعالى فصار حرا مطلقا فإذا تقدمت هذه الحرية صار القلب فارغا فحلت فيه العبودية لله فتشغله بالله وبمحبته وتقيد باطنه وظاهره بطاعته فلا يكون له مراد إلا الله تعالى ثم تجاوز هذا إلى مقام آخر أسنى منه يسمى الحرية وهو أن يعتق أيضا عن إرادة الله له من حيث هو بل يقنع بما يريد الله له من تقريب أو إبعاد فتفنى إرادته في إرادة الله تعالى. وهذا عبد عتق عن غير الله فصار حرا ثم عاد وعتق عن نفسه فصار حرا وصار مفقودا لنفسه موجودا لسيده ومولاه إن حركة تحرك وإن سكنه سكن وإن ابتلاه رضي لم يبق فيه متسع لطلب والتماس واعتراض بل هو بين يدي الله كالميت بين يدي الغاسل وهذا منتهى الصدق في العبودية لله تعالى فالعبد الحق هو الذي وجوده لمولاه لا لنفسه وهذه درجة الصديقين. وأما الحرية عن غير الله فدرجات الصادقين وبعدها تتحقق العبودية لله تعالى وما قبل هذا فلا يستحق صاحبه أن يسمى صادقا ولا صديقا فهذا هو معنى الصدق في القول.</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"اهْدِنَا","d":"ih'dinā","e":"āَnِdْhٱ"},{"b":"0.68","h":"0.88","c":"الصِّرَاطَ","d":"l-ṣirāṭa","e":"َṭَٰrِّṣlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.8","c":"الْمُسْتَقِيمَ","d":"l-mus'taqīma","e":"َmyِqَtْsُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Guide us to the straight path -","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book2a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Disciplining the Soul</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, due to the difficulty of uprightness [istiqamah], it is incumbent upon every servant [abd] to call upon God, exalted is He, seventeen times each day in his saying, \"Guide us to the straight path [sirat al-mustaqim],\" since the recitation of the Opening [al-Fatihah] is incumbent in every unit of prayer [rak'ah].
