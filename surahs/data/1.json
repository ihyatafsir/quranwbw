Then the secrets will be laid bare, and the Fire will be kindled, and the Scales will be set up, and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forth, and He will judge between them with truth, and it will be said: \"All praise is to Allah, Lord of the worlds [al-Hamd li-Allahi Rabb al-'Alamin].\" So how many will be disgraced and how many concealed! And how many will be destroyed and how many saved! And how many will be punished and how many shown mercy! So, I wonder, what will be my state and your state on that day?

And the second perfection is to observe the meaning of truthfulness [sidq] in the words with which he converses with his Lord, like His saying, \"I have turned my face [wajh] to the One who created the heavens and the earth.\" For if his heart [qalb] is turned away from God, exalted is He, preoccupied with the hopes of this world [dunya] and its desires, then it is falsehood. And like his saying, \"You alone we worship,\" and his saying, \"I am the servant ['abd] of God.\" For if he is not characterized by the reality of servitude ['ubudiyya] and has a desire other than God, then his speech is not truthful. And if he were called to account on the Day of Resurrection for the truthfulness in his statement \"I am the servant of God,\" he would be incapable of verifying it. For if he is a servant to his own self [nafs], or a servant to this world, or a servant to his desires, then he is not truthful in his statement. And everything the servant binds himself to, he is a servant to it, as Jesus, peace be upon him, said, \"O servants of the world,\" and our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"Wretched is the servant of the world, wretched is the servant of the dirham, the servant of the garment, and the servant of the fine cloak.\" He named everyone whose heart is bound to something a servant to it. The true servant for God, mighty and majestic, is he who is first freed from other than God, exalted is He, and thus became absolutely free. When this freedom [hurriyya] precedes, the heart becomes empty, and servitude to God settles within it, occupying it with God and His love, and binding his inner and outer being to His obedience, so that he has no object of desire except God, exalted is He. Then he transcends this to another station, more sublime than it, called freedom [hurriyya], which is that he is also freed from desiring God *for himself*; rather, he is content with what God wills for him, be it drawing near or being distanced, so his will [irada] is annihilated in the will of God, exalted is He. This is a servant who was freed from other than God and became free, then returned and was freed from his own self and became free, and became lost to himself, existing for his Master and Lord. If he moves, he moves; if he is still, he is still; if He afflicts him, he is pleased. No room remains in him for seeking, searching, or objection. Rather, he is before God like the dead before the washer. This is the ultimate truthfulness [sidq] in servitude to God, exalted is He. So the true servant is he whose existence is for his Master, not for himself. And this is the station of the truthful ones [siddiqun]. As for freedom from other than God, it is the stations of the truthful ones [sadiqun], and after it, servitude to God, exalted is He, is realized. And before this, its possessor does not deserve to be called truthful [sadiq] nor truthful one [siddiq]. This, then, is the meaning of truthfulness in speech.</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"اهْدِنَا","d":"ih'dinā","e":"āَnِdْhٱ"},{"b":"0.68","h":"0.88","c":"الصِّرَاطَ","d":"l-ṣirāṭa","e":"َṭَٰrِّṣlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.8","c":"الْمُسْتَقِيمَ","d":"l-mus'taqīma","e":"َmyِqَtْsُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Guide us to the straight path -","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book2a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, due to the difficulty of uprightness [istiqamah], it is incumbent upon every servant [abd] to call upon God, exalted is He, seventeen times each day in his saying, \"Guide us to the straight path [sirat al-mustaqim],\" since the recitation of the Opening [al-Fatihah] is incumbent in every unit of prayer [rak'ah].
