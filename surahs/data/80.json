In its treatment are two stations: the first is the eradication of its root from its origin and the uprooting of its tree from its planting place in the heart [qalb].\n\nThe first station is in eradicating its root, and its treatment is both intellectual ['ilmi] and practical ['amali], and healing is not complete except by their combination.\n\nAs for the intellectual: it is that he knows himself and knows his Lord, the Exalted, and that suffices him in removing pride [kibr]. For whenever he knows himself with true knowledge [ma'rifa], he knows that he is more abased than every abased one and less than every insignificant one, and that nothing befits him except humility [tawadu'] and abasement and lowliness. And when he knows his Lord, he knows that grandeur ['azama] and majesty [kibriya'] are not fitting except for Allah.\n\nAs for his knowing himself, it is also lengthy, but we mention from it what is beneficial in arousing humility [tawadu'] and abasement. It suffices him to know the meaning of a single verse in the Book of Allah, for the Qur'an is the knowledge ['ilm] of the first and the last for one whose insight [basira] has been opened. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"Destroyed is man [insan]; how ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way [sabil] easy for him. Then He causes him to die and puts him in a grave. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" Indeed, the verse points to the first creation of man [insan]: he was not a thing mentioned, and he was in the realm of non-existence for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more vile and less than obliteration and non-existence? He was like that in pre-eternity.\n\nThen Allah created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust [turab], then from a sperm-drop [nutfa], then from a clinging clot ['alaqa], then from a lump of flesh [mudgha], then He made him bones, then He clothed the bones with flesh. This was the beginning of his existence when he became a thing mentioned. He did not become a thing mentioned except while being upon the vilest of descriptions and attributes! For he was not created complete at his beginning; rather, He created him an inanimate, dead thing—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance before his knowledge ['ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance before his guidance, and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power.\n\nThis is the meaning of His saying: \"From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa], a mixture [amshaj].\" And the meaning of His saying: \"Has there come upon man [insan] a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man [insan] from a sperm-drop [nutfa], a mixture [amshaj], to test him.\" Likewise, He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Then He made the way [sabil] easy for him.\" And this points to what was made easy for him during the period of his life until death.\n\nAnd likewise He said: \"From a sperm-drop [nutfa], a mixture [amshaj], to test him; so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way [sabil], whether he be grateful or ungrateful.\" Its meaning is that He gave him life after he was an inanimate, dead thing—dust [turab] first, then a sperm-drop [nutfa]. And He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and gave him sight after he was lacking vision, and strengthened him after weakness, and gave him knowledge ['ilm] after ignorance, and created for him the limbs with what is in them of wonders and signs after their absence, and enriched him after poverty, and satisfied him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him after misguidance.\n\nSo look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way [sabil] how He made it easy, and to the transgression of man [insan] how ungrateful he is, and to the ignorance of man [insan] how He made it manifest? So He said: \"Does man [insan] not consider that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfa], and at once he is a clear adversary? And of His signs is that He created you from dust [turab], then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.\"\n\nSo look.</div></div></div>"}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.32","c":"أَمَاتَهُ","d":"amātahu","e":"ۥُhَtāَmَaʾ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"2.75","c":"فَأَقْبَرَهُ","d":"fa-aqbarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَbْqَaʾَf"}],"a":{"g":"Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book 9a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Know that arrogance [kibr] is among the destructive traits, and no one among creation is free from some measure of it.

The second is repelling its incidental manifestations through the causes by which a person becomes arrogant over others.\n\nThe first station is in eradicating its root, and its treatment is both intellectual ['ilmi] and practical ['amali], and the cure is not complete except by their combination.\n\nAs for the intellectual: it is that he knows his own soul [nafs] and knows his Lord, the Exalted, and that suffices him in removing arrogance [kibr]. For whenever he knows his own soul [nafs] with true knowledge [ma'rifa], he knows that he is more abased than every abased one and less than every insignificant one, and that nothing befits him except humility [tawadu'] and abasement and lowliness. And when he knows his Lord, he knows that grandeur ['azama] and majesty [kibriya'] are not fitting except for Allah.\n\nAs for his knowledge [ma'rifa] of his Lord and His grandeur and His glory, speech on that is lengthy, and it is the ultimate knowledge [ma'rifa] of unveiling [mukashafa].\n\nAs for his knowledge [ma'rifa] of his own soul [nafs], it is also lengthy, but we mention from it what is beneficial in arousing humility [tawadu'] and abasement. It suffices him to know the meaning of a single verse in the Book of Allah, for the Qur'an is the knowledge ['ilm] of the former and the later peoples for whom his insight [basira] has been opened. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"Cursed is man; how disbelieving he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He causes him to die and puts him in a grave. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" (80:17-22)\n\nIndeed, the verse has pointed to the first creation of man: he was not a thing mentioned, and he was in the realm of non-existence for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more vile and less than obliteration and non-existence? He was like that in pre-eternity.

This was the beginning of his existence, when he became a thing mentioned. He did not become a thing mentioned except while being upon the vilest of descriptions and attributes! For he was not created in his beginning complete; rather, He created him as a lifeless, inanimate object [jamad]—he did not hear, nor see, nor feel, nor move, nor speak, nor grasp, nor perceive, nor know. He began with his death before his life, and with his weakness before his strength, and with his ignorance before his knowledge ['ilm], and with his blindness before his sight, and with his deafness before his hearing, and with his muteness before his speech, and with his misguidance before his guidance, and with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power.\n\nThis is the meaning of His saying: \"From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed?\" (80:18-19) and the meaning of His saying: \"Has there come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned? Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed that We may try him.\" (76:1-2) Likewise, He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying: \"Then He made the way easy for him.\" (80:20) And this is a reference to what was made easy for him during the period of his life until death. And likewise He said: \"From a sperm-drop [nutfa] mixed, We try him, so We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful.\" (76:2-3) And its meaning is that He gave him life after he was a lifeless, inanimate object [jamad], dead, dust first and a sperm-drop [nutfa] second. And He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and gave him sight after he was lacking vision, and strengthened him after weakness, and gave him knowledge ['ilm] after ignorance, and created for him the limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence, and enriched him after poverty, and satiated him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him after misguidance.\n\nSo look how He managed him and formed him, and to the way how He made it easy for him, and to the transgression of man, how disbelieving he is, and to the ignorance of man, how He has made it manifest? So He said: \"Does man not consider that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfa] and at once he is a clear adversary? And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.\" (36:77, 20) So look...</div></div></div>"}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.35","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"2.0","h":"2.14","c":"شَاءَ","d":"shāa","e":"َءٓāَhs"},{"b":"3.9","h":"3.99","c":"أَنْشَرَهُ","d":"ansharahu","e":"ۥُhَrَhsnَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j4 k08</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, do you then disbelieve in His saying, \"Then when He wills, He will resurrect you [ansharakum]\"?\n\nIf you are not a disbeliever, then why do you not take your precaution? If a Jew were to inform you, concerning the most delicious of your foods, that it would harm you in your illness, you would abstain from it and leave it, and you would struggle against your soul [nafs] concerning it. Was the saying of the Prophets, supported by miracles, and the saying of God Almighty in His revealed Books, of less impact upon you than the saying of a Jew who informs you based on conjecture [hads] and guesswork and assumption [zann], with deficient intellect and limited knowledge?\n\nAnd the wonder is that if a child were to inform you that there is a scorpion in your garment, you would cast your garment away immediately without demanding from him proof and evidence. Was the saying of the Prophets and the scholars and the wise and all the saints [awliya'] less to you than the saying of a child from among the foolish? Or has the fire of Hell [jahannam] and its shackles and its chains and its Zaqqum and its maces and its pus and its poisonous winds and its serpents and its scorpions become more contemptible to you than a scorpion whose pain you would not feel except for a day or less? What are these actions of the rational?\n\nNay, if your state were unveiled to the beasts, they would laugh at you and mock your intellect. If you, O soul [nafs], have come to know all of that and have believed in it, then why do you procrastinate in work, while death lies in wait for you, and perhaps it will snatch you without respite? With what have you felt secure from the hastening of the appointed term [ajal]? Suppose you were promised a respite of a hundred years—do you think that one who feeds his mount in the pit of the steep pass will succeed and be able to cross the pass with it? If you think that, then how great is your ignorance!\n\nConsider, if a man traveled to seek knowledge [tafaqquh] in a foreign land and remained there for years, idle and inactive, promising himself to seek knowledge in the final year upon his return to his homeland—would you not laugh at his intellect and his assumption that instructing the soul [tafqih al-nafs] is something one can aspire to in a short period? Or his reckoning that the stations of the learned are attained without seeking knowledge, relying on the generosity of God, Glorified and Exalted is He?\n\nThen suppose that striving at the end of one's life is beneficial and that it leads to the highest degrees [darajat]—perhaps today is the last of your life, so why are you not occupied with that? If it is whispered to you of respite, what prevents you from hastening, and what incites you to procrastination? Does it have any cause except your inability to oppose your appetites [shahawat] due to the toil and hardship in it? Do you await a day that will come to you in which opposing appetites is not difficult? This is a day God has never created, nor will He create it. For Paradise [al-jannah] will never be except surrounded by hardships, nor will the Fire...</div></div></div>"}},"23":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.95","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"0.85","h":"1.8","c":"لَمَّا","d":"lammā","e":"āَّmَl"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.07","c":"يَقْضِ","d":"yaqḍi","e":"ِḍْqَy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.91","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"5.0","h":"5.44","c":"أَمَرَهُ","d":"amarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَmَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"No!

And just as food, the more delicious its taste, the richer its fat, and the more apparent its sweetness, the more foul its waste and the stronger its stench, so too every desire in the heart that is more appetizing, more delightful, and stronger—its stench, its repulsiveness, and the harm from it at death is more severe. Nay, it is witnessed even in this world. For whoever has his home demolished, his wealth taken, and his children seized, his calamity, his pain, and his grief for everything he lost is according to the measure of his delight in it, his love for it, and his covetousness for it. Thus, everything that was, in its presence, more appetizing to him and more delightful, is, in its loss, more destructive and more bitter. And the meaning of death is nothing but the loss of what is in the world. And Allah, Mighty and Majestic, has said, \"So let man look to his food.\" Ibn Abbas said: to its waste.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, water and soil alone are not sufficient. For if the seed were left in damp, solid, compacted earth, it would not sprout due to the absence of air [al-hawa']. Thus, it requires being placed in loose, friable earth into which the air can penetrate. Yet the air does not move to it by itself; it requires a wind [rih] to move the air and drive it with force and violence against the earth so that it penetrates it. To this, the saying of the Almighty alludes: **\"And We send the fertilizing winds\"** [Qur'an 15:22]. Their fertilization [ilaqah] lies in effecting the coupling [al-izdiwaj] between the air, the water, and the earth.\n\nThen, all of that would not suffice you if it were in extreme cold and harsh winter. Thus, you need the heat of spring and summer. So it has become clear that its nourishment depends on these four elements.\n\nNow look at what each one requires. The water needs to flow to the farmland from the seas, springs, rivers, and canals. So look how Allah created the seas, made the springs gush forth, and caused rivers to flow from them. Then, the land may be elevated, and the waters do not rise to it. So look how Allah, the Exalted, created the clouds and how He subjected the winds to them to drive them, by His command, to the regions of the earth—they are heavy clouds, bearers of water. Then look how He sends it down as abundant rain upon the lands in the time of spring and autumn, according to need. And look how He created the mountains as reservoirs for the waters, from which springs gush forth gradually. Had they emerged all at once, the lands would have been flooded, and the crops and livestock would have perished. The blessings of Allah in the mountains, the clouds, the seas, and the rains cannot be enumerated.\n\nAs for the heat, it does not arise between the water and the earth, for both are cold. So look how He subjected the sun and how He created it, despite its distance from the earth, to heat the earth at one time and not another, so that cold occurs when cold is needed and heat when heat is needed. This is one of the wisdoms of the sun, and its wisdoms are too numerous to count.\n\nThen, when the plant rises from the earth, the fruits require firmness and solidity to form, so they are in need of a moisture to ripen them. So look how He created the moon and made from its specific property moisture [al-tartib], just as He made from the specific property of the sun heating [al-taskhin]. It ripens the fruits and colors them by the decree of the Creator, the All-Wise. For this reason, if trees were in a shade that prevented the rising of the sun, the moon, and the other stars upon them, they would be corrupt and deficient. Indeed, a small tree becomes corrupt if a large tree shades it. And you can know the moistening effect of the moon by exposing your head to it at night; moisture, expressed as a cold [al-zukam], will overcome your head. Just as it moistens your head, it also moistens the fruit.\n\nWe shall not prolong discussion of what cannot be fully comprehended. Rather, we say: Every celestial body [kawkab] in the sky has been subjected for a type of benefit, just as the sun was subjected for heating and the moon for moistening. Not one of them is devoid of many wisdoms which human strength cannot enumerate. Were it not so, their creation would be futile and vain, and the saying of the Almighty would not be valid: **\"Our Lord, You have not created this in vain\"** [Qur'an 3:191], and His saying, the Mighty and Majestic: **\"We did not create the heavens and the earth and that between them in play\"** [Qur'an 21:16].\n\nAnd just as there is no limb in your body except for a benefit, there is no limb in the body of the world except for a benefit. The entire world is like a single person, and its individual bodies are like limbs for it, cooperating just as the limbs of your body cooperate within your whole body. Elaborating on this would be lengthy.\n\nYou must not think that believing the stars, the sun, and the moon are subjected by the command of Allah, glorified be He, in matters made as causes [asbab] for them by the decree of Wisdom, contradicts the Sacred Law due to what is reported therein of the prohibition against believing the astrologers and against the science of the stars. Rather, what is prohibited regarding the stars is two matters:\n\nThe first is that you believe they are independent agents [fa'ilah] of their effects, acting independently, and that they are not subjected under the management of a Manager who created and overpowered them. This is disbelief [kufr].\n\nThe second is believing the astrologers in the details of what they inform about of effects which are not commonly perceived by all of creation, for they say that out of ignorance. Indeed, the knowledge of the decrees of the stars was a miracle for some of the Prophets, peace be upon them. Then that knowledge was effaced, and nothing remained except what is mixed, wherein truth cannot be distinguished from error.\n\nTherefore, believing the celestial bodies [al-kawakib] to be causes [asbab] for effects that occur by the creation of Allah, the Exalted, on the earth, in plants, and in animals, is not detrimental to the religion [din]; rather, it is truth. But claiming knowledge of those effects in detail while being ignorant is detrimental to the religion.\n\nFor this reason, if you have a garment you have washed and wish to dry it, and someone says to you, \"Take out the garment and spread it, for the sun has risen and the heat of the day is intense, and the air is still,\" you are not obliged to disbelieve him, nor are you obliged to deny him by attributing the heat of the air to the rising of the sun. And if you ask about a change in a person's face and he says, \"The sun struck me on the road, so my face darkened,\" you are not obliged to disbelieve him in that. Judge all other effects by this standard, except that some effects are known and some are unknown. It is not permissible to claim knowledge of the unknown. As for the known, some of it is known to all people, like the occurrence of light and heat with the rising of the sun, and some of it is known to some people, like the occurrence of a cold [al-zukam] with the rising of the moon.\n\nTherefore, the celestial bodies were not created in vain. Rather, within them are many wisdoms that cannot be counted.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, let the human [insan] reflect upon his food [ta'am]. We poured down water [ma'] in abundance, then We split the earth [ard] open, splitting, and caused to grow within it grain [habb], and vines [‘inab], and fresh herbage [qadb], and olive trees [zaytun], and date-palms [nakhil].\n\nThen the plant, when it rises from the earth, finds in the fruits a hardening and firmness, so it needs a moisture to ripen them. So look how He created the moon [qamar] and made from its specific property moistening, just as He made from the specific property of the sun [shams] heating. So it ripens the fruits and colors them by the decree of the Creator, the Wise [al-Fatir al-Hakim]. And for that reason, if the trees were in a shade preventing the rising of the sun and the moon and the rest of the stars upon them, they would be corrupt and deficient—to the point that a small tree is corrupted if a large tree shades it, and it is known...\n\nSo We say: Just as wood and soil do not nourish you, but rather you need a specific food, likewise the seed does not nourish itself with everything, but rather it needs a specific thing. The proof is that if you left it in a house, it would not increase because nothing surrounds it except air [hawa'], and mere air is not suitable for its nourishment. And if you left it in water, it would not increase. And if you left it in an earth containing no water, it would not increase. Rather, it must be in an earth containing water, so that its water mixes with the earth and becomes mud. And to this is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: \"Let the human reflect upon his food. We poured down water in abundance, then We split the earth open, splitting, and caused to grow within it grain, and vines, and fresh herbage, and olive trees, and date-palms\" — the verse.\n\nThen water and soil are not sufficient, for if you left it in a moist, solid, compacted earth, it would not sprout due to the absence of air. So it needs to be left in a loose, porous earth into which the air penetrates. Then the air does not move to it by itself, so it needs a wind [rih] that moves the air and strikes it with compulsion and violence upon the earth until it penetrates into it. And to this is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: \"And We sent the winds as pollinators\" [15:22]. And their pollination is only in effecting the coupling [izdiwaj] between the air and the water and the earth.\n\nThen all of that is of no avail to you if it is in extreme cold and harsh winter, so you need the heat of spring and summer. Thus, the need of its nourishment for these four has become clear. So look at what each one needs.\n\nFor the water needs to flow to the land of cultivation from the seas, springs, rivers, and streams. So look how Allah created the seas and made the springs gush forth and caused rivers to flow from them. Then the earth may be elevated, and the waters do not rise to it. So look how Allah, the Exalted, created the clouds and how He subjected the winds to them to drive them by His permission to the regions of the earth—and they are heavy clouds, carriers of water. Then look how He sends it down pouring upon the lands in the time of spring and autumn according to the need. And look how He created the mountains as preservers of the waters, from which the springs gush forth gradually. If they came out all at once, the lands would be flooded and the crops and livestock would perish. And the blessings of Allah in the mountains, the clouds, the seas, and the rains cannot be enumerated.\n\nAs for the heat, it is not obtained between the water and the earth, for both of them are cold. So look how He subjugated the sun and how He created it, despite its distance from the earth, to heat the earth at one time and not another, so that cold occurs when there is need for cold, and heat when there is need for heat. This is one of the wisdoms of the sun, and the wisdoms in it are more than can be enumerated.</div></div></div>"}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.25","c":"أَنَّا","d":"annā","e":"āَّnَaʾ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.64","c":"صَبَبْنَا","d":"ṣababnā","e":"āَnْbَbَṣ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.75","c":"الْمَاءَ","d":"l-māa","e":"َءٓāَmْlٱ"},{"b":"4.8","h":"5.78","c":"صَبًّا","d":"ṣabban","e":"āًّbَṣ"}],"a":{"g":"How We poured down water in torrents,","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, have you considered what you sow [tahroothoon]?
