Indeed, his first state and middle have become apparent to him, and if his end were to appear—and refuge is sought with Allah, the Exalted—perhaps he would choose to be a dog or a pig to become with the animals as dust and not be a human who hears an address or meets punishment. And if he is with Allah deserving of the Fire, then the pig is more noble than him and more pleasant and higher, since its beginning is dust and its end is dust, and it is removed from the accounting and the punishment. And the dog and the pig, the creation does not flee from them.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فينقطع قلبه فزعاً من هول هذا الخطاب قبل أن تنتشر الصحيفة ويشاهد ما فيها من مخازيه، فإذا شاهده قال \"يا ويلتنا ما لهذا الكتاب لا يغادر صغيرة ولا كبيرة إلا أحصاها\" فهذا آخر أمره وهو معنى قوله تعالى \"ثم إذا شاء أنشره\" فما لمن هذا حاله والتكبر والتعظم؟ بل ما له وللفرح في لحظة واحدة فضلاً عن البطر والأشر؟ فقد ظهره له أول حاله ووسطه ولو ظهر آخره والعياذ بالله تعالى ربما اختار أن يكون كلباً أو خنزيراً ليصير مع البهائم تراباً ولا يكون إنساناً يسمع خطاباً أو يلقى عذاباً، وإن كان عند الله مستحقاً للنار فالخنزير أشرف منه وأطيب وأرفع إذ أوله التراب وآخره التراب وهو بمعزل عن الحساب والعذاب، والكلب والخنزير لا يهرب منه الخلق.</div></div></div>"}},"23":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.95","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"āَّlَk"},{"b":"0.85","h":"1.8","c":"لَمَّا","d":"lammā","e":"āَّmَl"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.07","c":"يَقْضِ","d":"yaqḍi","e":"ِḍْqَy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.91","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"5.0","h":"5.44","c":"أَمَرَهُ","d":"amarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَmَaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"No!

So we say: Just as wood and soil do not nourish you, rather you need specific food, likewise the grain does not nourish itself with everything, rather it needs something specific, as evidence that if you leave it in the house, it does not increase because nothing surrounds it except air, and mere air is not suitable for its nourishment; and if you leave it in water, it does not increase; and if you leave it in land with no water in it, it does not increase. Rather, it must be in land with water that mixes its water with the land, becoming mud. And to this is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: 'Then let man look at his food: We poured down water in abundance, then We split the earth in fissures, and caused to grow therein grain, and grapes and fresh vegetation, and olives and date-palms' (Quran 80:24-29). Then water and soil are not sufficient, for if it is left in damp, solid, compacted land, it does not sprout due to lack of air, so it needs to be placed in loose, porous land where air penetrates to it. Then air does not move to it by itself, so it needs a wind that moves the air and strikes it with force and violence upon the land until it penetrates into it. And to this is the allusion in His saying, the Exalted: 'And We send the winds fertilizing' (Quran 15:22). And its fertilization is in effecting the coupling between air, water, and land. Then all of that does not benefit you if it is in excessive cold and harsh winter, so you need the heat of spring and summer. Thus, the need of its nourishment for these four has become clear. So look at what each one needs: water needs to flow to the land of cultivation from seas, springs, rivers, and canals. So look how Allah created the seas, gushed forth the springs, and made rivers flow from them. Then the land may be elevated, and waters do not rise to it, so look how Allah, the Exalted, created the clouds and how He subjected the winds to them to drive them by His permission to the regions of the earth, and they are heavy clouds bearing water. Then look how He sends it pouring down upon the lands in the time of spring and autumn according to the need. And look how He created the mountains as preservers of waters, from which springs gush forth gradually; if they came out all at once, they would flood.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ولسنا نطنب في ذكر آلات النبات في اجتذاب الغذاء إلى نفسه ولكن نشير إلى غذائه. فنقول: كما أن الخشب والتراب لا يغذيك بل تحتاج إلى طعام مخصوص فكذلك الحبة لا تغتذى بكل شىء بل تحتاج إلى شىء مخصوص بدليل أنك لو تركتها في البيت لم تزد لأنه ليس يحيط بها إلا هواء ومجرد الهواء لا يصلح لغذائها ولو تركنها في الماء لم تزد ولو تركنها في أرض لا ماء فيها لم تزد بل لا بد من أرض فيها ماء يمتزج ماؤها بالأرض فيصير طينا وإليه الإشارة بقوله تعالى: ﴿ فلينظر الإنسان إلى طعامه أنا صببنا الماء صبا ثم شققنا الأرض شقا فأنبتنا فيها حبا وعنبا وقضبا وزيتونا ونخلا ﴾ {} الآية ثم لا يكفى الماء والتراب إذ لو تركت في أرض ندية صلبة متراكمة لم تنبت لفقد الهواء فيحتاج إلى تركها في أرض رجوة متخلخلة يتغلغل الهواء إليها ثم الهواء لا يتحرك إليها بنفسه فيحتاج إلى ريح تحرك الهواء وتضربه بقهر وعنف على الأرض حتى ينفذ فيها وإليه الإشارة بقولة تعالى: ﴿ وأرسلنا الرياح لواقح ﴾ {} وإنما إلقاحها في إيقاع الازدواج بين الهواء والماء والأرض ثم كل ذلك لا يغنيك لو كان في برد مفرط وشتاء شات فتحتاج إلى حرارة الربيع والصيف فقد بان احتياج غذائه إلى هذه الأربعة فانظر إلى ماذا يحتاج كل واحد إذ يحتاج الماء لينساق إلى أرض الزراعة من البحار والعيون والأنهار والسواقى فانظر كيف خلق الله البحار وفجر العيون وأجرى منها الأنهار ثم الأرض ربما تكون مرتفعة والمياه لا ترتفع إليها فانظر كيف خلق الله تعالى الغيوم وكيف سلط الرياح عليها لتسوقها بإذنه إلى أقطار الأرض وهى سحب ثقال حوامل بالماء ثم انظر كيف يرسله مدرارا على الأراضى في وقت الربيع والخريف على حسب الحاجة وانظر كيف خلق الجبال حافظة للمياه تتفجر منها العيون تدريجا فلو خرجت دفعة لغر</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-6a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of the World</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And Al-Hasan said: I have seen them perfume it with spices and fragrance, then they throw it where you have seen.

So how can you rely on those who do not benefit you, and forget the blessings of the One who possesses your benefit, harm, death, and life?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ثم كيف يعجب بهم وأنهم سيفترقون عنه إذا مات فيدفن في قبره ذليلاً معيناً وحده لا يرافقه أهل ولا ولد ولا قريب ولا حميم ولا عشير، فيسلمونه إلى البلى والحيات والعقارب والديدان ولا يغنون عنه شيئاً وفي أحوج أوقاته إليهم، وكذلك يهربون منه يوم القيامة \"يوم يفر المرء من أخيه وأمه وأبيه وصاحبته وبنيه\" الآية. فأي خير فيمن يفارقك في أشد أحوالك ويهرب منك؟ وكيف تعجب به ولا ينفعك في القبر والقيامة وعلى الصراط إلى عملك وفضل الله تعالى؟ فكيف تتكل على من لا ينفعك، وتنسى نعم من يملك نفعك وضرك وموتك وحياتك.</div></div></div>"}},"35":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَأُمِّهِ","d":"wa-ummihi","e":"ۦِhِّmُaʾَw"},{"b":"2.3","h":"2.3","c":"وَأَبِيهِ","d":"wa-abīhi","e":"ِhyِbَaʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"And his mother and his father"}},"36":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"وَصَاحِبَتِهِ","d":"waṣāḥibatihi","e":"ۦِhِtَbِḥَٰṣَw"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.74","c":"وَبَنِيهِ","d":"wabanīhi","e":"ِhyِnَbَw"}],"a":{"g":"And his wife and his children,"}},"37":{"w":[{"b":"0.12","h":"0.25","c":"لِكُلِّ","d":"likulli","e":"ِّlُkِl"},{"b":"0.94","h":"1.6","c":"امْرِئٍ","d":"im'ri-in","e":"ٍyʾِrْmٱ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"3.11","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"ْmُhْnِّm"},{"b":"3.7","h":"4.19","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"4.9","h":"6.21","c":"شَأْنٌ","d":"shanun","e":"ٌnْaʾَhs"},{"b":"7.7","h":"9.01","c":"يُغْنِيهِ","d":"yugh'nīhi","e":"ِhyِnْغُy"}],"a":{"g":"For every man, that Day, will be a matter adequate for him."}},"38":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.76","c":"وُجُوهٌ","d":"wujūhun","e":"ٌhwُjgُw"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.61","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"4.2","h":"4.96","c":"مُسْفِرَةٌ","d":"mus'firatun","e":"ٌẗَrِfْsُّm"}],"a":{"g":"[Some] faces, that Day, will be bright -"}},"39":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.92","c":"ضَاحِكَةٌ","d":"ḍāḥikatun","e":"ٌẗَkِḥāَḍ"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.27","c":"مُسْتَبْشِرَةٌ","d":"mus'tabshiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِhsْbَtْsُّm"}],"a":{"g":"Laughing, rejoicing at good news."}},"40":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"وَوُجُوهٌ","d":"wawujūhun","e":"ٌhwُjgُwَw"},{"b":"2.2","h":"2.93","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"3.4","h":"4.61","c":"عَلَيْهَا","d":"ʿalayhā","e":"āَhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.31","c":"غَبَرَةٌ","d":"ghabaratun","e":"ٌẗَrَbَغ"}],"a":{"g":"And [other] faces, that Day, will have upon them dust."}},"41":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"تَرْهَقُهَا","d":"tarhaquhā","e":"āَhُqَhْrَt"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.32","c":"قَتَرَةٌ","d":"qataratun","e":"ٌẗَrَtَq"}],"a":{"g":"Blackness will cover them."}},"42":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"أُولَئِكَ","d":"ulāika","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾ"},{"b":"2.6","h":"2.67","c":"هُمُ","d":"humu","e":"ُmُh"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.3","c":"الْكَفَرَةُ","d":"l-kafaratu","e":"ُẗَrَfَkْlٱ"},{"b":"4.2","h":"4.98","c":"الْفَجَرَةُ","d":"l-fajaratu","e":"ُẗَrَjgَfْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Those are the disbelievers, the wicked ones."}}}
