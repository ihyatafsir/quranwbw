The narrations have encompassed its description, and we hope that God the Exalted grants us, in this world [al-dunya], knowledge of it, and in the Hereafter [al-akhira], the taste of it. For among its attributes is that whoever drinks from it will never thirst again.\n\nAnas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, dozed off briefly, then raised his head smiling. They said to him, \"O Messenger of God, why are you smiling?\" He said, \"A verse was just revealed to me,\" and he recited: \"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 'Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar...'\" until he finished it. Then he said, \"Do you know what al-Kawthar is?\" They said, \"God and His Messenger know best.\" He said, \"It is a river my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, has promised me in Paradise. Upon it is abundant good. Upon it is a Fountain where my community will come to drink on the Day of Resurrection. Its vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky.\"\n\nAnd Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, \"While I was walking in Paradise, I came upon a river whose banks were domes of hollowed pearl. I said, 'What is this, O Gabriel?' He said, 'This is al-Kawthar which your Lord has given you.' Then the angel struck it with his hand, and its clay was fragrant musk.\"\n\nAnd Ibn 'Umar narrated that when the verse was revealed: \"Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar,\" the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, \"It is a river in Paradise. Its banks are of gold. Its drink is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, and more fragrant than musk. It flows over pebbles of pearl and coral.\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>آية أنزلت آنفا وقرأ بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم ﴿ إنا أعطيناك الكوثر ﴾ حتى ختمها ثم قال هل تدرون ما الكوثر؟ قالوا: الله ورسوله أعلم قال إنه نهر وعدنيه ربى عز وجل فى الجنة عليه خير كثير عليه حوض ترد عليه أمتى يوم القيامة آنيته عدد نجوم السماء</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"فَصَلِّ","d":"faṣalli","e":"ِّlَṣَf"},{"b":"0.92","h":"1.34","c":"لِرَبِّكَ","d":"lirabbika","e":"َkِّbَrِl"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.19","c":"وَانْحَرْ","d":"wa-in'ḥar","e":"ْrَḥْnٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"So pray to your Lord and sacrifice [to Him alone]."}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.4","c":"شَانِئَكَ","d":"shāni-aka","e":"َkَyʾِnāَhs"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.23","c":"هُوَ","d":"huwa","e":"َwُh"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.07","c":"الْأَبْتَرُ","d":"l-abtaru","e":"ُrَtْbَaʾْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off."}}}
