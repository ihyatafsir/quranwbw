The first: that he may experience its pleasure [ladhdha] and thereby analogize the pleasures of the Hereafter [al-akhira]. For if the pleasure of intercourse were to last, it would be the strongest of bodily pleasures, just as fire and its pains are the greatest of bodily pains. Encouragement [al-targhib] and warning [al-tarhib] drive people to their felicity [sa'ada], and that is only through a tangible pain and a tangible, perceptible pleasure. For what is not perceived by taste [dhawq] does not inspire a great longing [shawq] for it. The second benefit: the continuation of progeny and the permanence of existence; this is its benefit.\n\nBut within it are harms [afat] that destroy religion [din] and this world [al-dunya] if it is not restrained, not subdued, and not returned to the limit of moderation [i'tidal].\n\nIt has been said in the interpretation of His saying, the Most High, \"And from the evil of the darkening night when it descends\" [Surah Al-Falaq 113:3], it was said: It is the rising of the male organ [qiyam al-dhakar]. Some narrators attributed it to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, except that he said in its interpretation: \"The male organ [al-dhakar] when it enters.\" And it has been said: \"When a man's male organ [dhakar] rises, two-thirds of his intellect ['aql] depart.\"\n\nAnd he, peace be upon him, would say in his supplication: \"O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing, my sight, my heart [qalb], my tongue [lisani], and my semen [mani].\" And he, upon him be peace, said: \"Women are the snares of Satan [huba'il al-shaytan], and were it not for this desire [shahwa], women would have no dominion [sultana] over men.\"\n\nIt is narrated that Moses, peace be upon him, was sitting in one of his gatherings when Iblis approached him wearing a cloak [burnus] of shifting colors. When he drew near, he removed the cloak and placed it down, then came to him and said: \"Peace be upon you, O Moses.\" Moses said to him: \"Who are you?\" He said: \"I am Iblis.\" He said: \"May Allah not grant you life, what brings you?\" He said: \"I have come to greet you for your station with Allah and your place with Him.\" He said: \"Then what is that which I saw upon you?\" He said: \"A cloak [burnus] with which I snatch the hearts [qulub] of the children of Adam.\" He said: \"Then what is it that, if a person does it, you gain mastery over him?\" He said: \"If he is pleased with himself [a'jabat-hu nafsuhu], considers his deeds many [istakthara 'amaluhu], and forgets his sins [nasiya dhunubahu].\" And I warn you against three things: Do not be alone [la takhlu] with a woman who is not lawful [la tahillu] for you, for whenever a man is alone with a woman who is not lawful for him, I am his companion to the exclusion of my companions until I tempt him with her and tempt her with him. And do not make a covenant ['ahd] with Allah except that you fulfill it. And do not take out a charity [sadaqa] except that you complete it, for whenever a man takes out a charity and does not complete it, I am his companion to the exclusion of my companions until I come between him and fulfilling it.\" Then he turned away, saying: \"Moses has learned what he warns the children of Adam with.\"\n\nAnd from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, he said: \"Allah did not send a prophet in the past except that Iblis did not despair of destroying him through women, and there is nothing I fear more than them. And there is no house in Medina I enter except my house and my daughter's house, where I perform the ritual bath [ghusl] on Friday and then go.\"\n\nAnd some of them said: Indeed, Satan [al-shaytan] says to the woman: \"You are half of my army [jundi], and you are my arrow [sahmi] with which I shoot and do not miss, and you are the place of my secret [sirri], and you are my messenger [rasuli] for my needs.\" So half his army is desire [al-shahwa] and half his army is anger [al-ghadab]. And the greatest of desires is the desire for women [shahwat al-nisa'].\n\nAnd this desire [shahwa] also has excess [ifrat], deficiency [tafrit], and moderation [i'tidal]. The excess [al-ifrat]: is what overpowers the intellect ['aql] until it diverts the aspiration [himma] of men to seeking enjoyment [al-istimta'] with women and slave-girls.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد قيل في تأويل قوله تعالى \"ومن شر غاسق إذا وقب\" قال: هو قيام الذكر. وقد أسنده بعض الرواة إلى رسول الله ﷺ إلا أنه قال في تفسيره: الذكر إذا دخل. وقد قيل: إذا قام ذكر الرجل ذهب ثلثا عقله.</div></div></div>"}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.41","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"nِmَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.64","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.87","c":"النَّفَّاثَاتِ","d":"l-nafāthāti","e":"ِtَٰhtَّٰfَّnlٱ"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.45","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.87","c":"الْعُقَدِ","d":"l-ʿuqadi","e":"ِdَqُʿعْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And from the evil of the blowers in knots"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.34","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"nِmَw"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.63","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.68","c":"حَاسِدٍ","d":"ḥāsidin","e":"ٍdِsāَḥ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.73","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.9","c":"حَسَدَ","d":"ḥasada","e":"َdَsَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And from the evil of an envier when he envies.\""}}}
