And from the nobility of time is that which is between the rising of dawn [subh] and the rising of the sun, for it is the time of the gathering of night's shadow by the spreading of the sun's light [nur]. Its merit is indicated by God the Exalted's swearing by it in His saying: \"And by the dawn [subh] when it breathes\" (81:18), and His praising it in His saying: \"The Cleaver of the dawn [isbah]\" (6:96), and His manifesting power within it in His saying: \"Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal\" (25:46), and His guiding to glorification [tasbih] within it in His saying: \"So glorify [sabbih] God when you reach evening and when you rise at morn\" (30:17), and in His saying: \"So glorify [sabbih] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting\" (50:39), and His saying: \"And glorify [sabbih] Him during parts of the night and at the ends of the day, that you may be content\" (20:130), and His saying: \"And remember [udhkur] the Name of your Lord morning [bukratan] and evening\" (76:25). And within this context comes the command to seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak [rabb al-falaq] in His saying, the Exalted: \"Say, 'I seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak [rabb al-falaq]'\" (113:1), so that the servant may know that seeking refuge with God in this noble time opens for him the gates of nearness [qurb], and fortifies him from the darknesses of heedlessness [ghaflah]. For the Lord of the Daybreak [rabb al-falaq] is the Disperser of darkness [zulam] and the Illuminator of the morning [sabah]. So just as the dawn [subh] cleaves the darkness [zulmah] of the night, this seeking refuge cleaves the darkness [zulmah] of the heart [qalb], occupying it with remembrance [dhikr] and obedience [ta'ah]. Thus, the first litany [al-ward al-awwal] of the day's litanies [awrad] becomes a trade for the Abode of the Hereafter [dar al-akhirah], and a path [sabil] to the pleasure [rida] of the Generous Lord.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الطريق إلى الله تعالى مراقبة الأوقات وعمارتها بالأوراد على سبيل الدوام، فمن شرف الوقت ما بين طلوع الصبح إلى طلوع الشمس، إذ هو وقت قبض ظل الليل ببسط نور الشمس، ويدل على فضله إقسام الله تعالى به في قوله: ﴿ والصبح إذا تنفس ﴾، وتمدحه بقوله: ﴿ فالق الإصباح ﴾، وأظهر القدرة فيه بقوله: ﴿ ثم قبضناه إلينا قبضا يسيرا ﴾، وأرشد إلى التسبيح فيه بقوله: ﴿ فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون ﴾، وبقوله: ﴿ فسبح بحمد ربك قبل طلوع الشمس وقبل غروبها ﴾، وقوله: ﴿ ومن آناء الليل فسبح وأطراف النهار لعلك ترضى ﴾، وقوله: ﴿ واذكر اسم ربك بكرة وأصيلا ﴾. وفي هذا السياق يأتي الأمر بالاستعاذة برب الفلق في قوله تعالى: ﴿ قل أعوذ برب الفلق ﴾، ليعلم العبد أن الاستعاذة بالله في هذا الوقت الشريف تفتح له أبواب القرب، وتحصنه من ظلمات الغفلة، فرب الفلق هو مبدد الظلام ومنير الصباح، فكما يفلق الصبح ظلمة الليل، تفلق هذه الاستعاذة ظلمة القلب، فتشغله بالذكر والطاعة، فيكون الورد الأول من أوراد النهار تجارة للدار الآخرة، وسبيلاً إلى رضا الرب الكريم.</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.37","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"2.0","h":"2.66","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.42","c":"خَلَقَ","d":"khalaqa","e":"َqَlَhk"}],"a":{"g":"From the evil of that which He created"}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.06","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"nِmَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.33","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.52","c":"غَاسِقٍ","d":"ghāsiqin","e":"ٍqِsāَغ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.63","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.84","c":"وَقَبَ","d":"waqaba","e":"َbَqَw"}],"a":{"g":"And from the evil of darkness when it settles","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>j2 k02</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Know that the desire for intercourse [shahwat al-wiqa'] has been given dominion over man for two benefits.

And there is no house in Medina I enter except my house and my daughter's house, where I perform the ritual bath [ghusl] on Friday and then go.\"\n\nAnd some of them said: Indeed, Satan [al-shaytan] says to the woman: \"You are half of my army [jundi], and you are my arrow [sahmi] with which I shoot and do not miss, and you are the place of my secret [sirri], and you are my messenger [rasuli] for my needs.\" So half his army is desire [al-shahwa] and half his army is anger [al-ghadab]. And the greatest of desires is the desire for women [shahwat al-nisa'].\n\nAnd this desire [shahwa] also has excess [ifrat], deficiency [tafrit], and moderation [i'tidal]. The excess [al-ifrat]: is what overpowers the intellect ['aql] until it diverts the aspiration [himma] of men to seeking enjoyment [al-istimta'] with women and slave-girls.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن شهوة الوقاع سلطت على الإنسان لفائدتين؛ إحداهما: أن يدرك لذته فيقيس به لذات الآخرة. فإن لذة الوقاع لو دامت لكانت أقوى لذات الأجساد، كما أن النار وآلامها أعظم آلام الجسد. والترغيب والترهيب يسوق الناس إلى سعادتهم وليس ذلك إلا بألم محسوس ولذة محسوسة مدركة، فإن ما لا يدرك بالذوق لا يعظم إليه الشوق. الفائدة الثانية: بقاء النسل ودوام الوجود فهذه فائدتها. ولكن فيها من الآفات ما يهلك الدين والدنيا إن لم تضبط ولم تقهر ولم ترد إلى حد الاعتدال. وقد قيل في تأويل قوله تعالى \"ومن شر غاسق إذا وقب\" قال: هو قيام الذكر. وقد أسنده بعض الرواة إلى رسول الله ﭬ إلا أنه قال في تفسيره: الذكر إذا دخل. وقد قيل: إذا قام ذكر الرجل ذهب ثلثا عقله\"[55]. وكان ﭬ يقول في دعائه \"اللهم إني أعوذ بك من شر سمعي وبصري وقلبي وهني ومني\"[56] وقال عليه السلام \"النساء حبائل الشيطان ولولا هذه الشهوة لما كان للنساء سلطنة على الرجال\"[57]. روي أن موسى عليه السلام كان جالساً في بعض مجالسه إذا أقبل إليه إبليس وعليه برنس يتلون فيه ألواناً؛ فلما دنا منه خلع البرنس فوضعه، ثم أتاه فقال: السلام عليك يا موسى، فقال له موسى من أنت؟ فقال: أنا إبليس، فقال: لا حياك الله ما جاء بك؟ قال: جئت أسلم عليك لمنزلتك من الله ومكانتك منه، قال: فما الذي رأيت عليك؟ قال: برنس أختطف به قلوب بني آدم قال: فما الذي إذا صنعه الإنسان استحوذت عليه قال: إذا أعجبته نفسه واستكثر عمله ونسي ذنوبه، وأحذرك ثلاثاً: لا تخل بامرأة لا تحل لك فإن ما خلا رجل بامرأة لا تحل له إلا كنت صاحبه دون أصحابي حتى أفتنه بها وأفتنها به، ولا تعاهد الله عهداً إلا وفيت به، ولا تخرجن صدقة إلا أمضيتها فإنه ما أخرج رجل صدقة فلم يمضها إلا كنت صاحبه دون أصحابي حتى أحول بينه وبين الوفاء بها. ثم ولى وهو يقول: علم موسى ما يحذر به بني آدم. وعن سعيد بن المسيب قال: ما بعث الله نبياً فيما خلا إلا لم ييأس إبليس أن يهلكه بالنساء ولا شيء أخوف عندي منهن، وما بالمدينة بيت أدخله إلا بيتي وبيت ابنتي أغتسل فيه يوم الجمعة ثم أروح. وقال بعضهم: إن الشيطان يقول للمرأة أنت نصف جندي وأنت سهمي الذي أرمي به فلا أخطئ، وأنت موضع سري وأنت رسولي في حاجتي. فنصف جنده الشهوة ونصف جنده الغضب. وأعظم الشهوات شهوة النساء. وهذه الشهوة أيضاً لها إفراط وتفريط واعتدال، فالإفراط: ما يقهر العقل حتى يصرف همة الرجال إلى الاستمتاع بالنساء والجواري،</div></div></div>"}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.41","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"nِmَw"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.64","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.87","c":"النَّفَّاثَاتِ","d":"l-nafāthāti","e":"ِtَٰhtَّٰfَّnlٱ"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.45","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.87","c":"الْعُقَدِ","d":"l-ʿuqadi","e":"ِdَqُʿعْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And from the evil of the blowers in knots"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.34","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"nِmَw"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.63","c":"شَرِّ","d":"sharri","e":"ِّrَhs"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.68","c":"حَاسِدٍ","d":"ḥāsidin","e":"ٍdِsāَḥ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.73","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.9","c":"حَسَدَ","d":"ḥasada","e":"َdَsَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And from the evil of an envier when he envies.\""}}}
