So the Messenger of God ﷺ disciplined himself in what he would inform of, whether it was known or doubted, until he ﷺ said when he entered the graveyards: \"Peace be upon you, O abode of a believing people, and we, if God wills [in shā’a Allāh], will surely join you.\" And joining them is not a matter of doubt, but the requirement of discipline [adab] is the mention of God the Exalted and the linking of all matters to Him. And this phrase indicates that, until it became, by customary usage, an expression for showing desire [raghba] and hope [tamannī]. So if it is said to you that so-and-so will die soon, and you say, \"If God wills [in shā’a Allāh],\" it is understood from it your desire, not your doubt. And if it is said to you that so-and-so's illness will depart and he will recover, and you say, \"If God wills [in shā’a Allāh],\" with the meaning of desire, then the word has shifted from the meaning of doubt to the meaning of desire. And likewise is the shift to the meaning of discipline [adab] for the mention of God the Exalted, however the matter may be.</div></div></div>"}},"24":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.04","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"2.0","h":"2.34","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"َءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.74","c":"يَشَاءَ","d":"yashāa","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"5.7","h":"5.98","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"rُkْhdٱَw"},{"b":"8.1","h":"10.18","c":"وَاذْكُرْ","d":"wa-udh'kur","e":"َkَّbَّr"},{"b":"8.9","h":"11.48","c":"رَبَّكَ","d":"rabbaka","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"9.8","h":"12.86","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"َtyِsَn"},{"b":"10.4","h":"14.01","c":"نَسِيتَ","d":"nasīta","e":"ْlُqَw"},{"b":"11.3","h":"17.46","c":"وَقُلْ","d":"waqul","e":"ٰٓàَsَʿع"},{"b":"11.8","h":"18.28","c":"عَسَى","d":"ʿasā","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"12.2","h":"20.39","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"ِnَyِdْhَy"},{"b":"14.9","h":"21.63","c":"يَهْدِيَنِ","d":"yahdiyani","e":"àِّbَr"},{"b":"15.8","h":"23.22","c":"رَبِّي","d":"rabbī","e":"َbَrْqَaʾِl"},{"b":"16.8","h":"24.8","c":"لِأَقْرَبَ","d":"li-aqraba","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"17.8","h":"26.41","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"āَhdَٰh"},{"b":"18.4","h":"27.07","c":"هَذَا","d":"hādhā","e":"āًdَhsَr"},{"b":"18.8","h":"28.72","c":"رَشَدًا","d":"rashadan","e":"۟āwُhtِbَlَw"}],"a":{"g":"Except [when adding], \"If Allah wills.\" And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct.\""}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.17","c":"وَلَبِثُوا","d":"walabithū","e":"àِf"},{"b":"0.97","h":"1.68","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ْmِhِfْhَk"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.44","c":"كَهْفِهِمْ","d":"kahfihim","e":"َhtَٰlَht"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.12","c":"ثَلَاثَ","d":"thalātha","e":"ٍẗَyʾ۟āِm"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.63","c":"مِائَةٍ","d":"mi-atin","e":"َnyِnِs"},{"b":"4.8","h":"7.36","c":"سِنِينَ","d":"sinīna","e":"۟āwُdāَdْzٱَw"},{"b":"5.7","h":"8.8","c":"وَازْدَادُوا","d":"wa-iz'dādū","e":"āًʿعْsِt"},{"b":"6.9","h":"10.89","c":"تِسْعًا","d":"tis'ʿan","e":"ِlُq"}],"a":{"g":"And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine."}},"26":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.07","c":"قُلِ","d":"quli","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"0.36","h":"0.54","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُmَlْʿعَaʾ"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.87","c":"أَعْلَمُ","d":"aʿlamu","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.21","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"۟āwُhtِbَl"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.37","c":"لَبِثُوا","d":"labithū","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"3.9","h":"6.8","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ُbْyَغ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"7.9","c":"غَيْبُ","d":"ghaybu","e":"ِtَٰwَٰmَّslٱ"},{"b":"5.1","h":"8.9","c":"السَّمَاوَاتِ","d":"l-samāwāti","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"6.6","h":"11.59","c":"وَالْأَرْضِ","d":"wal-arḍi","e":"ْrِṣْbَaʾ"},{"b":"8.1","h":"14.65","c":"أَبْصِرْ","d":"abṣir","e":"ۦِhِb"},{"b":"8.8","h":"15.88","c":"بِهِ","d":"bihi","e":"ْʿعِmْsَaʾَw"},{"b":"9.5","h":"17.06","c":"وَأَسْمِعْ","d":"wa-asmiʿ","e":"āَm"},{"b":"11.","h":"20.04","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"mُhَl"},{"b":"11.5","h":"20.77","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"nِّm"},{"b":"13.0","h":"22.29","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۦِhِnwُd"},{"b":"13.8","h":"23.39","c":"دُونِهِ","d":"dūnihi","e":"nِm"},{"b":"14.9","h":"25.23","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ٍّàِlَw"},{"b":"15.9","h":"26.44","c":"وَلِيٍّ","d":"waliyyin","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"17.","h":"28.32","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"ُkِrْhsُy"},{"b":"18.0","h":"29.38","c":"يُشْرِكُ","d":"yush'riku","e":"àِf"},{"b":"18.9","h":"30.79","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٓۦِhِmْkُḥ"},{"b":"19.","h":"31.56","c":"حُكْمِهِ","d":"ḥuk'mihi","e":"āًdَḥَaʾ"},{"b":"22.1","h":"34.13","c":"أَحَدًا","d":"aḥadan","e":"ُlْtٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"Allah is most knowing of how long they remained.

As for the sinner, if he repents and recovers all that he has neglected from shortcomings, he is worthy of hoping for the acceptance of repentance. And as for before repentance, if he is averse to the sin—the evil deed displeases him and the good deed pleases him—and he censures himself and blames it, and he desires repentance and yearns for it, then he is worthy of hoping from Allah for the enabling to repent, because his aversion to the sin and his eagerness for repentance runs in the manner of a cause [sabab] which may lead to repentance. As for hope [raja'] after the causes are firmly established, and for that reason Allah the Exalted said: \"Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and striven in the cause of Allah - those hope for the mercy of Allah.\" Its meaning is: those deserve to hope for the mercy of Allah.

So they busied themselves with calling creation to the True Kingdom [al-mulk al-haqiqi] over the metaphorical kingdom [al-mulk al-majazi] which has no reality if it is safe, and no permanence at all. So they called out among them: **\"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah you cling heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya] rather than the Hereafter [al-akhirah]? But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a little.\"** (18:45)\n\nThus, the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Criterion [al-Furqan], the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham, and every revealed Book was sent for nothing but to call creation to the Everlasting, Eternal Kingdom. And what is intended for them is that they be kings in this world [al-dunya] and kings in the Hereafter [al-akhirah]. As for kingship in this world, it is through asceticism [zuhd] in it and contentment with the little of it. And as for kingship in the Hereafter, it is through proximity to Allah, the Exalted, attained by an everlasting life [baqa'] in which there is no annihilation, and a might ['izz] in which there is no humiliation, and a coolness of the eye [qurrat 'ayn] concealed in this world which no soul [nafs] among souls knows.\n\nAnd Satan calls them to kingship in this world, knowing that the kingship of the Hereafter is lost by it, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives. And knowing that this world will not be safe for him either, for even if it were safe for him, he would envy it also. But kingship in this world is not free from disputes, disturbances, the length of anxieties in management, and likewise all the causes of status [jah]. Then, however much one secures it and the causes are perfected, the lifespan ends: **\"Until, when the earth has taken on its ornaments and is adorned and its people think that they have complete power over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished the day before.\"** (10:24)\n\nSo Allah, the Exalted, struck a parable for it, saying, the Exalted: **\"And present to them the example of the life of this world as [like] water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds.\"** (18:45)\n\nAnd asceticism [zuhd] in this world, since it is a present kingship, Satan envied it and turned them away from it. And the meaning of asceticism is that the servant [al-'abd] masters his passion [shahwah] and his anger [ghadab], so they become subservient to the motive of religion [din] and the indication of faith [iman]. This is a kingship by right [istihqaq], for by it its possessor becomes free, and by the domination of passion over him he becomes a slave to his private parts, his stomach, and all his other desires, thus being driven like a beast, owned, with the reins of passion pulling him, taking him by his throat to where it wills and desires.\n\nSo how great is the deception [ghurur] of man when he thinks he attains kingship by becoming owned, and attains lordship [rububiyyah] by becoming a slave! Can such a thing be except inverted in this world and overturned in the Hereafter? For this reason, a certain king said to a certain ascetic: \"Do you have a need?\" He said: \"How can I ask you for a need when my kingdom is greater than your kingdom?\" He said: \"How?\" He said: \"Whoever you are a slave to is my slave.\" He said: \"How is that?\" He said: \"You are a slave to your passion, your anger, your private parts, and your stomach, and I have mastered all of these, so they are my slaves.\" This, then, is the kingship in this world, and it is what leads to kingship in the Hereafter.\n\nSo those deceived by the delusion [ghurur] of Satan have lost this world and the Hereafter together. And those who were granted success in holding fast to the Straight Path have won this world and the Hereafter together. So if you now know the meaning of kingship and lordship, and the meaning of subjugation and servitude ['ubudiyyah], and the point of error in that, and the manner of Satan's blinding and his deception, it will become easy for you to turn away from kingship and status, and to turn your back upon it, and to be patient when it is lost, for by abandoning it you become a king in the present, and by it you hope for a kingdom in the Hereafter.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, when the cunning [makr] of Satan spread among all creation, Allah sent the angels to the messengers and they revealed to them what had befallen creation from the destruction and misguidance of the enemy. So they busied themselves with calling creation to the True Kingdom [al-mulk al-haqiqi] over the metaphorical kingdom [al-mulk al-majazi] which has no reality if it is safe, and no permanence at all. So they called out among them: **\"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah you cling heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya] rather than the Hereafter [al-akhirah]? But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a little.\"** (18:45)\n\nThus, the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Criterion [al-Furqan], the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham, and every revealed Book was sent for nothing but to call creation to the Everlasting, Eternal Kingdom. And what is intended for them is that they be kings in this world [al-dunya] and kings in the Hereafter [al-akhirah]. As for kingship in this world, it is through asceticism [zuhd] in it and contentment with the little of it. And as for kingship in the Hereafter, it is through proximity to Allah, the Exalted, attained by an everlasting life [baqa'] in which there is no annihilation, and a might ['izz] in which there is no humiliation, and a coolness of the eye [qurrat 'ayn] concealed in this world which no soul [nafs] among souls knows.\n\nAnd Satan calls them to kingship in this world, knowing that the kingship of the Hereafter is lost by it, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives. And knowing that this world will not be safe for him either, for even if it were safe for him, he would envy it also. But kingship in this world is not free from disputes, disturbances, the length of anxieties in management, and likewise all the causes of status [jah]. Then, however much one secures it and the causes are perfected, the lifespan ends: **\"Until, when the earth has taken on its ornaments and is adorned and its people think that they have complete power over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished the day before.\"** (10:24)\n\nSo Allah, the Exalted, struck a parable for it, saying, the Exalted: **\"And present to them the example of the life of this world as [like] water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds.\"** (18:45)\n\nAnd asceticism [zuhd] in this world, since it is a present kingship, Satan envied it and turned them away from it. And the meaning of asceticism is that the servant [al-'abd] masters his passion [shahwah] and his anger [ghadab], so they become subservient to the motive of religion [din] and the indication of faith [iman].
