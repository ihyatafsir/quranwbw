And what falls within the boundaries (hudud) falls within the prohibition by the ruling of the kind (jins), just as the original meaning entered in the original totality. This is one example of its hidden ruling from the ruling of the two currencies. Therefore, one should consider gratitude (shukr) for the blessing (ni'mah) and ingratitude (kufran) with this example, for everything created for a wisdom (hikmah) should be directed away from it, and none knows this except one who has known the wisdom (hikmah) - 'And whoever is given wisdom (hikmah) has been given much good' - but the jewels of wisdom (hikmah) do not encounter hearts (qulub) that are dunghills of desires (shahawat) and playgrounds of devils (shayatin); rather, none remember except those of understanding (ulu al-albab). And therefore, He said: 'Were it not that the devils (shayatin) hover around the hearts (qulub) of the children of Adam, they would look at the dominion (malakut) of the heavens.' And when you have known this example, then measure against it your movement and stillness, your speech and silence, and every action issuing from you, for it is either gratitude (shukr) or ingratitude (kufr), as it is inconceivable to be free from them. And some of that is described in the language of jurisprudence (fiqh) that the common people speak with as disliked (makruh) and some as dangerous (khatr), and all of that is described as dangerous (khatr) by the possessors of hearts (arbab al-qulub).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ولذلك قال الله تعالى: ﴿ ومن يتعد حدود الله فقد ظلم نفسه ﴾ {} ولأن أصول هذه المعانى لا تختلف فيها الشرائع وإنما تختلف في وجوه التحديد كما يحد شرع عيسى ابن مريم عليه السلام تحريم الخمر بالسكر وقد حده شرعنا بكونه من جنس المسكر لأن قليله يدعو إلى كثير والداخل في الحدود داخل في التحريم بحكم الجنس كما دخل أصل المعنى بالجملة الأصلية فهذا مثال واحد لحكمه خفية من حكم النقدين فينبغى أن يعتبر شكر النعمة وكفرانها بهذا المثال فكل ما خلق لحكمة فينبغى أن يصرف عنها ولا يعرف هذا إلا من قد عرف الحكمة - ومن يؤت الحكمة فقد أوتي خيرا كثيرا - ولكن لا تصادف جواهر الحكم في قلوب هى مزابل الشهوات وملاعب الشياطين بل لا يتذكر إلا أولوا الألباب ولذلك قال ﭬ: (لولا أن الشياطين يحومون على قلوب بنى آدم لنظروا إلى ملكوت السماء[53]) وإذ عرفت هذا المثال فقس عليه حركتك وسكونك ونطقك وسكوتك وكل فعل صادر منك فإنه إما شكر وإما كفر إذ لا يتصور أن ينفك عنهما وبعض ذلك نصفه في لسان الفقه الذى تناطق به عوام الناس بالكراهة وبعضه بالخطر وكل ذلك عند أرباب القلوب موصوف بالخطر.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='#' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Watchfulness and Self-Examination</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And for each one of these there are limits that must be observed through constant vigilance (Muraqaba), and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has wronged his own soul (Nafs).

It is only permissible if there is no harm without right, and whenever he divorces her, he has harmed her. It is not permissible to harm others except due to a transgression from her side or a necessity from his side. Allah the Exalted said: (Then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them) meaning do not seek a stratagem for separation. And if her father dislikes her, let him divorce her. Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: I had a wife whom I loved, and my father disliked her and ordered me to divorce her, so I consulted the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: O Ibn Umar, divorce your wife. This indicates that the right of the parent takes precedence, but a parent who dislikes her without a corrupt purpose like Umar. And whenever she harms her husband and is insolent toward his family, she is a transgressor. Likewise, if she is of bad character or corrupt in religion. Ibn Mas'ud said regarding His statement, the Exalted: 'nor should they leave except that they commit a clear immorality' - whenever she is insolent toward his family and harms her husband, that is an immorality. This is intended for the waiting period, but it is an indication of the intended meaning. And if the harm is from the husband, she may ransom herself by giving wealth; it is disliked for the man to take from her more than what he gave, for that is injustice against her and oppression upon her and trading on the private part. He, the Exalted, said: 'Then there is no blame upon them for what she gives back.' So returning what he took or less is suitable for the ransom. If she asks for divorce without any wrongdoing, she is sinful. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Any woman who asks her husband for divorce without any wrongdoing will not smell the fragrance of Paradise). In another wording: 'Paradise is forbidden to her.' And in another wording: He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (The women who seek khul' are the hypocrites). Then the husband should observe four matters in divorce: The first is that he divorce her in a state of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her, for divorce during menstruation or the purity in which he had intercourse is called forbidden, even if it occurs, due to what it contains of prolonging the waiting period upon her. If he does that, let him take her back. Ibn Umar divorced his wife during menstruation, so He, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Umar: Command him to take her back until she becomes pure, then she menstruates, then she becomes pure, then if he wishes, he divorces her, and if he wishes, he retains her. That is the waiting period which Allah commanded to divorce women for. And He commanded him to be patient after taking her back for two purity periods so that the purpose of taking back is not...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الثاني عشر في الطلاق وليعلم أنه مباح ولكنه أبغض المباحات إلى الله تعالى وإنما يكون مباحا إذا لم يكن فيه إيذاء بالباطل ومهما طلقها فقد آذاها ولا يباح إيذاء الغير إلا بجناية من جانبها أو بضرورة من جانبه قال الله تعالى (فإن أطعنكم فلا تبغوا عليهن سبيلا) أي لا تطلبوا حيلة للفراق وإن كرهها أبوه فليطلقها قال ابن عمر رضي الله عنهما كان تحتي امرأة أحبها وكان أبي يكرهها ويأمرني بطلاقها فراجعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال يا ابن عمر طلق امرأتك فهذا يدل على أن حق الوالد مقدم ولكن والد يكرهها لا لغرض فاسد مثل عمر ومهما آذت زوجها وبذت على أهله فهي جانية وكذلك مهما كانت سيئة الخلق أو فاسدة الدين قال ابن مسعود في قوله تعالى ولا يخرجن إلا أن يأتين بفاحشة مبينة مهما بذت على أهله وآذت زوجها فهو فاحشة وهذا أريد به في العدة ولكنه تنبيه على المقصود وإن كان الأذى من الزوج فلها أن تفتدي ببذل مال يكره للرجل أن يأخذ منها أكثر مما أعطى فإن ذلك إجحاف بها وتحامل عليها وتجارة على البضع قال تعالى فلا جناح عليهما فيما افتدت به فرد ما أخذته فما دونه لائق بالفداء فإن سألت الطلاق بغير ما بأس فهي آثمة قال صلى الله عليه وسلم (أيما امرأة سألت زوجها طلاقها من غير ما بأس لم ترح رائحة الجنة) وفي لفظ آخر فالجنة عليها حرام وفي لفظ آخر أنه صلى الله عليه وسلم (قال المختلعات هن المنافقات) ثم ليراع الزوج في الطلاق أربعة أمور: الأول أن يطلقها في طهر لم يجامعها فيه فإن الطلاق في الحيض أو الطهر الذي جامع يدعى حرام وإن كان واقعا لما فيه من تطويل العدة عليها فإن فعل ذلك فليراجعها طلق ابن عمر زوجته في الحيض فقال صلى الله عليه وسلم لعمر مره فليراجعها حتى تطهر ثم تحيض ثم تطهر ثم إن شاء طلقها وإن شاء أمسكها فتلك العدة التي أمر الله أن يطلق لها النساء وإنما أمره بالصبر بعد الرجعة طهرين لئلا يكون مقصود الرجعة</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.2","c":"فَإِذَا","d":"fa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَf"},{"b":"0.69","h":"1.13","c":"بَلَغْنَ","d":"balaghna","e":"َnْغَlَb"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.13","c":"أَجَلَهُنَّ","d":"ajalahunna","e":"َّnُhَlَjgَaʾ"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.16","c":"فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ","d":"fa-amsikūhunna","e":"َّnُhwُkِsْmَaʾَf"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.22","c":"بِمَعْرُوفٍ","d":"bimaʿrūfin","e":"ٍfwُrْʿعَmِb"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.18","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"6.7","h":"9.7","c":"فَارِقُوهُنَّ","d":"fāriqūhunna","e":"َّnُhwُqِrāَf"},{"b":"8.8","h":"12.56","c":"بِمَعْرُوفٍ","d":"bimaʿrūfin","e":"ٍfwُrْʿعَmِb"},{"b":"10.","h":"15.1","c":"وَأَشْهِدُوا","d":"wa-ashhidū","e":"۟āwُdِhْhsَaʾَw"},{"b":"11.9","h":"16.71","c":"ذَوَيْ","d":"dhaway","e":"ْàَwَhd"},{"b":"12.4","h":"17.48","c":"عَدْلٍ","d":"ʿadlin","e":"ٍlْdَʿع"},{"b":"13.8","h":"19.2","c":"مِنْكُمْ","d":"minkum","e":"ْmُknِّm"},{"b":"15.2","h":"21.12","c":"وَأَقِيمُوا","d":"wa-aqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqَaʾَw"},{"b":"16.1","h":"22.61","c":"الشَّهَادَةَ","d":"l-shahādata","e":"َẗَdَٰhَّhslٱ"},{"b":"18","h":"24.48","c":"لِلَّهِ","d":"lillahi","e":"ِhَّlِl"},{"b":"20.0","h":"29.65","c":"ذَلِكُمْ","d":"dhālikum","e":"ْmُkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"21.0","h":"31.01","c":"يُوعَظُ","d":"yūʿaẓu","e":"ُẓَʿعwُy"},{"b":"21.","h":"32.31","c":"بِهِ","d":"bihi","e":"ۦِhِb"},{"b":"22.3","h":"33.21","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"nَm"},{"b":"23.3","h":"34.27","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"23.9","h":"35.18","c":"يُؤْمِنُ","d":"yu'minu","e":"ُnِmْwʾُy"},{"b":"24.7","h":"36.27","c":"بِاللَّهِ","d":"bil-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱِb"},{"b":"25.7","h":"37.68","c":"وَالْيَوْمِ","d":"wal-yawmi","e":"ِmْwَyْlٱَw"},{"b":"26.6","h":"39.1","c":"الْءَاخِرِ","d":"l-ākhiri","e":"ِrِhkāَءْlٱ"},{"b":"28.1","h":"42.02","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"29.5","h":"43.36","c":"يَتَّقِ","d":"yattaqi","e":"ِqَّtَy"},{"b":"30.1","h":"44.64","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"30.","h":"45.78","c":"يَجْعَلْ","d":"yajʿal","e":"lَʿعْjgَy"},{"b":"31.8","h":"46.64","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَّl"},{"b":"32.3","h":"47.91","c":"مَخْرَجًا","d":"makhrajan","e":"āًjgَrْhkَm"}],"a":{"g":"And when they have [nearly] fulfilled their term, either retain them according to acceptable terms or part with them according to acceptable terms.

And some of them said: Verily, Allah the Exalted has servants who spend according to the measure of their goods, and Allah has servants who spend according to the measure of good expectation (husn al-zann) of Allah the Exalted.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ومن كان غرضه الرفق وطلب الثواب به فله أن يستقرض على حسن الظن بالله لا على اعتماد السلاطين الظلمة، فإن رزقه الله من حلال قضاه. وغن مات قبل القضاء قضاه الله تعالى عنه وأرضى غرماءه، وذلك بشرط أن يكون مكشوف الحال عند من يقرضه فلا يغر المقرض ولا يخدعه بالمواعيد بل يكشف حاله عنده ليقدم على إقراضه على بصيرة، ودين مثل هذا الرجل واجب أن يقضى من مال بيت المال ومن الزكاة، وقد قال تعالى: \" ومن قدر عليه رزقه فلينفق مما آتاه الله \" قيل معناه: ليبع أحد ثوبيه. وقيل معناه: فليستقرض بجاهه، فذلك مما آتاه الله. وقال بعضهم: إن لله تعالى عباداً ينفقون على قدر بضائعهم، ولله عباد ينفقون على قدر حسن الظن بالله تعالى.</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"وَكَأَيِّنْ","d":"waka-ayyin","e":"nِّyَaʾَkَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"2.98","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِّm"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.8","c":"قَرْيَةٍ","d":"qaryatin","e":"ٍẗَyْrَq"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.42","c":"عَتَتْ","d":"ʿatat","e":"ْtَtَʿع"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.45","c":"عَنْ","d":"ʿan","e":"ْnَʿع"},{"b":"4.4","h":"7.13","c":"أَمْرِ","d":"amri","e":"ِrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"5.0","h":"8.07","c":"رَبِّهَا","d":"rabbihā","e":"āَhِّbَr"},{"b":"6.0","h":"9.83","c":"وَرُسُلِهِ","d":"warusulihi","e":"ۦِhِlُsُrَw"},{"b":"7.1","h":"11.68","c":"فَحَاسَبْنَاهَا","d":"faḥāsabnāhā","e":"āَhَٰnْbَsāَḥَf"},{"b":"8.8","h":"14.89","c":"حِسَابًا","d":"ḥisāban","e":"āًbāَsِḥ"},{"b":"10.3","h":"17.01","c":"شَدِيدًا","d":"shadīdan","e":"āًdyِdَhs"},{"b":"16.0","h":"19.05","c":"وَعَذَّبْنَاهَا","d":"waʿadhabnāhā","e":"āَhَٰnْbَّhdَʿعَw"},{"b":"18.5","h":"21.95","c":"عَذَابًا","d":"ʿadhāban","e":"āًbāَhdَʿع"},{"b":"19.3","h":"23.44","c":"نُكْرًا","d":"nuk'ran","e":"āًrْkُّn"}],"a":{"g":"And how many a city was insolent toward the command of its Lord and His messengers, so We took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment."}},"9":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"فَذَاقَتْ","d":"fadhāqat","e":"ْtَqāَhdَf"},{"b":"0.98","h":"2.04","c":"وَبَالَ","d":"wabāla","e":"َlāَbَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"3.35","c":"أَمْرِهَا","d":"amrihā","e":"āَhِrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"5.18","c":"وَكَانَ","d":"wakāna","e":"َnāَkَw"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.64","c":"عَاقِبَةُ","d":"ʿāqibatu","e":"ُẗَbِqَٰʿع"},{"b":"4.5","h":"8.53","c":"أَمْرِهَا","d":"amrihā","e":"āَhِrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"10.38","c":"خُسْرًا","d":"khus'ran","e":"āًrْsُhk"}],"a":{"g":"And it tasted the bad consequence of its affair, and the outcome of its affair was loss."}},"10":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1","c":"أَعَدَّ","d":"aʿadda","e":"َّdَʿعَaʾ"},{"b":"0.83","h":"2.11","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.52","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"2.1","h":"4.37","c":"عَذَابًا","d":"ʿadhāban","e":"āًbāَhdَʿع"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.6","c":"شَدِيدًا","d":"shadīdan","e":"āًdyِdَhs"},{"b":"5.5","h":"10.8","c":"فَاتَّقُوا","d":"fa-ittaqū","e":"۟āwُqَّtٱَf"},{"b":"6.3","h":"12.23","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"7.0","h":"13.43","c":"يَاأُولِي","d":"yāulī","e":"àِl۟wُaʾَٰٓy"},{"b":"9.1","h":"15.72","c":"الْأَلْبَابِ","d":"l-albābi","e":"ِbَٰbْlَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"10.3","h":"17.7","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"11.3","h":"19.31","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"12.8","h":"22.4","c":"قَدْ","d":"qad","e":"ْdَq"},{"b":"13.1","h":"22.85","c":"أَنْزَلَ","d":"anzala","e":"َlَznَaʾ"},{"b":"14.8","h":"24.58","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"15.","h":"25.94","c":"إِلَيْكُمْ","d":"ilaykum","e":"ْmُkْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"16.6","h":"27.49","c":"ذِكْرًا","d":"dhik'ran","e":"āًrْkِhd"}],"a":{"g":"Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; so fear Allah, O you of understanding who have believed.
