Those are the ones about whom Allah said: **\"Say, 'Indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do.'\"**\n\nThen, people are either engrossed, or a repentant beginner, or a knower [arif] who has reached the end. As for the engrossed one, he does not remember death, and if he does remember it, he remembers it to lament his worldly life and occupies himself with censuring it. This increases his distance from Allah through the remembrance of death. As for the repentant one, he increases in remembering death so that fear [khawf] and awe [khashya] may surge from his heart [qalb], fulfilling complete repentance. Perhaps he dislikes death, fearing it may snatch him before the completion of repentance and before preparing the provision. He is excused in disliking death, and this does not fall under His saying, peace be upon him: **\"Whoever dislikes meeting Allah, Allah dislikes meeting him.\"** For this one does not dislike death and meeting Allah; rather, he fears missing the meeting with Allah due to his deficiency and shortcoming. He is like one who delays meeting the beloved, busying himself with preparing for meeting him in a manner that pleases him, so he is not considered one who dislikes meeting him. The sign of this is that he is perpetually prepared for it, having no occupation other than it. Otherwise, he joins the ranks of those engrossed in the world [dunya].\n\nAs for the knower [arif], he remembers death constantly because it is the appointed time for meeting his Beloved, and the lover never forgets the appointed time of meeting the beloved. This, for the most part, causes him to consider the coming of death slow, and he loves its coming to be freed from the abode of the disobedient and to transfer to the proximity of the Lord of the worlds, as was narrated from Hudhayfah that when death was present for him, he said: \"A beloved has come in a state of need; may he not succeed who feels regret. O Allah, if You know that poverty is more beloved to me than wealth, sickness more beloved to me than health, and death more beloved to me than life, then make death easy for me until I meet You.\"\n\nTherefore, the repentant one is excused in disliking death, and this one is excused in loving death and desiring it. Higher than both of them in rank is the one who entrusts his affair to Allah, the Exalted, so he does not choose for himself death or life; rather, the most beloved of things to him is what is most beloved to his Master. This one has reached, through intense love [hubb] and loyalty, the station of submission [taslim] and contentment [rida], and it is the ultimate goal and end.\n\nIn any case, in remembering death there is reward and excellence. For the engrossed one also benefits from remembering death by turning away from the world [dunya], as it spoils his bliss for him and clouds the purity of his pleasure. Everything that clouds a person's pleasures and desires is from the causes of salvation.\n\n**(Clarifying the excellence of remembering death however it may be)**\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: **\"Increase your remembrance of the destroyer of pleasures.\"** Its meaning is: spoil your pleasures by remembering it so that your reliance upon them is severed, and you turn to Allah, the Exalted. And he, peace be upon him, said: **\"If the animals knew of death what the son of Adam knows, you would not eat from them anything fat.\"** And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"O Messenger of Allah, will anyone be resurrected with the martyrs?\" He said: **\"Yes, one who remembers death twenty times in a day and night.\"** The cause of all this excellence is that remembering death necessitates turning away from the abode of delusion and demands preparation for the Hereafter [akhirah], and heedlessness of death calls to engrossment in the pleasures of the world [dunya].\n\nAnd he, peace be upon him, said: **\"The gift for the believer is death.\"** He only said this because the world [dunya] is the prison of the believer, for he remains in it in toil from contending with his soul [nafs], disciplining his desires, and repelling his devil. Death is a release for him from this torment, and release is a gift in his right. And he, peace be upon him, said: **\"Death is an expiation for every Muslim.\"** He intended by this the true Muslim, the sincere believer, from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, in whom the character of the believers is realized, and who is not stained by sins except minor slips and small faults. Death purifies him from them and expiates them after he has avoided major sins and established the obligations.\n\n'Atta' al-Khurasani said: \"The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, passed by a gathering where laughter had become loud. He said: **'Mix your gathering with the remembrance of what spoils pleasures.'** They said: 'And what is that which spoils pleasures?' He said: **'Death.'**\"\n\nAnd Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: **\"Increase your remembrance of death, for it purifies sins and induces asceticism in the world [dunya].\"** And he, peace be upon him, said: **\"Sufficient is death as a separator.\"** And upon him be peace, said: **\"Sufficient is death as an admonisher.\"**\n\n**(And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went out to the mosque and found people conversing and laughing. He said: 'Remember death. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.')**\n\n**(And a man was mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and they praised him well. He said: 'How is your companion's remembrance of death?' They said: 'We hardly ever heard him mention death.' He said: 'Then your companion is not there.')**\n\nAnd Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: I came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, as the tenth of ten. A man from the Ansar said: \"Who are the wisest of people and the noblest of people, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said: **\"Those who remember death the most and are the strongest in preparation for it; those are the wise ones. They have taken the honor of the world [dunya] and the dignity of the Hereafter [akhirah].\"**\n\nAs for the narrations: Al-Hasan, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"Death has exposed the world [dunya], leaving no one of understanding joyful.\" And Al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym said: \"No absent thing awaited by the believer is better for him than death.\" And he used to say: \"Do not make anyone aware of me, and deliver me to my Lord smoothly.\" And one of the wise wrote to a man from his brothers: \"O my brother, beware of death in this abode before you reach an abode where you wish for death but do not find it.\" And Ibn Sirin, when death was mentioned to him, every limb of him would die. And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz would gather the jurists every night, and they would remind each other of death, the Resurrection, and the Hereafter [akhirah], then they would weep until it was as if there was a funeral bier before them. And Ibrahim al-Taymi said: \"Two things severed from me the pleasure of the world [dunya]: the remembrance of death and standing before Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.\" And Ka'b said: \"Whoever knows death, the calamities and worries of the world [dunya] become light to him.\" And Mutarrif said: \"I saw in a dream as if a speaker was saying in the middle of the mosque of Basrah: 'The remembrance of death has severed the hearts [qulub] of the fearful. By Allah, you do not see them except distracted.'\" And Ash'ath said: \"We used to enter upon Al-Hasan, and it was only the Fire, the matter of the Hereafter [akhirah], and the remembrance of death.\" And Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: \"A woman complained to 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, about the hardness of her heart [qalb]. She said: 'Increase your remembrance of death, and your heart [qalb] will soften.' She did so, and her heart [qalb] softened, and she came thanking 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her.\" And 'Isa, upon him be peace, when death was mentioned to him, his skin would drip blood. And Dawud, upon him be peace, when death and the Resurrection were mentioned to him, would weep until his limbs were dislocated, and when mercy was mentioned, his soul [nafs] would return to him.\" And Al-Hasan said: \"I have never seen a rational person except that I found him cautious of death and sorrowful over it.\" And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said to some scholars: \"Admonish me.\" He said: \"You are not the first caliph to die.\" He said: \"Increase me.\" He said: \"There is none of your forefathers back to Adam except that he has tasted death, and your turn has come.\" So 'Umar wept for that. And Al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym had dug a grave in his house and would sleep in it every day several times, perpetuating by that the remembrance of death. And he used to say: \"If the remembrance of death were to leave my heart [qalb] for a single moment, it would be corrupted.\" And Mutarrif ibn 'Abd Allah ibn al-Shikhkhir said: \"Indeed, this death has spoiled the bliss for the people of bliss, so seek a bliss in which there is no death.\" And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said to 'Anbasah: \"Increase your remembrance of death, for if your life was expansive, it will constrict it for you, and if your life was constricted, it will expand it for you.\" And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: \"I said to Umm Harun: 'Do you love death?' She said: 'No.' I said: 'Why?' She said: 'If I disobeyed a human, I would not desire to meet him, so how could I love meeting Him when I have disobeyed Him?'\"\n\n**(Clarifying the path to realizing the remembrance of death)**\nKnow that death is terrifying, its danger is great, and the heedlessness of people towards it is due to their little reflection upon it and their remembrance of it. And whoever remembers it does not remember it with an empty heart [qalb]; rather, with a heart [qalb] preoccupied with the desire of the world [dunya], so the remembrance of death does not take effect in his heart [qalb]. The path in it is that the servant empties his heart [qalb] of everything except the remembrance of death, which is before him like one who intends to travel to a dangerous desert or to embark upon the sea, for he does not reflect except upon it. When his heart [qalb] engages with the remembrance of death, it is likely to affect him, and at that point, his joy and happiness with the world [dunya] diminish, and his heart [qalb] is broken. The most effective path in it is to increase the remembrance of his peers and contemporaries who have passed before him, so he remembers their death and their places under the earth, and he remembers their images in their positions and their states, and he contemplates how the earth has now erased the beauty of their images, how their parts have scattered in their graves, how they left their wives widowed and their children orphaned, how they wasted their wealth, how their mosques and gatherings became empty of them, and how their traces were severed.\n\nWhenever a man remembers a man and details in his heart [qalb] his condition and the manner of his death, and imagines his image, and remembers his activity, his coming and going, his contemplation of life and permanence, his forgetfulness of death, his deception by the succession of means, his reliance upon strength and youth, his inclination to laughter and amusement, and his heedlessness of what is before him of swift death and rapid destruction, and how he used to come and go, and now his legs and joints have crumbled, and how he used to speak, and now worms have eaten his tongue, and how he used to laugh, and now earth has eaten his teeth, and how he used to plan for himself what he would not need for ten years at a time when there was not between him and death except a month, while he was heedless of what was intended for him until death came to him at a time he did not reckon, and the image of the angel was unveiled for him, and the call struck his hearing, either with Paradise or with the Fire—at that point, he looks at himself that he is like them, and his heedlessness is like their heedlessness, and his end will be like their end.\n\nAbu al-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When you remember the dead, count yourself as one of them.\" And Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"The fortunate one is he who is admonished by others.\" And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: \"Do you not see that you are preparing every day one going forth or returning to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic? You place him in a crack of the earth, having made the earth his pillow, leaving behind loved ones and severing ties.\"\n\nPersisting in these thoughts and their like, along with entering graveyards and observing the sick, is what renews the remembrance of death in the heart [qalb] until it overcomes it, such that it becomes before his eyes. At that point, it is likely to affect him and cause him to turn away from the abode of delusion. Otherwise, remembrance with the surface of the heart [qalb] and the tip of the tongue is of little benefit in warning and alerting. Whenever his heart [qalb] finds pleasure in something from the world [dunya], he should immediately remember that he must inevitably part from it.\n\nIbn al-Muti' looked one day at his house, and its beauty pleased him, then he wept and said: \"By Allah, were it not for death, I would be pleased with you, and were it not for what we will come to of the constriction of the graves, our eyes would be content with the world [dunya].\" Then he wept a severe weeping until his voice rose.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وفي قوله عز وجل -﴿ وهم في غفلة معرضون ﴾ {} فإن لم يكن بهذه الصفات ولم يتردد قلبه بين هذه الحالات كان حظه من التلاوة حركة اللسان مع صريح اللعن على نفسه في قوله تعالى ﴿ ألا لعنة الله على الظالمين ﴾ {} وفي قوله تعالى ﴿ كبر مقتا عند الله أن تقولوا ما لا تفعلون ﴾ {} وفي قوله عز وجل -﴿ وهم في غفلة معرضون ﴾ {} وفي قوله ﴿ فأعرض عمن تولى عن ذكرنا ولم يرد إلا الحياة الدنيا ﴾ {} وفي قوله تعالى ﴿ ومن لم يتب فأولئك هم الظالمون ﴾ {} إلى غير ذلك من الآيات وكان داخلا في معنى قوله عز وجل ﴿ ومنهم أميون لا يعلمون الكتاب إلا أمانيّ ﴾ {} يعني التلاوة المجردة وقوله عز وجل ﴿ وكأين من آية في السموات والأرض يمرون عليها وهم عنها معرضون ﴾ {} لأن القرآن هو المبين لتلك الآيات في السموات والأرض ومهما تجاوزها ولم يتأثر بها كان معرضا عنها ولذلك قيل: إن من لم يكن متصفا بأخلاق القرآن فإذا قرأ القرآن ناداه الله تعالى: مالك ولكلامي وأنت معرض عني دع عنك كلامي إن لم تتب إلي.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, do you not contemplate His saying, the Most High: \"The reckoning [hisab] for the people has drawn near, while they are in heedlessness [ghafla], turning away. No new reminder [dhikr] comes to them from their Lord except that they listen to it while they play, their hearts [qulub] distracted [lahiya].\"\n\nWoe to you, O soul [nafs]! If your boldness in disobeying Allah stems from your belief that Allah does not see you, then how great is your disbelief [kufr]! And if it is with your knowledge of His awareness of you, then how severe is your insolence and how little your shame!\n\nWoe to you, O soul [nafs]! If a servant from your servants, or even a brother from your brothers, were to confront you with what you dislike, how great would be your anger towards him and your loathing of him? With what audacity, then, do you expose yourself to the loathing, anger, and severe punishment of Allah? Do you suppose you can bear His punishment? Far, far from it!\n\nTest yourself, O soul [nafs]! If heedlessness [ghafla] has distracted you from His painful punishment, then confine yourself for an hour in the sun, or in a bathhouse, or bring your finger near the fire, so that the extent of your capacity may become clear.\n\nAre you deluded by the graciousness [karam] of Allah and His bounty, and His independence from your obedience and worship? Then why do you not rely on the graciousness [karam] of Allah, the Most High, in the pressing matters of your worldly life [dunya]? If an enemy intends you harm, why do you not devise stratagems to repel him, nor entrust him to the graciousness [karam] of Allah, the Most High? And if a need for a desire from the desires of the worldly life [dunya] overwhelms you—a desire that is only fulfilled by a dinar or a dirham—why do you exert your spirit [ruh] in seeking and acquiring it through all manner of schemes, and you do not rely on the graciousness [karam] of Allah, the Most High, that He might cause you to stumble upon a treasure or subjugate a servant from His servants to carry your need to you without any effort or seeking on your part?\n\nDo you reckon that Allah is gracious [karim] in the Hereafter [Akhira] but not in the worldly life [dunya]? Yet you know that the way [sunnah] of Allah is not subject to change, and that the Lord of the Hereafter [Akhira] and the worldly life [dunya] is One, and that for man there is only what he strives for.\n\nWoe to you, O soul [nafs]! How astonishing is your hypocrisy [nifaq] and your false pretexts! For you claim faith [iman] with your tongue, yet the mark of hypocrisy [nifaq] is apparent upon you. Did not your Master and Protector say to you: \"And there is no creature on earth but that its provision [rizq] is upon Allah\"? And concerning the matter of the Hereafter [Akhira], He said: \"And that for man there is only what he strives for.\" Thus, He has guaranteed your worldly affair [dunya] specifically and diverted you from striving in it, yet you have belied Him with your actions and have become avidly engrossed in seeking it, like one who is stunned and reckless. And He has entrusted the affair of the Hereafter [Akhira] to your striving, yet you have turned away from it like one deluded and contemptuous. What is this from the signs of faith [iman]? If faith [iman] were with the tongue alone, then why would the hypocrites [munafiqun] be in the lowest depth of the Fire?\n\nWoe to you, O soul [nafs]! It is as if you do not believe in the Day of Reckoning [yawm al-hisab] and you suppose that when you die, you will escape and be free. Far from it!

Thus, He the Exalted said, informing about them: \"They glorify [Him] night and day, without ceasing, and they are apprehensive [mushfiqun] from fear of Him.\" So when this apprehension [al-ishfaq] and caution from what has been decreed by preordainment [al-qada'] in eternity [al-azal]—and which is unveiled at the conclusion of one's appointed term [al-ajal]—is removed, then a feeling of security [al-amn] from the guile of God prevails. And that necessitates arrogance [al-kibr], which is the cause of perdition. So arrogance [al-kibr] is the indicator of security [al-amn], and security [al-amn] is destructive. And humility [al-tawadu'] is the indicator of fear [al-khawf], and it is the means to felicity. Therefore, what the worshipper corrupts by harboring arrogance [al-kibr] and contempt for creation, and by looking upon them with an eye of belittlement, is more than what he rectifies with the outward appearance of deeds. These are insights [ma'arif] by which the disease of arrogance [al-kibr] is removed from the heart [al-qalb], nothing else. However, the soul [al-nafs] after this knowledge [al-ma'rifah] may harbor humility [al-tawadu'] and claim innocence from arrogance [al-kibr] while it is lying. So when an opportunity arises, it returns to its base nature and forgets its promise. Therefore, based on this, one should not be content in the treatment with mere knowledge [al-ma'rifah]. Rather, it must be completed with action [al-'amal] and tested by the acts of the humble in situations where the stirring of arrogance [al-kibr] arises in the soul [al-nafs].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد وصف الله تعالى الملائكة عليهم السلام مع تقدسهم عن الذنوب ومواظبتهم على العبادات على الدءوب بالإشفاق فقال تعالى مخبراً عنهم \"يسحبون الليل والنهار لا يفترون وهم من خشيته مشفقون\" فمتى زال الإشفاق والحذر مما سبق به القضاء في الأزل - وينكشف عند خاتمة الأجل - غلب الأمن من مكر الله وذلك يوجب الكبر وهو سبب الهلاك. فالكبر دليل الأمن والأمن مهلك. والتواضع دليل الخوف وهو مسعد؛ فإذن ما يفسده العابد بإضمار الكبر واحتقار الخلق والنظر إليهم بعين الاستصغار أكثر مما يصلحه بظاهر الأعمال. فهذه معارف بها يزال داء الكبر عن القلب لا غير، إلا أن النفس بعد هذه المعرفة قد تضمر التواضع وتدعي البراءة من الكبر وهي كاذبة، فإذا وقعت عادت إلى طبعها ونسيت وعدها، فعلى هذا لا ينبغي أن يكتفي في المداواة بمجرد المعرفة بل ينبغي أن تكمل بالعمل وتجرب بأفعال المتواضعين في مواقع هيجان الكبر في النفس.</div></div></div>"}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"1.35","c":"أَمِ","d":"ami","e":"۟āٓwُhdَhkَّtٱ"},{"b":"0.53","h":"1.78","c":"اتَّخَذُوا","d":"ittakhadhū","e":"ًẗَhِlāَء"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.91","c":"ءَالِهَةً","d":"ālihatan","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.6","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"4.5","h":"8.08","c":"الْأَرْضِ","d":"l-arḍi","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"5.4","h":"9.56","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"َnwُrِhsnُy"},{"b":"5.6","h":"10.36","c":"يُنْشِرُونَ","d":"yunshirūna","e":"ْwَl"}],"a":{"g":"Or have men taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect [the dead]?"}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"1.22","c":"لَوْ","d":"law","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"0.37","h":"1.77","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"ٓāَmِhyِf"},{"b":"0.97","h":"2.98","c":"فِيهِمَا","d":"fīhimā","e":"ٌẗَhِlāَء"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.89","c":"ءَالِهَةٌ","d":"ālihatun","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"8.14","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"5.1","h":"9.16","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"āَtَdَsَfَl"},{"b":"6.0","h":"10.83","c":"لَفَسَدَتَا","d":"lafasadatā","e":"َnَٰḥْbُsَf"},{"b":"7.8","h":"14.5","c":"فَسُبْحَانَ","d":"fasub'ḥāna","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"16.42","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِّbَr"},{"b":"9.7","h":"17.94","c":"رَبِّ","d":"rabbi","e":"ِhsْrَʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"10.3","h":"19.09","c":"الْعَرْشِ","d":"l-ʿarshi","e":"āَّmَʿع"},{"b":"11.1","h":"20.35","c":"عَمَّا","d":"ʿammā","e":"َnwُfِṣَy"},{"b":"12.4","h":"22.32","c":"يَصِفُونَ","d":"yaṣifūna","e":"āَl"}],"a":{"g":"Had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined.

Even if it be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. Sufficient are We as Reckoners.\" Thus, the possessors of insight [arbab al-basa'ir] from among the servants came to know that God Almighty lies in wait for them, and that they will be scrutinized in the Reckoning [hisab] and held accountable for the weight of an atom [mithaqil al-dharr] from their passing thoughts [khawatir] and glances [lahazat]. And they realized that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning [muhasaba] and sincere self-observation [muraqaba], and holding the soul [nafs] to account for its breaths [anfas] and movements [harakat], and reckoning with it for its passing thoughts [khawatir] and glances [lahazat]. For whoever holds his soul [nafs] to account before he is held to account, his reckoning [hisab] on the Day of Resurrection [al-Qiyamah] will be light, his answer will be present when questioned, and his return [ma'ab] and outcome [manqalab] will be good. And whoever does not hold his soul [nafs] to account, his regrets [hasrat] will be prolonged, and his halts [waqfat] in the plains ['arasat] of the Day of Resurrection [al-Qiyamah] will be lengthy, and his misdeeds [sayyi'at] will lead him to disgrace [khizy] and contempt [maqt]. When this was unveiled to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to God. And He had commanded them to patience [sabr] and vigilant guarding [murabata], so He, the Majestic, said: \"O you who believe, be patient, and excel in patience, and guard [rabit], and be mindful of God.\" So they first guarded their souls [nafs] by mutual stipulation [al-musharata], then by self-observation [al-muraqaba], then by self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], then by self-chastisement [al-mu'aqaba], then by striving [al-mujahada], then by self-admonition [al-mu'ataba]. Thus, for them in vigilant guarding [al-murabata] were six stations [maqamat], and it is necessary to explain them, clarify their reality [haqiqa] and virtue [fadila], and detail the works within them. The foundation of that is self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], but every reckoning [hisab] is after mutual stipulation [musharata] and self-observation [muraqaba], and is followed, in case of loss [khusran], by self-admonition [mu'ataba] and self-chastisement [mu'aqaba]. So let us mention the explanation of these stations, and with God is success.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الأصل الرابع: الميزان وهو حق قال الله تعالى: ﴿ ونضع الموازين القسط ليوم القيامة ﴾ { سورة الأنبيآء: 47 } ووجهها أن الله تعالى يحدث في صحائف الأعمال وزنا بحسب درجات الأعمال عند الله تعالى فتصير مقادير أعمال العباد معلومة للعباد حتى يظهر لهم العدل في العقاب أو الفضل في العفو وتضعيف الثواب.</div></div></div>"}},"48":{"w":[{"b":"0.09","h":"1.3","c":"وَلَقَدْ","d":"walaqad","e":"āَnْyَtāَء"},{"b":"0.77","h":"2.07","c":"ءَاتَيْنَا","d":"ātaynā","e":"ٰàَswُm"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.73","c":"مُوسَى","d":"mūsā","e":"َnwُrَٰhَw"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.84","c":"وَهَارُونَ","d":"wahārūna","e":"َnāَqْrُfْlٱ"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.45","c":"الْفُرْقَانَ","d":"l-fur'qāna","e":"ًءٓāَyِḍَw"},{"b":"5.3","h":"8.13","c":"وَضِيَاءً","d":"waḍiyāan","e":"āًrْkِhdَw"},{"b":"8","h":"11.29","c":"وَذِكْرًا","d":"wadhik'ran","e":"َnyِqَّtُmْlِّl"},{"b":"9.4","h":"12.33","c":"لِلْمُتَّقِينَ","d":"lil'muttaqīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And We had already given Moses and Aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.35","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnْwَhsْhkَy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.62","c":"يَخْشَوْنَ","d":"yakhshawna","e":"mُhَّbَr"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.95","c":"رَبَّهُمْ","d":"rabbahum","e":"ِbْyَغْlٱِb"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.81","c":"بِالْغَيْبِ","d":"bil-ghaybi","e":"mُhَw"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.02","c":"وَهُمْ","d":"wahum","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"5.9","h":"7.39","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"ِẗَʿعāَّslٱ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"7.8","c":"السَّاعَةِ","d":"l-sāʿati","e":"َnwُqِfْhsُm"},{"b":"7.3","h":"9.4","c":"مُشْفِقُونَ","d":"mush'fiqūna","e":"āَhdَٰhَw"}],"a":{"g":"Who fear their Lord unseen, while they are of the Hour apprehensive."}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.35","c":"وَهَذَا","d":"wahādhā","e":"ٌrْkِhd"},{"b":"0.96","h":"2.51","c":"ذِكْرٌ","d":"dhik'run","e":"ٌkَrāَbُّm"},{"b":"2.4","h":"4.54","c":"مُبَارَكٌ","d":"mubārakun","e":"ُhَٰnْlَznَaʾ"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.94","c":"أَنْزَلْنَاهُ","d":"anzalnāhu","e":"ْmُtnَaʾَfَaʾ"},{"b":"7.4","h":"10.75","c":"أَفَأَنْتُمْ","d":"afa-antum","e":"ۥُhَl"},{"b":"9.2","h":"12.7","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"َnwُrِknُm"},{"b":"9.9","h":"13.71","c":"مُنْكِرُونَ","d":"munkirūna","e":"ْdَqَlَw"}],"a":{"g":"And this [Qur'an] is a blessed message which We have sent down.

And this is from the inward [al-batin], just as the Almighty has said: \"And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement [rushduhu] before, and We were of him Knowing.\" (21:51) Thus, guidance [al-rushd] is an expression for an illuminating guidance [hidayah] that urges towards the direction of felicity [al-sa'adah] and impels towards it. For the youth, when he reaches maturity, knowledgeable in safeguarding wealth and the ways of commerce and increasing it, but despite that he squanders and does not desire to increase it, he is not called rightly guided [rashid]—not due to a lack of guidance [hidayah], but due to the deficiency of his guidance [hidayah] in moving his innate impulse [da'iyyah]. For how many a person proceeds towards what he knows will harm him; he has been given the guidance [al-hidayah] and is distinguished by it from the ignorant one who does not know it will harm him, but he has not been given the sound judgement [al-rushd]. Thus, sound judgement [al-rushd], by this consideration, is more complete than mere guidance [al-hidayah] to the aspects of deeds, and it is a great blessing [ni'mah].</div><div class='ihya-arabic'

As for disciplining the inner secret [sirr] from harboring a sense of improbability regarding this apparent disparity in drawing near [taqrib] and casting far, in causing misery [ishqa'] and granting felicity [is'ad], while happiness [sa'ada] and wretchedness [shaqawa] remain for all eternity—none have the strength for this except the scholars firmly rooted in knowledge [al-'ulama' al-rasikhun fi al-'ilm]. And for this reason, Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, when asked about spiritual audition [sama'], said it is the pure, clear water upon which only the feet of the scholars can stand firm, for it stirs the secrets [asrar] and hidden places of the hearts [qulub], and agitates them with the agitation of bewildering intoxication which nearly loosens the knot of inner discipline [adab] from the secret [sirr], except for those whom God, exalted is He, has protected with the light [nur] of His guidance and His subtle protection.\n\nTherefore, one of them said, \"If only we were saved from this audition head for head.\" For in this category of audition lies a danger greater than the danger of the audition that stirs desire; the ultimate end of that is sin, while the ultimate end of error here is disbelief [kufr].\n\nAnd know that understanding [fahm] may differ according to the states of the listener. Ecstasy [wajd] may overcome two listeners from a single verse; one is correct in his understanding and the other is mistaken, or both may be correct, having understood two different, opposing meanings, but relative to the difference in their states, it is not contradictory. As was narrated regarding 'Utbah the youth: he heard a man say, \"Glory to the Compeller of the heavens! Indeed, the lover is in neglect ['ina].\" He said, \"You have spoken truthfully.\" Another man heard it and said, \"You have lied.\" Someone of insight [basira] said, \"They were both correct, and that is the truth.\" For the affirmation [tasdiq] is the speech of a lover who is not granted access to the Beloved; rather, he is repelled, wearied by rejection, abandonment, and being called a liar. The denial [takdhib] is the speech of one intimate with love, delighting in what he endures due to the intensity of his love, not affected by it, or it is the speech of a lover who is not currently repelled from his goal, nor does he sense the danger of rejection in the ultimate end, due to the dominance of hope and good expectation over his heart [qalb]. Thus, understanding differs according to these differing states.\n\nAnd it was narrated from Abu al-Qasim ibn Marwan—who had kept the company of Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz, may God have mercy on him, and had abandoned attending audition for many years—that he attended a gathering where a person was saying, \"Standing in water, thirsty, yet not given to drink.\" The people rose and were overcome by ecstasy. When they settled, he asked them about the meaning of what had occurred for them from the meaning.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولكن السائحون بنور التوفيق فازوا بالنعيم والملك المقيم وهم الذين سبقت لهم من الله الحسنى واعتبر هذا الملك بملك الدنيا فإنه يقل بالإضافة إلى كثرة الخلق طلابهم ومهما عظم المطلوب قل المساعد ثم الذي يهلك أكثر من الذي يملك ولا يتصدى لطلب الملك العاجز الجبان لعظيم الخطر وطول التعب وإذا كانت النفوس كبارا تعبت في مرادها الأجسام وما أودع الله العز والملك في الدين والدنيا إلا في حيز الخطر وقد يسمى الجبان الجبن والقصور باسم الحزم والحذر كما قيل ترى الجبناء أن الجبن حزم وتلك خديعة الطبع اللئيم فهذا حكم السفر الظاهر إذا أريد به السفر الباطن بمطالعة آيات الله في الأرض.</div></div></div>"}},"102":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.55","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُʿعَmْsَy"},{"b":"0.39","h":"1.19","c":"يَسْمَعُونَ","d":"yasmaʿūna","e":"āَhَsyِsَḥ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.02","c":"حَسِيسَهَا","d":"ḥasīsahā","e":"ْmُhَw"},{"b":"2.9","h":"5.14","c":"وَهُمْ","d":"wahum","e":"àِf"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.04","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"āَm"},{"b":"3.9","h":"6.81","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ْtَhَtْhsٱ"},{"b":"4.1","h":"7.04","c":"اشْتَهَتْ","d":"ish'tahat","e":"ْmُhُsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"4.9","h":"8.49","c":"أَنْفُسُهُمْ","d":"anfusuhum","e":"َnwُdِlَٰhk"},{"b":"6.7","h":"10.8","c":"خَالِدُونَ","d":"khālidūna","e":"āَl"}],"a":{"g":"They will not hear its sound, while they are, in that which their souls desire, abiding eternally."}},"103":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"ُmُhُnُzْḥَy"},{"b":"0.42","h":"1.38","c":"يَحْزُنُهُمُ","d":"yaḥzunuhumu","e":"ُʿعَzَfْlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.36","c":"الْفَزَعُ","d":"l-fazaʿu","e":"ُrَbْkَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.65","c":"الْأَكْبَرُ","d":"l-akbaru","e":"ُmُhٰàَّqَlَtَtَw"},{"b":"3.5","h":"6.2","c":"وَتَتَلَقَّاهُمُ","d":"watatalaqqāhumu","e":"ُẗَkِyʾَٰٓlَmْlٱ"},{"b":"5.3","h":"9.15","c":"الْمَلَائِكَةُ","d":"l-malāikatu","e":"āَhdَٰh"},{"b":"8.2","h":"12.14","c":"هَذَا","d":"hādhā","e":"ُmُkُmْwَy"},{"b":"9.0","h":"13.6","c":"يَوْمُكُمُ","d":"yawmukumu","e":"àِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"10.1","h":"15.15","c":"الَّذِي","d":"alladhī","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"10.9","h":"16.43","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"َnwُdَʿعwُt"},{"b":"12.4","h":"18.32","c":"تُوعَدُونَ","d":"tūʿadūna","e":"َmْwَy"}],"a":{"g":"They will not be grieved by the greatest terror, and the angels will meet them, [saying], \"This is your Day which you have been promised\" -"}},"104":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"àِwْṭَn"},{"b":"0.6","h":"1.59","c":"نَطْوِي","d":"naṭwī","e":"َءٓāَmَّslٱ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.54","c":"السَّمَاءَ","d":"l-samāa","e":"ِّàَṭَk"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.15","c":"كَطَيِّ","d":"kaṭayyi","e":"ِّlِjgِّslٱ"},{"b":"4.4","h":"6.48","c":"السِّجِلِّ","d":"l-sijili","e":"ِbُtُkْlِl"},{"b":"5.5","h":"8.05","c":"لِلْكُتُبِ","d":"lil'kutubi","e":"āَmَk"},{"b":"6.9","h":"11.1","c":"كَمَا","d":"kamā","e":"ٓāَnْaʾَdَb"},{"b":"7.5","h":"11.9","c":"بَدَأْنَا","d":"badanā","e":"َlَّwَaʾ"},{"b":"8.2","h":"15.04","c":"أَوَّلَ","d":"awwala","e":"ٍqْlَhk"},{"b":"11.0","h":"16.28","c":"خَلْقٍ","d":"khalqin","e":"ۥُhُdyِʿعُّn"},{"b":"12.2","h":"17.82","c":"نُعِيدُهُ","d":"nuʿīduhu","e":"āًdْʿعَw"},{"b":"14.0","h":"20.64","c":"وَعْدًا","d":"waʿdan","e":"ٓāَnْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"14.7","h":"21.65","c":"عَلَيْنَا","d":"ʿalaynā","e":"āَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"17.0","h":"24.54","c":"إِنَّا","d":"innā","e":"āَّnُk"},{"b":"18.4","h":"26.16","c":"كُنَّا","d":"kunnā","e":"َnyِlِʿعَٰf"},{"b":"19.9","h":"27.98","c":"فَاعِلِينَ","d":"fāʿilīna","e":"ْdَqَlَw"}],"a":{"g":"The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records.
