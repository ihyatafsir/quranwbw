So what will you do when your limbs have testified against you? So woe, all woe to us, the community of the heedless ones (al-ghāfilīn). Allah sends to us the master of the messengers and reveals to him the Clear Book (al-Kitāb al-Mubīn) and informs us of these attributes from the descriptions of the Day of Recompense (Yawm al-Dīn). Then He makes us aware of our heedlessness (ghafla) and says: 'The reckoning for the people has drawn near, while they are in heedlessness (ghafla), turning away.' Then He makes us aware of the nearness of the Hour (al-Sāʿa) and says: 'The Hour has drawn near and the moon has split. Indeed, they see it as distant, but We see it as near.' 'And what will make you know? Perhaps the Hour is near.' Then the best of our states is that we take the study of this Qur'an as an action, so we do not ponder its meanings, nor do we look at the multitude of descriptions and names of this Day, nor do we prepare to escape from its calamities. So we seek refuge in Allah from this heedlessness (ghafla) if Allah does not reach us with His vast mercy.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنْسَانُ مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ الْكَرِيمِ حَيْثُ أُغْلِقَتِ الْأَبْوَابُ وَأُرْخِيَتِ السُّتُورُ وَاسْتَتَرْتَ عَنِ الْخَلَائِقِ فَقَارَفْتَ الْفُجُورَ فَمَاذَا تَفْعَلُ وَقَدْ شَهِدَتْ عَلَيْكَ جَوَارِحُكَ فَالْوَيْلُ كُلُّ الْوَيْلِ لَنَا مَعْشَرَ الْغَافِلِينَ يُرْسِلُ اللَّهُ لَنَا سَيِّدَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ وَيُنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِ الْكِتَابَ الْمُبِينَ وَيُخْبِرُنَا بِهَذِهِ الصِّفَاتِ مِنْ نُعُوتِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ ثُمَّ يُعَرِّفُنَا غَفْلَتَنَا وَيَقُولُ: ﴿ اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَابُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ مُعْرِضُونَ ﴾  {}  ثُمَّ يُعَرِّفُنَا قُرْبَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَقُولُ اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانْشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ ﴿ إِنَّهُمْ يَرَوْنَهُ بَعِيدًا وَنَرَاهُ قَرِيبًا ﴾  {} ﴿ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ السَّاعَةَ تَكُونُ قَرِيبًا ﴾ {} ثُمَّ يَكُونُ أَحْسَنُ أَحْوَالِنَا أَنْ نَتَّخِذَ دِرَاسَةَ هَذَا الْقُرْآنِ عَمَلًا فَلَا نَتَدَبَّرُ مَعَانِيهِ وَلَا نَنْظُرُ فِي كَثْرَةِ أَوْصَافِ هَذَا الْيَوْمِ وَأَسَامِيهِ وَلَا نَسْتَعِدُّ لِلتَّخَلُّصِ مِنْ دَوَاهِيهِ فَنَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْغَفْلَةِ إِنْ لَمْ يُدَارِكْنَا اللَّهُ بِوَاسِعِ رَحْمَتِهِ.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>Indeed, the departure for what is after death has drawn near, and what remains of life is but little, and the creation is heedless of it.

No new Remembrance (Dhikr) comes to them from their Lord except they listen to it while they play, their Hearts (Qalb) distracted.' And woe to you, O Soul (Nafs)! If your boldness in disobeying Allah is due to your belief that Allah does not see you, then how great is your disbelief (Kufr)! And if it is with your knowledge of His awareness of you, then how severe is your insolence and how little your shame! Woe to you, O Soul (Nafs)! If a slave from your slaves, or rather a brother from your brothers, confronted you with what you dislike, how would your anger be upon him and your hatred for him? So with what audacity do you expose yourself to the hatred of Allah, His anger, and His severe punishment? Do you think you can bear His punishment? Far from it, far from it! Test yourself: if heedlessness distracts you from His painful punishment, then confine yourself for an hour in the sun, or in the bathhouse, or bring your finger near the fire to make clear the extent of your capacity. Are you deluded by the generosity of Allah and His bounty and His independence from your obedience and worship? So why do you not rely on the generosity of Allah, the Exalted, in the affairs of your worldly life? If an enemy intends you, why do you not devise means to repel him, nor entrust him to the generosity of Allah, the Exalted? And if a need for a desire from the desires of the worldly life, which does not end except with the dinar and dirham, overwhelms you, why do you exert the Spirit (Ruh) in seeking it and obtaining it through various means, not relying on the generosity of Allah, the Exalted, until He causes you to stumble upon a treasure or subjugates a slave from His slaves to carry your need to you without effort or seeking from you? Do you reckon that Allah is generous in the Hereafter but not in the worldly life? And you have known that the way of Allah has no change, and that the Lord of the Hereafter and the worldly life is One (Tawhid).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>أما تتدبرين قوله تعالى اقترب للناس حسابهم وهم في غفلة معرضون ما يأتيهم من ذكر من ربهم محدث إلا استمعوه وهم يلعبون لاهية قلوبهم ويحك يا نفس إن كانت جراءتك على معصية الله لاعتقادك أن الله لا يراك فما أعظم كفرك وإن كان مع علمك باطلاعه عليك فما أشد وقاحتك وأقل حياءك ويحك يا نفس لو واجهك عبد من عبيدك بل أخ من إخوانك بما تكرهينه كيف كان غضبك عليه ومقتك له فبأى جسارة تتعرضين لمقت الله وغضبه وشديد عقابه أفتظنين أنك تطيقين عذابه هيهات هيهات جربى نفسك إن ألهاك البطر عن أليم عذابه فاحتبسى ساعة في الشمس أو فى بيت الحمام أو قربى أصبعك من النار ليتبين قدر طاقتك أمتغترين بكرم الله وفضله واستغنائه عن طاعتك وعبادتك فما لك لا تعولين على كرم الله تعالىفي مهمات دنياك فإذا قصدك عدو فلم تستنبطين الحيل في دفعه ولا تكلينه إلى كرم الله تعالى وإذا أرهقتك حاجة إلى شهوة من شهوات الدنيا مما لا ينقضى إلا بالدينار والدرهم فما لك تنزعين الروح في طلبها وتحصيلها من وجوه الحيل فلا تعولين على كرم الله تعالى حتى يعثر بك على كنز أو يسخر عبدا من عبيده فيحمل إليك حاجتك من غير سعى منك ولا طلب أفتحسبين أن الله كريم في الآخرة دون الدنيا وقد عرفت أن سنة الله لا تبديل لها وأن رب الآخرة والدنيا واحد</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-8.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 1: Etiquette of Quran Recitation</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And he was included in the meaning of His Mighty and Majestic saying: 'And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Book except [mere] wishes' meaning mere recitation, and His Mighty and Majestic saying: 'And how many a sign in the heavens and earth they pass over while they are turning away from it' because the Quran is the clarifier of those signs in the heavens and the earth, and whenever he passes over them and is not affected by them, he is turning away from them. Therefore, it is said: Indeed, whoever is not characterized by the morals of the Quran, then when he recites the Quran, Allah the Exalted calls to him: What is your affair with My speech while you are turning away from Me? Leave My speech if you do not repent to Me. And the example of the disobedient one when he recites the Quran and repeats it is like one who repeats the book of the king every day multiple times, while it has been written to him concerning the building of his kingdom, yet he is busy destroying it and restricts himself to studying his book. Perhaps if he left the study at the time of transgression, he would be farther from mockery and deserving of hatred. Therefore, Yusuf ibn Asbat said: Indeed, I intend to recite the Quran, but when I remember what is in it, I fear hatred, so I turn to glorification and seeking forgiveness.

For He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. And I wonder how the Mu'tazilite would answer in his claim that what is most beneficial is obligatory upon Him in a matter we present to him, which is to suppose a debate in the Hereafter between a child and an adult who both died as Muslims. For Allah, the Glorified, increases the degrees of the adult and favors him over the child because he toiled in faith and acts of obedience after puberty, and this is obligatory upon Him according to the Mu'tazilite. So if the child says: 'O Lord, why have You elevated his station above mine?' He would say: 'Because he reached puberty and strove in acts of obedience.' And the child says: 'You caused me to die in childhood, so it was obligatory upon You to prolong my life until I reached puberty so I could strive.' You have deviated from justice in favoring him with long life to my exclusion, so why have You favored him? Allah, the Exalted, says: 'Because I knew that if you had reached puberty, you would have associated partners or disobeyed, so what was most beneficial for you was death in childhood.' This is the Mu'tazilite's excuse for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. And at this, the disbelievers call from the depths of Hellfire and say: 'O Lord, did You not know that if we had reached puberty we would have associated partners? Why did You not cause us to die in childhood? For we would have been content with less than the station of the Muslim child.' With what can this be answered? And is it not necessary at this point except to affirm that divine matters are exalted by the decree of Majesty from being weighed with the scale of the people of Mu'tazila? If it is said: 'Whenever He is able to observe what is most beneficial for the servants, then He subjects them to causes of punishment, that would be ugliness unbecoming of wisdom.' We say: Ugliness is what does not conform.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الأصل السابع: أنه تعالى يفعل بعباده ما يشاء فلا يجب عليه رعاية الأصلح لعباده لما ذكرناه من أنه لا يجب عليه سبحانه شيء بل لا يعقل في حقه الوجوب فإنه لا يسأل عما يفعل وهم يسألون وليت شعري بما يجيب المعتزلي في قوله إن الأصلح واجب عليه في مسألة نعرضها عليه وهو أن يفرض مناظرة في الآخرة بين صبي وبين بالغ ماتا مسلمين فإن الله سبحانه يزيد في درجات البالغ ويفضله على الصبي لأنه تعب بالإيمان والطاعات بعد البلوغ ويجب عليه ذلك عند المعتزلي فلو قال الصبي يا رب لم رفعت منزلته علي فيقول لأنه بلغ واجتهد في الطاعات ويقول الصبي أنت أمتني في الصبا فكان يجب عليك أن تديم حياتي حتى أبلغ فأجتهد فقد عدلت عن العدل في التفضل عليه بطول العمر له دوني فلم فضلته فيقول الله تعالى لأني علمت أنك لو بلغت لأشركت أو عصيت فكان الأصلح لك الموت في الصبا هذا عذر المعتزلي عن الله عز وجل وعند هذا ينادى الكفار من دركات لظى ويقولون يا رب أما علمت أننا إذا بلغنا أشركنا فهلا أمتنا في الصبا فإنا رضينا بما دون منزلة الصبي المسلم فبماذا يجاب عن ذلك وهل يجب عند هذا إلا القطع بأن الأمور الإلهية تتعالى بحكم الجلال عن أن توزن بميزان أهل الاعتزال فإن قيل مهما قدر على رعاية الأصلح للعباد ثم سلط عليهم أسباب العذاب كان ذلك قبحا لا يليق بالحكمة قلنا القبح ما لا يوافق</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-2.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 1: Foundations of Belief</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>The Third Foundation: That the action of the servant, even though it is an acquisition (kasb) for the servant, does not depart from being willed by Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He. Thus, not a blink of an eye, nor a turn of thought, nor a glance of sight occurs in the dominion (al-mulk) and the kingdom (al-malakūt) except by the decree (qadā') of Allah and His power (qudrah) and by His will (irādah) and His volition (mashī'ah). From it [comes] evil and good, benefit and harm, submission (al-Islām) and disbelief (al-kufr), recognition (al-'irfān) and denial (al-nukr), success (al-fawz) and loss (al-khusrān), misguidance (al-ghawāyah) and right guidance (al-rushd), obedience (al-ṭā'ah) and disobedience (al-'iṣyān), polytheism (al-shirk) and faith (al-īmān). There is no averter of His decree, nor any repealer of His judgment. He misguides whom He wills and guides whom He wills. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. Evidence for this from transmission (al-naql) is the statement of the entire community: 'What He wills occurs, and what He does not will does not occur,' and the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic is He: 'If Allah had willed, He would have guided all the people,' and His statement, Exalted is He: 'And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance.' Evidence for this from the perspective of intellect (al-'aql) is that if sins (al-ma'āṣī) and crimes (al-jarā'im) were such that Allah dislikes them and does not will them, and they only occur in accordance with the will of the enemy, Iblīs—may Allah curse him—even though he is an enemy to Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, and what occurs in accordance with the will of the enemy is more than what occurs in accordance with His will, Exalted is He, then I wonder how a Muslim permits himself to reduce the dominion of the Compeller (al-Jabbār), Possessor of Majesty and Honor, to a rank that, if the leadership of a village chief were reduced to it, he would disdain it. For if what continues for the enemy of the chief in the village were more than what is established for him, he would disdain his leadership and disavow his authority. Disobedience (al-ma'ṣiyah) is what predominates over creation, and all of that, according to the innovators (al-mubtadi'ah), occurs contrary to the will of the Truth, Exalted is He. This is the utmost weakness and incapacity—Exalted is the Lord of lords above what the wrongdoers say, greatly exalted. Then, whenever it becomes clear that the actions of the servants are created by Allah, it is correct that they are willed by Him. If it is said: 'How does He prohibit what He wills and command what He does not will?' We say: Command (al-amr) is different from will (al-irādah). Therefore, when a master strikes his servant and the ruler reproaches him for it, and he excuses himself by the rebellion of his servant against him, and the ruler disbelieves him, he wanted to manifest his proof by commanding the...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الأصل الثالث: أن فعل العبد وإن كان كسبا للعبد فلا يخرج عن كونه مرادا لله سبحانه فلا يجري في الملك والملكوت طرفة عين ولا لفتة خاطر ولا فلتة ناظر إلا بقضاء الله وقدرته وبإرادته ومشيئته ومنه الشر والخير والنفع والضر والإسلام والكفر والعرفان والنكر والفوز والخسران والغواية والرشد والطاعة والعصيان والشرك والإيمان لا راد لقضائه ولا معقب لحكمه يضل من يشاء ويهدي من يشاء لا يسئل عما يفعل وهم يسألون ويدل عليه من النقل قول الأمة قاطبة ما شاء كان وما لم يشأ لم يكن وقول الله عز وجل أن لو يشاء الله لهدى الناس جميعا وقوله تعالى ولو شئنا لآتينا كل نفس هداها ويدل عليه من جهة العقل أن المعاصي والجرائم إن كان الله يكرهها ولا يريدها وإنما هي جارية على وفق إرادة العدو إبليس لعنه الله مع أنه عدو لله سبحانه والجاري على وفق إرادة العدو أكثر من الجاري على وفق إرادته تعالى فليت شعري كيف يستجيز المسلم أن يرد ملك الجبار ذي الجلال والإكرام إلى رتبة لو ردت إليها رياسة زعيم ضيعة لاستنكف منها إذ لو كان ما يستمر لعدو الزعيم في القرية أكثر مما يستقيم له لاستنكف من زعامته وتبرأ عن ولايته والمعصية هي الغالبة على الخلق وكل ذلك جار عند المبتدعة على خلاف إرادة الحق تعالى وهذا غاية الضعف والعجز تعالى رب الأرباب عن قول الظالمين علوا كبيرا ثم مهما ظهر أن أفعال العباد مخلوقة لله صح أنها مرادة له فإن قيل فكيف ينهى عما يريد ويأمر بما لا يريد قلنا الأمر غير الإرادة ولذلك إذا ضرب السيد عبده فعاتبه السلطان عليه فاعتذر بتمرد عبده عليه فكذبه السلطان فأراد إظهار حجته بأن يأمر الع</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book2.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Patience and Gratitude</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>So the term 'Decree (Qada)' corresponds to the single universal command, and the term 'Divine Measure (Qadar)' corresponds to the detailed specification extending without end.

Then it occurred to some servants (عباد) why the apportionment necessitated this detailed specification and how justice was organized with this disparity and preferential treatment. And some of them, due to their deficiency, could not bear to observe the reality (كنه) of this matter and encompass its totality, so they were restrained from what they could not bear to plunge into its depth by the bridle of prohibition. And it was said to them: 'Be still, for you were not created for this. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.'

Then know that every Muslim is awaiting the intercession of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the relative is also worthy of hoping for it, but on the condition that he fears Allah (Taqwa) that He not be angry with him. For if He is angry with him, then He does not permit anyone to intercede for him, because sins are divided into that which necessitates wrath (Maaqt), so intercession is not permitted for it, and into that which is forgiven due to intercession, like sins with the kings of the world. For every person of status with the king cannot intercede in that which the king's anger has intensified against. So among sins are those from which intercession does not save, and about it is the expression by His saying, the Most High, \"Nor do they intercede except for him whom He approves\" (Quran 21:28), and by His saying, \"Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?\" (Quran 2:255), and by His saying, \"And intercession does not benefit with Him except for him whom He permits\" (Quran 34:23), and by His saying, \"So their intercession will not benefit them\" (Quran 74:48). And when sins are divided into that in which there is intercession and into that in which there is no intercession, fear (Khawf) and apprehension (Ishfaq) become obligatory without doubt.

If there is weakness in your faith (Iman), then strengthen the faith (Iman) by looking at the first creation, for the second is like it and easier than it. And if you are strong in faith (Iman) in it, then make your heart (Qalb) feel those fears and dangers, and increase in it reflection (Tafakkur) and consideration (I'tibar) to strip from your heart (Qalb) comfort and settlement, so you busy yourself with preparing for the presentation before the Almighty (Al-Jabbar). And reflect first on what strikes the hearing of the inhabitants of the graves from the intensity of blowing the Trumpet (As-Sur), for it is a single cry by which the graves split open from the heads of the dead, and they rise up all at once. So imagine yourself having leapt up, your face changed, your body dusty from your scalp to your feet from the dust of your grave, stunned from the intensity of the blow, your eye fixed toward the call. And the creation has risen up in one uprising from the graves in which their tribulation has been prolonged, and alarm and terror have agitated them, added to what they had of sorrows and griefs and intense waiting for the outcome of the matter, as the Exalted said: 'And the Trumpet (As-Sur) will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.' And the Exalted said: 'And when the Horn (An-Naqur) is blown, that Day will be a difficult day for the disbelievers; not easy.' And the Exalted said: 'And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\" They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing. And they will not be able to make a testament, nor to their people can they return. And the Trumpet (As-Sur) will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten. They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping place? This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.\"' So if there were not before the dead except the terror of that blowing, it would be worthy to be feared, for it is a blowing and a cry by which those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning they die by it except whom Allah wills, and that is some of the angels. And therefore the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'How can I be at ease when the possessor of the Trumpet (As-Sur) has taken the horn in his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, waiting for when he is commanded to blow?' Maqatil said: The Trumpet (As-Sur) is the horn, and that Israfil (upon him be peace) is placing his mouth on the horn like the form of a trumpet, and the circle of the horn's head is like the width of the heavens and the earth, and he is fixing his gaze toward the Throne, waiting for when he is commanded to blow the first blowing. And when he blows, those in the heavens and the earth are struck dead, meaning every animal dies from the intensity of the alarm except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt). Then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded to take the soul (Ruh) of Jibril, then the soul (Ruh) of Mika'il, then the soul (Ruh) of Israfil, then the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt) is commanded and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blowing in the Barzakh for forty years, then Allah the Exalted revives Israfil and commands.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em;

العين نحو النداء وقد ثار الخلق ثورة واحدة من القبور التى طال فيها بلاؤهم وقد أزعجهم الفزع والرعب مضافا إلى ما كان عندهم من الهموم والغموم وشدة الانتظار لعاقبة الأمر كما قال تعالى: ﴿ ونفخ فى الصور فصعق من فى السموات ومن فى الأرض إلا من شاء الله ثم نفخ فيه أخرى فإذا هم قيام ينظرون ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ فإذا نقر فى الناقور فذلك يومئذ يوم عسير على الكافرين غير يسير ﴾ {} وقال تعال: ﴿ ويقولون متى هذا الوعد إن كنتم صادقين ما ينظرون إلا صيحة واحدة تأخذهم وهم يخصمون فلا يستطيعون توصية ولا إلى أهلهم يرجعون ونفخ فى الصور فإذا هم من الأجداث إلى ربهم ينسلون قالوا يا ويلنا من بعثنا من مرقدنا هذا ما وعد الرحمن وصدق المرسلون ﴾ {} فلو لم يكن بين يدي الموتي إلا هول تلك النفخة لكان ذلك جديرا بأن يتقى فإنها نفخة وصيحة يصعق بها من فى السموات والأرض يعنى يموتون بها إلا من شاء الله وهو بعض الملائكة ولذلك قال رسول الله ﭬ: (كيف أنعم وصاحب الصور قد التقم القرن وحنى الجبهة وأصغى بالأذن متى يؤمر فينفخ[144]) قال مقاتل: الصور هو القرن وذلك أن إسرافيل عليه السلام واضع فاه على القرن كهيئة البوق ودائرة رأس القرن كعرض السموات والأرض وهو شاخص بصره نحو العرش ينتظر متى يؤمر فينفخ النفخة الأولى فإذا نفخ صعق من فى السموات والأرض أى مات كل حيوان من شدة الفزع إلا من شاء الله وهو جبريل وميكائيل وإسرافيل وملك الموت ثم يأمر ملك الموت أن يقبض روح جبريل ثم روح ميكائيل ثم روح إسرافيل ثم يأمر ملك الموت فيموت ثم يلبث الخلق بعد النفخة الأولى فى البرزخ أربعين سنة ثم يحيى الله تعالى إسرافيل فيأمر</div></div></div>"}},"39":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.2","c":"لَوْ","d":"law","e":"ُmَlْʿعَy"},{"b":"0.38","h":"0.49","c":"يَعْلَمُ","d":"yaʿlamu","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.37","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"۟āwُrَfَk"},{"b":"2.2","h":"2.45","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"َnyِḥ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"3.4","c":"حِينَ","d":"ḥīna","e":"āَl"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.16","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُّfُkَy"},{"b":"4.0","h":"4.52","c":"يَكُفُّونَ","d":"yakuffūna","e":"nَʿع"},{"b":"5.2","h":"5.96","c":"عَنْ","d":"ʿan","e":"ُmِhِhwُjgُw"},{"b":"5.5","h":"6.34","c":"وُجُوهِهِمُ","d":"wujūhihimu","e":"َrāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"7.3","h":"8.53","c":"النَّارَ","d":"l-nāra","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"8.7","h":"9.8","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"nَʿع"},{"b":"9.1","h":"10.42","c":"عَنْ","d":"ʿan","e":"ْmِhِrwُhُẓ"},{"b":"9.4","h":"11.59","c":"ظُهُورِهِمْ","d":"ẓuhūrihim","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"20.4","h":"13.02","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"23.6","h":"13.7","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"َnwُrَṣnُy"},{"b":"23.9","h":"14.21","c":"يُنْصَرُونَ","d":"yunṣarūna","e":"ْlَb"}],"a":{"g":"If

Allah the Exalted said: 'And We will set up the balances of justice (al-Mawazin al-Qist) for the Day of Resurrection' (Surah Al-Anbiya: 47). And He said: 'Then as for those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful ones. And as for those whose scales are light' (Surah Al-Muminun: 102-103). And its interpretation (Wajhuha) is that Allah the Exalted creates in the scrolls of deeds a weight (Waznan) according to the degrees of deeds with Allah the Exalted, so the measures (Maqadir) of the deeds of the servants become known to the servants until justice (al-Adl) in punishment or favor (al-Fadl) in pardon and multiplication of reward becomes apparent to them.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الأصل الرابع: الميزان وهو حق قال الله تعالى: ﴿ ونضع الموازين القسط ليوم القيامة ﴾ { سورة الأنبيآء: 47 } وقال تعالى: ﴿ فمن ثقلت موازينه فأولئك هم المفلحون. ومن خفت موازينه ﴾ { سورة المؤمنون:102، 103 } ووجهها أن الله تعالى يحدث في صحائف الأعمال وزنا بحسب درجات الأعمال عند الله تعالى فتصير مقادير أعمال العباد معلومة للعباد حتى يظهر لهم العدل في العقاب أو الفضل في العفو وتضعيف الثواب.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='#' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Watchfulness and Self-Examination</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>The thoughts (Khawatir) of His servants when they stir—He from Whose knowledge not an atom's weight in the heavens or earth escapes, whether it moves or is still—the Accountant (Al-Muhasib) over the smallest and the largest of deeds, even if hidden; the Bestower of favor (Al-Mutafaddil) by accepting the acts of obedience (Taat) of the servants, even if small; the One who extends pardon (Al-Mutawwil) by forgiving their sins, even if numerous. And He only accounts them so that every soul (Nafs) may know what it has brought forth and reflect on what it has sent ahead and left behind, so it knows that were it not for its adherence to vigilance (Muraqabah) and self-accounting (Muhasabah) in this world, it would be exposed on the plain of Resurrection and perish. And after striving (Mujahadah), self-accounting, and vigilance, were it not for His grace (Fadl) in accepting their meager offering, it would fail and lose. So glory be to Him whose favor (Nimat) encompasses all servants, and whose mercy (Rahmah) embraces and pervades the creatures in this world and the next, and overwhelms. And by the breaths of His grace, the hearts (Qulub) expanded for faith (Iman) and were opened, and by the blessing of His enabling success (Tawfiq), the limbs (Jawarih) were bound to acts of worship (Ibadat) and disciplined, and by the excellence of His guidance (Hidayah), the darknesses of ignorance (Jahl) cleared from the hearts and dispersed, and by His support (Tayid) and victory (Nasr), the schemes of Satan (Shaytan) were cut off and repelled, and by the gentleness of His care (Inayah), the scale of good deeds (Hasanat) tips when heavy, and by His facilitation (Taysir), what is facilitated of acts of obedience is facilitated. From Him is the giving and the recompense, the distancing and the drawing near, the making happy and the making wretched. And prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the master of the prophets, and upon his family, the masters of the chosen ones, and upon his companions, the leaders of the pious. Then after, Allah the Exalted said: 'And We will set up the scales of justice (Al-Mawazin Al-Qist) for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be wronged at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed (Habbah min Khardal), We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant (Hasib).' And He said: 'And the record [of deeds] will be placed, and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, \"Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?\" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one.' And He said: 'On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did. Allah has enumerated it, and they have forgotten it; and Allah is, over all things, Witness.' And He said: 'That Day, the people will depart separated [into categories] to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.' And He said: 'Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.' And He said: 'On the Day when every soul will find what it did of good present [before it] and what it did of evil, it will wish that between itself and that [evil] was a great distance. And Allah warns you of Himself.' And He said: 'And know that Allah knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him.' So the possessors of insight (Arbab Al-Basair) from among the servants recognized that Allah the Exalted is lying in wait for them and that they will be scrutinized in the account and demanded with atom's weights of thoughts (Khawatir) and glances (Lahzat). And they realized that nothing saves them from these dangers except adherence to self-accounting, sincerity in vigilance, and demanding accountability from the soul (Nafs) in breaths (Anfas) and movements (Harakat), and accounting it for thoughts and glances. For whoever accounts his soul before being accounted, his account on the Day of Resurrection will be lightened, his answer will be present at the questioning, and his outcome and return will be good. And whoever does not account his soul, it persists.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>خواطر عباده إذا اختلجت الذى لا يعزب عن علمه مثقال ذرة في السموات والأرض تحركت أو سكنت المحاسب على النقير والقطمير والقليل والكثير من الأعمال وإن خفيت المتفضل بقبول طاعات العباد وان صغرت المتطول بالعفو عن من معاصيهم وإن كثرت وإنما يحاسبهم لتعلم كل نفس ما أحضرت وتنظر فيما قدمت وأخرت فتعلم انه لولا لزومها للمراقبة والمحاسبة في الدنيا لشفيت في صعيد القيامة وهلكت وبعد المجاهدة والمحاسبة والمراقبة لولا فضله بقبول بضاعتها المزجاة لخابت وخسرت فسبحان من عمت نعمته كافة العباد وشملت واستغرقت رحمته الخلائق في الدنيا والآخرة وغمرت فبنفحات فضله اتسعت القلوب للإيمان وانشرحت وبيمن توفيقه تقيدت الجوارح بالعبادات وتأدبت وبحسن هدايته انجلت عن القلوب ظلمات الجهل وانقشعت وبتأييده ونصرته انقطعت مكايد الشيطان واندفعت وبلطف عنايته تترجح كفة الحسنات إذا ثقلت وبتيسيره تيسرت من الطاعات ما تيسرت فمنه العطاء والجزاء والإبعاد والإدناء والإسعاد والإشقاء والصلاة والسلام علي محمد سيد الأنبياء وعلى اله سادة الأصفياء وعلى أصحابه قادة الأتقياء أما بعد فقد قال الله تعالى ونضع الموازين القسط ليوم القيامة فلا تظلم نفس شيئا وان كان مثقال حبة من خردل أتينا بها وكفى بنا حاسبين وقال تعالى ووضع الكتاب فترى المجرمين مشفقين مما فيه ويقولون يا ويلتنا ما لهذا الكتاب لا يغادر صغيرة ولا كبيرة الا أحصاها ووجدوا ما عملوا حاضرا ولا يظلم ربك أحدا وقال تعالى يوم يبعثهم الله جميعا فينبئهم بما عملوا أحصاه الله ونسوه والله على كل شىء شهيد وقال تعالى يومئذ يصدر الناس أشتاتا ليروا أعمالهم فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيرا يره ومن يعمل مثقال ذرة شرا يره وقال تعالى ثم توفى كل نفس ما كسبت وهم لا يظلمون وقال تعالى يوم تجد كل نفس ما عملت من خير محضرا وما عملت من سوء تود لو أن بينها وبينه أمدا بعيدا ويحذركم الله نفسه وقال تعالى واعلموا أن الله يعلم ما في أنفسكم فاحذروه فعرف أرباب البصائر من جملة العباد أن الله تعالى لهم بالمرصاد وأنهم سيناقشون في الحساب ويطالبون بمثاقيل الذر من الخطرات واللحظات وتحققوا أنه لا ينجيهم من هذه الأخطار إلا لزوم المحاسبة وصدق المراقبة ومطالبة النفس في الأنفاس والحركات ومحاسبتها في الخطرات واللحظات فمن حاسب نفسه قبل أن يحاسب خف في القيامة حسابه وحضر عند السؤال جوابه وحسن منقلبه ومآبه ومن لم يحاسب نفسه دامت</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-9a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Pride and Conceit</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And He (Allah) said: \"And We will set up the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul (Nafs) will be wronged at all.

So the Guidance (Rushd) is an expression for a guidance (Hidayah) that motivates toward the direction of happiness (Al-Sa'adah) and moves toward it. For the boy when he reaches puberty, knowledgeable about preserving wealth and ways of commerce and growth, but with that he squanders and does not desire growth, he is not called guided (Rashid), not due to absence of his guidance (Hidayah) but due to deficiency of his guidance (Hidayah) in moving his motivation (Da'iyah). For how many a person proceeds upon what he knows harms him, he has been given the guidance (Hidayah) and distinguished by it from the ignorant one who does not know that it harms him, but he has not been given the Guidance (Rushd).

This is like the saying of Abraham (peace be upon him): 'Uff (an expression of disgust) to you and to what you worship besides Allah. Do you not then understand?' And we do not mean by reviling and obscenity that which involves attribution to fornication and its preliminaries, nor lying, but rather addressing him with what is not considered among obscenities, such as saying: 'O transgressor (Fasiq), O fool (Ahmaq), O ignorant one (Jahil), do you not fear Allah?' and like saying: 'O black one (Sawadi), O stupid one (Ghabi),' and what runs in this course. For every transgressor (Fasiq) is a fool (Ahmaq) and ignorant (Jahil), and were it not for his foolishness (Hamaq), he would not disobey Allah Almighty. Rather, everyone who is not prudent (Kays) is a fool (Ahmaq), and the prudent one (Kays) is he whom the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) testified to for prudence (Kaysah) when he said: 'The prudent one (Kays) is he who holds his Soul (Nafs) accountable and works for what is after death,' and the fool (Ahmaq) is he who follows his Soul's (Nafs) desire (Hawa) and wishes upon Allah. The hadith: 'The prudent one (Kays) is he who holds his Soul (Nafs) accountable and works for what is after death'—the hadith was reported by Al-Tirmidhi who said it is hasan, and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Shaddad ibn Aws. For this rank, there are two etiquettes: one is not to proceed to it except out of necessity and incapacity for gentleness, and the second is not to speak except with truth and not to indulge in it by letting his long tongue loose with what is not needed, but rather to limit to the extent of need. If he knows that addressing him with these deterrent words does not deter him, then it is not appropriate to let it loose, but rather to limit to showing anger and contempt for him and disdain for his place due to his disobedience.

So who knows that he is from those for whom the good (Al-Husna) has preceded from Allah? And it was said regarding the meaning of His saying, the Exalted: 'And the agony of death (Sakrat Al-Mawt) comes with the truth (Al-Haqq)' - meaning with the precedent (As-Sabiqah), that is, it reveals it. And some of the predecessors (As-Salaf) said: 'Only the endings (Al-Khawatim) of deeds are weighed.'
