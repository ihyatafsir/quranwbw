So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. Thus, the possessors of insight [ulu al-basa'ir] from among the servants came to know that Allah, the Exalted, lies in wait for them, and that they will be scrutinized in the Reckoning [hisab] and held accountable for the atom's weights of glances [lahazat] and passing thoughts [khawatir]. And they realized that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning [muhasaba] and sincere self-observation [muraqaba], and holding the soul [nafs] to account for every breath and movement, and reckoning with it for every passing thought and glance. For whoever holds his soul to account before he is held to account, his reckoning on the Day of Standing [al-qiyamah] will be lightened, his answer will be present when questioned, and his return and final destination will be good. And whoever does not hold his soul to account, his regrets will be prolonged, and his halts in the plains of the Standing will be lengthy, and his evil deeds will lead him to disgrace and contempt. When this was unveiled to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to Allah. And He has commanded them with patience [sabr] and vigilant guarding [murabata], so He, the Mighty and Sublime, said: \"O you who have believed, be patient and endure and guard [rabitū].\" So they began by guarding their souls [anfus]: first, by making a covenant [al-musharata]; then, by self-observation [al-muraqaba]; then, by self-reckoning [al-muhasaba]; then, by self-punishment [al-mu'aqaba]; then, by striving [al-mujahada]; then, by self-reproof [al-mu'ataba]. Thus, for them in vigilant guarding [al-murabata] were six stations [maqamat]. And it is necessary to explain them, clarify their reality and virtue, and detail the works within them. The foundation of all that is self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], but every reckoning is preceded by a covenant [musharata] and self-observation [muraqaba], and is followed, in case of loss, by self-reproof [mu'ataba] and self-punishment [mu'aqaba].</div></div></div>"}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.9","c":"فَمَنْ","d":"faman","e":"nَmَf"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.49","c":"يَعْمَلْ","d":"yaʿmal","e":"ْlَmْʿعَy"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.54","c":"مِثْقَالَ","d":"mith'qāla","e":"َlāَqْhtِm"},{"b":"3.1","h":"5.33","c":"ذَرَّةٍ","d":"dharratin","e":"ٍẗَّrَhd"},{"b":"4.2","h":"7.14","c":"خَيْرًا","d":"khayran","e":"āًrْyَhk"},{"b":"5.8","h":"8.92","c":"يَرَهُ","d":"yarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَy"}],"a":{"g":"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 1</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, the ruling on mixed action [al-'amal al-mashub] and its deserving of reward: Know that if an action is not purely for the sake of God [li-wajh Allah] Almighty, but is mixed with a taint of ostentation [riya'] or the aims of the self [huzuz al-nafs], people have differed concerning this: does it necessitate a reward, or does it necessitate punishment, or does it necessitate nothing at all, so there is neither for him nor against him?
