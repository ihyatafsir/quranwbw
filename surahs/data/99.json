So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. Thus, the possessors of insight [ulu al-basa'ir] from among the servants came to know that Allah, the Exalted, lies in wait for them, and that they will be scrutinized in the Reckoning [hisab] and held accountable for the atom's weights of glances [lahazat] and passing thoughts [khawatir]. And they realized that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning [muhasaba] and sincere self-observation [muraqaba], and holding the soul [nafs] to account for every breath and movement, and reckoning with it for every passing thought and glance. For whoever holds his soul to account before he is held to account, his reckoning on the Day of Standing [al-qiyamah] will be lightened, his answer will be present when questioned, and his return and final destination will be good. And whoever does not hold his soul to account, his regrets will be prolonged, and his halts in the plains of the Standing will be lengthy, and his evil deeds will lead him to disgrace and contempt. When this was unveiled to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to Allah. And He has commanded them with patience [sabr] and vigilant guarding [murabata], so He, the Mighty and Sublime, said: \"O you who have believed, be patient and endure and guard [rabitū].\" So they began by guarding their souls [anfus]: first, by making a covenant [al-musharata]; then, by self-observation [al-muraqaba]; then, by self-reckoning [al-muhasaba]; then, by self-punishment [al-mu'aqaba]; then, by striving [al-mujahada]; then, by self-reproof [al-mu'ataba]. Thus, for them in vigilant guarding [al-murabata] were six stations [maqamat]. And it is necessary to explain them, clarify their reality and virtue, and detail the works within them. The foundation of all that is self-reckoning [al-muhasaba], but every reckoning is preceded by a covenant [musharata] and self-observation [muraqaba], and is followed, in case of loss, by self-reproof [mu'ataba] and self-punishment [mu'aqaba].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال تعالى يومئذ يصدر الناس أشتاتا ليروا أعمالهم فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيرا يره ومن يعمل مثقال ذرة شرا يره فعرف أرباب البصائر من جملة العباد أن الله تعالى لهم بالمرصاد وأنهم سيناقشون في الحساب ويطالبون بمثاقيل الذر من الخطرات واللحظات وتحققوا أنه لا ينجيهم من هذه الأخطار إلا لزوم المحاسبة وصدق المراقبة ومطالبة النفس في الأنفاس والحركات ومحاسبتها في الخطرات واللحظات فمن حاسب نفسه قبل أن يحاسب خف في القيامة حسابه وحضر عند السؤال جوابه وحسن منقلبه ومآبه ومن لم يحاسب نفسه دامت حسراته وطالت في عرصات القيامة وقفاته وقادته إلى الخزى والمقت سيئاته فلما انكشف لهم ذلك علموا أنه لا ينجيهم منه إلا طاعة الله وقد أمرهم بالصبر والمرابطة فقال عز من قائل يا أيها الذين آمنو اصبروا وصابروا ورابطوا فرابطوا أنفسهم أولا بالمشارطة ثم بالمراقبة ثم بالمحاسبة ثم بالمعاقبة ثم بالمجاهدة ثم بالمعاتبة فكانت لهم في المرابطة ست مقامات ولا بد من شرحها وبيان حقيقتها وفضيلتها وتفصيل الأعمال فيها وأصل ذلك المحاسبة ولكن كل حساب فبعد مشارطة ومراقبة ويتبعه عند الخسران المعاتبة والمعاقبة.</div></div></div>"}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.9","c":"فَمَنْ","d":"faman","e":"nَmَf"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.49","c":"يَعْمَلْ","d":"yaʿmal","e":"ْlَmْʿعَy"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.54","c":"مِثْقَالَ","d":"mith'qāla","e":"َlāَqْhtِm"},{"b":"3.1","h":"5.33","c":"ذَرَّةٍ","d":"dharratin","e":"ٍẗَّrَhd"},{"b":"4.2","h":"7.14","c":"خَيْرًا","d":"khayran","e":"āًrْyَhk"},{"b":"5.8","h":"8.92","c":"يَرَهُ","d":"yarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَy"}],"a":{"g":"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-1.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Book of Knowledge</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, the ruling on mixed action [al-'amal al-mashub] and its deserving of reward: Know that if an action is not purely for the sake of God [li-wajh Allah] Almighty, but is mixed with a taint of ostentation [riya'] or the aims of the self [huzuz al-nafs], people have differed concerning this: does it necessitate a reward, or does it necessitate punishment, or does it necessitate nothing at all, so there is neither for him nor against him? As for that which was intended only for ostentation [riya'], it is against him without doubt, and it is a cause for wrath and punishment. As for that which is purely for the sake of God [li-wajh Allah] Almighty, it is a cause for reward. The consideration is only concerning the mixed [al-mashub].\n\nThe apparent meaning of the reports indicates that there is no reward for it, yet the reports are not free of contradiction concerning it. That which becomes clear to me regarding it—and the knowledge is with God—is to look at the measure of the strength of the motive [ba'ith]. If the religious motive [al-ba'ith al-dini] is equal to the motive of the self [ba'ith al-nafs], they counterbalance and nullify each other, and the action becomes neither for him nor against him. If the motive of ostentation [ba'ith al-riya'] is more dominant and stronger, then it is not beneficial, and it is moreover harmful and leads to punishment. Yes, the punishment within it is lighter than the punishment for the action that was purely for ostentation [riya'] and was not mixed with any element of drawing near [taqarrub].\n\nIf the intention of drawing near [qasd al-taqarrub] is more dominant in comparison to the other motive, then he has a reward according to the measure of what exceeded from the strength of the religious motive [al-ba'ith al-dini]. This is due to His saying, Almighty: \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.\" And His saying, Almighty: \"Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight. And if there is a good deed, He multiplies it.\" Therefore, the intention of good [qasd al-khayr] should not be wasted. Rather, if it was dominant over the intention of ostentation [qasd al-riya'], the portion equal to it is nullified, and the excess remains. If it was dominated, something of the punishment for the corrupt intention [al-qasd al-fasid] is dropped because of it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وبالجملة فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيرا يره ومن يعمل مثقال ذرة شرا يره ومن قصد الله تعالى بالعلم أي علم كان نفعه ورفعه لا محالة.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book3.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Fear and Hope</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, whoever does an atom's weight [mithqāl dharratin] of good [khayran] will see it [yarah].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>قوله: ﴿ فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيرا يره ﴾ {} الآيتين</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.2","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"1.6","c":"يَعْمَلْ","d":"yaʿmal","e":"ْlَmْʿعَy"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.95","c":"مِثْقَالَ","d":"mith'qāla","e":"َlāَqْhtِm"},{"b":"3.4","h":"4.8","c":"ذَرَّةٍ","d":"dharratin","e":"ٍẗَّrَhd"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.04","c":"شَرًّا","d":"sharran","e":"āًّrَhs"},{"b":"7.5","h":"9.43","c":"يَرَهُ","d":"yarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَy"}],"a":{"g":"And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it."}}}
