For the negligent in the matter, it is said that he forgot the matter and the recitation of the Quran.

As for that which was intended only with showing off (Riya'), it is against him decisively and is a cause of wrath and punishment. And as for that which is purely for the Face (Wajh) of Allah the Exalted, it is a cause of reward. The consideration is regarding the mixed [deed]. The apparent reports indicate that there is no reward for it, and the reports are not free from contradiction in this matter. What becomes clear regarding it—and knowledge is with Allah—is to look at the measure of the strength of the motivator. If the religious motivator is equal to the soul (Nafs) motivator, they counterbalance and cancel each other out, and the deed becomes neither for him nor against him. And if the motivator of showing off (Riya') is predominant and stronger, then it is not beneficial, and it is moreover harmful and leads to punishment—yes, the punishment in it is lighter than the punishment of the deed that was purely for showing off (Riya') and not mixed with any taint of drawing near (Taqarrub). And if the intention of drawing near (Taqarrub) is predominant in comparison to the other motivator, then he has reward according to what remains of the strength of the religious motivator. And this is due to His saying, the Exalted: 'So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it' (Quran 99:7-8), and due to His saying, the Exalted: 'Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; and if there is a good deed, He multiplies it' (Quran 4:40). So it is not fitting that the intention of good be wasted. Rather, if it is predominant over the intention of showing off (Riya'), the amount that equals it is invalidated, and the increase remains. And if it is overcome, something of the punishment of the corrupt intention falls away because of it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>اعلم أن العمل إذا لم يكن خالصا لوجه الله تعالى بل امتزج به شوب من الرياء أو حظوظ النفس فقد اختلف الناس في أن ذلك هل يقتضي ثوابا أم يقتضي عقابا أم لا يقتضي شيئا أصلا فلا يكون له ولا عليه أما الذي لم يرد به إلا الرياء فهو عليه قطعا وهو سبب المقت والعقاب وأما الخالص لوجه الله تعالى فهو سبب الثواب وإنما النظر في المشوب وظاهر الأخبار تدل على أنه لا ثواب له[45] وليس تخلو الأخبار عن تعارض فيه والذي ينقدح لما فيه والعلم عند الله أن ينظر إلى قدر قوة الباعث فإن كان الباعث الديني مساويا للباعث النفسي تقاوما وتساقطا وصار العمل لا له ولا عليه وإن كان باعث الرياء أغلب وأقوى فهو ليس بنافع وهو مع ذلك مضر ومفض للعقاب نعم العقاب الذي فيه أخف من عقاب العمل الذي تجرد للرياء ولم يمتزج به شائبه التقرب وإن كان قصد التقرب أغلب بالإضافة إلى الباعث الآخر فله ثواب بقدر ما فضل من قوة الباعث الديني وهذا لقوله تعالى فمن يعمل مثقال ذرة خيرا يره ومن يعمل مثقال ذرة شرا يره ولقوله تعالى إن الله لا يظلم مثقال ذرة وإن تك حسنة يضاعفها فلا ينبغي أن يضيع قصد الخير بل إن كان غالبا على قصد الرياء حبط منه القدر الذي يساويه وبقيت زيادة وإن كان مغلوبا سقط بسببه شيء من عقوبة القصد الفاسد.</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.2","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"nَmَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"1.6","c":"يَعْمَلْ","d":"yaʿmal","e":"ْlَmْʿعَy"},{"b":"2.4","h":"2.95","c":"مِثْقَالَ","d":"mith'qāla","e":"َlāَqْhtِm"},{"b":"3.4","h":"4.8","c":"ذَرَّةٍ","d":"dharratin","e":"ٍẗَّrَhd"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.04","c":"شَرًّا","d":"sharran","e":"āًّrَhs"},{"b":"7.5","h":"9.43","c":"يَرَهُ","d":"yarahu","e":"ۥُhَrَy"}],"a":{"g":"And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #fcfaf2; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif; font-size: 1.2em;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din <span style='font-size: 0.8em; color: #888;'>(Verbatim V3)</span></h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And it is not that his hope is limited to a month like one whose hope is for a month and a day, but between them there is a difference in degree with Allah, for Allah does not wrong (even) the weight of an atom (mithqāla dharratin).
