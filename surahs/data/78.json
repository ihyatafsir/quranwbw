Thus they combined in speech between the conclusions of intellects and the transmitted rulings of the Sacred Law [al-shar' al-manqool], and they realized that uttering that by which they were commanded to worship—the saying \"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the Messenger of God\"—has no substance or yield unless there is realized a comprehensive grasp of the pivotal points and foundational principles [al-aqtab wal-usool] upon which this testimony revolves.\n\nAnd they knew that the two phrases of the testimony, despite their brevity, encompass the affirmation of the Essence [dhat] of the Divine, the affirmation of His Attributes [sifat], the affirmation of His Actions [af'al], and the affirmation of the truthfulness of the Messenger. And they learned that faith [al-iman] is built upon these pillars, which are four, and each pillar revolves upon ten foundational principles [usool].\n\nThe First Pillar is in the knowledge [ma'rifa] of the Essence [dhat] of God, the Exalted, and its orbit is upon ten foundational principles [usool]: The knowledge of the existence [wujud] of God, the Exalted, His Pre-Eternity [qidam], His Everlastingness [baqa'], that He is not a substance [jawhar] nor a body [jism] nor an accident ['arad], that He, Glory be to Him, is not specified by a direction [jiha] nor settled in a place [makan], that He will be seen [yura], and that He is One [wahid].\n\nThe Second Pillar is in His Attributes [sifat] and comprises ten foundational principles [usool]: The knowledge that He is Living [hayy], Knowing ['alim], Powerful [qadir], Willing [murid], Hearing [sami'], Seeing [basir], Speaking [mutakallim], sanctified from the inherence of temporal events [hulool al-hawadith], and that His Speech [kalam], Knowledge ['ilm], and Will [irada] are Pre-Eternal [qadim].\n\nThe Third Pillar is in His Actions [af'al], the Exalted, and its orbit is upon ten foundational principles [usool]: That the actions of the servants are created [makhluqa] by God, the Exalted, that they are acquired [muktasaba] by the servants, that they are willed [murada] by God, the Exalted, that He is the Bestower of favor [mutafaddil] through creation and origination, that He, the Exalted, imposes obligation [taklif] of what is beyond capacity, that for Him, the Exalted, is the causing of pain to the innocent, and that it is not incumbent upon Him to observe what is most beneficial, that nothing is obligatory [wajib] except by the Sacred Law [al-shar'], that the sending of the prophets is permissible, and that the prophethood [nubuwwa] of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is established, confirmed by the miracle [al-mu'jiza].\n\nThe Fourth Pillar is in the transmitted matters [al-sam'iyyat] and its orbit is upon ten foundational principles [usool]: The affirmation of the Gathering [al-hashr] and the Resurrection [al-nushur], the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, the punishment of the grave ['adhab al-qabr], the Scale [al-mizan], the Bridge [al-sirat], the creation of Paradise [al-janna] and the Fire [al-nar], the rulings concerning the Imamate [al-imama], that the merit of the Companions is according to their order, and the conditions of the Imamate.\n\n(As for the First Pillar from the pillars of faith [arkan al-iman], in the knowledge [ma'rifa] of the Essence [dhat] of God, Glory be to Him, the Exalted, and that God, the Exalted, is One, and its orbit is upon ten foundational principles [usool]) The First Principle [al-asl al-awwal]: The knowledge [ma'rifa] of His Existence [wujud], the Exalted. And the first of the lights [al-anwar] by which illumination is sought, and the path of consideration [tariq al-i'tibar] which is embarked upon, is that to which the Qur'an has guided, for there is no clarification after the clarification of God, Glory be to Him. And indeed He, the Exalted, has said: \"Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes? And created you in pairs? And made your sleep for rest? And made the night as a covering? And made the day for livelihood? And constructed above you seven strong [heavens]? And made [therein] a burning lamp? And sent down, from the rain clouds, pouring water? That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation? And gardens of entwined growth?\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what God has sent down from the sky of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every kind of moving creature, and [in His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"Do you not see how God created seven heavens in layers? And made the moon therein a light and made the sun a lamp? And God caused you to grow from the earth a growth? Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"Then do you see that which you emit? Is it you who creates it, or are We the Creator?\" up to His saying: \"for those in need.\" So it is not hidden from one who possesses the slightest shred of intellect ['aql], if he reflects with the least thought upon the content of these verses and turns his gaze upon the wonders of God's creation in the earth and the heavens and the marvels of the natural constitution [fitra] of animals and plants, that this amazing affair and this precise arrangement cannot dispense with a Maker [sani'] who manages it and an Agent [fa'il] who governs and determines it. Rather, the very natural constitution [fitra] of souls almost testifies to their being subdued under His subjugation and directed according to the requirement of His management. And for that reason God, the Exalted, said: \"Is there doubt concerning God, Creator of the heavens and the earth?\" And for this He sent the prophets, the prayers of God be upon them, to call the creation to Oneness [al-tawhid], so that they would say \"There is no god but God,\" and they were not commanded to say \"For us is a god and for the world is a god,\" for that was already ingrained in the natural constitution [fitra] of their intellects from the beginning of their origin and in the prime of their youth. And for that reason He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: \"And if you asked them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they would surely say, 'God.'\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the natural constitution [fitra] of God upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of God. That is the correct religion.\"\n\nThus, in the natural constitution [fitra] of man and the evidences of the Qur'an is that which suffices from establishing a formal proof [al-burhan]. But we, on the path of seeking support and emulating the speculative scholars [al-'ulama' al-nuzzar], say: From the self-evident truths of intellects ['aql] is that the originated [al-hadith] cannot, in its origination, dispense with a cause [sabab] that originates it. And the world ['alam] is originated [hadith]. Therefore, it cannot, in its origination, dispense with a cause. As for our saying that the originated cannot, in its origination, dispense with a cause, this is evident, for every originated thing is specified by a time for which it is possible in the intellect to conceive of its being advanced or delayed. So its specification to its time, to the exclusion of what is before it and after it, necessitates by necessity a Specifier [al-mukhassis]. And as for our saying the world is originated, its proof is that the bodies [ajsam] of the world do not cease...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فليس يخفى على من معه أدنى مسكة من عقل إذا تأمل بأدنى فكرة مضمون هذه الآيات وأدار نظره على عجائب خلق الله في الأرض والسموات وبدائع فطرة الحيوان والنبات أن هذا الأمر العجيب والترتيب المحكم لا يستغني عن صانع يدبره وفاعل يحكمه ويقدره بل تكاد فطرة النفوس تشهد بكونها مقهورة تحت تسخيره ومصرفة بمقتضى تدبيره</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-2.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol1 book 2</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And We guided them to emulate the companionship of the most noble and made easy for them the following of the footsteps of the righteous predecessors, so that they held fast, from the dictates of intellects, to the Firm Rope [al-habl al-mateen], and from the ways of the ancients and their beliefs, to the Clear Path [al-minhaj al-mubeen].
