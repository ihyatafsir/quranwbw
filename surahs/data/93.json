Thus, it becomes evidence that Allah, the Exalted, prepares for the soul [nafs] opportunities for manifestation [tajalli] and illumination [tanwir]. For just as the forenoon [al-duha] dispels the darkness of the night [al-layl], so too does spiritual wakefulness [yaqazah ruhiyyah] dispel the darkness of ignorance [jahl]. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the seeker [murid] to seize this time for prayer [salah] and remembrance [dhikr], so that expansion [inshirah] after constriction [dayq] and guidance [hidayah] after bewilderment [hayrah] may be realized for him.</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَاللَّيْلِ","d":"wa-al-layli","e":"ِlْyَّlٱَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.53","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.53","c":"سَجَى","d":"sajā","e":"ٰàَjgَs"}],"a":{"g":"And [by] the night when it covers with darkness,","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 10</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>And by the night when it settles [sajā], that is, when it becomes still, and its stillness is its calmness at this time, so no eye remains except sleeping, save for the Ever-Living, the Sustainer [al-Ḥayy al-Qayyūm] who neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. And it is said: when it settles [sajā] means when it extends and lengthens; and it is said: when it grows dark. Indeed, this oath by the night when it settles [sajā] confirms that the time in which creation becomes still and they are absent in sleep is the time of divine power [al-qudrah al-ilāhiyyah] which is established with the permanence of life [dawām al-ḥayāh] and overseeing creation. Therefore, it is fitting for the believer to utilize this time with remembrance [dhikr] and worship [‘ibādah] so that he may connect with the presence of holiness [ḥaḍrat al-qudūsiyyah] and feel the permanence of life [dawām al-ḥayāh] in his heart [qalb], so that this becomes a cause for the purification of the soul [tazkiyah al-nafs] and the realization of humility [taḥqīq al-khushū‘] in prayer [ṣalāh] and deeds.</div></div></div>"}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.06","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"0.5","h":"0.67","c":"وَدَّعَكَ","d":"waddaʿaka","e":"َkَʿعَّdَw"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.38","c":"رَبُّكَ","d":"rabbuka","e":"َkُّbَr"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.76","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.72","c":"قَلَى","d":"qalā","e":"ٰàَlَq"}],"a":{"g":"Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Muhammad], nor has He detested [you]."}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.1","c":"وَلَلْءَاخِرَةُ","d":"walalākhiratu","e":"ُẗَrِhkāَءْlَlَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.59","c":"خَيْرٌ","d":"khayrun","e":"ٌrْyَhk"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.74","c":"لَكَ","d":"laka","e":"َkَّl"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.72","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.35","c":"الْأُولَى","d":"l-ūlā","e":"ٰàَlwُaʾْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life]."}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"وَلَسَوْفَ","d":"walasawfa","e":"َfْwَsَlَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.96","c":"يُعْطِيكَ","d":"yuʿ'ṭīka","e":"َkyِṭْʿعُy"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.68","c":"رَبُّكَ","d":"rabbuka","e":"َkُّbَr"},{"b":"3.1","h":"5.17","c":"فَتَرْضَى","d":"fatarḍā","e":"ٰٓàَḍْrَtَf"}],"a":{"g":"And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol4 book10</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>And in the interpretation of His saying, the Most High: **\"And your Lord will surely give you, and you will be satisfied\"** [93:5], it is said: Muhammad will not be satisfied, nor will any one of his community [ummah] be in the Fire.
