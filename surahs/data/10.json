Not every speech is suitable for every state. So if they gathered in supplications [du'awat] around the reciter, perhaps he would recite a verse [ayah] that does not correspond to their state, for indeed the Qur'an is a healing [shifa'] for all people according to the diversity of states [ahwal]. Thus, verses of mercy [ayat al-rahmah] are the healing of the fearful [al-kha'if], and verses of punishment [ayat al-'adhab] are the healing of the deluded, the secure [al-maghrur al-amin]. The detailing of that is among what would be lengthy. Therefore, one cannot be secure from the recited [al-maqru'] not corresponding to the state, and the soul [al-nafs] disliking it, and thus exposing oneself through it to the danger [khatr] of disliking the speech of God, the Exalted, from a direction where he finds no way to repel it. So precaution [al-ihtiraz] from the danger of that is extreme prudence [hazm] and an obligatory necessity [hatm wajib], for he finds no deliverance [al-khalas] from it except by applying it [tanzil] in accordance with his state, and it is not permissible to apply the speech of God, the Exalted, except upon what God, the Exalted, intended. As for the saying of the poet, it is permissible to apply it contrary to his intent, for in it lies the danger of dislike or the danger of erroneous interpretation [al-ta'wil al-khata'] due to correspondence with the state. Therefore, it is obligatory to venerate [taqrir] the speech of God and protect it [syanatuhu] from that.</div></div></div>"}},"58":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.35","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ِlْḍَfِb"},{"b":"0.4","h":"0.74","c":"بِفَضْلِ","d":"bifaḍli","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.94","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ۦِhِtَmْḥَrِbَw"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.14","c":"وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ","d":"wabiraḥmatihi","e":"َkِlَٰhdِbَf"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.47","c":"فَبِذَلِكَ","d":"fabidhālika","e":"۟āwُḥَrْfَyْlَf"},{"b":"5.3","h":"7.29","c":"فَلْيَفْرَحُوا","d":"falyafraḥū","e":"َwُh"},{"b":"6.9","h":"9.63","c":"هُوَ","d":"huwa","e":"ٌrْyَhk"},{"b":"7.2","h":"10.02","c":"خَيْرٌ","d":"khayrun","e":"āَّmِّm"},{"b":"8.8","h":"11.88","c":"مِمَّا","d":"mimmā","e":"َnwُʿعَmْjgَy"},{"b":"10.1","h":"13.49","c":"يَجْمَعُونَ","d":"yajmaʿūna","e":"ْlُq"}],"a":{"g":"Say, \"In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate.\"","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book 8a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, by this is demonstrated the beauty of God's design [husn al-sun'] for him, and His gaze [nazrah] upon him, and His subtle grace [lutf] towards him.

The truth of the matter is that the Shari'ah has employed them in three ways: as synonyms [taraduf], as distinct terms [ikhtilaf], and as overlapping terms [tadakhul].\n\nAs for synonymity [taraduf], it is found in the words of the Almighty: \"O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then upon Him rely, if you should be Muslims [muslimin].\" (Qur'an 10:84) And the Prophet ﷺ said: \"Islam [al-Islam] is built upon five...\" and he was once asked about faith [al-Iman] and he answered with these five.\n\nAs for distinction [ikhtilaf], it is found in the words of the Almighty: \"The bedouins say, 'We have believed.' Say, 'You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted [aslamna],' for faith [al-Iman] has not yet entered your hearts.'\" (Qur'an 49:14) Its meaning is: we have surrendered outwardly. Here, He intended by 'faith' [al-Iman] only affirmation [tasdiq] with the heart [qalb], and by 'Islam' [al-Islam] outward surrender [istislam] with the tongue and limbs. And in the Hadith of Jibril (upon him be peace), when he asked him about faith [al-Iman], he said: \"That you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and in resurrection after death, and in the Reckoning, and in the Decree, its good and its evil.\" Then he said: \"So what is Islam [al-Islam]?\" He answered by mentioning the five pillars. Thus, he expressed 'Islam' as the outward surrender [taslim] by word and deed. And in the hadith concerning Sa'd, that the Prophet ﷺ gave a gift to one man and did not give to another. So Sa'd said to him: \"O Messenger of Allah, you left so-and-so, you did not give him, and he is a believer [mu'min].\" The Prophet ﷺ said: \"Or a Muslim [muslim].\" He repeated it to him, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ repeated it.\n\nAs for overlap [tadakhul], it is also narrated that he was asked: \"Which deed is best?\" He ﷺ said: \"Islam [al-Islam].\" He was asked: \"Which Islam is best?\" He ﷺ said: \"Faith [al-Iman].\" This is evidence for both distinction [ikhtilaf] and overlap [tadakhul], and it is the most fitting of usages in language, because faith [al-Iman] is one of the deeds, and it is the best of them. And Islam [al-Islam] is surrender [taslim], whether by the heart [qalb], or by the tongue, or by the limbs. And the best of it is that which is by the heart [qalb], which is affirmation [tasdiq] and is called faith [al-Iman]. The usage of them as distinct [ikhtilaf], as overlapping [tadakhul], and as synonyms [taraduf] is all not outside the path of figurative usage in language.\n\nAs for distinction [ikhtilaf], it is to make 'faith' [al-Iman] an expression for affirmation [tasdiq] by the heart [qalb] only, which conforms to language, and 'Islam' [al-Islam] an expression for outward surrender [taslim], which also conforms to language. For surrender [taslim] with some of what surrender [taslim] entails is applied to it the name 'surrender' [taslim]. It is not a condition for the realization of the name that the meaning be general for every instance where the meaning can exist. For whoever touches another with some part of his body is called 'one who touches' [lamis], even if he does not encompass all of his body. Thus, applying the name 'Islam' [al-Islam] to outward surrender [taslim] in the absence of inward surrender [taslim] conforms to linguistic convention. Upon this meaning proceeds the saying of the Almighty: \"The bedouins say, 'We have believed.' Say, 'You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted [aslamna]...'\" (Qur'an 49:14) and His saying ﷺ in the hadith of Sa'd: \"Or a Muslim [muslim],\" because he preferred one of them over the other.
