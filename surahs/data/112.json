So whoever supplicates with these names, let him say, \"Indeed, You are Allah [Allah], there is no god but You,\" such and such. For whoever supplicates with them, he is recorded among the prostrating, humble ones who will dwell alongside Muhammad, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets, the prayers of Allah be upon them, in the Abode of Majesty, and for him is the reward of the worshippers in the heavens and the earths.
