Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the sign of a beautiful character [khuluq].\n\nFor indeed, a beautiful character [khuluq] is faith [iman], and an ugly character [khuluq] is hypocrisy [nifaq]. And Allah, the Exalted, has mentioned the attributes of the believers [mu'minun] and the hypocrites [munafiqun] in His Book, and they are, in their totality, the fruit of a beautiful character [khuluq] and an ugly character [khuluq].\n\nSo let us present a summary of that, so that you may know the sign of a beautiful character [khuluq]. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Indeed, successful are the believers [mu'minun], those who are in their prayer humbly submissive [khashi'un], and those who turn away from idle talk [laghw]\" up to His saying: \"Those are the inheritors.\"\n\nWhoever is uncertain about his own state, let him present himself against these verses. The presence of all these attributes is a sign of a beautiful character [khuluq], and the absence of all of them is a sign of an ugly character [khuluq].

And indeed, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may God have mercy upon him, mentioned them all, saying:\n\nIndeed, its pomegranates are like water-skins, and indeed its rivers are of water [ma'] that is not stagnant, and rivers of milk [laban] whose taste has not changed, and rivers of honey [asal] purified, not purified by men. And indeed, in it is wine [khamr], a delight for the drinkers, which does not befuddle the minds nor cause headaches. And indeed, in it is what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has not occurred to the heart [qalb] of any human.\n\nThey are kings, living in comfort, sons of thirty-three, in one age. Their height is sixty cubits in the sky, with kohl, beardless, smooth-skinned. They are secure from the punishment, and the Abode [al-dar] is at peace with them. And indeed, its rivers flow over pebbles of ruby and chrysolite. And indeed, its roots, its palm trees, and its vines are of pearl, and its fruits—none knows their knowledge [ilm] except God, the Exalted. And indeed, its fragrance is found from a distance of five hundred years' journey.\n\nAnd indeed, for them in it are horses and camels, swift, their saddles and bridles and saddles of ruby. They visit one another in it, and their spouses are the wide-eyed maidens [al-hur al-'in], as if they were hidden pearls. And indeed, a woman takes seventy garments between her two fingers and wears them, and the marrow of her shin is seen from behind those seventy garments. God has purified the characters [al-akhlaq] from evil and the bodies from death. They do not blow their noses in it, nor do they urinate, nor do they defecate. It is only a belch and a sweat of musk. Their provision [rizq] is in it morning and evening.

well, saying, the Most High: **\"And those who are over their prayers [salawat] vigilant [yuhafidhun].\"** As for the prayer of the heedless, it is a peril, unless Allah envelops them with His mercy [rahma], and the mercy is vast, and the generosity is overflowing. So we ask Allah to envelop us with His mercy and to immerse us with His forgiveness, for we have no means except the confession of incapacity to fulfill obedience to Him.\n\nAnd know that purifying the prayer [salah] from defects, and making it sincere [ikhlas] for the Countenance of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, and performing it with the inward conditions we mentioned—of humility [khushu'], reverence [ta'zim], and shame [haya']—is a cause for the occurrence of lights [anwar] in the heart [qalb]. Those lights become keys to the sciences of unveiling [mukashafa]. The allies of Allah [awliya'], those unveiled to the dominion [malakut] of the heavens and the earth and the secrets of Lordship, are only unveiled during prayer, especially in prostration [sujud], for the servant draws near to his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, through prostration. And for that reason, Allah, the Most High, said: **\"And prostrate and draw near.\"** And the unveiling [mukashafa] for every person praying is only according to the measure of his clarity from the impurities of the world [dunya], and that differs in strength and weakness, in scarcity and abundance, and in clarity and obscurity—until the thing itself is unveiled to some of them, and to some of them the thing is unveiled by its likeness, just as the world [dunya] was unveiled to some of them in the form of a carcass, and Satan in the form of a dog crouching upon it, calling to it.\n\nAnd it also differs according to what is in the unveiling: for some of them, His attributes [sifat] and His majesty [jalal] are unveiled; for some, His actions; and for some, the subtleties of the sciences of spiritual transaction [mu'amala]. And the specification of those meanings in every moment has hidden causes beyond enumeration. The most fitting of them is aspiration [himma], for when it is directed to a specific thing, that thing is most deserving of being unveiled.\n\nAnd since these matters only appear in polished mirrors, and all mirrors were rusty, guidance [hidaya] was veiled from them—not due to stinginess from the side of the Bestower of guidance, but due to the foulness of accumulated rust upon the place where guidance is received. Tongues hastened to deny such things, for nature is created to deny what is not present. If the fetus had intellect, it would deny the possibility of a human existing in the expanse of the air. And if the child had discernment, he might perhaps deny what the people of intellect claim to perceive of the dominion [malakut] of the heavens and the earth. And thus is man in every stage; he almost denies what...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فمدحهم بعد الإيمان بصلاة مخصوصة وهي المقرونة بالخشوع ثم ختم أوصاف المفلحين بالصلاة أيضا فقال تعالى: ﴿ والذين هم على صلواتهم يحافظون ﴾ فهذا تفصيل صلاة الخاشعين الذين هم في صلاتهم خاشعون والذين هم على صلواتهم يحافظون والذين هم على صلاتهم دائمون والذين هم يناجون الله على قدر استطاعتهم في العبودية فليعرض الإنسان نفسه على هذه الصلاة فبالقدر الذي يسر له منه ينبغي أن يفرح وعلى ما يفوته ينبغي أن يتحسر وفي مداراة ذلك ينبغي أن يجتهد.</div></div></div>"}},"10":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.26","c":"أُولَئِكَ","d":"ulāika","e":"ُmُh"},{"b":"2.9","h":"3.06","c":"هُمُ","d":"humu","e":"َnwُhtِrَٰwْlٱ"},{"b":"3.3","h":"3.83","c":"الْوَارِثُونَ","d":"l-wārithūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Those are the inheritors","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-4.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Prayer</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, Allah the Almighty has said: \"Indeed, the believers have succeeded [qad aflaha al-mu'minun] – those who are in their prayer humbly submissive [khashi'un].\" So He praised them, after faith [iman], with a specific prayer [salah] – that which is coupled with humility [khushu'].

And at once he is a clear adversary [khasim mubin].\" (36:77)\n\nAnd He said: \"We created the human being from a sperm-drop mixed [nutfah amshaj].\" (76:2) Then He mentioned how He made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot [alaqah], and the clot into a lump [mudghah], and the lump into bones [izam].\n\nThe repeated mention of the sperm-drop [nutfah] in the Mighty Book is not merely to hear its word and neglect reflection upon its meaning.\n\nSo look now at the sperm-drop [nutfah]—it is a droplet of base, impure water. If it were left for an hour for the air to strike it, it would spoil and become foul. How did the Lord of lords extract it from the loins and ribs? How did He bring together the male and the female and cast affection [ulfah] and love [mahabbah] into their hearts [qulub]? How did He lead them by the chain of love [mahabbah] and desire [shahwah] to union? How did He extract the sperm-drop [nutfah] from the man by the movement of intercourse? How did He draw the menstrual blood from the depths of the veins and gather it in the womb? Then how did He create the child from the sperm-drop [nutfah] and nourish it with the water of menstruation until it grew, developed, and became large?\n\nAnd how did He make the sperm-drop [nutfah], which is white and shining, into a red clinging clot [alaqah]? Then how did He make it into a lump [mudghah]? Then how did He divide the parts of the sperm-drop [nutfah], which are equal and similar, into bones [izam], nerves [a'sab], veins [urouq], tendons [awtar], and flesh [lahm]? Then how did He construct from the flesh [luhum], nerves [a'sab], and veins [urouq] the apparent limbs [a'da']: the roundness of the head, the aperture for hearing, sight, the nose, the mouth, and all the other openings? Then He extended the hand and the leg and divided their ends into fingers [asabi'], and divided the fingers into fingertips [anamil].\n\nThen how did He construct the internal organs [a'da']: the heart [qalb], the stomach [ma'idah], the liver [kabid], the spleen [tihal], the lung [ri'ah], the womb [rahim], the bladder [mathanah], and the intestines [am'a']—each one with a specific form [shakl makhsus] and a specific measure [miqdar makhsus] for a specific function [amal makhsus]?\n\nThen how did He divide each one of these organs into other divisions? He constructed the eye from seven layers [tabaqat]; for each layer is a specific attribute [wasf makhsus] and a specific form [hai'ah makhsus]. If a single layer from them were missing, or an attribute from its attributes were removed, the eye would be incapacitated from sight [ibsar].\n\nIf we were to begin describing the wonders [aja'ib] and signs [ayat] contained in each single one of these organs, lifetimes would be exhausted in it.\n\nSo look now at the bones [izam]—they are solid, strong bodies. How did He create them from a weak, delicate sperm-drop [nutfah]? Then He made them the framework [qiwam] for the body and its support [amad]. Then He proportioned them with different measures [maqadir] and different forms [ashkal]: among them is small and large, long and round, hollow and solid, broad and delicate.\n\nAnd since the human being is in need of movement with his entire body and with some of his limbs [a'da'], and is in need of moving about for his needs, He did not make his bone a single bone, but rather many bones [izam] between which are joints [mafasil] so that movement is facilitated by them. And He proportioned the form [shakl] of each one in accordance with the movement required by it. Then He connected their joints and bound some of them to others with tendons [awtar] which He caused to grow from one end of the bone and attached it to the other bone.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وتلا الآية الواردة في أطوار الخلقة وهي قوله تعالى (ولقد خلقنا الإنسان من سلالة من طين ثم جعلناه نطفة في قرار مكين...) إلى قوله (...ثم أنشأناه خلقا آخر) أي نفخنا فيه الروح</div></div></div>"}},"13":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"ُhَٰnْlَʿعَjg"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.5","c":"جَعَلْنَاهُ","d":"jaʿalnāhu","e":"ًẗَfْṭُn"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.95","c":"نُطْفَةً","d":"nuṭ'fatan","e":"àِf"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.03","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٍrāَrَq"},{"b":"4.4","h":"6.82","c":"قَرَارٍ","d":"qarārin","e":"ٍnyِkَّm"},{"b":"6.5","h":"9.39","c":"مَكِينٍ","d":"makīnin","e":"َّmُht"}],"a":{"g":"Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging."}},"14":{"w":[{"b":"0.15","h":"0.5","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"āَnْqَlَhk"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.64","c":"خَلَقْنَا","d":"khalaqnā","e":"َẗَfْṭُّnlٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"3.18","c":"النُّطْفَةَ","d":"l-nuṭ'fata","e":"ًẗَqَlَʿع"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.07","c":"عَلَقَةً","d":"ʿalaqatan","e":"āَnْqَlَhkَf"},{"b":"5.7","h":"7.21","c":"فَخَلَقْنَا","d":"fakhalaqnā","e":"َẗَqَlَʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"6.7","h":"8.9","c":"الْعَلَقَةَ","d":"l-ʿalaqata","e":"ًẗَغْḍُm"},{"b":"7.8","h":"10.67","c":"مُضْغَةً","d":"muḍ'ghatan","e":"āَnْqَlَhkَf"},{"b":"9.4","h":"12.81","c":"فَخَلَقْنَا","d":"fakhalaqnā","e":"َẗَغْḍُmْlٱ"},{"b":"10.5","h":"14.53","c":"الْمُضْغَةَ","d":"l-muḍ'ghata","e":"āًmَٰẓِʿع"},{"b":"11.6","h":"16.14","c":"عِظَامًا","d":"ʿiẓāman","e":"āَnْwَsَkَf"},{"b":"17.8","h":"18.36","c":"فَكَسَوْنَا","d":"fakasawnā","e":"َmَٰẓِʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"18.8","h":"20.14","c":"الْعِظَامَ","d":"l-ʿiẓāma","e":"āًmْḥَl"},{"b":"20.0","h":"21.99","c":"لَحْمًا","d":"laḥman","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"20.6","h":"23.71","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"ُhَٰnْaʾَhsnَaʾ"},{"b":"23.0","h":"25.24","c":"أَنْشَأْنَاهُ","d":"anshanāhu","e":"āًqْlَhk"},{"b":"25.1","h":"28.35","c":"خَلْقًا","d":"khalqan","e":"َrَhkāَء"},{"b":"26.1","h":"29.9","c":"ءَاخَرَ","d":"ākhara","e":"َkَrāَbَtَf"},{"b":"27.6","h":"34.6","c":"فَتَبَارَكَ","d":"fatabāraka","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"28.8","h":"36.72","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُnَsْḥَaʾ"},{"b":"29.7","h":"38.28","c":"أَحْسَنُ","d":"aḥsanu","e":"َnyِqِlَٰhkْlٱ"},{"b":"30.5","h":"39.73","c":"الْخَالِقِينَ","d":"l-khāliqīna","e":"َّmُht"}],"a":{"g":"Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation.

And He, the Exalted, has said: \"Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children, We are hastening for them in good things? Rather, they do not perceive [la yash'urūn].\" (23:55-56) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We will gradually draw them [from destruction] from where they do not know.\" (7:182) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We opened to them the gates of every thing until, when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and at once they were in despair.\" (6:44) And in the interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: \"We will gradually draw them [from destruction] from where they do not know,\" it is that whenever they commit a sin, We grant them a blessing [ni'mah] so that their delusion [ghurūr] increases. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We only grant them respite that they may increase in sin.\" (3:178) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do.

Yes, if fear [khawf] overcomes him, he sees everyone as better than himself, and that is the virtue [al-fadilah].\n\nAs it is narrated that an ascetic ['abid] took refuge in a mountain, and it was said to him in a dream: \"Go to so-and-so the cobbler [al-iskaff] and ask him to supplicate for you.\" So he went to him and asked him about his practice ['amal], and he informed him that he fasts the day, earns a living, gives charity [yata-saddaq], and feeds his family with some of it. The ascetic returned saying: \"This is indeed good, but it is not like being free for the worship of Allah.\" Then he came in a second dream and it was said to him: \"Go to so-and-so the cobbler and say to him: 'What is this pallor [al-saffar] on your face?'\" So he went to him and asked him. He said to him: \"I have not seen anyone from the people except that it occurs to me: that he will be saved [yanju] and I will be destroyed [ahlak].\" The ascetic said: \"By this.\"\n\nAnd what indicates the virtue of this characteristic is His saying, the Most High: \"Indeed, those who are apprehensive [mushfiqun] from fear [khashya] of their Lord...\" So when the apprehension [al-ishfaq] and caution [al-hadhar] from what the decree [al-qada'] has preceded with in pre-eternity [al-azal] – and which is unveiled [yankashif] at the conclusion of the term [khatimat al-ajal] – is removed, then feeling secure [al-amn] from the plan of Allah overcomes, and that necessitates arrogance [al-kibr], and it is the cause of destruction [al-halak]. So arrogance [al-kibr] is the proof of feeling secure [al-amn], and feeling secure [al-amn] is destructive [muhlik]. And humility [al-tawadu'] is the proof of fear [al-khawf], and it is felicitous [musa'id].\n\nTherefore, what the ascetic ['abid] corrupts by harboring arrogance [al-kibr] and despising the creation [ih-tiqar al-khalq] and looking at them with the eye of belittlement [al-istisghar] is more than what he rectifies by the outward deeds [al-a'mal].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;
