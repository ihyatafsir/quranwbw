Then I said to it, 'Speak,' and it said: **\"Indeed, the believers have attained success [qad aflaha al-mu'minun].\"**\n\nThese are the attributes [sifat] of Paradise which We have mentioned in summary, then We have conveyed them in detail. And indeed, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may God have mercy upon him, mentioned them all, saying:\n\nIndeed, its pomegranates are like water-skins, and indeed its rivers are of water [ma'] that is not stagnant, and rivers of milk [laban] whose taste has not changed, and rivers of honey [asal] purified, not purified by men. And indeed, in it is wine [khamr], a delight for the drinkers, which does not befuddle the minds nor cause headaches. And indeed, in it is what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has not occurred to the heart [qalb] of any human.\n\nThey are kings, living in comfort, sons of thirty-three, in one age. Their height is sixty cubits in the sky, with kohl, beardless, smooth-skinned. They are secure from the punishment, and the Abode [al-dar] is at peace with them. And indeed, its rivers flow over pebbles of ruby and chrysolite. And indeed, its roots, its palm trees, and its vines are of pearl, and its fruits—none knows their knowledge [ilm] except God, the Exalted. And indeed, its fragrance is found from a distance of five hundred years' journey.\n\nAnd indeed, for them in it are horses and camels, swift, their saddles and bridles and saddles of ruby. They visit one another in it, and their spouses are the wide-eyed maidens [al-hur al-'in], as if they were hidden pearls. And indeed, a woman takes seventy garments between her two fingers and wears them, and the marrow of her shin is seen from behind those seventy garments. God has purified the characters [al-akhlaq] from evil and the bodies from death. They do not blow their noses in it, nor do they urinate, nor do they defecate. It is only a belch and a sweat of musk. Their provision [rizq] is in it morning and evening. Behold, there is no night; morning comes upon evening and evening comes upon morning.\n\nAnd indeed, the last to enter Paradise [al-jannah] and the lowest in rank, sight [basar] and dominion [mulk] will be extended for him.</div></div></div>"}},"2":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.25","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.02","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"àِf"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.65","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ْmِhِtāَlَṣ"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.46","c":"صَلَاتِهِمْ","d":"ṣalātihim","e":"َnwُʿعِhsَٰhk"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.74","c":"خَاشِعُونَ","d":"khāshiʿūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"They who are during their prayer humbly submissive"}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.15","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.98","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.71","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِwْغَّllٱ"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.41","c":"اللَّغْوِ","d":"l-laghwi","e":"َnwُḍِrْʿعُm"},{"b":"3.0","h":"5.01","c":"مُعْرِضُونَ","d":"muʿ'riḍūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And they who turn away from ill speech"}},"4":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.35","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.21","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ِẗٰwَkَّzlِl"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.94","c":"لِلزَّكَوةِ","d":"lilzzakati","e":"َnwُlِʿعَٰf"},{"b":"2.9","h":"5.27","c":"فَاعِلُونَ","d":"fāʿilūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And they who are observant of zakah"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"1","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.95","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ْmِhِjgwُrُfِl"},{"b":"1.7","h":"3.67","c":"لِفُرُوجِهِمْ","d":"lifurūjihim","e":"َnwُẓِfَٰḥ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"7.04","c":"حَافِظُونَ","d":"ḥāfiẓūna","e":"āَّlِiʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And they who guard their private parts"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.15","h":"0.45","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ٰٓàَlَʿع"},{"b":"0.8","h":"1.7","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ْmِhِjgَٰwْzَaʾ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.08","c":"أَزْوَاجِهِمْ","d":"azwājihim","e":"ْwَaʾ"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.71","c":"أَوْ","d":"aw","e":"āَm"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.43","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ْtَkَlَm"},{"b":"5.6","h":"8.1","c":"مَلَكَتْ","d":"malakat","e":"ْmُhُnَٰmْyَaʾ"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.56","c":"أَيْمَانُهُمْ","d":"aymānuhum","e":"ْmُhَّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"7.9","h":"12.03","c":"فَإِنَّهُمْ","d":"fa-innahum","e":"ُrْyَغ"},{"b":"9.8","h":"14.68","c":"غَيْرُ","d":"ghayru","e":"َnyِmwُlَm"},{"b":"10.5","h":"16.13","c":"مَلُومِينَ","d":"malūmīna","e":"ِnَmَf"}],"a":{"g":"Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed -"}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.15","h":"1","c":"فَمَنِ","d":"famani","e":"ٰàَغَtْbٱ"},{"b":"0.72","h":"1.81","c":"ابْتَغَى","d":"ib'taghā","e":"َءٓāَrَw"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.89","c":"وَرَاءَ","d":"warāa","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.75","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾَf"},{"b":"5.0","h":"7.21","c":"فَأُولَئِكَ","d":"fa-ulāika","e":"ُmُh"},{"b":"8","h":"10.53","c":"هُمُ","d":"humu","e":"َnwُdāَʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"8.4","h":"11.4","c":"الْعَادُونَ","d":"l-ʿādūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors -"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.25","h":"0.5","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.34","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ْmِhِtَٰnَٰmَaʾِl"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.03","c":"لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ","d":"li-amānātihim","e":"ْmِhِdْhَʿعَw"},{"b":"3.7","h":"6.44","c":"وَعَهْدِهِمْ","d":"waʿahdihim","e":"َnwُʿعَٰr"},{"b":"5.0","h":"8.53","c":"رَاعُونَ","d":"rāʿūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive"}},"9":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.2","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"ْmُh"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.06","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.65","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ْmِhِtَٰwَlَṣ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.73","c":"صَلَوَاتِهِمْ","d":"ṣalawātihim","e":"َnwُẓِfāَḥُy"},{"b":"3.9","h":"6.4","c":"يُحَافِظُونَ","d":"yuḥāfiẓūna","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And they who carefully maintain their prayers -","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 4</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, then He concluded the attributes of the successful ones with prayer as well, saying, the Most High: **\"And those who are over their prayers [salawat] vigilant [yuhafidhun].\"** As for the prayer of the heedless, it is a peril, unless Allah envelops them with His mercy [rahma], and the mercy is vast, and the generosity is overflowing.

Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot [alaqah], and We made the clot into a lump [mudghah], and We made the lump into bones [izam], and We clothed the bones with flesh [lahm]; then We brought him into being as another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators. (Quran 23:12-14)\n\nAnd He reminds you that you were created from a base fluid [nutfah qadhirah]. He said: \"Destroyed is man; how ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfah] He created him and destined for him; then He made the way easy for him; then He causes him to die and be buried; then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" (80:17-22)\n\nAnd He, the Exalted, said: \"And among His signs is that He created you from dust [turab], then, at once, you are human beings dispersing [tansharun].\" (30:20)\n\nAnd He, the Exalted, said: \"Was he not a sperm-drop [nutfah] of semen emitted [mani yumna]? Then he was a clinging clot [alaqah], and He created [fakhalaqa] and proportioned [fasawwa].\" (75:37-38)\n\nAnd He, the Exalted, said: \"Did We not create you from a despised water [ma'in mahin]? Then We placed it in a firm resting place [qararin makin], for a known extent [qadar ma'lum].\" (77:20-22)\n\nAnd He said: \"Does man not consider that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfah]? And at once he is a clear adversary [khasim mubin].\" (36:77)\n\nAnd He said: \"We created the human being from a sperm-drop mixed [nutfah amshaj].\" (76:2) Then He mentioned how He made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot [alaqah], and the clot into a lump [mudghah], and the lump into bones [izam].\n\nThe repeated mention of the sperm-drop [nutfah] in the Mighty Book is not merely to hear its word and neglect reflection upon its meaning.\n\nSo look now at the sperm-drop [nutfah]—it is a droplet of base, impure water. If it were left for an hour for the air to strike it, it would spoil and become foul. How did the Lord of lords extract it from the loins and ribs? How did He bring together the male and the female and cast affection [ulfah] and love [mahabbah] into their hearts [qulub]? How did He lead them by the chain of love [mahabbah] and desire [shahwah] to union? How did He extract the sperm-drop [nutfah] from the man by the movement of intercourse? How did He draw the menstrual blood from the depths of the veins and gather it in the womb? Then how did He create the child from the sperm-drop [nutfah] and nourish it with the water of menstruation until it grew, developed, and became large?\n\nAnd how did He make the sperm-drop [nutfah], which is white and shining, into a red clinging clot [alaqah]? Then how did He make it into a lump [mudghah]? Then how did He divide the parts of the sperm-drop [nutfah], which are equal and similar, into bones [izam], nerves [a'sab], veins [urouq], tendons [awtar], and flesh [lahm]? Then how did He construct from the flesh [luhum], nerves [a'sab], and veins [urouq] the apparent limbs [a'da']: the roundness of the head, the aperture for hearing, sight, the nose, the mouth, and all the other openings? Then He extended the hand and the leg and divided their ends into fingers [asabi'], and divided the fingers into fingertips [anamil].\n\nThen how did He construct the internal organs [a'da']: the heart [qalb], the stomach [ma'idah], the liver [kabid], the spleen [tihal], the lung [ri'ah], the womb [rahim], the bladder [mathanah], and the intestines [am'a']—each one with a specific form [shakl makhsus] and a specific measure [miqdar makhsus] for a specific function [amal makhsus]?\n\nThen how did He divide each one of these organs into other divisions? He constructed the eye from seven layers [tabaqat]; for each layer is a specific attribute [wasf makhsus] and a specific form [hai'ah makhsus]. If a single layer from them were missing, or an attribute from its attributes were removed, the eye would be incapacitated from sight [ibsar].\n\nIf we were to begin describing the wonders [aja'ib] and signs [ayat] contained in each single one of these organs, lifetimes would be exhausted in it.\n\nSo look now at the bones [izam]—they are solid, strong bodies. How did He create them from a weak, delicate sperm-drop [nutfah]? Then He made them the framework [qiwam] for the body and its support [amad]. Then He proportioned them with different measures [maqadir] and different forms [ashkal]: among them is small and large, long and round, hollow and solid, broad and delicate.\n\nAnd since the human being is in need of movement with his entire body and with some of his limbs [a'da'], and is in need of moving about for his needs, He did not make his bone a single bone, but rather many bones [izam] between which are joints [mafasil] so that movement is facilitated by them. And He proportioned the form [shakl] of each one in accordance with the movement required by it. Then He connected their joints and bound some of them to others with tendons [awtar] which He caused to grow from one end of the bone and attached it to the other bone.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j4 k09</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, We created the human being [al-insan] from an extract of clay [tin].

And He, the Exalted, has said: \"Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children, We are hastening for them in good things? Rather, they do not perceive [la yash'urūn].\" (23:55-56) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We will gradually draw them [from destruction] from where they do not know.\" (7:182) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We opened to them the gates of every thing until, when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and at once they were in despair.\" (6:44) And in the interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: \"We will gradually draw them [from destruction] from where they do not know,\" it is that whenever they commit a sin, We grant them a blessing [ni'mah] so that their delusion [ghurūr] increases. And He, the Exalted, has said: \"We only grant them respite that they may increase in sin.\" (3:178) And He, the Exalted, has said: \"And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].\" (14:42) And other than this from what has come in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So whoever believes in this is freed from this delusion [ghurūr], for the source of this delusion [ghurūr] is ignorance [jahl] of Allah and His attributes.

Yes, if fear [khawf] overcomes him, he sees everyone as better than himself, and that is the virtue [al-fadilah].\n\nAs it is narrated that an ascetic ['abid] took refuge in a mountain, and it was said to him in a dream: \"Go to so-and-so the cobbler [al-iskaff] and ask him to supplicate for you.\" So he went to him and asked him about his practice ['amal], and he informed him that he fasts the day, earns a living, gives charity [yata-saddaq], and feeds his family with some of it. The ascetic returned saying: \"This is indeed good, but it is not like being free for the worship of Allah.\" Then he came in a second dream and it was said to him: \"Go to so-and-so the cobbler and say to him: 'What is this pallor [al-saffar] on your face?'\" So he went to him and asked him. He said to him: \"I have not seen anyone from the people except that it occurs to me: that he will be saved [yanju] and I will be destroyed [ahlak].\" The ascetic said: \"By this.\"\n\nAnd what indicates the virtue of this characteristic is His saying, the Most High: \"Indeed, those who are apprehensive [mushfiqun] from fear [khashya] of their Lord...\" So when the apprehension [al-ishfaq] and caution [al-hadhar] from what the decree [al-qada'] has preceded with in pre-eternity [al-azal] – and which is unveiled [yankashif] at the conclusion of the term [khatimat al-ajal] – is removed, then feeling secure [al-amn] from the plan of Allah overcomes, and that necessitates arrogance [al-kibr], and it is the cause of destruction [al-halak]. So arrogance [al-kibr] is the proof of feeling secure [al-amn], and feeling secure [al-amn] is destructive [muhlik]. And humility [al-tawadu'] is the proof of fear [al-khawf], and it is felicitous [musa'id].\n\nTherefore, what the ascetic ['abid] corrupts by harboring arrogance [al-kibr] and despising the creation [ih-tiqar al-khalq] and looking at them with the eye of belittlement [al-istisghar] is more than what he rectifies by the outward deeds [al-a'mal].</div></div></div>"}},"58":{"w":[{"b":"0.09","h":"0.35","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"mُh"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.52","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ِtَٰyāَٔـِb"},{"b":"2.2","h":"2.63","c":"بِءَايَاتِ","d":"biāyāti","e":"ْmِhِّbَr"},{"b":"3.3","h":"4.11","c":"رَبِّهِمْ","d":"rabbihim","e":"َnwُnِmْwʾُy"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.38","c":"يُؤْمِنُونَ","d":"yu'minūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And they who believe in the signs of their Lord"}},"59":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.25","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"mُh"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.69","c":"هُمْ","d":"hum","e":"ْmِhِّbَrِb"},{"b":"2.3","h":"2.76","c":"بِرَبِّهِمْ","d":"birabbihim","e":"āَl"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.28","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"َnwُkِrْhsُy"},{"b":"3.9","h":"4.79","c":"يُشْرِكُونَ","d":"yush'rikūna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And they who do not associate anything with their Lord"}},"60":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.15","c":"وَالَّذِينَ","d":"wa-alladhīna","e":"َnwُtْwʾُy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.49","c":"يُؤْتُونَ","d":"yu'tūna","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.75","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"۟āwَtāَء"},{"b":"4.0","h":"4.49","c":"ءَاتَوْا","d":"ātaw","e":"ْmُhُbwُlُqَّw"},{"b":"4.9","h":"5.36","c":"وَقُلُوبُهُمْ","d":"waqulūbuhum","e":"ٌẗَlِjgَw"},{"b":"6.2","h":"7.33","c":"وَجِلَةٌ","d":"wajilatun","e":"ْmُhَّnَaʾ"},{"b":"7.3","h":"8.63","c":"أَنَّهُمْ","d":"annahum","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"},{"b":"8.9","h":"10.28","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ْmِhِّbَr"},{"b":"9.4","h":"10.93","c":"رَبِّهِمْ","d":"rabbihim","e":"َnwُʿعِjgَٰr"},{"b":"10.6","h":"12.32","c":"رَاجِعُونَ","d":"rājiʿūna","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord -","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px;
