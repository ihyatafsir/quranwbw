Allah the Exalted said: 'And he who restrains the Soul (Nafs) from desire (Hawa), indeed Paradise will be his refuge.' And He the Exalted said: 'Those are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for piety (Taqwa).' It is said: He removed from them the love of desires. And he (the Prophet, peace be upon him) said: 'The believer is between five hardships: a believer who envies him, a hypocrite who hates him, a disbeliever who fights him, a devil who misguides him, and a Soul (Nafs) that contends with him.' [43] Thus, he clarified that the Soul (Nafs) is a contentious enemy that must be struggled against. And it is narrated that Allah the Exalted revealed to David, peace be upon him: 'O David, warn and admonish your companions against consuming desires, for the hearts attached to the desires of the world have their intellects veiled from Me.' And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: 'Blessed is he who leaves a present desire for a promised unseen that he has not seen.' And our Prophet (peace be upon him) said to a people who returned from military struggle (Jihad): 'Welcome, you have come from the lesser struggle (Jihad) to the greater struggle (Jihad).' It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, and what is the greater struggle?' He said: 'The struggle against the Soul (Nafs).' [44] And he (peace be upon him) said: 'The struggler (Mujahid) is he who struggles against his Soul (Nafs) in obedience to Allah the Exalted.'

Glory be to the One who, when He wills, destroys with truthfulness and when He wills, makes happy with ignorance; He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. So these, when they thought that they were employed for the sake of the poor and the needy, exalted is Allah, then said: 'There is no share for us in the poor, and there is no share for Allah in us and in our wealth, whether we spend or withhold,' they perished just as the boy perished when he thought that the father's intention was to employ him for the sake of the slaves, and he did not realize that the intended purpose was the establishment of the attribute of knowledge in his self (Nafs) and its confirmation in his heart (Qalb) so that it would be the cause of his happiness in this world. And that was from the father only as gentleness with him in drawing him to what contains his happiness.

Then know that when the physician praises the medicine, it does not indicate that the medicine is desired for itself or that it is better than the health (Sihha) and healing (Shifa) attained through it. Rather, works (A'mal) are a treatment (Ilaj) for the disease (Marad) of the hearts (Qulub), and the disease of the hearts is something that most do not perceive. It is like leprosy (Baras) on the face of one who has no mirror with him, for he does not perceive it, and even if it is mentioned to him, he does not believe it. The way with him is to exaggerate in praising washing the face with rosewater (Ma' al-Ward), for example, if rosewater removes the leprosy, until excessive praise spurs him to persist in it, and his disease is removed. For if it were mentioned to him that the intended purpose is the removal of leprosy from your face, perhaps he would abandon the treatment and claim that his face has no defect. And let us give an example closer than this: We say: He has a son whom he taught knowledge (Ilm) and the Quran, and he wanted to establish that in his memory (Hifz) so that it would not depart from him. And he knew that if he ordered him to repeat (Takrir) and study (Dirasa) so that it would remain preserved for him, he would say, \"It is preserved, and I have no need for repetition and study,\" because he thinks that what he memorizes at present remains so forever. And he had slaves, so he ordered the boy to teach the slaves and promised him for that with goodness, so that his motivation (Da'iya) would be abundant for much repetition through teaching.

If you say: your statement that the preservation of progeny and the Soul (Nafs) is beloved implies that its annihilation is hated before Allah, and this is a distinction between death and life in relation to the Will (Iradah) of Allah, the Exalted. And it is known that everything is by the Decree (Mashiyyah) of Allah, and indeed Allah is Free of need from the worlds. So from where is distinguished before Him their death from their life, or their preservation from their annihilation? Know that this statement is truth intended by it falsehood, for what we have mentioned does not contradict attributing all existents entirely to the Will (Iradah) of Allah—their good and evil, their benefit and harm. But Love (Mahabbah) and Hatred (Karāhiyyah) are opposites, and both do not oppose the Will (Iradah). For sometimes a thing willed is hated, and sometimes a thing willed is beloved. Sins (Ma'asi) are hated, and they, with the hatred, are willed. Obediences (Ta'at) are willed, and it is intended that they be willed, beloved, and pleasing.

And to this is the allusion in His saying the Exalted: \"Their light runs before them and on their right hands; they say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us\" since the perfection of the light does not affect except in increase of unveiling. And for this reason, none attains the degree of seeing and vision except the knowers in this world, because the knowledge is the seed that transforms in the Hereafter into witnessing, just as the kernel transforms into a tree and the seed into a crop. And he who has no kernel in his land, how can he obtain a palm tree? And he who does not sow the seed, how can he harvest the crop? Likewise, he who does not know Allah the Exalted in this world, how can he see Him in the Hereafter? And since the knowledge is on varying degrees, the manifestation was also on varying degrees, so the difference of the manifestation in relation to the difference of the knowledges is like the difference of the plant in relation to the difference of the seed, differing inevitably in their abundance and scarcity, goodness and strength, and weakness. And for this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, Allah manifests to people in general and to Abu Bakr in particular.\" So it should not be thought that other than Abu Bakr, from those who are below him, finds from the pleasure of seeing and witnessing what Abu Bakr finds, but he finds only a tenth of his tenth if his knowledge in this world is a tenth of his tenth. And when He favored among people with a secret settled in his chest, He favored inevitably with a manifestation that he alone possessed. And just as you see in this world one who prefers the pleasure of leadership over food and marriage, and you see one who prefers the pleasure of knowledge and the unveiling of the problems of the kingdom of the heavens.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فإذا لم يكن في معرفة الله تعالى إثبات صورة وجهه فلا يكون في استكمال تلك المعرفة بعينها وترقيها في الوضوح إلى غاية الكشف أيضاً جهة وصورة لأنها هي بعينها لا تفترق منها إلا في زيادة الكشف، كما أن الصورة المرئية هي المتخيلة بعينها إلا في زيادة الكشف، وإليه الإشارة بقوله تعالى: \" يسعى نورهم بين أيديهم وبأيمانهم يقولون ربنا أتمم لنا نورنا \" إذ تمام النور لا يؤثر إلا في زيادة التكشف، ولهذا لا يفوز بدرجة النظر والرؤية إلا العارفون في الدنيا، لأن المعرفة هي البذر الذي ينقلب في الآخرة مشاهدة كما تنقلب النواة شجرة والحب زرعاً، ومن لا نواة في أرضه كيف يحصل له نخل؟ ومن لم يزرع الحب فكيف يحصد الزرع؟ فكذلك من لم يعرف الله تعالى في الدنيا فكيف يراه في الآخرة؟ ولما كانت المعرفة على درجات متفاوتة كان التجلي أيضاً على درجات متفاوتة، فاختلاف التجلي بالإضافة إلى اختلاف المعارف كاختلاف النبات بالإضافة إلى اختلاف البذر، إذ تختلف لا محالة بكثرتها وقلتها وحسنها وقوتها وضعفها، ولذلك قال النبي عليه الصلاة والسلام: \" إن الله يتجلى للناس عامة ولأبي بكر خاصة\" فلا ينبغي أن يظن أن غير أبي بكر ممن هو دونه يجد من لذة النظر والمشاهدة ما يجده أبو بكر، بل لا يجد إلا عشر عشيره إن كانت معرفته في الدنيا عشر عشيره، ولما فضل من الناس بسر وقر في صدره فضل لا محالة بتجل انفرد به، وكما أنك ترى في الدنيا من يؤثر لذة الرياسة على المطعوم والمنكوح، وترى من يؤثر لذة العلم وانكشاف مشكلات ملكوت السمو</div></div></div>"}},"13":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.15","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"0.6","h":"0.55","c":"يَقُولُ","d":"yaqūlu","e":"ُlwُqَy"},{"b":"1.5","h":"1.44","c":"الْمُنَافِقُونَ","d":"l-munāfiqūna","e":"َnwُqِfَٰnُmْlٱ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"2.99","c":"وَالْمُنَافِقَاتُ","d":"wal-munāfiqātu","e":"ُtَٰqِfَٰnُmْlٱَw"},{"b":"5.2","h":"4.9","c":"لِلَّذِينَ","d":"lilladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlِl"},{"b":"6.5","h":"6.1","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"7.4","h":"6.98","c":"انْظُرُونَا","d":"unẓurūnā","e":"āَnwُrُẓnٱ"},{"b":"9.5","h":"8.74","c":"نَقْتَبِسْ","d":"naqtabis","e":"ْsِbَtْqَn"},{"b":"10.6","h":"10.01","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"12.0","h":"10.9","c":"نُورِكُمْ","d":"nūrikum","e":"ْmُkِrwُّn"},{"b":"13.0","h":"11.91","c":"قِيلَ","d":"qīla","e":"َlyِq"},{"b":"13.6","h":"12.51","c":"ارْجِعُوا","d":"ir'jiʿū","e":"۟āwُʿعِjgْrٱ"},{"b":"14.6","h":"13.66","c":"وَرَاءَكُمْ","d":"warāakum","e":"ْmُkَءٓāَrَw"},{"b":"17.5","h":"16.18","c":"فَالْتَمِسُوا","d":"fal-tamisū","e":"۟āwُsِmَtْlٱَf"},{"b":"18.9","h":"17.78","c":"نُورًا","d":"nūran","e":"āًrwُn"},{"b":"20.7","h":"19.32","c":"فَضُرِبَ","d":"faḍuriba","e":"َbِrُḍَf"},{"b":"21.6","h":"20.34","c":"بَيْنَهُمْ","d":"baynahum","e":"mُhَnْyَb"},{"b":"23.3","h":"21.94","c":"بِسُورٍ","d":"bisūrin","e":"ٍrwُsِb"},{"b":"24.2","h":"23.04","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ۥُhَّl"},{"b":"25.0","h":"32.96","c":"بَابٌ","d":"bābun","e":"ٌۢbāَb"},{"b":"34.3","h":"34.49","c":"بَاطِنُهُ","d":"bāṭinuhu","e":"ۥُhُnِṭāَb"},{"b":"35.5","h":"35.96","c":"فِيهِ","d":"fīhi","e":"ِhyِf"},{"b":"36.2","h":"36.74","c":"الرَّحْمَةُ","d":"l-raḥmatu","e":"ُẗَmْḥَّrlٱ"},{"b":"37.4","h":"38.05","c":"وَظَاهِرُهُ","d":"waẓāhiruhu","e":"ۥُhُrِhَٰẓَw"},{"b":"38.8","h":"39.96","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"40.3","h":"40.81","c":"قِبَلِهِ","d":"qibalihi","e":"ِhِlَbِq"},{"b":"41.1","h":"41.89","c":"الْعَذَابُ","d":"l-ʿadhābu","e":"ُbāَhdَʿعْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"On the [same] Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed, \"Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light.\" It will be said, \"Go back behind you and seek light.\" And a wall will be placed between them with a door, its interior containing mercy, but on the outside of it is torment.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book6.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Love, Longing, and Intimacy</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And His saying, the Exalted: \"Look at us, let us borrow from your light - it is said: Go back behind you and seek light\" indicates that the lights (Anwar) must have their foundation (Asl) acquired in this world (Dunya), then they increase in radiance (Ishraq) in the Hereafter (Akhira).

It is sufficient in censuring deception (Al-Ghuroor), and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said \"How excellent is the sleep of the intelligent and their breaking of fast, how they surpass the staying awake of the foolish and their striving, and a speck's weight of one with piety (Taqwa) and certainty (Yaqeen) is better than the earth filled with the deceived ones\"[1] and he ﷺ said \"The intelligent is he who holds his self (Nafs) accountable and works for what is after death, and the foolish is he who follows his self (Nafs) its desire (Hawa) and hopes upon Allah\"[2] and all that has come regarding the virtue of knowledge and the censure of ignorance is evidence for censuring deception (Al-Ghuroor), because deception (Al-Ghuroor) is an expression for some types of ignorance, since ignorance is to believe a thing and see it contrary to what it is, and deception (Al-Ghuroor) is ignorance except that there is ignorance that is not deception (Al-Ghuroor), rather it necessitates deception (Al-Ghuroor): a deceived one in it specified and a deceived one by it which is that which deceives him. So whenever the striving one believes something that agrees with desire (Hawa) and the cause necessitating ignorance is a false doubt and imagination that he thinks is evidence and it is not evidence, the ignorance occurring by it is called deception (Al-Ghuroor). So deception (Al-Ghuroor) is the settling of the self (Nafs) to what agrees with desire (Hawa), and inclines to it the natural disposition from a doubt and trick of Satan, so whoever believes that he is upon good either in the immediate or in the ultimate from a false doubt, then he is deceived, and most people think of themselves good and they are mistaken in it, so most people therefore are deceived even if the types of their deception differ and their degrees differ, until the deception of some of them is more apparent and more</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>اعلم أن قوله تعالى \"فلا تغرنكم الحياة الدنيا ولا يغرنكم بالله الغرور\" وقوله تعالى \"ولكنكم فتنتم أنفسكم وتربضتم وارتبتم وغرتكم الأماني\" الآية. كاف في ذم الغرور، وقد قال رسول الله ﭬ \"حبذا نوم الأكياس وفطرهم كيف يغبنون سهر الحمقى واجتهادهم ولمثقال ذرة من صاحب تقوى ويقين أفضل من ملئ الأرض من المغترين\"[1] وقال ﭬ \"الكيس من دان نفسه وعمل لما بعد الموت، والأحمق من اتبع نفسه هواها وتمنى على الله\"[2] وكل ما ورد في فضل العلم وذم الجهل فهو دليل على ذم الغرور، لأن الغرور عبارة عن بعض أنواع الجهل، إذ الجهل هو أن يعتقد الشيء ويراه على خلاف ما هو به، والغرور هو جهل إلا أن لك جهل ليس بغرور، بل يستدعي الغرور: مغروراً فيه مخصوصاً ومغروراً به وهو الذي يغره. فمهما كان المجهدل المعتقد شيئاً يوافق الهوى وكان السبب الموجب للجهل شبهة ومخيلة فاسدة يظن أنها دليل ولا تكون دليلاً سمي الجهل الحاصل به غروراً. فالغرور هو سكون النفس إلى ما يوافق الهوى، ويميل إليه الطبع عن شبهة وخدعة من الشيطان فمن اعتقد أنه على خير إما في العاجل أو في الآجل عن شبهة فاسدة فهو مغرور، وأكثر الناس يظنون بأنفسهم الخير وهم مخطئون فيه، فأكثر الناس إذن مغرورون وإن اختلفت أصناف غرورهم واختلفت درجاتهم، حتى كان غرور بعضهم أظهر وأش</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And some interpreters said regarding His saying, the Exalted: 'You tempted yourselves (Nafs)' {} He said: with desires and pleasures 'And you awaited' {} He said: with repentance 'And you doubted' {} He said: you doubted 'Until came the command of Allah' {} He said: death 'And deceived you regarding Allah the deceiver' {} He said: Satan.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال بعض المفسرين في قوله تعالى: ﴿ فتنتم أنفسكم ﴾ {} قال بالشهوات واللذات ﴿ وتربصتم ﴾ {} قال بالتوبة ﴿ وارتبتم ﴾ {} قال شككتم ﴿ حتى جاء أمر الله ﴾ {} قال الموت ﴿ وغركم بالله الغرور ﴾ {} قال الشيطان.</div></div></div>"}},"15":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.45","c":"فَالْيَوْمَ","d":"fal-yawma","e":"َmْwَyْlٱَf"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.53","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.99","c":"يُؤْخَذُ","d":"yu'khadhu","e":"ُhdَhkْwʾُy"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.03","c":"مِنْكُمْ","d":"minkum","e":"ْmُknِm"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.37","c":"فِدْيَةٌ","d":"fid'yatun","e":"ٌẗَyْdِf"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.15","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"6.6","h":"8","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"6.9","h":"8.4","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"8.0","h":"9.66","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"۟āwُrَfَk"},{"b":"9.8","h":"12.55","c":"مَأْوَاكُمُ","d":"mawākumu","e":"ُmُkٰàَwْaʾَm"},{"b":"11.2","h":"14.07","c":"النَّارُ","d":"l-nāru","e":"ُrāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"13.2","h":"15.69","c":"هِيَ","d":"hiya","e":"َàِh"},{"b":"13.6","h":"16.22","c":"مَوْلَاكُمْ","d":"mawlākum","e":"ْmُkٰàَlْwَm"},{"b":"15.0","h":"17.94","c":"وَبِئْسَ","d":"wabi'sa","e":"َsْyʾِbَw"},{"b":"15.9","h":"18.94","c":"الْمَصِيرُ","d":"l-maṣīru","e":"ُryِṣَmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved.

Truthfulness in Oneness is for the general believers. Allah the Exalted said: 'And those who believe in Allah and His messengers - those are the truthful ones (al-Siddiqun).' And truthfulness in obedience is for the people of knowledge and piety, and truthfulness in knowledge is for the people of sainthood (Wilayah) who are the pegs of the earth.'

I say: Their doubt is the generalities of the Quran. As for the Murji'a, they said: The believer does not enter the Fire even if he commits all sins, due to His saying, the Mighty and Majestic: 'So whoever believes in his Lord, he fears neither loss nor tyranny' and due to His saying, the Exalted: 'And those who believe in Allah and His messengers - those are the Truthful Ones (al-Siddiqun)' the verse, and due to His saying: 'Whenever a group is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them...' until His saying: 'So we denied and said: Allah has not sent down anything.' So His saying 'Whenever a group is thrown into it' is general, so it should be that whoever is thrown into the Fire is a denier, and due to His saying: 'None will burn in it except the most wretched, who denied and turned away' and this is restriction, affirmation, and negation, and due to His saying: 'Whoever comes with a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be secure' so Faith (Iman) is the head of good deeds, and due to His saying: 'And Allah loves the Doers of Good (al-Muhsinin)' and He said: 'Indeed, We do not allow to be lost the reward of any who does good in deed.' And they have no proof in that, for when Faith (Iman) is mentioned in these verses, what is intended by it is Faith (Iman) with action, since we have clarified that Faith (Iman) may be used and what is intended by it is Islam, which is agreement with the Heart (Qalb), speech, and action. The evidence for this interpretation is many reports about punishing the disobedient and the measures of punishment, and his saying (peace be upon him): 'He will be brought out of the Fire whoever had in his heart an atom's weight of Faith (Iman)' so how can he be brought out if he did not enter?

This indicates that His saying: \"That is the Bounty (Fadl) of Allah which He gives to whom He wills\" means the increased reward of the poor over their remembrance (Dhikr).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد استشهد ابن عطاء أيضاً لما سئل عن ذلك فقال: الغني أفضل لأنه وصف الحق، أما دليله الأول ففيه نظر، لأن الخبر قد ورد مفصلاً تفصيلاً يدل على خلاف ذلك: وهو أن ثواب الفقير في التسبيح يزيد على ثواب الغني، وأن فوزهم بذلك الثواب فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء، فقد روى يزيد بن أسلم عن أنس بن مالك رضي الله عنه قال: بعثني الفقراء رسولاً إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال: إني رسول الفقراء إليك؛ فقال: \" مرحباً بك وبمن جئت من عندهم قوم أحبهم \" قال: قالوا يا رسول الله إن الأغنياء ذهبوا بالخير يحجون ولا نقدر عليه، ويعتمرون ولا نقدر عليه، وإذا مرضوا بعثوا بفضل أموالهم ذخيرة لهم؛ فقال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: \" بلغ عني الفقراء أن لمن صبر واحتسب منكم ثلاث خصال ليست للأغنياء: أما خصلة واحدة: فإن في الجنة غرفاً ينظر إليها أهل الجنة كما ينظر أهل الأرض إلى نجوم السماء، لا يدخلها إلا نبي فقير، أو شهيد فقير، أو مؤمن فقير، والثانية: يدخل الفقراء الجنة قبل الأغنياء بنصف يوم وهو خمسمائة عام، والثالثة: سبحان الله والحمد لله ولا إله إلا الله والله أكبر، وقال الفقير مثل ذلك لم يلحق الغني بالفقير ولو أنفق فيها عشرة آلاف درهم، وكذلك أعمال البر كلها \"، فرجع إليهم فأخبرهم بما قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فقالوا: رضينا رضينا[45]. فهذا يدل على أن قوله: \" ذلك فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء \" أي مزيد ثواب الفقراء على ذكرهم.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book4.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Poverty and Abstinence</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>This indicates that His saying: \"That is the Grace (Fadl) of Allah, He bestows it upon whom He wills\" means the increased reward of the poor over their remembrance (Dhikr). As for the statement that richness is an attribute of the Truth (Al-Haqq), some shaykhs responded to it by saying: Do you see that Allah the Exalted is rich (Ghani) through causes and accidents? He fell silent and did not speak. Others answered by saying: Indeed, arrogance (Takabbur) is from the attributes of the Truth, so it should be better than humility (Tawadu'). Then they said: Rather, this indicates that poverty is better because the attributes of servitude (Ubudiyyah) are a grace (Fadl) for the servant (Abd) like fear (Khawf) and hope (Raja'), and the attributes of lordship (Rububiyyah) should not be contended over. Therefore, Allah the Exalted said in what was narrated from our Prophet, peace be upon him: \"Pride (Kibriya') is My cloak and majesty (Izzah) is My garment, so whoever contends with Me in one of them, I will break him.\" And Sahl said: Love of honor (Izz) and permanence (Baqa') is polytheism (Shirk) in lordship and contention in it because they are from the attributes of the Lord, the Exalted. From this category, they spoke about preferring the rich and the poor, and the essence of that is attachment to generalities that accept interpretations and deficient words whose contradiction is not far, for just as the statement of one who prefers richness because it is an attribute of the Truth through arrogance is contradicted, likewise the statement of one who censures richness because it is a description of the servant with knowledge (Ilm) and recognition (Ma'rifah) is contradicted, for it is a description of the Lord, the Exalted, and ignorance (Jahl) and heedlessness (Ghaflah) are descriptions of the servant, and no one should prefer heedlessness over knowledge. The unveiling of the veil from this is what we mentioned in the Book of Patience (Kitab al-Sabr): which is that what is not intended for itself but is intended for something else then</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فهذا يدل على أن قوله: \" ذلك فضل الله يؤتيه من يشاء \" أي مزيد ثواب الفقراء على ذكرهم. وأما قوله: إن الغني وصف الحق، فقد أجابه بعض الشيوخ فقال: أترى أن الله تعالى غني بالأسباب والأعراض، فانقطع ولم ينطق، وأجاب آخرون فقالوا: إن التكبر من صفات الحق فينبغي أن يكون أفضل من التواضع، ثم قالوا: بل هذا يدل على أن الفقر أفضل لأن صفات العبودية فضل للعبد كالخوف والرجاء، وصفات الربوبية لا ينبغي أن ينازع فيها، ولذلك قال تعالى فيما روى عنه نبينا صلى الله عليه وسلم: \" الكبرياء ردائي والعظمة إزاري، فمن نازعني واحداً منهما قصمته\"[46]. وقال سهل: حب العز والبقاء شرك في الربوبية ومنازعة فيها لأنهما من صفات الرب تعالى؛ فمن هذا الجنس تكلموا في تفضيل الغني والفقير، وحاصل ذلك تعلق بعمومات تقبل التأويلات وبكلمات قاصرة لا تبعد مناقضتها، إذ كما يناقض قول من فضل الغني بأنه صفة الحق بالتكبر، فكذلك يناقض قول من ذم الغني لأنه وصف للعبد بالعلم والمعرفة فإنه وصف الرب تعالى، والجهل والغفلة وصف العبد، وليس لأحد أن يفضل الغفلة على العلم، فكشف الغطاء عن هذا هو ما ذكرناه في كتاب الصبر: وهو أن ما لا يراد لعينه بل يراد لغيره ف</div></div></div>"}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.45","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.09","c":"أَصَابَ","d":"aṣāba","e":"َbāَṣَaʾ"},{"b":"2.6","h":"3.37","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"3.6","h":"4.38","c":"مُصِيبَةٍ","d":"muṣībatin","e":"ٍẗَbyِṣُّm"},{"b":"5.5","h":"6.62","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"5.9","h":"7.01","c":"الْأَرْضِ","d":"l-arḍi","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"6.8","h":"8.09","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"7.4","h":"8.94","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٓàِf"},{"b":"9.0","h":"10.58","c":"أَنْفُسِكُمْ","d":"anfusikum","e":"ْmُkِsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"11.1","h":"12.81","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"12.0","h":"13.94","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"12.4","h":"14.61","c":"كِتَابٍ","d":"kitābin","e":"ٍbَٰtِk"},{"b":"18.4","h":"16.83","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِّm"},{"b":"19.6","h":"17.76","c":"قَبْلِ","d":"qabli","e":"ِlْbَq"},{"b":"20.3","h":"18.73","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"22.","h":"19.87","c":"نَبْرَأَهَا","d":"nabra-ahā","e":"ٓāَhَaʾَrْbَّn"},{"b":"23.9","h":"25.24","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"25.2","h":"26.63","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"26.1","h":"27.69","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"26.5","h":"28.42","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"27.5","h":"29.71","c":"يَسِيرٌ","d":"yasīrun","e":"ٌryِsَy"}],"a":{"g":"No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy -"}},"23":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.3","c":"لِكَيْلَا","d":"likaylā","e":"āَlْyَkِّl"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.78","c":"تَأْسَوْا","d":"tasaw","e":"۟āْwَsْaʾَt"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.11","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.1","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.79","c":"فَاتَكُمْ","d":"fātakum","e":"ْmُkَtāَf"},{"b":"4.4","h":"6.53","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"5.0","h":"7.43","c":"تَفْرَحُوا","d":"tafraḥū","e":"۟āwُḥَrْfَt"},{"b":"6.1","h":"9.19","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"ٓāَmِb"},{"b":"8.1","h":"11.34","c":"ءَاتَاكُمْ","d":"ātākum","e":"ْmُkٰàَtāَء"},{"b":"9.9","h":"16.25","c":"وَاللَّهُ","d":"wal-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱَw"},{"b":"11.1","h":"17.79","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"11.5","h":"18.46","c":"يُحِبُّ","d":"yuḥibbu","e":"ُّbِḥُy"},{"b":"12.4","h":"19.68","c":"كُلَّ","d":"kulla","e":"َّlُk"},{"b":"13.1","h":"20.6","c":"مُخْتَالٍ","d":"mukh'tālin","e":"ٍlāَtْhkُm"},{"b":"15.4","h":"22.99","c":"فَخُورٍ","d":"fakhūrin","e":"ٍrwُhkَf"}],"a":{"g":"In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you.
