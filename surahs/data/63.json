If it is mixed with a taint of the desires of the Soul (Nafs), the truthfulness of intention is invalidated, and its possessor may be called a liar, as we have narrated in the virtue of sincerity (Ikhlas) from the Hadith of the Three when the scholar is asked: 'What did you do with what you knew?' He said: 'I did such and such.' Allah the Exalted said: 'You have lied, rather you intended that it be said: So-and-so is a scholar.' The Hadith of the Three when the scholar was asked: 'What did you do with what you knew?' The Hadith has preceded, for He did not call him a liar and did not say to him: 'You did not act,' but He called him a liar in his will (Iradah) and intention (Niyyah). And some have said: 'Truthfulness (Sidq) is the soundness of monotheism (Tawhid) in purpose (Qasd).' Likewise, the saying of Allah the Exalted: 'And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars.' And they said: 'Indeed, you are the Messenger of Allah.' And this is truthfulness, but their lying is not from the aspect of tongue utterance, but from the aspect of the heart's conscience (Damir Al-Qalb). And the calling liar pertains to the report, and this saying includes reporting by circumstantial evidence (Qarinah Al-Hal), since its possessor shows from himself that he believes what he says, so he lied in his indication by circumstantial evidence (Qarinah Al-Hal) to what is in his heart, for he lied in that and did not lie in what he utters. Thus, one of the meanings of truthfulness (Sidq) returns to the purity of intention (Niyyah), which is sincerity (Ikhlas), so every truthful one must be sincere (Mukhlis).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الصدق الثانى في النية والإرادة ويرجع ذلك إلى الإخلاص وهو أن لا يكون له باعث في الحركات والسكنات إلا الله تعالى فإن مازجه شوب من حظوظ النفس بطل صدق النية وصاحبه يجوز أن يسمى كاذبا كما روينا في فضيلة الإخلاص من حديث الثلاثة حين يسئل العالم ما عملت فيما علمت فقال فعلت كذا وكذا فقال الله تعالى كذبت بل أردت أن يقال فلان عالم حديث الثلاثة حين سأل العالم ماذا عملت فيما علمت الحديث تقدم فإنه لم يكذبه ولم يقل له لم تعمل ولكنه كذبه في إرادته ونيته وقد قال بعضهم الصدق صحة التوحيد في القصد وكذلك قول الله تعالى والله يشهد إن المنافقين لكاذبون وقد قالوا إنك لرسول الله وهذا صدق ولكن كذبهم لا من حيث نطق اللسان بل من حيث ضمير القلب وكان التكذيب يتطرق إلى الخبر وهذا القول يتضمن إخبارا بقرينة الحال إذ صاحبه يظهر من نفسه أن يعتقد ما يقول فكذب في دلالته بقرينة الحال على ما في قلبه فإنه كذب في ذلك ولم يكذب فيما يلفظ به فيرجع أحد معانى الصدق إلى خلوص النية وهو الإخلاص فكل صادق فلا بد وأن يكون مخلصا.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-4.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Prayer</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, He said [ﷺ]: \"Between us and the hypocrites are the prayers of the dusk [al-'atamah] and the dawn [al-subh]; they are incapable of performing them.\" And He said [ﷺ]: \"Whoever meets Allah while having neglected the prayer [al-salah], Allah will not care for any of his good deeds.\" And He said [ﷺ]: \"The prayer [al-salah] is the pillar [‘imad] of the religion [al-din]; so whoever abandons it has demolished the religion.\" And He was asked [ﷺ]: \"Which deed is most excellent?\" He said: \"The prayer [al-salah] at its appointed times.\" And He said [ﷺ]: \"Whoever is diligent in performing the five [prayers] by perfecting their purification [tuhur] and their appointed times, they will be a light [nur] and a proof [burhan] for him on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever neglects them will be gathered with Pharaoh and Haman.\" And He said [ﷺ]: \"The key to Paradise is the prayer [al-salah].\" And He said: \"After the declaration of Oneness [al-tawhid], Allah has not obligated upon His creation anything more beloved to Him than the prayer [al-salah]. If there were anything more beloved to Him than it, He would have made His angels worship through it: among them bowing [raki'], among them prostrating [sajid], and among them standing [qa'im] and sitting [qa'id].\" And the Prophet [ﷺ] said: \"Whoever intentionally abandons a prayer [salah] has disbelieved [kafara]\" — meaning, he has come close to being stripped from faith [al-iman] by the loosening of its bond and the collapse of its pillar, just as one says of him who has approached a town that he has reached it and entered it.

(And when the peace be upon him saw his son Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him, stumbling in his shirt, he descended from the pulpit and embraced him, then said: 'Allah has spoken the truth: \"Your wealth and your children are but a trial\" {} for when I saw my son stumbling, I could not control my soul (Nafs) from taking him[20].') In that is a lesson for those of insight. The man, every man, is he who is patient upon well-being, and the meaning of patience upon it is that he does not rely upon it and knows that all of that is a deposit with him, and perhaps it will be reclaimed soon, and that he does not release his soul (Nafs) in rejoicing in it, nor does he immerse himself in enjoyment, pleasure, amusement, and play, and that he observes the rights of Allah in his wealth through spending, in his body through offering assistance to creation, in his tongue through offering truth, and likewise in all that Allah has bestowed upon him. And this patience is connected to gratitude, so it is not complete except by fulfilling the right of gratitude as will come later. And patience upon prosperity is more severe only because it is accompanied by ability, and from protection is that you are not able. And patience upon cupping and intention when someone else undertakes it is easier than patience upon bleeding yourself and cupping yourself, and the hungry person in the absence of food is more capable of patience than when delicious, tasty foods are present to him and he has ability over them, then...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولذلك حذر الله عباده من فتنة المال والزوج والولد فقال تعالى: ﴿ يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تلهكم أموالكم ولا أولادكم عن ذكر الله ﴾ {} وقال عز وجل: ﴿ ان من أزواجكم وأولادكم عدوا لكم فاحذروهم ﴾ {} وقال ﭬ: (الولد مبخلة مجبنة محزنة[19]).
