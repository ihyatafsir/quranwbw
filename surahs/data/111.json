And He the Exalted says: \"Woe to every slanderer [humaza] and backbiter [lumaza].\" It is said: \"The slanderer [al-humaza] is the tale-bearer [an-namam].\" And He the Exalted says: \"A carrier of firewood [hamalata al-hatab].\" It is said she was a tale-bearer [namama], a carrier of speech. And He the Exalted says: \"But they betrayed them, so they availed them nothing against Allah.\" It is said: \"The wife of Lot used to inform about the guests, and the wife of Noah used to inform that he was mad.\" And He ﷺ said: \"The tale-bearer [an-namam] will not enter Paradise.\" And in another narration: \"The tale-bearer [al-qattat] will not enter Paradise.\" And the tale-bearer [al-qattat] is the tale-bearer [an-namam]. And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"The most beloved of you to Allah are the best of you in character, the most accommodating, those who befriend and are befriended. And the most hateful of you to Allah are those who go about with tale-bearing [an-namima], those who separate between brothers, those who seek out the faults of the innocent.\" And He ﷺ said: \"Shall I not inform you of the worst of you?\" They said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Those who go about with tale-bearing [an-namima], those who cause corruption between loved ones, those who seek out faults for the innocent.\" And Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"Whoever spreads a word about a Muslim to disgrace him with it without right, Allah will disgrace him with it in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.\" And Abu ad-Darda' said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"Any man who spreads a word about a man while he is innocent of it to disgrace him with it in the world, it is a right upon Allah to melt him with it on the Day of Resurrection in the Fire.\" And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"Whoever bears witness against a Muslim with testimony for which he is not worthy, let him take his seat in the Fire.\" And it is said: \"One-third of the punishment of the grave is from tale-bearing [an-namima].\" And from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet ﷺ: \"Indeed, when Allah created Paradise, He said to it: 'Speak.' So it said: 'Fortunate is he who enters me.' So the Compeller, majestic is His majesty and mighty is His might, said: 'By My might and My majesty, eight types of people from mankind will not dwell in you: the addicted to wine, the persistent in fornication, the tale-bearer [al-qattat] and he is the tale-bearer [an-namam], the pimp, the policeman, the effeminate man, the severer of kinship ties, and he who says concerning Allah's covenant: 'If I do not do such and such...' and does not fulfill it.'\" And Ka'b al-Ahbar narrated that the Children of Israel were struck by drought, so Musa, peace be upon him, prayed for rain many times, but they were not given rain.
