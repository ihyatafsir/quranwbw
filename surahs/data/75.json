And Satan calls them to sovereignty in this world, knowing that sovereignty in the Hereafter is lost by it, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives, and knowing that this world will not be safe for him either—and even if it were safe for him, he would envy it also—but sovereignty in this world is not free from disputes, disturbances, the length of cares in management, and likewise all the causes of status. Then, however much it is safe and the causes are complete, the lifespan ends: **\"Until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people think that they are capable of it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday.\"** (10:24) So God, the Most High, struck a parable for it, saying, the Most High: **\"And present to them the example of the life of this world [al-hayat al-dunya] as [like] water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it; then it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds.\"** (18:45) And asceticism [zuhd] in this world, since it is a present sovereignty, Satan envied it and turned him away from it. And the meaning of asceticism is that the servant [al-'abd] masters his passion [shahwa] and his anger [ghadab], so they submit to the motive of religion and its indication.</div></div></div>"}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.7","c":"وَتَذَرُونَ","d":"watadharūna","e":"َnwُrَhdَtَw"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.37","c":"الْءَاخِرَةَ","d":"l-ākhirata","e":"َẗَrِhkāَءْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And leave the Hereafter."}},"22":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.85","c":"وُجُوهٌ","d":"wujūhun","e":"ٌhwُjgُw"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.83","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.41","c":"نَاضِرَةٌ","d":"nāḍiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِḍāَّn"}],"a":{"g":"[Some] faces, that Day, will be radiant,","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol1 book 2</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, the ninth foundation: the knowledge [ma'rifa] that He, the Exalted, while being sanctified from form [surah] and dimension [miqdar], purified from directions [jihat] and spatial confines [aqtar], is seen [mura'i] by the eyes [a'yun] and the sights [absar] in the Abode of the Hereafter [Dar al-Akhirah], the Abode of Permanence [Dar al-Qarar], due to His saying, the Exalted: \"Faces [wujuh] on that day will be radiant, looking [nazirah] at their Lord [Rabb]\" (75:22-23). And He is not seen in this world [dunya], confirming His saying, Mighty and Majestic: \"Eyesights [absar] do not perceive Him, yet He perceives eyesights\" (6:103), and due to His saying, the Exalted, in His address to Musa, peace be upon him: \"You will not see Me\" (7:143). And I wonder how the Mu'tazilite presumed to know from the attributes [sifat] of the Lord of lords what Musa, peace be upon him, was ignorant of, and how could Musa, peace be upon him, ask for the vision [ru'yah] while it is impossible? Perhaps ignorance is more fitting for the people of innovation [bid'ah] and caprice [ahwa'] from among the ignorant fools than it is for the Prophets, may the prayers of God be upon them. As for the manner of applying the verse of vision [ayah al-ru'yah] according to its apparent meaning [zahir], it is that it does not lead to impossibility, for vision [ru'yah] is a type of unveiling [kashf] and knowledge ['ilm], except that it is more complete and clearer than knowledge. So, if it is permissible for knowledge to be related to Him while He is not in a direction [jihat], then it is permissible for vision [ru'yah] to be related to Him while He is not in a direction. And just as it is permissible for God, the Exalted, to see the creation [khalq] while not being opposite them, it is permissible for the creation to see Him without opposition. And just as it is permissible to know Him without modality [kayfiyyah] or form [surah], it is permissible to see Him likewise.</div></div></div>"}},"23":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.57","h":"1.14","c":"رَبِّهَا","d":"rabbihā","e":"āَhِّbَr"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.03","c":"نَاظِرَةٌ","d":"nāẓiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِẓāَn"}],"a":{"g":"Looking at their Lord."}},"24":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1","c":"وَوُجُوهٌ","d":"wawujūhun","e":"ٌhwُjgُwَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"3.18","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"ٍۭhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.42","c":"بَاسِرَةٌ","d":"bāsiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِsāَb"}],"a":{"g":"And [some] faces, that Day, will be contorted,"}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.5","c":"تَظُنُّ","d":"taẓunnu","e":"ُّnُẓَt"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.91","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.09","c":"يُفْعَلَ","d":"yuf'ʿala","e":"َlَʿعْfُy"},{"b":"3.4","h":"4.18","c":"بِهَا","d":"bihā","e":"āَhِb"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.17","c":"فَاقِرَةٌ","d":"fāqiratun","e":"ٌẗَrِqāَf"}],"a":{"g":"Expecting that there will be done to them [something] backbreaking."}},"26":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.95","c":"كَلَّا","d":"kallā","e":"ٓāَّlَk"},{"b":"1.5","h":"3.07","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.05","c":"بَلَغَتِ","d":"balaghati","e":"ِtَغَlَb"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.3","c":"التَّرَاقِيَ","d":"l-tarāqiya","e":"َàِqāَrَّtlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"No!

If a single layer from them were lost, or an attribute from its attributes were removed, the eye would be incapacitated from sight. So look now at the bones—they are solid, strong bodies—how did He create them from a lowly, delicate sperm-drop [nutfah]? Then He made them the framework [qiwam] for the body and its support [‘amad]. Then He proportioned them with different measures and different forms.</div></div></div>"}},"38":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.85","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.4","h":"1.98","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"1.9","h":"2.92","c":"عَلَقَةً","d":"ʿalaqatan","e":"ًẗَqَlَʿع"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.94","c":"فَخَلَقَ","d":"fakhalaqa","e":"َqَlَhkَf"},{"b":"4.3","h":"6.18","c":"فَسَوَّى","d":"fasawwā","e":"ٰàَّwَsَf"}],"a":{"g":"Then he was a clinging clot, and [Allah] created [his form] and proportioned [him]","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>Vol3 book 9a</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Then He mentioned His favor upon him, saying: \"Then He created and proportioned, and made from him the two spouses, the male and the female,\" so that his existence [wujud] would endure through procreation [tanasul], just as his existence was first obtained through origination [ikhtira'].</div></div></div>"}},"39":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.65","c":"فَجَعَلَ","d":"fajaʿala","e":"َlَʿعَjgَf"},{"b":"0.79","h":"1.53","c":"مِنْهُ","d":"min'hu","e":"ُhْnِm"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.4","c":"الزَّوْجَيْنِ","d":"l-zawjayni","e":"ِnْyَjgْwَّzlٱ"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.2","c":"الذَّكَرَ","d":"l-dhakara","e":"َrَkَّhdlٱ"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.46","c":"وَالْأُنْثَى","d":"wal-unthā","e":"ٰٓàَhtnُaʾْlٱَw"}],"a":{"g":"And made of him two mates, the male and the female."}},"40":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.85","c":"أَلَيْسَ","d":"alaysa","e":"َsْyَlَaʾ"},{"b":"0.78","h":"1.68","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.89","c":"بِقَادِرٍ","d":"biqādirin","e":"ٍrِdَٰqِb"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.68","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ٰٓàَlَʿع"},{"b":"3.0","h":"6.89","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"5.6","h":"8.22","c":"يُحْيِيَ","d":"yuḥ'yiya","e":"َàِۦْḥُy"},{"b":"6.5","h":"9.28","c":"الْمَوْتَى","d":"l-mawtā","e":"ٰàَtْwَmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Is not that [Creator] Able to give life to the dead?","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 8px;'>j4 k08</span><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;'>Indeed, woe unto you, O soul [nafs]!
