So, for whom Allah the Exalted is his Sufficiency [ḥasbuhu] and his Provider [kāfīhi] and his Beloved [muḥibbuhu] and his Guardian [murā'īhi]: then he has attained the great success [al-fawz al-'aẓīm].

And He the Exalted has said: \"Is not Allah sufficient for His servant?\" So, the seeker of sufficiency [kifāya] from other than Him and the abandoner of reliance [tawakkul] is the one who denies this verse. For it is a question in the form of an elicitation of the truth [istiṇṭāq bi-al-ḥaqq], like His saying the Exalted: \"Has there [not] come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned?\" And the Almighty has said: \"And whoever relies upon Allah [yatawakkal 'alā Allāh] – then indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\" That is, Mighty ['azīz] – He does not humiliate the one who seeks refuge in Him, nor does He waste the one who clings to His side and seeks the protection of His sanctuary and His safeguard; and Wise [ḥakīm] – He does not fall short in managing the affairs of the one who relies [tawakkala] upon His management.
