How can the servant (Al-Abd) be an owner when he himself does not own himself, but rather is owned by another? Indeed, the creation (Al-Khalq) are servants of Allah (Ibad Allah) and the earth is the table of Allah (Maidat Allah), and He has permitted them to eat from His table according to their need, like a king who sets a table for his servants. So whoever takes a morsel with his right hand and encloses it with his knuckles, and then another servant comes and wants to snatch it from his hand, he cannot be prevented from it not because the morsel has become his property by taking it with the hand, for the hand and the owner of the hand are also owned. But if each specific morsel does not fulfill the need of all the servants, then justice in specification occurs when there is a kind of preference, distinction, and taking—a distinction that the servant uniquely possesses—so that those who do not present such distinction are prevented from competing with him. Thus, one should understand the command of Allah regarding His servants. Therefore, we say: whoever takes from the worldly wealth more than his need and hoards it and holds onto it, while among the servants of Allah are those who need it, he is unjust (Zalim) and is among those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend them in the path of Allah (Sabil Allah). And indeed, the path of Allah is obedience to Him (Taatuhu), and the provision for the creation in His obedience is worldly wealth, for through it their necessities are repelled and their needs are elevated. Indeed, this does not fall within the scope of legal rulings (Fatawa Al-Fiqh) because the measures of needs are hidden, and the souls (Al-Nufus) in sensing poverty in the future are different, and the ends of lifespans are unknown, so imposing this on the common people proceeds in the manner of...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فالعدل هو أن يكون أولى به، وعبر الفقراء عن هذا الترجيح بالملك، وهو مجاز محض، إذ لا ملك إلا لملك الملوك الذى له ما في السموات والأرض وكيف يكون العبد مالكا وهو في نفسه ليس يملك نفسه بل هو ملك غيره، نعم الخلق عباد الله والأرض مائدة الله وقد أذن لهم في الأكل من مائدته بقدر حاجتهم كالملك ينصب مائدة لعبيده، فمن أخذ لقمة بيمينه واحتوت عليها براجمه فجاء عبد آخر وأراد انتزاعها من يده لم يمكن منه لا لأن اللقمة صارت ملكا له بالأخذ باليد فإن اليد وصاحب اليد أيضا مملوك ولكن إذا كانت كل لقمة بعينها لا تفى بحاجة كل العبيد فالعدل في التخصيص عند حصول ضرب من الترجيح والاختصاص والأخذ اختصاص ينفرد به العبد فمنع من لا يدلى بذلك الاختصاص عن مزاحمته فهكذا ينبغى أن تفهم أمر الله في في عباده ولذلك نقول من أخذ من أموال الدنيا أكثر من حاجته وكنزه وأمسكه وفي عباد الله من يحتاج إليه فهو ظالم وهو من الذين يكنزون الذهب والفضة ولا ينفقونها في سبيل الله وإنما سبيل الله طاعته وزاد الخلق في طاعته أموال الدنيا، إذ بها تندفع ضروراتهم وترتفع حاجاتهم، نعم لا يدخل هذا في حد فتاوى الفقة لأن مقادير الحاجات خفية والنفوس في استشعار الفقر في الاستقبال مختلفة وأواخر الأعمار غير معلومة فتكليف العوام ذلك يجرى مجرى</div></div></div>"}},"3":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.6","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnwُّbِḥَtْsَy"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.99","c":"يَسْتَحِبُّونَ","d":"yastaḥibbūna","e":"َẗٰwَyَḥْlٱ"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.26","c":"الْحَيَوةَ","d":"l-ḥayata","e":"āَyْnُّdlٱ"},{"b":"3.9","h":"5.85","c":"الدُّنْيَا","d":"l-dun'yā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"4.9","h":"7.25","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"ِẗَrِhkāَءْlٱ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.89","c":"الْءَاخِرَةِ","d":"l-ākhirati","e":"َnwُّdُṣَyَw"},{"b":"6.7","h":"9.72","c":"وَيَصُدُّونَ","d":"wayaṣuddūna","e":"nَʿع"},{"b":"8.1","h":"11.62","c":"عَنْ","d":"ʿan","e":"ِlyِbَs"},{"b":"8.9","h":"12.63","c":"سَبِيلِ","d":"sabīli","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.9","h":"13.89","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"āَhَnwُغْbَyَw"},{"b":"10.7","h":"15.06","c":"وَيَبْغُونَهَا","d":"wayabghūnahā","e":"āًjgَwِʿع"},{"b":"12.3","h":"17.25","c":"عِوَجًا","d":"ʿiwajan","e":"َkِyʾَٰٓl۟wُaʾ"},{"b":"13.9","h":"21.71","c":"أُولَئِكَ","d":"ulāika","e":"àِf"},{"b":"16.1","h":"24.3","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٍۭlَٰlَḍ"},{"b":"16.5","h":"24.95","c":"ضَلَالٍ","d":"ḍalālin","e":"ٍdyِʿعَb"},{"b":"18.6","h":"27.1","c":"بَعِيدٍ","d":"baʿīdin","e":"ٓāَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"The ones who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter and avert [people] from the way of Allah, seeking to make it (seem) deviant.

And the deluded one is he whose insight has not opened to be sufficient for guiding his own self and</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>الحمد لله الذي بيده مقاليد الأمور، وبقدرته مفاتيح الخيرات والشرور، مخرج أوليائه من الظلمات إلى النور، ومورد أعدائه ورطات الغرور، والصلاة على محمد مخرج الخلائق من الديجور، وعلى آله وأصحابه الذين لم تغرهم الحياة الدنيا ولم يغرهم بالله الغرور، صلاة تتوالى على ممر الدهور ومكر الساعات والشهور. أما بعد: فمفتاح السعادة التيقظ والفطنة، ومنبع الشقاوة الغرور والغفلة فلا نعمة لله على عباده أعظم من الإيمان والمعرفة، ولا وسيلة سوى انشراح الصدر بنور البصيرة، ولا نقمة أعظم من الكفر والمعصية، ولا داعي إليهما سوى عمى القلب بظلمة الجهالة، فالأكياس وأرباب البصائر قلوبهم \"كمشكاة فيها مصباح المصباح في زجاجة الزجاجة كأنها كوكب دري يوقد من شجرة مباركة زيتونة لا شرقية ولا غربية يكاد زيتها يضيء ولو لم تمسسه نار نور على نور\" والمغترون قلوبهم \"كظلمات في بحر لجي يغشاه موج من فوقه سحاب ظلمات بعضها فوق بعض إذا أخرج يده لم يكد يراها ومن لم يجعل الله له نوراً فما له من نور\" فالأكياس هم الذين أراد الله أن يهديهم فشرح صدورهم للإسلام والهدى، والمغترون هم الذين أراد الله أن يضلهم فجعل صدرهم ضيقاً حرجاً كأنما يصعد في السماء. والمغرور هو الذي لم تنفتح بصيرته ليكون بهداية نفسه كفيلاً و</div></div></div>"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.07","h":"0.76","c":"وَإِذْ","d":"wa-idh","e":"َlāَq"},{"b":"0.67","h":"1.37","c":"قَالَ","d":"qāla","e":"ٰàَswُm"},{"b":"1.3","h":"2.32","c":"مُوسَى","d":"mūsā","e":"ِhِmْwَqِl"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.64","c":"لِقَوْمِهِ","d":"liqawmihi","e":"۟āwُrُkْhdٱ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"5.03","c":"اذْكُرُوا","d":"udh'kurū","e":"َẗَmْʿعِn"},{"b":"4.0","h":"6.21","c":"نِعْمَةَ","d":"niʿ'mata","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"4.9","h":"7.47","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ْmُkْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"5.7","h":"8.55","c":"عَلَيْكُمْ","d":"ʿalaykum","e":"ْhdِiʾ"},{"b":"6.8","h":"10.1","c":"إِذْ","d":"idh","e":"mُkٰàَjgnَaʾ"},{"b":"7.2","h":"10.57","c":"أَنْجَاكُمْ","d":"anjākum","e":"ْnِّm"},{"b":"9.7","h":"13.71","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ِlāَء"},{"b":"10.","h":"14.16","c":"ءَالِ","d":"āli","e":"َnْwَʿعْrِf"},{"b":"10.6","h":"15.08","c":"فِرْعَوْنَ","d":"fir'ʿawna","e":"ْmُkَnwُmwُsَy"},{"b":"11.7","h":"16.62","c":"يَسُومُونَكُمْ","d":"yasūmūnakum","e":"َءٓwُs"},{"b":"15.","h":"19.09","c":"سُوءَ","d":"sūa","e":"ِbāَhdَʿعْlٱ"},{"b":"17.5","h":"20.84","c":"الْعَذَابِ","d":"l-ʿadhābi","e":"َnwُḥِّbَhdُyَw"},{"b":"18.7","h":"22.34","c":"وَيُذَبِّحُونَ","d":"wayudhabbiḥūna","e":"ْmُkَءٓāَnْbَaʾ"},{"b":"20.","h":"24.75","c":"أَبْنَاءَكُمْ","d":"abnāakum","e":"َnwُyْḥَtْsَyَw"},{"b":"22.9","h":"43","c":"وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ","d":"wayastaḥyūna","e":"ْmُkَءٓāَsِn"},{"b":"24.7","h":"45.47","c":"نِسَاءَكُمْ","d":"nisāakum","e":"àِfَw"},{"b":"27.7","h":"50.25","c":"وَفِي","d":"wafī","e":"mُkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"28.4","h":"51.08","c":"ذَلِكُمْ","d":"dhālikum","e":"ٌءٓāَlَb"},{"b":"30.2","h":"53.12","c":"بَلَاءٌ","d":"balāon","e":"nِّm"},{"b":"32.8","h":"56.24","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْmُkِّbَّr"},{"b":"32.9","h":"56.41","c":"رَبِّكُمْ","d":"rabbikum","e":"ٌmyِẓَʿع"},{"b":"34.","h":"58.39","c":"عَظِيمٌ","d":"ʿaẓīmun","e":"ْhdِiʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"And [recall, O Children of Israel], when Moses said to His people, \"Remember the favor of Allah upon you when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive.

Rather, the natural disposition (Fitra) of the souls almost testifies to being subdued under His subjugation and directed according to His management. Therefore, Allah the Exalted said: 'Is there any doubt about Allah, the Originator (Fāṭir) of the heavens and the earth?' (Quran 14:10). And for this reason, the prophets, prayers of Allah be upon them, were sent to call the creation to Monotheism (Tawḥīd) so that they would say 'There is no god but Allah,' and they were not commanded to say to us a god and to the world a god, for that was ingrained in the natural disposition (Fitra) of their intellects from the beginning of their emergence and in the prime of their youth. Therefore, He the Exalted said: 'And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say Allah' (Quran 31:25). And He the Exalted said: 'So set your face to the religion, uprightly, the natural disposition (Fitra) of Allah upon which He has created people; there is no altering the creation of Allah; that is the upright religion' (Quran 30:30).

And they said: \"Why has not an angel been sent down to him?\" And Pharaoh, in what Allah informed about him, said: \"Or that the angels should come with him, combined together?\" And Allah said: \"And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without right.\" So he was arrogant toward Allah and toward all His Messengers. Wahb said: Moses, peace be upon him, said to him: \"Believe, and you will have your kingdom.\" He said: \"Until I consult Haman.\" So he consulted Haman, and Haman said: \"While you are a lord being worshipped, you have become a slave worshipping.\" So he disdained the worship (Ibadah) of Allah and from following Moses, peace be upon him. And Quraysh, in what Allah informed about them, said: \"Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon a man from the two cities who is great?\" Qatadah said: The great one of the two cities is Al-Walid ibn Al-Mughirah and Abu Mas'ud Al-Thaqafi. They demanded one who has greater leadership than the Prophet, peace be upon him, when they said: \"An orphan boy, how has Allah sent him to us?\" So Allah said: \"Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord?\" And Allah said: \"So that they may say: 'Are these whom Allah has favored among us?'\" meaning belittling them and considering their precedence unlikely. And Quraysh said to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: \"How can we sit with you when these are present?\" And they pointed to the poor Muslims, and they looked down upon them with their eyes due to their poverty, and</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>القسم الثاني: التكبر على الرسل من حيث تعزز النفس وترفعها على الانقياد لبشر مثل سائر الناس؛ وذلك تارة يصرف عن الفكر والاستبصار فيبقى في ظلمة الجهل بكبره فيمتنع عن الانقياد وهو ظان أنه محق فيه، وتارة يمتنع مع المعرفة ولكن لا تطاوعه نفسه للإنقياد للحق والتواضع للرسل، كما حكى الله قولهم \"أنؤمن لبشرين مثلنا\" وقولهم \"إن أنتم إلا بشر مثلنا ولئن أطعتم بشراً مثلكم إنكم إذا لخاسرون\" وقال الذين لا يرجون لقائنا لولا أنزل علينا الملائكة أو نرى ربنا لقد استكبروا في أنفسهم وعتوا عواً كبيراً. وقالوا لولا أنزل عليه ملك\" وقال فرعون فيما أخبر الله عنه \"أو جاء معه الملائكة مقترنين\" وقال الله تعالى \"واستكبر هو وجنوده في الأرض بغير الحق\" فتكبر هو على الله وعلى رسله جميعاً. قال وهب: قال له موسى عليه السلام آمن ولك ملكك، قال: حتى أشاور هامان، فشاور هامان فقال هامان:بينما أنت رب يعبد إذ صرت عبد تعبد فاستنكف عن عبودية الله وعن اتباع موسى عليه السلام. وقالت قريش فيما أخبر الله تعالى عنهم \"لولا أنزل هذا القرآن على رجل من القريتين عظيم\" قال قتاده: عظيم القريتين هو الوليد بن المغيرة وأبو مسعود الثقفي، طلبوا من هو أعظم رياسة من النبي ﭬ إذ قالوا غلام يتيم كيف بعثه الله إلينا؟ فقال تعالى \"أهم يقسمون رحمة ربك\" وقال الله تعالى \"ليقولوا أهؤلاء من الله عليهم من بيننا\" أي استحقاراً لهم واستبعاداً لتقدمهم. وقالت قريش لرسول الله ﭬ: كيف نجلس إليك وعند هؤلاء؟ وأشاروا إلى فقراء المسلمين فازدروهم بأعينهم لفقرهم، وت</div></div></div>"}},"11":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.3","c":"قَالَتْ","d":"qālat","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"0.9","h":"1.29","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhُlُsُr"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.22","c":"رُسُلُهُمْ","d":"rusuluhum","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"2.6","h":"3.88","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"ُnْḥَّn"},{"b":"3.8","h":"4.88","c":"نَحْنُ","d":"naḥnu","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"4.4","h":"5.72","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ٌrَhsَb"},{"b":"5.3","h":"6.98","c":"بَشَرٌ","d":"basharun","e":"ْmُkُlْhtِّm"},{"b":"6.7","h":"8.69","c":"مِثْلُكُمْ","d":"mith'lukum","e":"َّnِkَٰlَw"},{"b":"7.7","h":"10.08","c":"وَلَكِنَّ","d":"walākinna","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.6","h":"12.35","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"ُّnُmَy"},{"b":"10.5","h":"13.58","c":"يَمُنُّ","d":"yamunnu","e":"ٰàَlَʿع"},{"b":"11.8","h":"14.99","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"nَm"},{"b":"12.5","h":"16.14","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"ُءٓāَhsَy"},{"b":"13.4","h":"17.24","c":"يَشَاءُ","d":"yashāu","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"24.","h":"19.38","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ۦِhِdāَbِʿع"},{"b":"25.0","h":"19.85","c":"عِبَادِهِ","d":"ʿibādihi","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"26.6","h":"24.2","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"27.3","h":"24.99","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"ٓāَnَl"},{"b":"28.0","h":"26.11","c":"لَنَا","d":"lanā","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"28.","h":"26.39","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"mُkَyِtْaʾَّn"},{"b":"30.3","h":"29.35","c":"نَأْتِيَكُمْ","d":"natiyakum","e":"ٍnَٰṭْlُsِb"},{"b":"32.5","h":"31.58","c":"بِسُلْطَانٍ","d":"bisul'ṭānin","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"34.1","h":"33.79","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ِnْhdِiʾِb"},{"b":"35.0","h":"35.14","c":"بِإِذْنِ","d":"bi-idh'ni","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"36.0","h":"36.35","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"àَlَʿعَw"},{"b":"38.5","h":"40.25","c":"وَعَلَى","d":"waʿalā","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"39.1","h":"40.95","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِlَّkَwَtَyْlَf"},{"b":"40.0","h":"42.31","c":"فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ","d":"falyatawakkali","e":"َnwُnِmْwʾُmْlٱ"},{"b":"41.9","h":"45.02","c":"الْمُؤْمِنُونَ","d":"l-mu'minūna","e":"āَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"Their messengers said to them, \"We are only men like you, but Allah confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants.

Some of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, said: We did not consider a man's faith (Iman) to be faith if he did not have patience (Sabr) with harm, and Allah the Exalted said: 'And we will certainly have patience (Sabr) with what you harm us, and upon Allah let the reliant ones (Mutawakkilun) rely.' (Quran 14:12). (And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, once distributed wealth, and some Bedouin from the Muslims said: This is a distribution not intended for the Face of Allah, so the Messenger of Allah was informed, and his cheeks reddened, then he said: May Allah have mercy on my brother Musa, he was harmed more than this and had patience (Sabr)[24]). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And leave their harm and rely (Tawakkul) upon Allah' (Quran 73:10). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And have patience (Sabr) with what they say and leave them with a beautiful leaving' (Quran 73:10). And Allah the Exalted said: 'And We certainly know that your chest (Sadr) is constrained by what they say, so glorify with the praise of your Lord' (Quran 15:97) the verse. And Allah the Exalted said: 'And you will certainly hear much harm from those who were given the Book before you and from those who associate partners, and if you have patience (Sabr) and guard (Taqwa), then indeed that is from the matters of determination' (Quran 3:186), meaning have patience (Sabr) from retaliation, and for that Allah the Exalted praised those who pardon from their rights in retaliation (Qisas) and other than it, so He the Exalted said: 'And if you punish, then punish with the like of that with which you were punished, and if you have patience (Sabr), it is better for the patient ones (Sabirin)' (Quran 16:126). And he, peace be upon him, said: 'Pray for the one who cuts you off, give to the one who deprives you, and pardon the one who wrongs you[25].' And I saw in the Gospel, Isa ibn Maryam, peace be upon him, said: It was said to you before: An eye for an eye and a nose for a nose, and I say to you: Do not resist with evil, but whoever strikes your right cheek, turn to him the left cheek, and whoever takes your cloak, give him your garment, and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two miles, and all of that is a command for patience (Sabr).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>القسم الثاني: مالا يرتبط هجومه باختياره وله اختيار في دفعه كما لو أوذي بفعل أو قول وجنى عليه في نفسه أو ماله، فالصبر على ذلك بترك المكافأة تارة يكون واجبا وتارة يكون فضيلة. قال بعض الصحابة رضوان الله عليهم: ما كنا نعدّ إيمان الرجل ايمانا إذا لم يصبر على الأذى، وقال تعالى: ﴿ ولنصبرنّ على ما آذيتمونا وعلى الله فليتوكل المتوكلون ﴾ {}.

For if he is not with these qualities and his heart (Qalb) does not fluctuate between these states, his share of recitation is the movement of the tongue with clear curse upon himself in His saying, the Exalted, 'Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers' (Quran 11:18) and in His saying, the Exalted, 'Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do' (Quran 61:3) and in His saying, the Exalted, 'And they are in heedlessness turning away' (Quran 21:1) and in His saying 'So turn away from whoever turns away from Our remembrance (Dhikr) and desires not except the worldly life' (Quran 53:29) and in His saying, the Exalted, 'And whoever does not repent - then those are the wrongdoers' (Quran 49:11) and other than that of the verses, and he was included in the meaning of His saying, the Exalted, 'And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except [their] wishes' (Quran 2:78) meaning mere recitation, and His saying, the Exalted, 'And how many a sign in the heavens and earth they pass over while they are therefrom turning away' (Quran 12:105) because the Quran is the clarifier of those signs in the heavens and earth, and whenever he passes over them and is not affected by them, he is turning away from them. Therefore, it is said: Indeed, whoever is not characterized by the morals of the Quran, when he recites the Quran, Allah, the Exalted, calls to him: What is with you and My speech while you are turning away from Me? Leave My speech if you do not repent to Me.

Allah the Exalted said: \"So take Him as your trustee and be patient (sabr) over what they say.\" And He said: \"And we will surely be patient (sabr) over what you harm us, and upon Allah let the reliant ones rely (tawakkul).\" And He the Mighty and Majestic said: \"And leave their harm and rely (tawakkul) upon Allah.\" And He the Blessed and Exalted said: \"So be patient (sabr) as the resolute ones of the messengers were patient (sabr).\" And He said: \"Excellent is the reward of the workers who were patient (sabr) and upon their Lord they rely (tawakkul).\" And this is regarding the harm of people. As for patience (sabr) upon the harm of snakes, beasts, and scorpions, abandoning repelling them is not from reliance (tawakkul) in anything, for there is no benefit in it, and striving is not intended nor is striving abandoned for its own sake but rather to aid in the religion (deen), and the arrangement of causes here is like their arrangement in earning and bringing benefits, so we do not prolong with repetition. Likewise, in the causes repelling from wealth, reliance (tawakkul) is not diminished by closing the door of the house when leaving nor by tying the camel, because these are causes known by the Sunnah of Allah the Exalted either certainly or presumably, and for that reason He ﷺ said to the Bedouin when he neglected the camel and said 'I have relied (tawakkul) upon Allah': 'Tie it and rely (tawakkul).'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ولترك الأسباب الدافعة وإن كانت مقطوعة وجه إذا ناله الضرر من إنسان، فإنه إذا أمكنه الصبر وأمكنه الدفع والتشفي فشرط التوكل الاحتمال والصبر، قال الله تعالى: \" فاتخذه وكيلاً واصبر على ما يقولون \". وقال تعالى: \" ولنصبرن على ما آذيتمونا وعلى الله فليتوكل المتوكلون \". وقال عز وجل: \" ودع أذاهم وتوكل على الله \". وقال سبحانه وتعالى: \" فاصبر كما صبر أولو العزم من الرسل \". وقال تعالى: \" نعم أجر العاملين الذين صبروا وعلى ربهم يتوكلون \" وهذا في أذى الناس، وأما الصبر على أذى الحيات والسباع والعقارب، فترك دفعها ليس من التوكل في شيء إذ لا فائدة فيه، ولا يراد السعي ولا يترك السعي لعينه بل لإعانته على الدين، وترتب الأسباب ههنا كترتبها في الكسب وجلب المنافع فلا نطول بالإعادة، وكذلك في الأسباب الدافعة عن المال، فلا ينقص التوكل بإغلاق باب البيت عند الخروج ولا بأن يعقل البعير، لأن هذه أسباب عرفت سنة الله تعالى إما قطعاً وإما ظناً، ولذلك قال ﭬ للأعرابي لما أن أهمل البعير وقال توكلت على الله \" اعقلها وتوكل\"[33].</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book5.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Tawhid and Trust</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And He, the Exalted, said: \"And upon Allah let the ones who trust (Mutawakkilun) rely.\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"And whoever relies upon Allah, then He is sufficient for him.\" And He, the Glorified and Exalted, said: \"Indeed, Allah loves the ones who rely (Mutawakkilun).\" And how great is a station marked with the love of Allah, the Exalted, its possessor, and guaranteed the sufficiency of Allah, the Exalted, its companion. So whoever from Allah, the Exalted, is his sufficiency and his suffices and his lover and his guardian: then he has attained the great success, for the beloved is not punished nor distanced nor veiled. And He, the Exalted, said: \"Is not Allah sufficient for His servant?\" So the seeker of sufficiency from other than Him and the abandoner of reliance (Tawakkul) is the one who denies this verse. For it is a question in the manner of interrogation with the truth, like His saying, the Exalted: \"Has there come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing mentioned?\" And He, the Exalted, said: \"And whoever relies upon Allah, then indeed Allah is Mighty, Wise.\" Meaning Mighty, He does not humiliate the one who seeks refuge in Him, nor does He waste the one who clings to His side and seeks protection in His sanctuary and His protection, and Wise, He does not fall short in managing the one who relies upon His management.

And one should guard his hearing from dialectics (Jadal) and theological disputation (Kalam) with utmost vigilance, for what confuses it through dialectics is more than what prepares it, and what corrupts it is more than what rectifies it. Rather, strengthening it through dialectics resembles striking a tree with an iron mallet hoping to strengthen it by increasing its parts, but perhaps that shatters it and corrupts it—and that is more likely. Observation suffices you in this as explanation, so let direct sight be your proof. Compare the belief (I'tiqad) of the people of righteousness (Salah) and piety (Taqwa) from the common folk to the belief of the theologians (Mutakallimun) and disputants (Mujadilun): you will see the common person's belief in steadfastness like a towering mountain (Tawd) that calamities (Dawahi) and thunderbolts (Sawa'iq) cannot move, while the theologian's belief, guarded by the divisions of dialectics, is like a thread sent into the air that the winds sway sometimes this way and sometimes that way—except for one who receives from them the proof of belief and accepts it through imitation (Taqleed) just as he accepted the belief itself through imitation, since there is no difference in imitation between teaching the proof or learning what is proven. Teaching the proof is one thing, and inferring through independent reasoning (Nadhar) is another thing far from it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فيكون أول التلقين كإلقاء بذر في الصدر وتكون هذه الأسباب كالسقى والتربية له حتى ينمو ذلك البذر يقوى ويرتفع شجرة طيبة راسخة أصلها ثابت وفرعها في السماء وينبغي أن يحرس سمعه من الجدل والكلام غاية الحراسة فإن ما يشوّشه الجدل أكثر مما يمهده وما يفسده أكثر مما يصلحه بل تقويته بالجدل تضاهي ضرب الشجرة بالمدقة من الحديد رجاء تقويتها بأن تكثر أجزاؤها وربما يفتتها ذلك ويفسدها وهو الأغلب والمشاهدة تكفيك في هذا بيانا فناهيك بالعيان برهانا فقس عقيدة أهل الصلاح والتقى من عوام الناس بعقيدة المتكلمين والمجادلين فترى اعتقاد العامي في الثبات كالطود الشامخ لا تحركه الدواهي والصواعق وعقيدة المتكلم الحارس اعتقاده بتقسيمات الجدل كخيط مرسل في الهواء تفيئه الرياح مرة هكذا ومرة هكذا إلا من سلم منهم دليل الاعتقاد فتلقفه تقليدا كما تلقف نفس الاعتقاد تقليدا إذ لا فرق في التقليد بين تعليم الدليل أو تعلم المدلول فتلقين الدليل شيء والاستدلال بالنظر شيء آخر بعيد عنه</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book6.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Love, Longing, and Intimacy</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>And love is a good tree whose root is firm and whose branch is in the sky and its fruits appear in the heart (Qalb), the tongue, and the limbs. And those overflowing effects from it upon the heart (Qalb) and the limbs indicate love with the indication of smoke upon fire and the indication of fruits upon trees. And they are many, among them is love of meeting the Beloved through unveiling (Kashf) and witnessing (Mushahada) in the Abode of Peace (Dar al-Salam), so it is inconceivable that the heart (Qalb) loves a beloved except that it loves seeing him and meeting him, and when it knows that there is no arrival except by departing from the world and leaving it through death, then it should be loving of death, not fleeing from it, for the lover is not burdened by traveling from his homeland to the abode of his beloved to delight in seeing him, and death is the key to meeting and the door to entering into witnessing (Mushahada).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>والمحبة شجرة طيبة أصلها ثابت وفرعها في السماء وثمارها تظهر في القلب واللسان والجوارح. وتدل تلك الآثار الفائضة منها على القلب والجوارح على المحبة دلالة الدخان على النار ودلالة الثمار على الأشجار. وهي كثيرة فمنها حب لقاء الحبيب بطريق الكشف والمشاهدة في دار السلام، فلا يتصور أن يحب القلب محبوباً إلا ويحب مشاهدته ولقاءه، وإذا علم أنه لا وصول إلا بالارتحال من الدنيا ومفارقتها بالموت فينبغي أن يكون محباً للموت غير فار منه، فإن المحب لا يثقل عليه السفر عن وطنه إلى مستقر محبوبه ليتنعم بمشاهدته والموت مفتاح اللقاء وباب الدخول إلى المشاهدة.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #e0d0a0; margin: 20px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book6.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge' style='background-color: #f4ecd8; color: #8a6d3b; border: 1px solid #d0c090; padding: 5px 10px; font-weight: 500;'>📖 Vol 4: Love, Longing, and Intimacy</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.7; color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 12px; font-family: \"Georgia\", serif;'>The second reason: For the strength of love, the strength of knowledge of Allah the Exalted and its expansion and its domination over the heart (Qalb), and that after purifying the heart from all distractions of the world and its attachments, it proceeds like placing the seed in the earth after purifying it from weeds, which is the second half. Then from this seed is generated the tree of love and knowledge, which is the good word (Kalimah Tayyibah) that Allah struck as a parable when He said: \"Allah struck a parable: a good word is like a good tree, its root is firm and its branch is in the sky.\" And to it is the indication by His saying the Exalted \"To Him ascends the good word,\" meaning the knowledge \"and the righteous deed raises it.\" So the righteous deed is like beauty for this knowledge and like a servant, and indeed all righteous deed is in purifying the heart first from the world then maintaining its purity, so the deed is not desired except for this knowledge, and as for the knowledge of how to perform the deed, it is desired for the deed, so knowledge is the first and it is the last, and indeed the first is knowledge of interaction (Ilm al-Mu'amalah) and its purpose is the deed, and the purpose of interaction is clarity of the heart and its purity so that in it becomes clear the manifestation of the truth and it becomes adorned with knowledge of knowledge (Ilm al-Ma'rifah), which is knowledge of unveiling (Ilm al-Mukashafah). And whenever this knowledge is attained, love follows it by necessity, just as one who has balanced temperament, if he sees the beautiful and perceives it with the apparent eye, loves it and inclines to it, and whenever he loves it, pleasure occurs, so pleasure follows love by necessity, and love follows knowledge by necessity, and one does not reach this knowledge after cutting off distractions of the world from the heart except with pure thought (Fikr) and constant remembrance (Dhikr) and utmost effort in seeking and continuous contemplation in Allah the Exalted and in His attributes and in the dominion of His heavens and all His creations.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>السبب الثاني: لقوة المحبة، قوة معرفة الله تعالى واتساعها واستيلاؤها على القلب، وذلك بعد تطهير القلب من جميع شواغل الدنيا وعلائقها يجري مجرى وضع البذر في الأرض بعد تنقيتها من الحشيش وهو الشطر الثاني. ثم يتولد من هذا البذر شجرة المحبة والمعرفة وهي الكلمة الطيبة التي ضرب الله بها مثلاً حيث قال: \"ضرب الله مثلاً كلمة طيبة كشجرة طيبة أصلها ثابت وفرعها في السماء\" وإليها الإشارة بقوله تعالى \"إليه يصعد الكلم الطيب\"، أي المعرفة \"والعمل الصالح يرفعه\" فالعمل الصالح كالجمال لهذه المعرفة وكالخادم وإنما العمل الصالح كله في تطهير القلب أولاً من الدنيا ثم إدامة طهارته، فلا يراد العمل إلا لهذه المعرفة، وأما العلم بكيفية العمل فيراد للعمل، فالعلم هو الأول وهو الآخر، وإنما الأول علم المعاملة وغرضه العمل، وغرض المعاملة صفاء القلب وطهارته ليتضح فيه جلية الحق ويتزين بعلم المعرفة وهو علم المكاشفة ومهما حصلت هذه المعرفة تبعتها المحبة بالضرورة، كما أن من كان معتدل المزاج إذا أبصر الجميل وأدركه بالعين الظاهرة أحبه ومال إليه، ومهما أحبه حصلت اللذة، فاللذة تبع المحبة بالضرورة، والمحبة تبع المعرفة بالضرورة، ولا يوصل إلى هذه المعرفة بعد انقطاع شواغل الدنيا من القلب إلا بالفكر الصافي والذكر الدائم والجد البالغ في الطلب والنظر المستمر في الله تعالى وفي صفاته وفي ملكوت سمواته وسائر مخلوقاته.</div></div></div>"}},"25":{"w":[{"b":"0.16","h":"0.55","c":"تُؤْتِي","d":"tu'tī","e":"āَhَlُkُaʾ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.12","c":"أُكُلَهَا","d":"ukulahā","e":"َّlُk"},{"b":"3.4","h":"4.79","c":"كُلَّ","d":"kulla","e":"ٍۭnyِḥ"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.75","c":"حِينٍ","d":"ḥīnin","e":"ِnْhdِiʾِb"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.54","c":"بِإِذْنِ","d":"bi-idh'ni","e":"āَhِّbَr"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.76","c":"رَبِّهَا","d":"rabbihā","e":"ُbِrْḍَyَw"},{"b":"8","h":"13.2","c":"وَيَضْرِبُ","d":"wayaḍribu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9.0","h":"14.76","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"َlāَhtْmَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"9.9","h":"16","c":"الْأَمْثَالَ","d":"l-amthāla","e":"ِsāَّnlِl"},{"b":"11.2","h":"18.02","c":"لِلنَّاسِ","d":"lilnnāsi","e":"ْmُhَّlَʿعَl"},{"b":"12.8","h":"20.09","c":"لَعَلَّهُمْ","d":"laʿallahum","e":"َnwُrَّkَhdَtَy"},{"b":"14.","h":"22.01","c":"يَتَذَكَّرُونَ","d":"yatadhakkarūna","e":"ُlَhtَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord.

Until our Prophet (upon him be peace and blessings) said: 'O Allah, make the provision of the family of Muhammad sufficient (Kafāf).' So he did not ask from the worldly life except what is purely good, and he said: 'O Allah, make me live as a poor person (Miskīn), make me die as a poor person (Miskīn), and gather me in the company of the poor (Masākīn).' And Abraham (peace be upon him) sought refuge, saying: 'And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols (Aṣnām).' And he meant by them these two stones: gold and silver, for the rank of prophethood (Nubuwwah) is too noble to fear that it would believe in the divinity (Ilāhiyyah) of any of these stones, since he was protected before prophethood even in childhood. Rather, the meaning of worshipping them is loving them, being deceived by them, and relying upon them. Our Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Wretched is the slave (ʿAbd) of the Dinar, wretched is the slave (ʿAbd) of the Dirham, wretched and not prosperous, and if pricked, not relieved.' So he clarified that one who loves them is a worshipper of them, and whoever worships a stone is a worshipper of an idol (Ṣanam). Rather, everyone who is a slave (ʿAbd) to other than Allah is a worshipper of an idol (Ṣanam), meaning that it cuts him off from Allah the Exalted and from fulfilling His right, so he is like a worshipper of an idol (Ṣanam), and it is association (Shirk). Except that association (Shirk) is of two types: hidden association (Shirk Khafī) that does not necessitate eternal abode in the Fire, and rarely do the believers (Mu'minūn) escape from it, for it is more hidden than the crawling of ants; and manifest association (Shirk Jalī) that necessitates eternal abode in the Fire—we seek refuge in Allah from all of it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>ولما كانت الطباع مائلة إلى اتباع الشهوات القاطعة لسبيل الله وكان المال مسهلاً لها وآلة إليها، عظم الخطر فيما يزيد على قدر الكفاية فاستعاذ الأنبياء من شره حتى قال نبينا عليه الصالة والسلام \"الله اجعل قوت آل محمد كفافاً\" فلم يطلب من الدنيا غلا ما يتمحض خيره وقال \"الله أحيني مسكيناً وأمتني مسكيناً واحشرني في زمرة المساكين\" واستعاذ إبراهيم ﭬ فقال \"واجنبني وبني أن نعبد الأصنام\" وعنى بها هذين الحجرين الذهب والفضة، إذ رتبة النبوة أجل من أن يخشى عليها أن تعتقد الإلهية في شيء من هذه الحجارة، إذ قد كفى قبل النبوة مع الصغر، وإنما معنى عبادتهما حبهما والاغترار بهما والركون إليهما قال نبينا ﭬ \"تعس عبد الدينار وتعس عبد الدرهم تعس ولا انتعش وإذا شيك فلا انتفش\" فبين أن محبهما عابد لهما ومن عبد حجراً فهو عابد صنم. بل كل من كان عبداً لغير الله فهو عابد صنم، أي قطعه ذلك عن الله تعالى وعن أداء حقه فهو كعابد صنم، وهو شرك إلا أن الشرك شركان: شرك خفي لا يوجب الخلود في النار وقلما ينفك عنه المؤمنون فإنه أخفى من دبيب النمل، وشرك جلي يوجب الخلود في النار نعوذ بالله من الجميع.</div></div></div>"}},"36":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.75","c":"رَبِّ","d":"rabbi","e":"َّnُhَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"0.65","h":"1.76","c":"إِنَّهُنَّ","d":"innahunna","e":"َnْlَlْḍَaʾ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.3","c":"أَضْلَلْنَ","d":"aḍlalna","e":"āًryِhtَk"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.86","c":"كَثِيرًا","d":"kathīran","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"5.0","h":"8.35","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"ِsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.88","c":"النَّاسِ","d":"l-nāsi","e":"nَmَf"},{"b":"9.9","h":"13.25","c":"فَمَنْ","d":"faman","e":"àِnَʿعِbَt"},{"b":"11.2","h":"14.4","c":"تَبِعَنِي","d":"tabiʿanī","e":"ۥُhَّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"12.3","h":"16.21","c":"فَإِنَّهُ","d":"fa-innahu","e":"àِّnِm"},{"b":"14.4","h":"18.72","c":"مِنِّي","d":"minnī","e":"ْnَmَw"},{"b":"16.4","h":"21.71","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"àِnāَṣَʿع"},{"b":"16.9","h":"22.49","c":"عَصَانِي","d":"ʿaṣānī","e":"َkَّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"18.2","h":"24.55","c":"فَإِنَّكَ","d":"fa-innaka","e":"ٌrwُfَغ"},{"b":"19.9","h":"26.63","c":"غَفُورٌ","d":"ghafūrun","e":"ٌmyِḥَّr"},{"b":"21.1","h":"28.22","c":"رَحِيمٌ","d":"raḥīmun","e":"ٓāَnَّbَّr"}],"a":{"g":"My Lord, indeed they have led astray many among the people.

And his matter is precarious in his soul. So if you are incapable of all that, then be a lover of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), eager to magnify his traditions, longing to observe the hearts of the righteous among his community, and blessed by their supplications, so perhaps you may attain from his intercession or their intercession, and thus be saved by intercession if you are of little merchandise. (Description of Intercession) Know that if entry into the Fire becomes due for groups of the believers, then Allah the Exalted, by His grace, accepts among them the intercession of the prophets and the truthful ones, indeed the intercession of the scholars and the righteous, and everyone who has with Allah the Exalted status and good dealings, then he has intercession for his family, his relatives, his friends, and his acquaintances. So be eager to acquire for yourself with them the rank of intercession, and that is by not despising any human being at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His friendship (Wilayah) in His servants, so perhaps the one whom your eye looks down upon is the friend (Wali) of Allah; and do not belittle any sin at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His anger in His sins, so perhaps the wrath (Maqt) of Allah is in it; and do not despise any obedience at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His pleasure in His obedience, so perhaps His pleasure is in it, even if it be a good word or a good intention or what runs in its course. And the evidences of intercession in the Quran and the reports are many: Allah the Exalted said: 'And your Lord will give you, and you will be satisfied.' {} Narrated Amr ibn al-'As: 'That the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) recited the saying of Ibrahim (upon him be peace): \"My Lord, indeed they have led astray many of the people. So whoever follows me, then indeed he is of me; and whoever disobeys me, indeed You are Forgiving, Merciful.\" {} And the saying of Isa (upon him be peace): \"If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants.\" {} Then he raised his hands and said: \"My community, my community,\" then he wept. So Allah the Mighty and Majestic said: \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad and ask him what makes him weep.\" So Jibril came to him and asked him, and he informed him, and Allah knows best about it. Then He said: \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad and say to him: 'We will satisfy you concerning your community and not grieve you.'\"[175])</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>وقال ﭬ: (لكل نبى دعوة مستجابة فأريد أن أختبىء دعوتي شفاعة لأمتى يوم القيامة[178]) وقال ابن عباس رضى الله عنهما: قال رسول الله ﭬ: (ينصب للأنبياء منابر من ذهب فيجلسون عليها ويبقى منبرى لا أجلس عليه قائما بين يدى ربى منتصبا مخافة أن يبعث بى إلى الجنة وأمره مخطر فى نفسه فإن عجزت عن ذلك كله فكن محبا لرسول الله ﭬ حريصا على تعظيم سننه ومتشوقا إلى مراعاة قلوب الصالحين من أمته ومتبركا بأدعيتهم فعساك أن تنال من شفاعته أو شفاعتهم فتنجو بالشفاعة إن كنت قليل البضاعة.

As for insight, it is by knowing the aspect of turning toward the desires of the world being distant from Allah and the aspect of distancing from them being close to Allah, and one perceives that through inspiration (Ilhām) in the stations (Manāzil) of the knowers (ʿĀrifīn) and the friends (Awliyāʾ), and its explanation is from the totality of the sciences of unveiling (ʿUlūm al-Mukāshafah) and is not suitable for the science of transaction (ʿIlm al-Muʿāmalah). \"And as for knowing it through the way of imitation and belief (Tasdīq),\" it is that one believes in the Book of Allah the Exalted and believes His messenger. And He the Exalted has said: \"Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children, We hasten for them in good things? Rather, they do not perceive.\" And He the Exalted said: \"We will lead them on step by step from where they do not know.\" And He the Exalted said: \"We opened to them the doors of every thing until when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and at once they were in despair.\" And in the interpretation (Tafsīr) of His saying the Exalted \"We will lead them on step by step from where they do not know,\" it is that whenever they committed a sin, We granted them a blessing to increase their delusion. And He the Exalted said: \"We only give them respite that they may increase in sin.\" And He the Exalted said: \"And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].\" And other than that from what has come in the Book of Allah the Exalted and the Sunnah of His messenger. So whoever believes in it is freed from this delusion, for the origin of this delusion is ignorance of Allah and His attributes, for whoever knows Him does not feel secure from His plan (Makr) nor is deluded by such false imaginings, and looks to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah and to the kings of the earth and what happened to them—how Allah was good to them initially then destroyed them utterly! So He the Exalted said: \"Do you perceive of them anyone?\" the verse. And Allah the Exalted has warned of His plan and leading on step by step, so He said: \"So none feels secure from the plan of Allah except the losing people.\" And He the Exalted said: \"And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceive not.\" And He the Mighty and Majestic said: \"And they planned, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of planners.\" And He the Exalted said: \"Indeed, they are planning a plan, and I am planning a plan. So allow time for the disbelievers.

So the Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah) is one of what is mentioned in it, and Allah has described some of its terrors and multiplied its names so that we may stand with the multiplicity of its names on the multiplicity of its meanings, so the purpose of the multiplicity of names is not the repetition of names and titles.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>يوم ترى الأرض قد زلزلت فيه زالزالها، وأخرجت الأرض أثقالها، يومئذ يصدر الناس أشتاتا ليروا أعمالهم، يوم تحمل الأرض والجبال فدكتا دكة واحدة، فيومئذ وقعت الواقعة وانشقت السماء فهى يومئذ واهية، والملك على أرجائها، ويحمل عرش ربك فوقهم يومئذ ثمانية يومئذ تعرضون لا تخفى منكم خافية، يوم تسير الجبال وترى الأرض بارزة، يوم ترج الأرض فيه رجا وتبس الجبال بسا فكانت هباء منبثا، يوم يكون الناس كالفراش المبثوث وتكون الجبال كالعهن المنفوش، يوم تذهل فيه كل مرضعة عما أرضعت وتضع كل ذات حمل حملها وترى الناس سكارى وما هم بسكارى ولكن عذاب الله شديد، يوم تبدل الأرض غير الأرض والسموات وبرزوا لله الواحد القهار، يوم تنسف فيه الجبال نسفا فتترك قاعا صفصفا لا ترى فيها عوجا ولا أمتا، يوم ترى الجبال تحسبها جامدة وهى تمر مر السحاب، يوم تنشق فيه السماء فتكون وردة كالدهان، فيومئذ لا يسئل عن ذنبه إنس ولا جان، يوم يمنع فيه العاصى من الكلام ولا يسئل فيه عن الأجرام بل يؤخذ بالنواصى والأقدام، يوم تجد كل نفس ما عملت من خير محضرا وما عملت من سوء تود لو أن بينها وبينه أمدا بعيدا، يوم تعلم فيه كل نفس ما أحضرت وتشهد ما قدمت وأخرت يوم تخرس فيه الألسن وتنطق الجوارح يوم شيب ذكره سيد المرسلين إذ قال له الصديق رضى الله عنه: أراك قد شبت يا رسول الله قال: (شيبتنى هود وأخواتها[155]) وهى الواقعة والمرسلات وعم يتساءلون وإذا الشمس كورت فيا أيها القارىء العاجز إنما حظك من قراءتك أن تمجمج القرآن وتحرك به اللسان ولو كنت متفكرا فيما تقرؤه لكنت جديرا بأن تنشق مرارتك مما شاب منه شعر سيد المرسلين وإذا قنعت بحركة اللسان فقد حرمت ثمرة القرآن فالقيامة أحد ما ذكر فيه وقد وصف الله بعض دواهيها وأكثر من أساميها لنقف بكثرة أساميها على كثرة معانيها فليس المقصود بكثرة الأسامى تكرير الأسامى والألقا</div></div></div>"}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.7","c":"وَتَرَى","d":"watarā","e":"َnyِmِrْjgُmْlٱ"},{"b":"0.65","h":"1.57","c":"الْمُجْرِمِينَ","d":"l-muj'rimīna","e":"ٍhdِyʾَmْwَy"},{"b":"2.2","h":"3.62","c":"يَوْمَئِذٍ","d":"yawma-idhin","e":"َnyِnَّrَqُّm"},{"b":"4.5","h":"6.2","c":"مُقَرَّنِينَ","d":"muqarranīna","e":"àِf"},{"b":"5.9","h":"8.42","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ِdāَfْṣَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"6.2","h":"8.83","c":"الْأَصْفَادِ","d":"l-aṣfādi","e":"mُhُlyِbāَrَs"}],"a":{"g":"And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in shackles,"}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"سَرَابِيلُهُمْ","d":"sarābīluhum","e":"nِّm"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.34","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ٍnāَrِṭَq"},{"b":"3.3","h":"4.22","c":"قَطِرَانٍ","d":"qaṭirānin","e":"ٰàَhsْغَtَw"},{"b":"11.","h":"6.66","c":"وَتَغْشَى","d":"wataghshā","e":"ُmُhَhwُjgُw"},{"b":"13.","h":"8.5","c":"وُجُوهَهُمُ","d":"wujūhahumu","e":"ُrāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"14.9","h":"10.52","c":"النَّارُ","d":"l-nāru","e":"َàِzْjgَyِl"}],"a":{"g":"Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire."}},"51":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.45","c":"لِيَجْزِيَ","d":"liyajziya","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.85","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"َّlُk"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.23","c":"كُلَّ","d":"kulla","e":"ٍsْfَn"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.3","c":"نَفْسٍ","d":"nafsin","e":"āَّm"},{"b":"4.2","h":"6.24","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ْtَbَsَk"},{"b":"5.0","h":"6.82","c":"كَسَبَتْ","d":"kasabat","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"9.3","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"7.5","h":"10.71","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"ُʿعyِrَs"},{"b":"8.4","h":"12.13","c":"سَرِيعُ","d":"sarīʿu","e":"ِbāَsِḥْlٱ"},{"b":"9.4","h":"13.76","c":"الْحِسَابِ","d":"l-ḥisābi","e":"āَhdَٰh"}],"a":{"g":"So that Allah will recompense every soul for what it earned.
