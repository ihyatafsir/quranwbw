God Most High created them for the sake of the servant, so that he may attain through them the felicity [sa'ada] of proximity [qurb]. And God Most High is independent of him, whether near or far. And the servant, concerning them, is between two states: either he employs them in obedience [ta'a], and thus he has given thanks [shakar] by conforming to the love [mahabba] of his Master; or he employs them in disobedience [ma'siya] to Him, and thus he has disbelieved [kafara] by plunging into what his Master dislikes and does not approve for him. For God does not approve disbelief [kufr] and disobedience for His servants. And if he neglects them and does not employ them in obedience or disobedience, that too is disbelief—a disbelief of ingratitude for the blessing [ni'ma] through waste. And everything created in the world [dunya] was created only as an instrument for the servant, so that he may connect through it to the felicity of the Hereafter [akhira] and attain proximity to God Most High. So every obedient one is, according to the measure of his obedience, thankful for God's blessing in the means [asbab] which he employed in obedience. And every slothful one who abandoned their use, or disobedient one who employed them on the path of remoteness [bu'd], is an ingrate [kafir], straying outside the love of God Most High. Thus, disobedience and obedience are both encompassed by the Will [mashi'a], but they are not both encompassed by Love [mahabba] and Dislike [karaha]. For many a willed thing is beloved, and many a willed thing is disliked. And beyond the clarification of this subtle point lies the secret of Divine Decree [sirr al-qadr], which has been prohibited from being divulged. And by this, the first difficulty is resolved—which is that if the one to be thanked has no share, how can there be thanksgiving? And by this also, the second is resolved. For we did not intend by thanksgiving [shukr] except the directing of God's blessing [ni'ma] towards the direction of God's love [mahabba]. So when the blessing is directed towards the direction of Love by God's action, the intended goal is achieved. And your action is a gift ['ata'] from God Most High, and from the perspective that you are its locus [mahall], He has praised you, and His praise [thana'] is another blessing from Him to you. Thus, He is the One who gives, and He is the One who praises. And your single action became a cause [sabab] for the directing of His second action towards the direction of His love. So to Him belongs the thanks [shukr] in every state. And you are described as being thankful [shakir], meaning that you are the locus of the meaning which thanksgiving expresses, not meaning that you are the agent who brings it about—just as you are described as being one who knows ['arif] and one who has knowledge ['alim], not meaning that you are the creator or originator of knowledge ['ilm], but meaning that you are a locus for it, and it came to be in you through the Eternal Power [al-qudra al-azaliyya]. So describing you as thankful affirms a thingness [shay'iyya] for you, for you are a thing [shay'] since the Creator of things made you a thing. And you are nothing [la shay'] only when you imagine yourself to be a thing independently.</div></div></div>"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.3","h":"1.93","c":"رَدَدْنَاهُ","d":"radadnāhu","e":"ُhَٰnْdَdَr"},{"b":"2.5","h":"4.12","c":"أَسْفَلَ","d":"asfala","e":"َlَfْsَaʾ"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.45","c":"سَافِلِينَ","d":"sāfilīna","e":"َnyِlِfَٰs"}],"a":{"g":"Then We return him to the lowest of the low,"}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.56","h":"1.13","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.5","h":"2.77","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.59","c":"وَعَمِلُوا","d":"waʿamilū","e":"۟āwُlِmَʿعَw"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.82","c":"الصَّالِحَاتِ","d":"l-ṣāliḥāti","e":"ِtَٰḥِlَّٰṣlٱ"},{"b":"4.7","h":"8.45","c":"فَلَهُمْ","d":"falahum","e":"ْmُhَlَf"},{"b":"5.6","h":"9.9","c":"أَجْرٌ","d":"ajrun","e":"ٌrْjgَaʾ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"11.07","c":"غَيْرُ","d":"ghayru","e":"ُrْyَغ"},{"b":"6.9","h":"12.53","c":"مَمْنُونٍ","d":"mamnūnin","e":"ٍnwُnْmَm"}],"a":{"g":"Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have a reward uninterrupted."}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.6","c":"فَمَا","d":"famā","e":"āَmَf"},{"b":"0.57","h":"1.49","c":"يُكَذِّبُكَ","d":"yukadhibuka","e":"َkُbِّhdَkُy"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.58","c":"بَعْدُ","d":"baʿdu","e":"ُdْʿعَb"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.63","c":"بِالدِّينِ","d":"bil-dīni","e":"ِnyِّdlٱِb"}],"a":{"g":"So what yet causes you to deny the Recompense?"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.25","c":"أَلَيْسَ","d":"alaysa","e":"َsْyَlَaʾ"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.24","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.93","c":"بِأَحْكَمِ","d":"bi-aḥkami","e":"ِmَkْḥَaʾِb"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.71","c":"الْحَاكِمِينَ","d":"l-ḥākimīna","e":"َnyِmِkَٰḥْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"Is not Allah the most just of judges?"}}}
