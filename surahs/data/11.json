And the knowers [ʿārifūn] say: \"If you mock us, indeed we mock you as you mock, and you will come to know.\"</div></div></div>"}},"39":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.5","c":"فَسَوْفَ","d":"fasawfa","e":"َnwُmَlْʿعَt"},{"b":"0.84","h":"1.26","c":"تَعْلَمُونَ","d":"taʿlamūna","e":"nَm"},{"b":"2.1","h":"2.64","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"ِhyِtْaʾَy"},{"b":"3.1","h":"3.54","c":"يَأْتِيهِ","d":"yatīhi","e":"ٌbāَhdَʿع"},{"b":"4.0","h":"4.6","c":"عَذَابٌ","d":"ʿadhābun","e":"ِhyِzْhkُy"},{"b":"5.6","h":"6.4","c":"يُخْزِيهِ","d":"yukh'zīhi","e":"ُّlِḥَyَw"},{"b":"6.8","h":"7.5","c":"وَيَحِلُّ","d":"wayaḥillu","e":"ِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"7.8","h":"8.54","c":"عَلَيْهِ","d":"ʿalayhi","e":"ٌbāَhdَʿع"},{"b":"8.6","h":"9.44","c":"عَذَابٌ","d":"ʿadhābun","e":"ٌmyِqُّm"},{"b":"9.5","h":"11.54","c":"مُقِيمٌ","d":"muqīmun","e":"ٰٓàَّtَḥ"}],"a":{"g":"And you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment [in the Hereafter].\""}},"40":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.45","c":"حَتَّى","d":"ḥattā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"2.82","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"َءٓāَjg"},{"b":"3","h":"3.65","c":"جَاءَ","d":"jāa","e":"āَnُrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"4.8","h":"5.27","c":"أَمْرُنَا","d":"amrunā","e":"َrāَfَw"},{"b":"6.1","h":"6.47","c":"وَفَارَ","d":"wafāra","e":"ُrwُّnَّtlٱ"},{"b":"7.0","h":"7.48","c":"التَّنُّورُ","d":"l-tanūru","e":"āَnْlُq"},{"b":"9.0","h":"9.24","c":"قُلْنَا","d":"qul'nā","e":"ْlِmْḥٱ"},{"b":"9.6","h":"9.81","c":"احْمِلْ","d":"iḥ'mil","e":"āَhyِf"},{"b":"10.","h":"10.51","c":"فِيهَا","d":"fīhā","e":"nِm"},{"b":"11.1","h":"11.57","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ٍّlُk"},{"b":"12.4","h":"12.37","c":"كُلٍّ","d":"kullin","e":"ِnْyَjgْwَz"},{"b":"14.","h":"13.76","c":"زَوْجَيْنِ","d":"zawjayni","e":"ِnْyَnْhtٱ"},{"b":"15.1","h":"14.92","c":"اثْنَيْنِ","d":"ith'nayni","e":"َkَlْhَaʾَw"},{"b":"25.3","h":"15.91","c":"وَأَهْلَكَ","d":"wa-ahlaka","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"26.3","h":"17.03","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"nَm"},{"b":"27.2","h":"17.92","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"َqَbَs"},{"b":"28.1","h":"18.86","c":"سَبَقَ","d":"sabaqa","e":"ِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"28.8","h":"19.65","c":"عَلَيْهِ","d":"ʿalayhi","e":"ُlْwَqْlٱ"},{"b":"29.7","h":"20.67","c":"الْقَوْلُ","d":"l-qawlu","e":"ْnَmَw"},{"b":"30.6","h":"21.67","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"َnَmāَء"},{"b":"31.1","h":"22.42","c":"ءَامَنَ","d":"āmana","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"32.5","h":"26.81","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"َnَmāَء"},{"b":"34.8","h":"28.69","c":"ءَامَنَ","d":"āmana","e":"ٓۥُhَʿعَm"},{"b":"35.6","h":"29.8","c":"مَعَهُ","d":"maʿahu","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"38.2","h":"32.07","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"ٌlyِlَq"},{"b":"39","h":"33","c":"قَلِيلٌ","d":"qalīlun","e":"َlāَqَw"}],"a":{"g":"[So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, \"Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed.\" But none had believed with him, except a few."}},"41":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.97","c":"وَقَالَ","d":"waqāla","e":"۟āwُbَkْrٱ"},{"b":"0.82","h":"1.85","c":"ارْكَبُوا","d":"ir'kabū","e":"āَhyِf"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.74","c":"فِيهَا","d":"fīhā","e":"ِmْsِb"},{"b":"2.6","h":"3.73","c":"بِسْمِ","d":"bis'mi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.44","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"āَhٰà۪rْjgَm"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.36","c":"مَجْرِيهَا","d":"majrahā","e":"ٓāَhٰàَsْrُmَw"},{"b":"5.4","h":"6.84","c":"وَمُرْسَاهَا","d":"wamur'sāhā","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"7.7","h":"10.25","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"àِّbَr"},{"b":"9.0","h":"11.27","c":"رَبِّي","d":"rabbī","e":"ٌrwُfَغَl"},{"b":"9.9","h":"12.23","c":"لَغَفُورٌ","d":"laghafūrun","e":"ٌmyِḥَّr"},{"b":"11.3","h":"13.71","c":"رَحِيمٌ","d":"raḥīmun","e":"َàِhَw"}],"a":{"g":"And [Noah] said, \"Embark therein; in the name of Allah is its course and its anchorage.

One might think that fear opposes love, but it is not so. Rather, the perception of majesty [idrak al-'azama] necessitates awe [hayba], just as the perception of beauty [idrak al-jamal] necessitates love. And for the lovers [muhibbin] specifically, there are fears in the station of love [maqam al-mahabbah] that are not for others. Some of their fears are more severe than others. The first of them is the fear of being turned away [khawf al-i'rad], and more severe than it is the fear of the veil [khawf al-hijab], and more severe than that is the fear of being distanced [khawf al-ib'ad]. This meaning in Surah Hud is what turned the hair of the master of the lovers [sayyid al-muhibbin] white when he heard the saying of the Almighty: \"So away with Thamud! So away with Madyan as Thamud was distanced!\" And the awe [hayba] of distance [ba'd] and the fear of it only becomes immense in the heart [qalb] of one who has become intimate with nearness [qurb] and tasted it and taken delight in it. Thus, the mention of distance [ba'd] regarding those who are distanced turns the hair of the people of nearness [ahl al-qurb] white while they are in nearness. And one who is accustomed to distance [ba'd] does not yearn for nearness [qurb], nor does one weep from the fear of distance [khawf al-ba'd] who has not been granted the carpet of nearness [bisat al-qurb]. Then there is the fear of being made to stand [khawf al-wuquf] and the deprivation of increase [salb al-mazid], for We have previously established that the degrees of nearness [darajat al-qurb] have no end, and it is the right of the servant that he strive with every breath until he increases in it in nearness [qurb].</div></div></div>"}},"96":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.6","c":"وَلَقَدْ","d":"walaqad","e":"āَnْlَsْrَaʾ"},{"b":"0.81","h":"1.47","c":"أَرْسَلْنَا","d":"arsalnā","e":"ٰàَswُm"},{"b":"2.1","h":"3.44","c":"مُوسَى","d":"mūsā","e":"āَnِtَٰyāَٔـِb"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.79","c":"بِءَايَاتِنَا","d":"biāyātinā","e":"ٍnَٰṭْlُsَw"},{"b":"4.6","h":"7.53","c":"وَسُلْطَانٍ","d":"wasul'ṭānin","e":"ٍnyِbُّm"},{"b":"7.1","h":"10.38","c":"مُبِينٍ","d":"mubīnin","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"}],"a":{"g":"And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority"}},"97":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"0.45","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"َnْwَʿعْrِf"},{"b":"0.61","h":"1.14","c":"فِرْعَوْنَ","d":"fir'ʿawna","e":"ۦِh۟yِiʾَlَmَw"},{"b":"1.7","h":"2.69","c":"وَمَلَإيهِ","d":"wamala-ihi","e":"۟āٓwُʿعَbَّtٱَf"},{"b":"2.9","h":"4.5","c":"فَاتَّبَعُوا","d":"fa-ittabaʿū","e":"َrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.6","c":"أَمْرَ","d":"amra","e":"َnْwَʿعْrِf"},{"b":"6.0","h":"8.46","c":"فِرْعَوْنَ","d":"fir'ʿawna","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"9.5","h":"10.03","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"ُrْmَaʾ"},{"b":"12.3","h":"11.94","c":"أَمْرُ","d":"amru","e":"َnْwَʿعْrِf"},{"b":"12.9","h":"12.8","c":"فِرْعَوْنَ","d":"fir'ʿawna","e":"ٍdyِhsَrِb"},{"b":"14","h":"14.36","c":"بِرَشِيدٍ","d":"birashīdin","e":"ُmُdْqَy"}],"a":{"g":"To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not [at all] discerning."}},"98":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.45","c":"يَقْدُمُ","d":"yaqdumu","e":"ۥُhَmْwَq"},{"b":"0.9","h":"1.58","c":"قَوْمَهُ","d":"qawmahu","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.19","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"ِẗَmَٰyِqْlٱ"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.17","c":"الْقِيَامَةِ","d":"l-qiyāmati","e":"ُmُhَdَrْwَaʾَf"},{"b":"3.9","h":"6.03","c":"فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ","d":"fa-awradahumu","e":"َrāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"8.36","c":"النَّارَ","d":"l-nāra","e":"َsْyʾِbَw"},{"b":"9.6","h":"12.24","c":"وَبِئْسَ","d":"wabi'sa","e":"ُdْrِwْlٱ"},{"b":"10.4","h":"13.39","c":"الْوِرْدُ","d":"l-wir'du","e":"ُdwُrْwَmْlٱ"},{"b":"11.3","h":"14.66","c":"الْمَوْرُودُ","d":"l-mawrūdu","e":"۟āwُʿعِbْtُaʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the place to which they are led."}},"99":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.4","c":"وَأُتْبِعُوا","d":"wa-ut'biʿū","e":"àِf"},{"b":"1.2","h":"2.22","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ۦِhِhdَٰh"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.94","c":"هَذِهِ","d":"hādhihi","e":"ًẗَnْʿعَl"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.69","c":"لَعْنَةً","d":"laʿnatan","e":"َmْwَyَw"},{"b":"3.6","h":"6.91","c":"وَيَوْمَ","d":"wayawma","e":"ِẗَmَٰyِqْlٱ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"8.32","c":"الْقِيَامَةِ","d":"l-qiyāmati","e":"َsْyʾِb"},{"b":"7.2","h":"11.47","c":"بِئْسَ","d":"bi'sa","e":"ُdْfِّrlٱ"},{"b":"7.8","h":"12.39","c":"الرِّفْدُ","d":"l-rif'du","e":"ُdwُfْrَmْlٱ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"13.8","c":"الْمَرْفُودُ","d":"l-marfūdu","e":"َkِlَٰhd"}],"a":{"g":"And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the Day of Resurrection.

And rarely does a servant [al-'abd] become free from inclining away from the Straight Path—I mean the middle [al-wasat]—such that he does not incline to one of the two sides, and thus his heart [qalb] becomes attached to the side to which he inclined. And because of this, he is not free from some punishment and from passing through the Fire, even if it be like the flash of lightning. Allah, the Exalted, has said: \"And there is none of you but will come to it. This is, with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished. Then We will save those who feared Allah [ittaqaw]\"—meaning those whose nearness to the Straight Path was greater than their distance from it.\n\nAnd due to the difficulty of uprightness [al-istiqamah], it is incumbent upon every servant to supplicate to Allah, the Exalted, in every day seventeen times in his saying, \"Guide us to the Straight Path,\" since the recitation of the Opening Chapter [al-Fatihah] is obligatory in every unit of prayer. It has been narrated that one of them saw the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in a dream and said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, 'Surah Hud has aged me.' Why did you say that?\" He, peace be upon him, said, \"Because of His saying, the Exalted: 'So remain upright as you have been commanded.'\" For uprightness upon the evenness of the way is of the utmost subtlety.

So if the servant [abd] directs half of his times to the arrangements and permissible desires of the world, and the other half to acts of worship [ibadat], the side of inclination toward the world is weighted, because it agrees with his nature, since the time is equal. How can they be balanced when the nature [tab'] is a weight in favor of one of them? For the outward [zahir] and the inward [batin] cooperate in the matters of the world, and the heart [qalb] becomes pure and single-minded in seeking it. As for turning back to acts of worship, it is forced, and the sincerity [ikhlas] of the heart and its presence [hudur] therein are not secure except at some times. So whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him immerse all his times in obedience [ta'a]. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds [hasanat] to be weighted and the balances of his good works to be heavy, let him occupy most of his times in obedience. If he mixes a righteous deed with an evil one, his affair is perilous, but hope is not cut off, and pardon from the generosity [karam] of Allah is awaited. Perhaps Allah, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty [jud] and generosity. This is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [nur al-basira]. If you are not of its people, then look to the address of Allah, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [nur al-iman]. For He, the Mighty and Majestic, has said: \"And establish prayer [salat] at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds.\" In this divine command is a clarification that establishing the prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night, with the good deeds it contains, does away with misdeeds [sayi'at], purifies the heart from the stains of sins, and places the servant in the arena of acceptance [qabul] and divine pleasure [ridwan]. For good deeds remove the effect of misdeeds and bring about forgiveness [maghfira]. So let this be evidence of the necessity of watching over the times and filling them with regular litanies [awrad] on the path of constancy, to achieve success [fawz] in the Final Abode [dar al-akhira].</div></div></div>"}},"115":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.38","c":"وَاصْبِرْ","d":"wa-iṣ'bir","e":"َّnِiʾَf"},{"b":"0.67","h":"1.42","c":"فَإِنَّ","d":"fa-inna","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"2.4","h":"3.15","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"āَl"},{"b":"3.3","h":"4.44","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"ُʿعyِḍُy"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.03","c":"يُضِيعُ","d":"yuḍīʿu","e":"َrْjgَaʾ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.4","c":"أَجْرَ","d":"ajra","e":"َnyِnِsْḥُmْlٱ"},{"b":"5.2","h":"7.27","c":"الْمُحْسِنِينَ","d":"l-muḥ'sinīna","e":"āَlْwَlَf"}],"a":{"g":"And be patient, for indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."}},"116":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.75","c":"فَلَوْلَا","d":"falawlā","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"0.94","h":"1.91","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.82","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"ِnwُrُqْlٱ"},{"b":"2.0","h":"3.29","c":"الْقُرُونِ","d":"l-qurūni","e":"nِm"},{"b":"3.0","h":"4.73","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْmُkِlْbَq"},{"b":"4.0","h":"5.7","c":"قَبْلِكُمْ","d":"qablikum","e":"۟āwُl۟wُaʾ"},{"b":"5.1","h":"7.21","c":"أُولُوا","d":"ulū","e":"ٍẗَّyِqَb"},{"b":"5.7","h":"8.03","c":"بَقِيَّةٍ","d":"baqiyyatin","e":"َnْwَhْnَy"},{"b":"7.8","h":"10.19","c":"يَنْهَوْنَ","d":"yanhawna","e":"ِnَʿع"},{"b":"8.7","h":"11.48","c":"عَنِ","d":"ʿani","e":"ِdāَsَfْlٱ"},{"b":"9.2","h":"12.11","c":"الْفَسَادِ","d":"l-fasādi","e":"àِf"},{"b":"10.2","h":"13.54","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ِḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"10.4","h":"13.87","c":"الْأَرْضِ","d":"l-arḍi","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"11.2","h":"15.01","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āًlyِlَq"},{"b":"12","h":"16.12","c":"قَلِيلًا","d":"qalīlan","e":"ْnَّmِّm"},{"b":"15.0","h":"17.39","c":"مِمَّنْ","d":"mimman","e":"āَnْyَjgnَaʾ"},{"b":"15.3","h":"19.75","c":"أَنْجَيْنَا","d":"anjaynā","e":"ْmُhْnِm"},{"b":"17.5","h":"22.25","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"َʿعَbَّtٱَw"},{"b":"18.","h":"25.85","c":"وَاتَّبَعَ","d":"wa-ittabaʿa","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"19.8","h":"27.05","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"۟āwُmَlَẓ"},{"b":"20.8","h":"28.44","c":"ظَلَمُوا","d":"ẓalamū","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"21.7","h":"29.83","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"۟āwُfِrْtُaʾ"},{"b":"23.6","h":"31.58","c":"أُتْرِفُوا","d":"ut'rifū","e":"ِhyِf"},{"b":"24.6","h":"33.05","c":"فِيهِ","d":"fīhi","e":"۟āwُnāَkَw"},{"b":"25.3","h":"33.98","c":"وَكَانُوا","d":"wakānū","e":"َnyِmِrْjgُm"},{"b":"26.4","h":"35.71","c":"مُجْرِمِينَ","d":"muj'rimīna","e":"āَmَw"}],"a":{"g":"So why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth - except a few of those We saved from among them?
