It has been narrated from Kurz ibn Wabrah (may Allah have mercy on him), who was among the Substitutes (Al-Abdal), that he said: A brother of mine from the people of Ash-Sham came to me and gifted me a gift and said: O Kurz, accept from me this gift, for it is an excellent gift. I said: O my brother, and who gifted you this gift? He said: Ibrahim Al-Taymi gave it to me. I said: Did you not ask Ibrahim who gave it to him? He said: I was sitting in the courtyard of the Kaaba while I was engaged in declaring the Oneness (At-Tahlil), glorification (At-Tasbih), praise (At-Tahmid), and magnification (At-Tamjid) of Allah. A man came to me, greeted me with peace, and sat to my right. I have never seen in my time anyone with a more beautiful face, nor more beautiful clothes, nor more intense whiteness, nor more pleasant fragrance than him. I said: O servant of Allah, who are you and from where have you come? He said: I am Al-Khidr. I said: For what have you come to me? He said: I have come to you to greet you with peace and out of love for you for the sake of Allah, and I have a gift I wish to present to you. I said: What is it? He said: That you say before the rising of the sun, before its spreading over the earth, and before sunset: Surah Al-Hamd (Al-Fatihah), and 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind (Qul A'udhu bi-Rabbi an-Nas)', and 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak (Qul A'udhu bi-Rabbi al-Falaq)', and 'Say: He is Allah, the One (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad)', and 'Say: O you who disbelieve (Qul Ya Ayyuha al-Kafirun)', and the Verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi), each one seven times. And you say: Glory be to Allah (Subhan Allah), and praise be to Allah (Al-Hamdu Lillah), and there is no god but Allah (La Ilaha Illa Allah), and Allah is the Greatest (Allahu Akbar) seven times. And you send prayers upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) seven times. And you seek forgiveness for yourself, your parents, the believing men, and the believing women seven times.

So the chasing away between the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah and the whispering (Waswas) of the Devil (Shaytan) is like the chasing away between light and darkness and between night and day.
