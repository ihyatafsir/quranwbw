Therefore the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Most of the people of Paradise are the simple-minded' meaning simple-minded in worldly matters. And Al-Hasan said in some of his sermons: 'We have encountered people whom if you saw them, you would say they are mad, and if they encountered you, they would say you are devils.' So whenever you hear something strange from the matters of religion, the intelligent ones in all other sciences deny it, so do not let their denial deceive you from accepting it, since it is impossible for one traveling the path of the East to attain what exists in the West. Similarly, the affair of this world and the Hereafter proceeds. Therefore Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein...' [the verse]. And He said: 'They know an outward (Zahir) from the life of this world, but they, from the Hereafter, they are heedless (Ghafilun).' And He the Mighty and Majestic said: 'So turn away from whoever turns away from Our Remembrance (Dhikr) and desires not except the life of this world. That is their extent of knowledge.' So combining perfect insight (Istibsar) into the benefits of this world and religion hardly becomes easy except for those whom Allah has firmly established to manage His servants in their livelihood (Ma'ash) and their return (Ma'ad), and they are the prophets supported by the Spirit of Holiness (Ruh al-Qudus), drawing from the divine power (Al-Quwwah al-Ilahiyyah) that expands for all matters and does not become narrow from them. As for the hearts (Qulub) of the rest of creation, when they become preoccupied with the affair of this world, they turn away from the Hereafter and fall short from attaining perfection therein.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولذلك ترى الأكياس في أمور الدنيا وفي علم الطب والحساب والهندسة والفلسفة جهالا في أمور الآخرة والأكياس في دقائق علوم الآخرة جهالا في أكثر علوم الدنيا لأن قوة العقل لا تفي بالأمرين جميعا في الغالب فيكون أحدهما مانعا من الكمال في الثاني ولذلك قال صلى الله عليه وسلم إن أكثر أهل الجنة البله[24] أي البله في أمور الدنيا وقال الحسن في بعض مواعظه لقد أدركنا أقواما لو رأيتموهم لقلتم مجانين ولو أدركوكم لقالوا شياطين فمهما سمعت أمرا غريبا من أمور الدين جحده أهل الكياسة في سائر العلوم فلا يغرنك جحودهم عن قبوله إذ من المحال أن يظفر سالك طريق المشرق بما يوجد في المغرب فكذلك يجري أمر الدنيا والآخرة ولذلك قال تعالى إن الذين لا يرجون لقاءنا ورضوا بالحياة الدنيا واطمأنوا بها الآية وقال تعالى يعلمون ظاهرا من الحياة الدنيا وهم عن الآخرة هم غافلون وقال عز وجل فأعرض عمن تولى عن ذكرنا ولم يرد إلا الحياة الدنيا ذلك مبلغهم من العلم فالجمع بين كمال الاستبصار في مصالح الدنيا والدين لا يكاد يتيسر إلا لمن رسخه الله لتدبير عباده في معاشهم ومعادهم وهم الأنبياء المؤيدون بروح القدس المستمدون من القوة الإلهية التي تتسع لجميع الأمور ولا تضيق عنها فأما قلوب سائر الخلق فإنها إذا استقلت بأمر الدنيا انصرفت عن الآخرة وقصرت عن الاستكمال فيها.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol4_Vol4-book6.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 4: Love, Longing, and Intimacy</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>So Glory be to the One who has veiled Himself from the insights of the blind out of jealousy for His Beauty (Jamal) and Majesty (Jalal), that none may perceive Him except those for whom the good has preceded from Him—those who are kept far from the fire of the veil—and He has left the losers wandering in the darknesses of blindness and lingering in the pastures of the sensibles and the lusts of the beasts; they know an outward aspect from the worldly life and they, from the Hereafter (Akhirah), they are heedless.

An example of this in observation is the love of the prophets, the scholars, and those with noble virtues and pleasing character traits, for that is conceivable even with disarray in the face's appearance and the other limbs. This is what is meant by the beauty of the inner form, which the senses do not perceive. Rather, it is perceived through the beauty of its effects emanating from it that indicate it, until when the Heart (Qalb) indicates it, the Heart (Qalb) inclines toward it and loves it. Thus, whoever loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his family), or Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), or Al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him), loves them only for the beauty that appeared from them, and that is not for the beauty of their forms nor for the beauty of their actions. Rather, the beauty of their actions indicated the beauty of the attributes that are the source of the actions, since actions are effects emanating from them and indicating them. So whoever saw the beauty of the author's composition and the beauty of the poet's poetry, indeed the beauty of the engraver's engraving and the builder's building, was unveiled to him from these actions their inner attributes, whose essence upon investigation returns to knowledge and capability. Then, whenever the known is more noble and more complete in men and greatness, the knowledge is more noble and more beautiful. Likewise, the object of capability, whenever it is greater in rank and more majestic in station, the capability regarding it is more majestic in rank and more noble in value. And the most majestic of known things is Allah the Exalted, so it is no wonder that the most beautiful of sciences and the most noble of them is the knowledge of Him the Exalted. And the most majestic of objects of capability is Allah the Exalted, so it is no wonder that the most beautiful of capabilities and the most noble of them is the capability to know Him the Exalted. And this inner beauty is not perceived except by the possessors of Hearts (Qalb), and none shares with them in it except those who know only an outward aspect from the worldly life, and they, regarding the Hereafter, they are heedless.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وكل جمال فهو محبوب عند مدرك الجمال، فإن كان مدركاً بالقلب فهو محبوب القلب ومثال هذا في المشاهدة حب الأنبياء والعلماء وذوي المكارم السنية والأخلاق المرضية، فإن ذلك متصور مع تشوش صورة الوجه وسائر الأعضاء وهو المراد بحسن الصورة الباطنة والحس لا يدرك. نعم يدرك بحسن آثاره الصادرة منه الدالة عليه، حتى إذا دل القلب عليه مال القلب إليه فأحبه، فمن يحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم أو الصديق رضي الله تعالى عنه أو الشافعي رحمة الله عليه فلا يحبهم إلا لحسن ما ظهر منهم، وليس ذلك لحسن صورهم ولا لحسن أفعالهم، بل دل حسن أفعالهم على حسن الصفات التي هي مصدر الأفعال إذ الأفعال آثار صادرة عنها ودالة عليها فمن رأى حسن تصنيف المصنف وحسن شعر الشاعر بل حسن نقش النقش وبناء البناء انكشف له من هذه الأفعال صفاتها الباطنة التي يرجع حاصلها عند البحث إلى العلم والمقدرة، ثم كلما كان المعلوم أشرف وأتم رجالاً وعظمة كان العلم أشرف وأجمل، وكذا المقدور كلما كان أعظم رتبة وأجل منزلة كانت القدرة عليه أجل رتبة وأشرف قدراً. وأجل المعلومات هو الله تعالى، فلا جرم أحسن العلوم وأشرفها العلم به تعالى، وأجل المقدورات هو الله تعالى، فلا جرم أحسن المقدرات وأشرفها القدرة على معرفته تعالى، وهذا الجمال الباطن لا يدركه إلا أرباب القلوب ولا يشاركهم فيه من لا يعلم إلا ظاهراً من الحياة الدنيا وهم عن الآخرة هم غافلون.</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.3","c":"أَوَلَمْ","d":"awalam","e":"ْmَlَwَaʾ"},{"b":"0.92","h":"1.29","c":"يَتَفَكَّرُوا","d":"yatafakkarū","e":"۟āwُrَّkَfَtَy"},{"b":"2.3","h":"4.12","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"ٓàِf"},{"b":"2.5","h":"6.03","c":"أَنْفُسِهِمْ","d":"anfusihim","e":"mِhِsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"7.1","h":"10.59","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَّm"},{"b":"7.4","h":"11.17","c":"خَلَقَ","d":"khalaqa","e":"َqَlَhk"},{"b":"8.2","h":"12.35","c":"اللَّهُ","d":"l-lahu","e":"ُhَّllٱ"},{"b":"9","h":"13.83","c":"السَّمَاوَاتِ","d":"l-samāwāti","e":"ِtَٰwَٰmَّslٱ"},{"b":"10.5","h":"16.41","c":"وَالْأَرْضَ","d":"wal-arḍa","e":"َḍْrَaʾْlٱَw"},{"b":"11.6","h":"18.11","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"12.2","h":"19.33","c":"بَيْنَهُمَا","d":"baynahumā","e":"ٓāَmُhَnْyَb"},{"b":"15.0","h":"21.01","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"15.9","h":"24.41","c":"بِالْحَقِّ","d":"bil-ḥaqi","e":"ِّqَḥْlٱِb"},{"b":"16.9","h":"26.27","c":"وَأَجَلٍ","d":"wa-ajalin","e":"ٍlَjgَaʾَw"},{"b":"18.7","h":"28.69","c":"مُسَمًّى","d":"musamman","e":"àًّmَsُّm"},{"b":"21.3","h":"33.43","c":"وَإِنَّ","d":"wa-inna","e":"َّnِiʾَw"},{"b":"22.8","h":"35.05","c":"كَثِيرًا","d":"kathīran","e":"āًryِhtَk"},{"b":"23.7","h":"36.69","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِّm"},{"b":"25.3","h":"38.36","c":"النَّاسِ","d":"l-nāsi","e":"ِsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"27.0","h":"40.55","c":"بِلِقَاءِ","d":"biliqāi","e":"ِyʾٓāَqِlِb"},{"b":"29.6","h":"43.73","c":"رَبِّهِمْ","d":"rabbihim","e":"ْmِhِّbَr"},{"b":"30.","h":"45.65","c":"لَكَافِرُونَ","d":"lakāfirūna","e":"َnwُrِfَٰkَl"}],"a":{"g":"Do they not contemplate within themselves?

All of this makes clear to you that the path to the Exalted is watching over the times and populating them with regular devotional practices (Awrad) on the basis of continuity, and for that reason the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'The most beloved of Allah's servants to Allah are those who observe the sun, the moon, and the shadows for the Remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah the Exalted.'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال عز وجل: ﴿ كانوا قليلا من الليل ما يهجعون وبالأسحار هم يستغفرون ﴾ {} وقال عز وجل: ﴿ فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ ولا تطرد الذين يدعون ربهم بالغداة والعشي يريدون وجهه ﴾ {}. فهذا كله يبين لك أن الطريق إلى تعالى مراقبة الأوقات وعمارتها بالأوراد على سبيل الدوام ولذلك قال ﭬ: (أحب عباد الله إلى الله الذين يراعون الشمس والقمر والأظلة لذكر الله تعالى[1]).</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Arrangement of Litanies</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And it is a noble time, and its nobility and excellence are indicated by Allah the Exalted swearing by it when He said: 'And by the morning when it breathes' (Quran 81:18), and praising it when He said: 'The Cleaver of the dawn' (Quran 6:96), and Allah the Exalted said: 'Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak\"' (Quran 113:1), and demonstrating His power by the contraction of the shadow in it when Allah the Exalted said: 'Then We drew it in to Ourselves a gradual drawing in' (Quran 25:46), and it is the time of contracting the shadow of the night by spreading the light of the sun, and guiding people to the Glorification (Tasbīḥ) in it by His saying the Exalted: 'So glorify Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning' (Quran 30:17), and by His saying the Exalted: 'So glorify with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting' (Quran 50:39), and His saying the Mighty and Majestic: 'And during parts of the night exalt Him and at the ends of the day, that you may be satisfied' (Quran 20:130), and His saying the Exalted: 'And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening' (Quran 76:25).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وهو وقت شريف ويدل على شرفه وفضله إقسام الله تعالى به إذ قال: ﴿ والصبح إذا تنفس ﴾ {} وتمدحه به إذ قال: ﴿ فالق الإصباح ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ قل أعوذ برب الفلق ﴾ {} وإظهاره القدرة بقبض الظل فيه إذ قال تعالى: ﴿ ثم قبضناه إلينا قبضا يسيرا ﴾ {} وهو وقت قبض ظل الليل ببسط نور الشمس وإرشاده الناس إلى التسبيح فيه بقوله تعالى: ﴿ فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون ﴾ {} وبقوله تعالى: ﴿ فسبح بحمد ربك قبل طلوع الشمس وقبل غروبها ﴾ {} وقوله عز وجل: ﴿ ومن آناء الليل فسبح وأطراف النهار لعلك ترضى ﴾ {} وقوله تعالى: ﴿ واذكر اسم ربك بكرة وأصيلا ﴾ {}.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-10.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Arrangement of Litanies</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>The Seventh Remembrance (Wird): When the sun yellows by approaching the earth such that its light covers the expressions and vapors on the face of the earth and a yellowness is seen in its light, the time of this Remembrance (Wird) enters. It is like the first Remembrance (Wird) from the rising of dawn to the rising of the sun because it is before sunset, just as that is before sunrise. This is what is intended by His saying, the Exalted: 'So glorify Allah when you reach evening and when you reach morning.' And this is the second extremity intended by His saying, the Exalted: 'So glorify and the extremities of the day.' Al-Hasan said: They used to have greater reverence for the evening than for the beginning of the day. And some of the predecessors said: They used to make the beginning of the day for the worldly life (Dunya) and its end for the Hereafter (Akhirah). So it is recommended in this time the Glorification (Tasbih) and the Seeking of Forgiveness (Istighfar) especially, and the rest of what we mentioned in the first Remembrance (Wird), such as saying: 'I seek forgiveness from Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the Sustainer, and I ask Him for repentance, and glory be to Allah the Great and with His praise,' taken from His saying, the Exalted: 'And seek forgiveness for your sin and glorify with the praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.' And the Seeking of Forgiveness (Istighfar) upon the names that are in the Quran is more beloved, like His saying: 'Seek forgiveness from Allah, indeed He is Oft-Forgiving (Ghaffar),' 'I seek forgiveness from Allah, indeed He is Oft-Returning (Tawwab),' 'My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the best of the forgivers.' And it is recommended to recite before the setting of the sun: 'By the sun and its brightness,' 'By the night when it covers,' and the two seeking refuge surahs. And let the sun set upon him while he is in the Seeking of Forgiveness (Istighfar). Then when he hears the call to prayer (Adhan), he says: 'O Allah, this is the approach of Your night and the departure of Your day and the voices of Your callers,' as preceded, then he responds to the caller to prayer and occupies himself with the sunset prayer (Maghrib). And with the sunset, the Remembrances (Awrad) of the day have ended, so it behooves the servant (Abd) to observe his states and account his Soul (Nafs), for a stage from his path has passed, so if the day equals...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الورد السابع: إذا اصفرت الشمس بأن تقرب من الأرض بحيث يغطى نورها العبارات والبخارات التي على وجه الأرض ويرى صفرة في ضوئها دخل وقت هذا الورد وهو مثل الورد الأول من طلوع الفجر إلى طلوع الشمس لأنه قبل الغروب كما أن ذلك قبل الطلوع وهو المراد بقوله تعالى: ﴿ فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون ﴾ {} وهذا هو الطرف الثاني المراد بقوله تعالى: ﴿ فسبح وأطراف النهار ﴾ {} قال الحسن كانوا أشد تعظيما للعشى منهم لأول النهار وقال بعض السلف كانوا يجعلون أول النهار للدنيا وآخره للآخرة فيستحب في هذا الوقت التسبيح والاستغفار خاصة وسائر ما ذكرناه في الورد الأول مثل أن يقول أستغفر الله الذي لا إله إلا هو الحي القيوم وأسأله التوبة وسبحان الله العظيم وبحمده مأخوذ من قوله تعالى: ﴿ واستغفر لذنبك وسبح بحمد ربك بالعشي والإبكار ﴾ {} والاستغفار على الأسماء التي في القرآن أحب كقوله استغفر الله إنه كان غفارا أستغفر الله إنه كان توابا رب اغفر وارحم وأنت خير الراحمين فاغفر لنا وارحمنا وأنت خير الراحمين فاغفر لنا وارحمنا وأنت خير الغافرين ويستحب أن يقرأ قبل غروب الشمس: والشمس وضحاها. والليل إذا يغشى. والمعوذتين. ولتغرب الشمس عليه وهو في الاستغفار فإذا سمع الأذان قال اللهم هذا إقبال ليلك وإدبار نهارك وأصوات دعاتك كما سبق ثم يجيب المؤذن ويشتغل بصلاة المغرب وبالغروب قد انتهت أوراد النهار فينبغي أن يلاحظ العبد أحواله ويحاسب نفسه فقد انقضى من طريقه مرحلة فان ساوى يوم</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-7.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Hajj</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, glorify Allah [subhan Allah] when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning.

This is the shortest of the day's litanies and the most excellent of them. So, if he had performed ablution [wudu] before the zenith and was present in the mosque, then whenever the sun has passed its zenith and the caller to prayer [mu'adhdhin] begins the call [adhan], let him wait until the completion of the response to his call. Then let him rise to enliven what is between the call [adhan] and the establishment [iqamah], for it is the time of the appearance [al-izhar] which Allah, the Exalted, intended by His saying: \"And when you appear [tazharun]\" (30:18). And let him pray in this time four rak'ahs, not separating between them with a single salutation [taslimah wahidah]. Concerning this prayer alone, among all the other prayers of the day, some scholars have transmitted that he prays it with a single salutation, but that narration has been criticized. The school [madhhab] of Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, is that he prays it two by two [mathna mathna] like all other supererogatory prayers [nawafil] and separates with a salutation, and it is that which the reports have confirmed as sound. And let him lengthen these rak'ahs, for in them the gates of the heaven are opened, as we have mentioned the report concerning it in the chapter on supererogatory prayer [salah al-tatawwu']. And let him recite in them Surah Al-Baqarah, or a surah from the Hundreds [al-mi'in], or four from the Repeated Verses [al-mathani]. For these are hours in which supplication [du'a'] is answered, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, loved that a deed be raised up for him within them. Then he prays Dhuhr in congregation after four long rak'ahs, as preceded, or short ones—it is not fitting that he neglects them. Then let him pray after Dhuhr two rak'ahs, then four. For Ibn Mas'ud disliked that an obligatory prayer [fard] be followed by its like without a separation. And it is recommended [mustahabb] that he recite in this supererogatory prayer [nafilah] the Verse of the Throne [Ayat al-Kursi] and the end of Surah Al-Baqarah and the verses which we mentioned in the First Litany, so that this may combine for him between supplication [du'a'], remembrance [dhikr], recitation [qira'ah], prayer [salah], praise [tahmid], and glorification [tasbih] along with the nobility of the time.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الورد الرابع ما بين الزوال إلى الفراغ من صلاة الظهر وراتبته وهذا أقصر أوراد النهار وأفضلها فإذا كان قد توضأ قبل الزوال وحضر المسجد فمهما زالت الشمس وابتدأ المؤذن الأذان فليصبر إلى الفراغ من جواب أذانه ثم ليقم إلى إحياء ما بين الأذان والإقامة فهو وقت الإظهار الذي أراده الله تعالى بقوله: ﴿ وحين تظهرون ﴾ {} وليصلّ في هذا الوقت أربع ركعات لا يفصل بينهن بتسليمة واحدة[39] وهذه الصلاة وحدها من بين سائر صلوات النهار نقل بعض العلماء أنه يصليها بتسليمة واحدة ولكن طعن في تلك الرواية ومذهب الشافعي رضي الله عنه أنه يصلي مثنى مثنى كسائر النوافل ويفصل بتسليمة[40] وهو الذي صحت به الأخبار وليطول هذه الركعات إذ فيها تفتح أبواب السماء كما أوردنا الخبر فيه في باب صلاة التطوع وليقرأ فيها سورة البقرة أو سورة من المئين أو أربعا من المثاني فهذه ساعات يستجاب فيها الدعاء وأحب رسول الله ﭬ أن يرتفع له فيها عمل ثم يصلي الظهر بجماعة بعد أربع ركعات طويلة كما سبق أو قصيرة لا ينبغي أن يدعها ثم ليصل بعد الظهر ركعتين ثم أربعا فقد كره ابن مسعود أن تتبع الفريضة بمثلها من غير فاصل ويستحب أن يقرأ في هذه النافلة آية الكرسي وآخر سورة البقرة والآيات التي أوردناها في الورد الأول ليكون ذلك جامعا له بين الدعاء والذكر والقراءة والصلاة والتحميد والتسبيح مع شرف الوقت.</div></div></div>"}},"19":{"w":[{"b":"0.31","h":"0.65","c":"يُخْرِجُ","d":"yukh'riju","e":"ُjgِrْhkُy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.86","c":"الْحَيَّ","d":"l-ḥaya","e":"َّàَḥْlٱ"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.23","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.89","c":"الْمَيِّتِ","d":"l-mayiti","e":"ِtِّyَmْlٱ"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.74","c":"وَيُخْرِجُ","d":"wayukh'riju","e":"ُjgِrْhkُyَw"},{"b":"4.3","h":"7.56","c":"الْمَيِّتَ","d":"l-mayita","e":"َtِّyَmْlٱ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"9.34","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"5.7","h":"9.96","c":"الْحَيِّ","d":"l-ḥayi","e":"ِّàَḥْlٱ"},{"b":"6.6","h":"11.43","c":"وَيُحْيِي","d":"wayuḥ'yī","e":"ِàْḥُyَw"},{"b":"7.4","h":"12.89","c":"الْأَرْضَ","d":"l-arḍa","e":"َḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"8.2","h":"14.3","c":"بَعْدَ","d":"baʿda","e":"َdْʿعَb"},{"b":"8.8","h":"15.43","c":"مَوْتِهَا","d":"mawtihā","e":"āَhِtْwَm"},{"b":"10.4","h":"18.9","c":"وَكَذَلِكَ","d":"wakadhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhdَkَw"},{"b":"11.6","h":"20.96","c":"تُخْرَجُونَ","d":"tukh'rajūna","e":"َnwُjgَrْhkُt"}],"a":{"g":"He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness.

In you are wonders indicating the majesty of Allah, the Exalted, that lifetimes would not suffice to grasp a tenth of a tenth of it, while you are heedless of it. So, O you who are heedless of your own self (Nafs) and ignorant of it, how can you aspire to know others when Allah, the Exalted, has commanded you to reflect upon your self (Nafs) in His Noble Book, saying: 'And in your own selves (Anfusikum) - will you not then see?' And He mentioned that you are created from a filthy sperm-drop (Nutfah Qadhirah), saying: 'Woe to man! How ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop (Nutfah) He created him and then proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He causes him to die and puts him in his grave. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'And among His Signs (Ayat) is that He created you from dust, then, behold, you are human beings dispersing.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'Was he not a sperm-drop (Nutfah) from semen emitted? Then he was a clinging clot ('Alaqah), then He created and proportioned.' And He, the Exalted, said: 'Did We not create you from a despised water (Ma'in Mahin)? Then We placed it in a firm lodging (Qararin Makin) for a known term.' And He said: 'Does not man see that We created him from a sperm-drop (Nutfah)? Then, behold, he is a clear adversary.' And He said: 'Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture (Nutfatin Amshaj).' Then He mentioned how He made the sperm-drop (Nutfah) into a clinging clot ('Alaqah), and the clinging clot ('Alaqah) into a chewed lump (Mudghah), and the chewed lump (Mudghah) into bones, saying, the Exalted: 'And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop (Nutfah) in a firm lodging (Qararin Makin). Then We made the sperm-drop (Nutfah) into a clinging clot ('Alaqah)...' So, the repetition of mentioning the sperm-drop (Nutfah) in the Noble Book is not merely to hear its word and neglect reflection upon its meaning. Now look at the sperm-drop (Nutfah): it is a drop of filthy water; if left for an hour to be struck by the air, it would spoil and become foul-smelling. How did the Lord of lords bring it forth from the backbone and the ribs? And how did He bring together the male and the female and cast affection (Alfah) and love (Mahabbah) into their hearts (Qulub)? And how did He lead them by the chain of love (Mahabbah) and desire (Shahwah) to union? And how did He extract the sperm-drop (Nutfah) from the man through the movement of intercourse (Waqa')? And how did He draw the menstrual blood from the depths of the veins and gather it in the womb?

Therefore, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'How can I be at ease when the possessor of the Trumpet has taken the horn into his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow?' [144] Muqatil said: The Trumpet (الصور) is the horn, and that is because Israfil (upon him be peace) has placed his mouth on the horn like a trumpet, and the circumference of the head of the horn is like the expanse of the heavens and the earth, and he is staring with his gaze towards the Throne, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first blowing. When he blows, those in the heavens and the earth are struck unconscious (صعق), meaning every living creature dies from the intensity of the fright except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death. Then the Angel of Death is commanded to take the soul (روح) of Jibril, then the soul of Mika'il, then the soul of Israfil, then the Angel of Death is commanded and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blowing in the Barzakh (البرزخ) for forty years. Then Allah the Exalted revives Israfil and commands him to blow the second blowing, and that is His saying the Exalted: 'Then it will be blown into it another time, and behold, they will be standing, looking on.' {} On their feet, looking at the Resurrection. And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'When I was sent, I was sent to the possessor of the Trumpet, and he inclined it to his mouth, advanced one foot and delayed another, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow. Indeed, fear the blowing!' [145] So reflect upon the creatures and their humiliation, their brokenness, and their submission at the time of resurrection out of fear of this striking unconscious (الصعقة) and in anticipation of what will be decreed for them of happiness or misery. And you are among them, broken like their brokenness, perplexed like their perplexity. Rather, if you were in the world among the luxurious and the rich enjoying pleasures, then the kings of the earth on that day are the most humiliated people of the gathering place, the smallest and most contemptible of them, being trodden underfoot like a grain.

Therefore, Allah the Exalted said: 'And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, \"Allah.\"' Its meaning is that if you considered their states, their souls (Nafs) and innermost beings (Bawatin) would testify to that. The natural disposition (Fitrah) of Allah upon which He created people, meaning every human is created upon faith in Allah the Exalted, indeed upon knowledge of things as they are, meaning they are as if embedded in it due to the proximity of their preparedness for perception. Then, since faith is firmly rooted in the souls (Nafs) by natural disposition (Fitrah), people divided into two groups: those who turned away and forgot—they are the disbelievers—and those who pondered their thoughts and remembered, so they were like one who carried testimony then forgot it due to heedlessness then remembered it. Therefore, the Exalted said: 'That they may remember,' 'And that those of understanding may remember,' 'And remember the favor of Allah upon you and His covenant with which He bound you,' 'And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?'; Naming this pattern remembrance is not far-fetched, as if remembrance is of two kinds: one is to remember an image that was present in existence in his heart (Qalb) but disappeared after the other existence. The other is to remember an image that was embedded in him by natural disposition (Fitrah), and these are truths apparent to the observer by the light of insight, heavy upon one who is accustomed to it—his saying 'is accustomed to it' is from circulation, meaning hearing and imitation are prevalent with him, so reflect—his corrector is hearing and imitation without unveiling and witnessing. Therefore, you see him floundering in such verses and forcing, and in interpreting remembrance with the affirmation of souls (Nafs), types of forced interpretations, and he imagines to himself in reports and verses kinds of contradictions, and perhaps that overcomes him until he looks at them with an eye of contempt and...</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولذلك قال تعالى وإذ أخذ ربك من بني آدم من ظهورهم ذريتهم وأشهدهم على أنفسهم ألست بربكم قالوا بلى فالمراد به إقرار نفوسهم لا إقرار الألسنة فإنهم انقسموا في إقرار الألسنة حيث وجدت الألسنة والأشخاص إلى مقر وإلى جاحد ولذلك قال تعالى: (ولئن سألتهم من خلقهم ليقولن الله( معناه إن اعتبرت أحوالهم شهدت بذلك نفوسهم وبواطنهم فطرة الله التي فطر الناس عليها أي كل آدمي فطر على الإيمان بالله عز وجل بل على معرفة الأشياء على ما هي عليه أعني أنها كالمضمنة فيها لقرب استعدادها للإدراك ثم لما كان الإيمان مركوزا في النفوس بالفطرة انقسم الناس إلى قسمين إلى من أعرض فنسي وهم الكفار وإلى من أجال خاطره فتذكر فكان كمن حمل شهادة فنسيها بغفلة ثم تذكرها ولذلك قال عز وجل: (لعلهم يتذكرون) ، (وليتذكر أولوا الألباب)، (واذكروا نعمة الله عليكم وميثاقه الذي واثقكم به)، (ولقد يسرنا القرآن للذكر فهل من مدكر)؛ وتسمية هذا النمط تذكرا ليس ببعيد فكأن التذكر ضربان أحدهما أن يذكر صورة كانت حاضرة الوجود في قلبه لكن غابت بعد الوجود الآخر. والآخر أن يذكر صورة كانت مضمنة فيه بالفطرة وهذه حقائق ظاهرة للناظر بنور البصيرة ثقيلة على من يستروجه قوله يستروجه من الرواج أي يكون السماع والتقليد رائجا عنده فتأمل اه مصححه السماع والتقليد دون الكشف والعيان ولذلك تراه يتخبط في مثل هذه الآيات ويتعسف وفي تأويل التذكر بإقرار النفوس أنواعا من التعسفات ويتخايل إليه في الأخبار والآيات ضروب من المناقضات وربما يغلب ذلك عليه حتى ينظر إليها بعين الاستحقار ويعت</div></div></div>"}},"31":{"w":[{"b":"0.21","h":"0.65","c":"مُنِيبِينَ","d":"munībīna","e":"َnyِbyِnُm"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.53","c":"إِلَيْهِ","d":"ilayhi","e":"ِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.88","c":"وَاتَّقُوهُ","d":"wa-ittaqūhu","e":"ُhwُqَّtٱَw"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.95","c":"وَأَقِيمُوا","d":"wa-aqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqَaʾَw"},{"b":"4.6","h":"7.81","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"5.7","h":"9.53","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"6.3","h":"10.49","c":"تَكُونُوا","d":"takūnū","e":"۟āwُnwُkَt"},{"b":"7.5","h":"12.41","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"7.9","h":"13","c":"الْمُشْرِكِينَ","d":"l-mush'rikīna","e":"َnyِkِrْhsُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"[Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with Allah"}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.24","h":"0.16","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"0.54","h":"0.61","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.32","c":"فَرَّقُوا","d":"farraqū","e":"۟āwُqَّrَf"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.18","c":"دِينَهُمْ","d":"dīnahum","e":"ْmُhَnyِd"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.92","c":"وَكَانُوا","d":"wakānū","e":"۟āwُnāَkَw"},{"b":"4.8","h":"7.84","c":"شِيَعًا","d":"shiyaʿan","e":"āًʿعَyِhs"},{"b":"5.9","h":"11.05","c":"كُلُّ","d":"kullu","e":"ُّlُk"},{"b":"6.8","h":"11.9","c":"حِزْبٍ","d":"ḥiz'bin","e":"ٍۭbْzِḥ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"13.9","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"9.3","h":"15.05","c":"لَدَيْهِمْ","d":"ladayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَdَl"},{"b":"10.","h":"16.92","c":"فَرِحُونَ","d":"fariḥūna","e":"َnwُḥِrَf"}],"a":{"g":"[Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol3_Vol3-book-9a.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 3: Condemnation of Pride and Conceit</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>The eighth: Pride in erroneous opinion.

And Abu Yazid saw his Lord in a dream and said: 'O Lord, how is the path to You?' He said: 'Leave your Soul (Nafs) and come to Me.' And al-Shibli was seen after his death in a dream, and it was said to him: 'What did Allah do with you?' He said: 'He did not demand from me proof for the claims except for one statement: I said one day: What loss is greater than the loss of Paradise? He said: What loss is greater than the loss of My meeting?' And the purpose is that these intentions are of varying degrees, and whoever is dominated in their Heart (Qalb) by one of them, perhaps it is not made easy for them to turn to another.
