The worldly are like the science of medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all crafts and industries. The otherworldly are like the science of the states of the heart [ahwal al-qalb] and the defects of deeds, and the knowledge [al-'ilm] of God, the Exalted, and His attributes and His actions, as We detailed in the Book of Knowledge. And these are two conflicting sciences ['ilman mutanafiyan]; I mean that whoever directs his concern to one of them until he delves deeply into it, his insight [basira] into the other is, for the most part, diminished.\n\nTherefore, 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, gave three parables for the world [al-dunya] and the Hereafter [al-akhira]. He said: They are like the two pans of a scale, and like the east and the west, and like two co-wives: if you please one, you anger the other. For this reason, you see the clever ones [al-akyaas] in the affairs of the world [al-dunya] and in the science of medicine, arithmetic, geometry, and philosophy to be ignorant [juhhala] in the affairs of the Hereafter [al-akhira]. And the clever ones [al-akyaas] in the subtleties of the sciences of the Hereafter [al-akhira] are ignorant [juhhala] in most of the worldly sciences [al-'ulum al-dunya], because the power of the intellect [al-'aql] does not suffice for both matters together in most cases, so one of them becomes a barrier [man'] from perfection in the second.\n\nTherefore, He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, most of the people of Paradise are the simple-minded [al-bulh],\" meaning simple-minded in the affairs of the world [al-dunya]. And Al-Hasan said in one of his sermons: \"We have encountered people whom, if you saw them, you would say they are madmen, and if they encountered you, they would say you are devils.\"\n\nWhenever you hear something strange from the affairs of the religion [al-din], which the people of cleverness [ahl al-kiyasa] in the other sciences reject, do not let their rejection deceive you into not accepting it. For it is impossible for the traveler on the path to the east to find what exists in the west.

As for turning back to acts of worship [‘ibadat], it is forced, and the sincerity [ikhlas] of the heart and its presence [hudur] within it are not secured except at some times. So whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him immerse his times in obedience [ta’a]. And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds [hasanat] to outweigh and the balances of his goodness [khayrat] to grow heavy, let him occupy most of his time with obedience. For if he mixes a righteous deed with an evil one, his affair is perilous, yet hope [raja’] is not cut off, and pardon [‘afw] from the generosity of Allah is awaited. Perhaps Allah, the Exalted, will forgive him by His bounty and generosity. This is what has been unveiled to the observers by the light of insight [nur al-basira]. If you are not of its people, then look to the address of Allah, the Exalted, to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith [iman].\n\nAnd Allah, the Exalted, has made clear that the path to Him is the vigilant observance of times and populating them with litanies [awrad] on the path of constancy. The purpose of the sun and moon running in a precise, ordered calculation, and of the creation of shadow and light and the stars, is not to seek aid through them for worldly matters, but rather that you may know by them the measures of times, so you may occupy yourselves within them with acts of obedience and trade for the Abode of the Hereafter [dar al-akhira]. His statement, the Exalted, indicates that: **“And He is the One who made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude.”** Meaning, one succeeds the other so that what was missed in one may be made up in the other, and He clarified that this is for remembrance [dhikr] and gratitude [shukr], nothing else.\n\nAnd the litanies [awrad] of the day are seven. The first litany is what is between the dawn [fajr] and sunrise, and it is a noble time. The swearing of Allah, the Exalted, by it indicates its nobility and virtue, as in His statement, the Exalted: **“So exalted is Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning.”** For the time is equal, so how can they be equivalent when nature inclines towards one of them? It is like the first litany from the dawn to sunrise, for it is before sunset just as that is before sunrise. So glorification [tasbih] in these two times reveals the virtue of the first litany and necessitates observing it for remembrance and gratitude. Thus it is unveiled that acts of worship in these times secure the sincerity of the heart and its presence, so the scale of good deeds outweighs and the balances of goodness grow heavy, and by this, hope in pardon and forgiveness from the generosity of Allah, the Exalted, is realized.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>إن القلب في طلب أمور الدنيا يصفو ويتجرد، إذ الظاهر والباطن يتساعدان عليها، فالتقرب إليها يكون طبعاً مرجحاً. أما الرد إلى العبادات فمتكلف، ولا يسلم إخلاص القلب فيه وحضوره إلا في بعض الأوقات، فمن أراد أن يدخل الجنة بغير حساب فليستغرق أوقاته في الطاعة، ومن أراد أن تترجح كفة حسناته وتثقل موازين خيراته فليستوعب في الطاعة أكثر أوقاته، فإن خلط عملاً صالحاً وآخر سيئاً فأمره مخطر، ولكن الرجاء غير منقطع والعفو من كرم الله منتظر، فعسى الله تعالى أن يغفر له بجوده وكرمه. وهذا ما انكشف للناظرين بنور البصيرة، فإن لم تكن من أهله فانظر إلى خطاب الله تعالى لرسوله واقتبسه بنور الإيمان، فقد قال الله تعالى: ﴿ فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون ﴾، فتبين أن الطريق إلى الله تعالى مراقبة الأوقات وعمارتها بالأوراد على سبيل الدوام، إذ الشمس والقمر والظل والنجوم خُلقت لتعرف بها مقادير الأوقات فتشتغل فيها بالطاعات والتجارة للدار الآخرة، كما يدل عليه قوله تعالى: ﴿ وهو الذي جعل الليل والنهار خلفة لمن أراد أن يذكر أو أراد شكورا ﴾، فالمقصود من سيرها بحسبان أن يتدارك في أحدهما ما فات في الآخر للذكر والشكر لا غير، فسبحان الله حين تمسون وحين تصبحون، إذ هذان الوقتان من أشراف الأوقات للعبادة والذكر، فينبغي أن يُستغرقا في تسبيح الله وطاعته لتحصيل الفضل المبتغى وهو الثواب والمغفرة.</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-7.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Hajj</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Indeed, glorify Allah [subhan Allah] when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning.

This is the shortest of the day's litanies and the most excellent of them. So, if he had performed ablution [wudu] before the zenith and was present in the mosque, then whenever the sun has passed its zenith and the caller to prayer [mu'adhdhin] begins the call [adhan], let him wait until the completion of the response to his call. Then let him rise to enliven what is between the call [adhan] and the establishment [iqamah], for it is the time of the appearance [al-izhar] which Allah, the Exalted, intended by His saying: \"And when you appear [tazharun]\" (30:18). And let him pray in this time four rak'ahs, not separating between them with a single salutation [taslimah wahidah]. Concerning this prayer alone, among all the other prayers of the day, some scholars have transmitted that he prays it with a single salutation, but that narration has been criticized. The school [madhhab] of Al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, is that he prays it two by two [mathna mathna] like all other supererogatory prayers [nawafil] and separates with a salutation, and it is that which the reports have confirmed as sound. And let him lengthen these rak'ahs, for in them the gates of the heaven are opened, as we have mentioned the report concerning it in the chapter on supererogatory prayer [salah al-tatawwu']. And let him recite in them Surah Al-Baqarah, or a surah from the Hundreds [al-mi'in], or four from the Repeated Verses [al-mathani]. For these are hours in which supplication [du'a'] is answered, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, loved that a deed be raised up for him within them. Then he prays Dhuhr in congregation after four long rak'ahs, as preceded, or short ones—it is not fitting that he neglects them. Then let him pray after Dhuhr two rak'ahs, then four. For Ibn Mas'ud disliked that an obligatory prayer [fard] be followed by its like without a separation. And it is recommended [mustahabb] that he recite in this supererogatory prayer [nafilah] the Verse of the Throne [Ayat al-Kursi] and the end of Surah Al-Baqarah and the verses which we mentioned in the First Litany, so that this may combine for him between supplication [du'a'], remembrance [dhikr], recitation [qira'ah], prayer [salah], praise [tahmid], and glorification [tasbih] along with the nobility of the time.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>الورد الرابع ما بين الزوال إلى الفراغ من صلاة الظهر وراتبته وهذا أقصر أوراد النهار وأفضلها فإذا كان قد توضأ قبل الزوال وحضر المسجد فمهما زالت الشمس وابتدأ المؤذن الأذان فليصبر إلى الفراغ من جواب أذانه ثم ليقم إلى إحياء ما بين الأذان والإقامة فهو وقت الإظهار الذي أراده الله تعالى بقوله: ﴿ وحين تظهرون ﴾ {} وليصلّ في هذا الوقت أربع ركعات لا يفصل بينهن بتسليمة واحدة[39] وهذه الصلاة وحدها من بين سائر صلوات النهار نقل بعض العلماء أنه يصليها بتسليمة واحدة ولكن طعن في تلك الرواية ومذهب الشافعي رضي الله عنه أنه يصلي مثنى مثنى كسائر النوافل ويفصل بتسليمة[40] وهو الذي صحت به الأخبار وليطول هذه الركعات إذ فيها تفتح أبواب السماء كما أوردنا الخبر فيه في باب صلاة التطوع وليقرأ فيها سورة البقرة أو سورة من المئين أو أربعا من المثاني فهذه ساعات يستجاب فيها الدعاء وأحب رسول الله ﭬ أن يرتفع له فيها عمل ثم يصلي الظهر بجماعة بعد أربع ركعات طويلة كما سبق أو قصيرة لا ينبغي أن يدعها ثم ليصل بعد الظهر ركعتين ثم أربعا فقد كره ابن مسعود أن تتبع الفريضة بمثلها من غير فاصل ويستحب أن يقرأ في هذه النافلة آية الكرسي وآخر سورة البقرة والآيات التي أوردناها في الورد الأول ليكون ذلك جامعا له بين الدعاء والذكر والقراءة والصلاة والتحميد والتسبيح مع شرف الوقت.</div></div></div>"}},"19":{"w":[{"b":"0.31","h":"0.65","c":"يُخْرِجُ","d":"yukh'riju","e":"ُjgِrْhkُy"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.86","c":"الْحَيَّ","d":"l-ḥaya","e":"َّàَḥْlٱ"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.23","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.89","c":"الْمَيِّتِ","d":"l-mayiti","e":"ِtِّyَmْlٱ"},{"b":"3.4","h":"5.74","c":"وَيُخْرِجُ","d":"wayukh'riju","e":"ُjgِrْhkُyَw"},{"b":"4.3","h":"7.56","c":"الْمَيِّتَ","d":"l-mayita","e":"َtِّyَmْlٱ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"9.34","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"5.7","h":"9.96","c":"الْحَيِّ","d":"l-ḥayi","e":"ِّàَḥْlٱ"},{"b":"6.6","h":"11.43","c":"وَيُحْيِي","d":"wayuḥ'yī","e":"ِàْḥُyَw"},{"b":"7.4","h":"12.89","c":"الْأَرْضَ","d":"l-arḍa","e":"َḍْrَaʾْlٱ"},{"b":"8.2","h":"14.3","c":"بَعْدَ","d":"baʿda","e":"َdْʿعَb"},{"b":"8.8","h":"15.43","c":"مَوْتِهَا","d":"mawtihā","e":"āَhِtْwَm"},{"b":"10.4","h":"18.9","c":"وَكَذَلِكَ","d":"wakadhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhdَkَw"},{"b":"11.6","h":"20.96","c":"تُخْرَجُونَ","d":"tukh'rajūna","e":"َnwُjgَrْhkُt"}],"a":{"g":"He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness.

So let us mention the manner of reflection upon some of the signs [ayat]. So from His signs [ayat] is the human [insan], created from a sperm-drop [nutfah]. And the closest thing to you is your own self [nafs], and within you are wonders [aja'ib] indicating the majesty of Allah the Exalted, which lifetimes would not suffice to stand upon a tenth of a tenth of them, while you are heedless [ghafil] of them. So O you who is heedless [ghafil] of your own self [nafs] and ignorant of it, how do you aspire to the knowledge [ma'rifah] of other than you? And Allah the Exalted has commanded you to contemplate [tadabbur] within your own selves [anfusikum] in His Mighty Book, saying: \"And in yourselves [anfusikum]—will you not then see?\" And He mentioned that you are created from a foul sperm-drop [nutfah qadhirah], saying: \"Destroyed is man [insan]; how ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a sperm-drop [nutfah] He created him and destined him. Then He made the path easy for him. Then He causes him to die and be buried. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.\" And He the Exalted said: \"And among His signs [ayat] is that He created you from dust, then, behold, you are human beings spreading [on earth].\" And He the Exalted said: \"Was he not a sperm-drop [nutfah] from semen emitted? Then he was a clinging clot ['alaqah]; then He created and proportioned.\" And He the Exalted said: \"Did We not create you from a despised fluid [ma' mahin]? Then We placed it in a firm lodging [qararin makin], for a known term [qadar ma'lum].\" And He said: \"Does man [insan] not see that We created him from a sperm-drop [nutfah]? Then at once he is a clear adversary.\" And He said: \"Indeed, We created man [insan] from a sperm-drop [nutfah] mixed [amshaj]...\" Then He mentioned how He made the sperm-drop [nutfah] a clinging clot ['alaqah], and the clinging clot ['alaqah] a chewed lump [mudghah], and the chewed lump [mudghah] bones. He the Exalted said: \"And certainly did We create man [insan] from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop [nutfah] in a firm lodging [qararin makin]. Then We made the sperm-drop [nutfah] into a clinging clot ['alaqah]...\" So the repeated mention of the sperm-drop [nutfah] in the Mighty Book is not for one to merely hear its word and abandon reflection upon its meaning. So look now at the sperm-drop [nutfah]—it is a droplet of foul water; if left for an hour for the air to strike it, it would spoil and become putrid. How did the Lord of lords bring it forth from the loins and the ribs? And how did He bring together the male and the female and cast affection [ulfah] and love [mahabbah] into their hearts [qulub]? And how did He lead them by the chain of love [mahabbah] and desire [shahwah] to union? And how did He extract the sperm-drop [nutfah] from the man by the movement of intercourse? And how did He draw the menstrual blood from the depths of the veins and gather it in the womb? Then how did He create the newborn from the sperm-drop [nutfah] and nourish it with the water of menstruation until it grew, increased, and became large? And how did He make the sperm-drop [nutfah], which is white and radiant, into a red clinging clot ['alaqah]? Then how did He make it a chewed lump [mudghah]? Then how did He divide the parts of the sperm-drop [nutfah], which are equal and similar, into bones, nerves, veins, tendons, and flesh? Then how did He construct from the flesh, nerves, and veins the outward limbs: the roundness of the head, the aperture of hearing, sight, the nose, the mouth, and the rest of the openings? Then He extended the hand and the leg and divided their ends into fingers, and divided the fingers into fingertips? Then how did He construct the inward organs: the heart [qalb], the stomach, the liver, the spleen, the lung, the womb, the bladder, and the intestines—each one with a specific form, a specific measure, for a specific function? Then how did He divide each one of these organs into other divisions? He constructed the eye from seven layers, each layer with a specific attribute and a specific form; if a single layer from them were lost, or an attribute from its attributes were removed, the eye would be incapacitated from sight. If we were to begin describing the wonders [aja'ib] and signs [ayat] in each single one of these organs, lifetimes would not suffice for it. So look now at the bones—they are solid, strong bodies—how did He create them from a lowly sperm-drop [nutfah sakhifah]?</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقد ورد القرآن بالحث على التفكر في هذه الايات كما قال الله تعالى إن في خلق السموات والأرض واختلاف الليل والنهار لآيات لأولي الألباب وكما قال تعالى ومن آياته من أول القرآن إلى آخره فلنذكر كيفية الفكر في بعض الآيات فمن آياته الانسان المخلوق من النطفة وأقرب شيء إليك نفسك وفيك من العجائب الدالة على عظمة الله تعالى ما تنقضي الأعمار في الوقوف على عشر عشيره وأنت غافل عنه فيامن هو غافل عن نفسه وجاهل بها كيف تطمع في معرفة غيرك وقد أمرك الله تعالى بالتدبر في نفسك في كتابه العزيز فقال وفي أنفسكم أفلا تبصرون وذكر أنك مخلوق من نطفة قذرة فقال قتل الإنسان ما أكفره من أي شئ خلقه من نطفة خلقه فقدره ثم السبيل يسره ثم أماته فأقبره ثم إذا شاء أنشره وقال تعالى ومن آياته أن خلقكم من تراب ثم إذا أنتم بشر تنتشرون وقال تعالى ألم يك نطفة من منى يمنى ثم كان علقة فخلق فسوى وقال تعالى ألم نخلقكم من ماء مهين فجعلناه في قرار مكين إلى قدر معلوم وقال أولم ير الإنسان أنا خلقناه من نطفة فإذا هو خصيم مبين وقال إنا خلقنا الإنسان من نطفة أمشاج ثم ذكر كيف جعل النطفة علقة والعلقة مضغة والمضغة عظاما فقال تعالى ولقد خلقنا الإنسان من سلالة من طين ثم جعلناه نطفة في قرار مكين ثم خلقنا النطفة علقة الآية فتكرير ذكر النطفة في الكتاب العزيز ليس ليسمع لفظه ويترك التفكر في معناه فانظر الآن إلى النطفة وهي قطرة من الماء قذرة لو تركت ساعة ليضربها الهواء فسدت وانتنت كيف أخرجها رب الأرباب من الصلب والترائب وكيف جمع بين الذكر والأنثى وألقى الألفة والمحبة في قلوبهم وكيف قادهم بسلسلة المحبة والشهوة الى الاجتماع وكيف استخرج النطفة من الرجل بحركة الوقاع وكيف استجلب دم الحيض من أعماق العروق وجمعه في الرحم ثم كيف خلق المولود من النطفة وسقاه بماء الحيض وغذاه حتى نما وربا وكبر وكيف جعل النطفة وهي بيضاء مشرقة علقة حمراء ثم كيف جعلها مضغة ثم كيف قسم أجزاء النطفة وهي متساوية متشابهة إلى العظام والأعصاب والعروق والأوتار واللحم ثم كيف ركب من اللحوم والأعصاب والعروق الأعضاء الظاهرة فدور الرأس وشق السمع والبصر والأنف والفم وسائر المنافذ ثم مد اليد والرجل وقسم رءوسها بالأصابع وقسم الأصابع بالأنامل ثم كيف ركب الأعضاء الباطنة من القلب والمعدة والكبد والطحال والرئة والرحم والمثانة والأمعاء كل واحد على شكل مخصوص ومقدار مخصوص لعمل مخصوص ثم كيف قسم كل عضو من هذه الأعضاء بأقسام أخر فركب العين من سبع طبقات لكل طبقة وصف مخصوص وهيئة مخصوصة لو فقدت طبقة منها أو زالت صفة من صفاتها تعطلت العين عن الإبصار فلو ذهبنا إلى أن نصف ما في آحاد هذه الأعضاء من العجائب والآيات لانقضي فيه الأعمار فانظر الآن إلى العظام وهي أجسام صلبة قوية كيف خلقها من نطفة سخيفة</div></div></div>"}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.33","h":"0.4","c":"وَمِنْ","d":"wamin","e":"ْnِmَw"},{"b":"0.94","h":"1.24","c":"ءَايَاتِهِ","d":"āyātihi","e":"ٓۦِhِtَٰyāَء"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.16","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"ْnَaʾ"},{"b":"4.1","h":"5.69","c":"خَلَقَ","d":"khalaqa","e":"َqَlَhk"},{"b":"4.8","h":"6.92","c":"لَكُمْ","d":"lakum","e":"mُkَl"},{"b":"6.1","h":"8.56","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِّm"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.12","c":"أَنْفُسِكُمْ","d":"anfusikum","e":"ْmُkِsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"8.4","h":"11.7","c":"أَزْوَاجًا","d":"azwājan","e":"āًjgَٰwْzَaʾ"},{"b":"9.2","h":"13.53","c":"لِتَسْكُنُوا","d":"litaskunū","e":"۟āٓwُnُkْsَtِّl"},{"b":"12.4","h":"16.69","c":"إِلَيْهَا","d":"ilayhā","e":"āَhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"13.4","h":"18.52","c":"وَجَعَلَ","d":"wajaʿala","e":"َlَʿعَjgَw"},{"b":"14.2","h":"19.91","c":"بَيْنَكُمْ","d":"baynakum","e":"mُkَnْyَb"},{"b":"15.8","h":"22.12","c":"مَوَدَّةً","d":"mawaddatan","e":"ًẗَّdَwَّm"},{"b":"16.9","h":"24.95","c":"وَرَحْمَةً","d":"waraḥmatan","e":"ًẗَmْḥَrَw"},{"b":"19.5","h":"28.4","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"20.6","h":"29.8","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"21.1","h":"30.66","c":"ذَلِكَ","d":"dhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhd"},{"b":"22.0","h":"32.22","c":"لَءَايَاتٍ","d":"laāyātin","e":"ٍtَٰyāَءَl"},{"b":"23.2","h":"34.59","c":"لِقَوْمٍ","d":"liqawmin","e":"ٍmْwَqِّl"},{"b":"25.2","h":"37.21","c":"يَتَفَكَّرُونَ","d":"yatafakkarūna","e":"َnwُrَّkَfَtَy"}],"a":{"g":"And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.

That is the upright religion.\" Thus, in the innate disposition [fitra] of man and the evidences of the Quran, there is what suffices from establishing the proof [burhan].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولذلك قال الله تعالى أفي الله شك فاطر السموات والأرض ولهذا بعث الأنبياء صلوات الله عليهم لدعوة الخلق إلى التوحيد ليقولوا لا إله إلا الله وما أمروا أن يقولوا لنا إله وللعالم إله فإن ذلك كان مجبولا في فطرة عقولهم من مبدأ نشؤهم وفي عنفوان شبابهم ولذلك قال عز وجل ولئن سألتهم من خلق السموات والأرض ليقولن الله وقال تعالى: )فأقم وجهك للدين حنيفا فطرة الله التي فطر الناس عليها لا تبديل لخلق الله ذلك الدين القيم( فإذا في فطرة الإنسان وشواهد القرآن ما يغني عن إقامة البرهان</div></div></div>"}},"31":{"w":[{"b":"0.21","h":"0.65","c":"مُنِيبِينَ","d":"munībīna","e":"َnyِbyِnُm"},{"b":"1.4","h":"2.53","c":"إِلَيْهِ","d":"ilayhi","e":"ِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"2.3","h":"3.88","c":"وَاتَّقُوهُ","d":"wa-ittaqūhu","e":"ُhwُqَّtٱَw"},{"b":"3.6","h":"5.95","c":"وَأَقِيمُوا","d":"wa-aqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqَaʾَw"},{"b":"4.6","h":"7.81","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"5.7","h":"9.53","c":"وَلَا","d":"walā","e":"āَlَw"},{"b":"6.3","h":"10.49","c":"تَكُونُوا","d":"takūnū","e":"۟āwُnwُkَt"},{"b":"7.5","h":"12.41","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"7.9","h":"13","c":"الْمُشْرِكِينَ","d":"l-mush'rikīna","e":"َnyِkِrْhsُmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"[Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with Allah"}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.24","h":"0.16","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"َnِm"},{"b":"0.54","h":"0.61","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.32","c":"فَرَّقُوا","d":"farraqū","e":"۟āwُqَّrَf"},{"b":"2.7","h":"4.18","c":"دِينَهُمْ","d":"dīnahum","e":"ْmُhَnyِd"},{"b":"3.8","h":"5.92","c":"وَكَانُوا","d":"wakānū","e":"۟āwُnāَkَw"},{"b":"4.8","h":"7.84","c":"شِيَعًا","d":"shiyaʿan","e":"āًʿعَyِhs"},{"b":"5.9","h":"11.05","c":"كُلُّ","d":"kullu","e":"ُّlُk"},{"b":"6.8","h":"11.9","c":"حِزْبٍ","d":"ḥiz'bin","e":"ٍۭbْzِḥ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"13.9","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"9.3","h":"15.05","c":"لَدَيْهِمْ","d":"ladayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَdَl"},{"b":"10.","h":"16.92","c":"فَرِحُونَ","d":"fariḥūna","e":"َnwُḥِrَf"}],"a":{"g":"[Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has."}},"33":{"w":[{"b":"0.18","h":"0.7","c":"وَإِذَا","d":"wa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.97","c":"مَسَّ","d":"massa","e":"َّsَm"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.07","c":"النَّاسَ","d":"l-nāsa","e":"َsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"3.1","h":"4.89","c":"ضُرٌّ","d":"ḍurrun","e":"ٌّrُḍ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.83","c":"دَعَوْا","d":"daʿaw","e":"۟āْwَʿعَd"},{"b":"5.3","h":"7.98","c":"رَبَّهُمْ","d":"rabbahum","e":"mُhَّbَr"},{"b":"7.1","h":"10.63","c":"مُنِيبِينَ","d":"munībīna","e":"َnyِbyِnُّm"},{"b":"8.3","h":"12.4","c":"إِلَيْهِ","d":"ilayhi","e":"ِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"15.7","h":"13.93","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"17.1","h":"15.48","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"ٓāَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"19.0","h":"15.94","c":"أَذَاقَهُمْ","d":"adhāqahum","e":"mُhَqāَhdَaʾ"},{"b":"21.1","h":"19.93","c":"مِنْهُ","d":"min'hu","e":"ُhْnِّm"},{"b":"21.6","h":"20.93","c":"رَحْمَةً","d":"raḥmatan","e":"ًẗَmْḥَr"},{"b":"22.","h":"22.75","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"23.3","h":"23.8","c":"فَرِيقٌ","d":"farīqun","e":"ٌqyِrَf"},{"b":"25.1","h":"26.34","c":"مِنْهُمْ","d":"min'hum","e":"mُhْnِّm"},{"b":"26.4","h":"44.61","c":"بِرَبِّهِمْ","d":"birabbihim","e":"ْmِhِّbَrِb"},{"b":"27.7","h":"46.92","c":"يُشْرِكُونَ","d":"yush'rikūna","e":"َnwُkِrْhsُy"}],"a":{"g":"And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him.
