But as for he whose scales are light, his refuge will be an abyss. And what can make you know what that is? It is a Fire, intensely hot.\"**\n\nAnd know that none is saved from the peril of the Scales except he who, in this world [al-dunya], holds his soul to account [hasaba] and weighs therein, with the scale [mizan] of the Sacred Law, his deeds, his words, his passing thoughts, and his glances, just as 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: \"Hold yourselves to account before you are held to account, and weigh yourselves before you are weighed.\"\n\nAnd his holding his soul to account is that he repents from every sin before death with a sincere repentance [tawba], and makes up for what he has neglected of his shortcomings in the obligations [fara'id] of God, the Exalted, and he restores wrongfully taken rights, grain by grain, and seeks to be absolved by everyone he has confronted with his tongue, his hand, and the evil of his assumption [su' al-zann] with his heart, by purifying their hearts, until he dies and no wrongful claim or obligatory duty remains upon him. This one enters Paradise without reckoning.\n\nBut if he dies before restoring the wrongfully taken rights, his adversaries will surround him. This one will seize his hand, and this one will grip his forelock, and this one will cling to his collar. This one says, \"You wronged me [zalamtani]!\" And this one says, \"You insulted me!\" And this one says, \"You mocked me!\" And this one says, \"You mentioned me in backbiting [al-ghiba] with what displeased me!\" And this one says, \"You were my neighbor and you were a bad neighbor to me!\" And this one says, \"You dealt with me and you cheated me!\" And this one says, \"You sold to me and you defrauded me and concealed from me the defect in your merchandise!\" And this one says, \"You lied about the price of your goods!\" And this one says, \"You saw me in need while you were wealthy, yet you did not feed me!\" And this one says, \"You found me wronged while you were capable of repelling the wrong from me, yet you appeased the wrongdoer and did not regard me!\"\n\nAnd while you are in that state, with the adversaries having sunk their claws into you and firmly fixed their hands upon your collar, and you are bewildered, perplexed by their multitude—until there remains no one in your lifetime whom you dealt with for a single dirham or sat with in a gathering except that he has a rightful claim against you for a wrong [muzlima] through backbiting, betrayal, or a look with an eye of contempt—and you have become too weak to resist them, and you stretch forth the neck of hope to your Master and Protector, that perhaps He may deliver you from their hands, then the call of the Compeller, majestic is His glory, strikes your hearing: **\"Today, every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today!\"**\n\nAt that, your heart [qalb] is torn out from awe [al-hayba], and your soul [nafs] becomes certain of ruin [al-bawar], and you remember what God, the Exalted, warned you through the tongue of His Messenger, where He said: **\"And never think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror], racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance not returning to them, and their hearts [af'ida] void. And warn the people...\"** the verse.
