No injustice today!\"**\n\nAt that, your heart [qalb] is torn out from awe [al-hayba], and your soul [nafs] becomes certain of ruin [al-bawar], and you remember what God, the Exalted, warned you through the tongue of His Messenger, where He said: **\"And never think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do.
