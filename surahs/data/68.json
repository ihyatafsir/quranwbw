And Allah is the best of planners.\" And He the Exalted has said: \"Indeed, they are planning a plan, and I am planning a plan. So allow time for the disbelievers. Leave them awhile.\" So just as it is not permissible for the neglected servant to infer from the master's neglect of him and enabling him with blessings that the master loves him, rather he should beware that this might be a plan and scheme from him, even though the master did not warn him of his own plan, then how much more must that be in the case of Allah the Exalted with His warning.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>وهذا الغرور علاجه معرفة دلائل الكرامة والهوان إما بالبصيرة أو بالتقليد أما البصيرة فبأن يعرف وجه كون الالتفات إلى شهوات الدنيا مبعد عن الله ووجه كون التباعد عنها مقرباً إلى الله ويدرك ذلك بالإلهام في منازل العارفين والأولياء، وشرحه من جملة علوم المكاشفة ولا يليق بعلم المعاملة \"وأما معرفته بطريق التقليد والتصديق\" فهو أن يؤمن بكتاب الله تعالى ويصدق رسوله وقد قال تعالى \"أيحسبون أن ما نمدهم به من مال وبنين نسارع لهم في الخيرات بل لا يشعرون\" وقال تعالى \"سنستدرجهم من حيث لا يعلمون\" وقال تعالى \"فتحنا عليهم أبواب كل شيء حتى إذا فرحوا بما أوتوا أخذناهم بغتة فإذا هم مبلسون\" وفي تفسير قوله تعالى \"سنستدرجهم من حيث لا يعلمون\" أنهم كلما أحدثوا ذنباً أحدثنا لهم نعمة ليزيد غرورهم وقال تعالى \"إنما نملي لهم ليزدادوا إثماً\" وقال تعالى \"ولا تحسبن الله غافلاً عما يعمل الظالمون إنما يؤخرهم ليوم تشخص فيه الأبصار\" إلى غير ذلك مما ورد في كتاب الله تعالى وسنة رسوله، فمن آمن به تخلص من هذا الغرور فإن منشأ هذا الغرور والجهل بالله وبصفاته، فإن من عرفه لا يأمن مكره ولا يغتر بأمثال هذه الخيالات الفاسدة، وينظر إلى فرعون وهامان وقارون وإلى ملوك الأرض وما جرى لهم كيف أحسن الله إليهم ابتداء ثم دمرهم تدميرا! فقال تعالى \"هل تحس منهم من أحد\" الآية. وقد حذر الله تعالى من مكره واستدراجه فقال \"فلا يأمن مكر الله إلا القوم الخاسرون\" وقال تعالى \"ومكروا مكراً ومكرنا مكراً وهم لا يشعرون\" وقال عز وجل \"ومكروا ومكر الله والله خير الماكرين\" وقال تعالى \"إنهم يكيدون كيداً وأكيد كيداً فمهل الكافرين أمهلهم رويداً\" فكما لا يجوز للعبد المهمل أن يستدل بإهمال السيد إياه وتمكينه من النعم على حب السيد، بل ينبغي أن يحذر أن يكون ذلك مكراً منه وكيداً مع أن السيد لم يحذره مكر نفسه، فبأن يجب ذلك في حق الله تعالى مع تحذيره اس</div></div></div>"}},"45":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.55","c":"وَأُمْلِي","d":"wa-um'lī","e":"àِlْmُaʾَw"},{"b":"0.99","h":"2.46","c":"لَهُمْ","d":"lahum","e":"ْmُhَl"},{"b":"2.0","h":"4.5","c":"إِنَّ","d":"inna","e":"َّnِiʾ"},{"b":"3.1","h":"5.87","c":"كَيْدِي","d":"kaydī","e":"àِdْyَk"},{"b":"4.0","h":"7.48","c":"مَتِينٌ","d":"matīnun","e":"ٌnyِtَm"}],"a":{"g":"And I will give them time.
