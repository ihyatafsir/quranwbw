So He said: \"But as for he who comes to you striving [while he fears [God], from him you are distracted.\" And regarding the other, He said: \"As for he who thinks himself self-sufficient, to him you give attention.\" Likewise, He commanded him to sit with a group, for the Almighty said: \"And when those come to you who believe in Our signs, say, 'Peace be upon you.'\" And He commanded him to turn away from others, saying: \"And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse concerning Our signs, then turn away from them,\" until He said: \"Then do not sit, after the reminder, with the wrongdoing people.\" And God said: \"And restrain yourself with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening.\" So too, expansiveness [inbisat] and intimate boldness [idlal] are permissible from some worshippers [‘ibad] and not from others. Among the expressions of intimate familiarity [uns] is the saying of Moses, peace be upon him: \"It is not but Your trial [fitna]; You send astray with it whom You will and guide whom You will,\" and his statement giving a reason and excuse when it was said to him, \"Go to Pharaoh,\" and he said, \"And upon me is a sin [dhanb],\" and his saying, \"Indeed, I fear that they will deny me and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent,\" and his saying, \"Indeed, we fear that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress.\" This, from someone other than Moses, peace be upon him, would be poor etiquette [su’ al-adab], for the One established in the place of intimate familiarity [uns] is gentle and forbearing. Yet, for Jonah, peace be upon him, less than this was not borne, for he was established in the place of constriction [qabd] and awe [hayba], so he was punished with imprisonment in the belly of the fish—in threefold darkness—and was called out to until the Day of Resurrection: \"If not that a favor from his Lord had reached him, he would have been cast onto the bare shore while blameworthy.\" Al-Hasan said: \"The bare shore [‘ara’] is the Resurrection.\" And our Prophet ﷺ was forbidden from being followed in this, and it was said to him: \"Then be patient for the decree of your Lord and do not be like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed.\"\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"49":{"w":[{"b":"0.05","h":"0.7","c":"لَوْلَا","d":"lawlā","e":"If not"},{"b":"2.2","h":"1.5","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"that"},{"b":"3.2","h":"3.93","c":"تَدَارَكَهُ","d":"tadārakahu","e":"overtook him"},{"b":"4.7","h":"6.77","c":"نِعْمَةٌ","d":"niʿ'matun","e":"a Favor"},{"b":"6.3","h":"9.18","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"from"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.33","c":"رَبِّهِ","d":"rabbihi","e":"his Lord"},{"b":"7.6","h":"11.74","c":"لَنُبِذَ","d":"lanubidha","e":"surely he would have been thrown"},{"b":"8.4","h":"13.08","c":"بِالْعَرَاءِ","d":"bil-ʿarāi","e":"onto (the) naked shore"},{"b":"11.3","h":"16.01","c":"وَهُوَ","d":"wahuwa","e":"while he"},{"b":"11.9","h":"17.15","c":"مَذْمُومٌ","d":"madhmūmun","e":"(was) blamed"}],"a":{"g":"If not that a favor from his Lord overtook him, he would have been thrown onto the naked shore while he was censured.","ihya":"\n        <div class=\"ihya-tafsir-box\" style=\"margin-top: 15px; border-top: 1px solid #eee; padding-top: 10px;\">\n            <h5 style=\"color: #91740c; font-family: Cabin, sans-serif;\">Tafsir Al-Ihya</h5>\n            <div class=\"ihya-arabic\" style=\"font-family: IndoPak; font-size: 18px; text-align: right; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #555;\">\n                فلم يحتمل ليونس عليه السلام ما دون هذا لما أقيم مقام القبض والهيبة، فعوقب بالسجن في بطن الحوت - في ظلمات ثلاث - ونودي عليه إلى يوم القيامة \" لولا أن تداركه نعمة من ربه لنبذ بالعراء وهو مذموم \".\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"ihya-english\" style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; color: #777;\">\n                Indeed, had Yunus, peace be upon him, not endured what was less than this—when the state of being seized [qabd] and awe [hayba] was established in its place—he would have been punished with imprisonment in the belly of the whale, in threefold darkness, and the call would have been proclaimed against him until the Day of Resurrection: \"Had it not been for a grace [ni'ma] from his Lord reaching him, he would have been cast upon the barren shore while blameworthy [madhmun].\"\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        "}},"50":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.75","c":"فَاجْتَبَاهُ","d":"fa-ij'tabāhu","e":"But chose him"},{"b":"1.1","h":"2.82","c":"رَبُّهُ","d":"rabbuhu","e":"his Lord"},{"b":"2.1","h":"4.7","c":"فَجَعَلَهُ","d":"fajaʿalahu","e":"and made him"},{"b":"3.3","h":"7.15","c":"مِنَ","d":"mina","e":"of"},{"b":"3.7","h":"7.87","c":"الصَّالِحِينَ","d":"l-ṣāliḥīna","e":"the righteous"}],"a":{"g":"And his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous."}},"51":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.35","c":"وَإِنْ","d":"wa-in","e":"And indeed"},{"b":"1.2","h":"1.74","c":"يَكَادُ","d":"yakādu","e":"would almost"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.17","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"those who"},{"b":"2.8","h":"4.82","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"disbelieve"},{"b":"3.7","h":"6.4","c":"لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ","d":"layuz'liqūnaka","e":"surely make you slip"},{"b":"5.3","h":"9.42","c":"بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ","d":"bi-abṣārihim","e":"with their eyes"},{"b":"6.9","h":"12.45","c":"لَمَّا","d":"lammā","e":"when"},{"b":"8.1","h":"14.16","c":"سَمِعُوا","d":"samiʿū","e":"they hear"},{"b":"8.8","h":"15.37","c":"الذِّكْرَ","d":"l-dhik'ra","e":"the Message"},{"b":"9.6","h":"16.82","c":"وَيَقُولُونَ","d":"wayaqūlūna","e":"and they say"},{"b":"10.9","h":"19.49","c":"إِنَّهُ","d":"innahu","e":"Indeed he"},{"b":"12.5","h":"21.76","c":"لَمَجْنُونٌ","d":"lamajnūnun","e":"(is) surely mad"}],"a":{"g":"And indeed, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message, and they say, \"Indeed, he is mad.\""}},"52":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"And not"},{"b":"0.61","h":"1.77","c":"هُوَ","d":"huwa","e":"it (is)"},{"b":"1.0","h":"2.65","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"but"},{"b":"1.8","h":"4.24","c":"ذِكْرٌ","d":"dhik'run","e":"a Reminder"},{"b":"2.7","h":"6.01","c":"لِلْعَالَمِينَ","d":"lil'ʿālamīna","e":"to the worlds"}],"a":{"g":"But it is not except a reminder to the worlds."}}}
