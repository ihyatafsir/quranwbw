So He said: \"But as for he who comes to you striving [while he fears [God], from him you are distracted.\" And regarding the other, He said: \"As for he who thinks himself self-sufficient, to him you give attention.\" Likewise, He commanded him to sit with a group, for the Almighty said: \"And when those come to you who believe in Our signs, say, 'Peace be upon you.'\" And He commanded him to turn away from others, saying: \"And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse concerning Our signs, then turn away from them,\" until He said: \"Then do not sit, after the reminder, with the wrongdoing people.\" And God said: \"And restrain yourself with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening.\" So too, expansiveness [inbisat] and intimate boldness [idlal] are permissible from some worshippers [‘ibad] and not from others. Among the expressions of intimate familiarity [uns] is the saying of Moses, peace be upon him: \"It is not but Your trial [fitna]; You send astray with it whom You will and guide whom You will,\" and his statement giving a reason and excuse when it was said to him, \"Go to Pharaoh,\" and he said, \"And upon me is a sin [dhanb],\" and his saying, \"Indeed, I fear that they will deny me and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent,\" and his saying, \"Indeed, we fear that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress.\" This, from someone other than Moses, peace be upon him, would be poor etiquette [su’ al-adab], for the One established in the place of intimate familiarity [uns] is gentle and forbearing. Yet, for Jonah, peace be upon him, less than this was not borne, for he was established in the place of constriction [qabd] and awe [hayba], so he was punished with imprisonment in the belly of the fish—in threefold darkness—and was called out to until the Day of Resurrection: \"If not that a favor from his Lord had reached him, he would have been cast onto the bare shore while blameworthy.\" Al-Hasan said: \"The bare shore [‘ara’] is the Resurrection.\" And our Prophet ﷺ was forbidden from being followed in this, and it was said to him: \"Then be patient for the decree of your Lord and do not be like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed.\"</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;
