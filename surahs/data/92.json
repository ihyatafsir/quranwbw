For the strong man is able to overpower the weak with the slightest charge and easiest exertion, such that he meets no fatigue [i'ya'] or weariness [lughub] in wrestling him, nor is his self [nafs] disturbed, nor is he bewildered, whereas he cannot overpower the strong except with toil, increased effort, and sweat upon the brow. Thus is the wrestling between the motivator of religion [din] and the motivator of base desire [hawa], for it is, in truth, a wrestling between the soldiers of the angels and the soldiers of the devils. Whenever the appetites [shahawat] submit and are subdued, and the motivator of religion [din] gains mastery and takes control, and patience [sabr] is made easy through constant perseverance, that bequeaths the station [maqam] of contentment [rida], as will come in the Book of Contentment.

And when God-consciousness (التقوى) persists and the affirmation (التصديق) of what is in the outcome from the best reward (الحسنى) strengthens, patience (الصبر) becomes facilitated. And for that reason, Allah the Exalted said: 'So as for he who gives and is God-conscious (واتقى) and affirms the best reward (الحسنى), We will facilitate for him the ease (لليسرى).' And an example of this division is the ability of the wrestler over his opponent, for the strong man is able to throw down the weak with the slightest attack and easiest strength such that he does not encounter in his wrestling fatigue nor weariness, nor does his Soul (النفس) become agitated nor bewildered, and he is not able to throw down the strong except with exertion and increased effort and sweat of the brow.

Whenever the desires (الشهوات) submit and are suppressed, and the motivator of religion (الدين) dominates and takes control, and patience (الصبر) becomes facilitated through prolonged persistence, that bequeaths the station of contentment (الرضا) as will come in the Book of Contentment, so contentment (الرضا) is higher than patience (الصبر).</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وينقسم الصبر أيضا باعتبار اليسر والعسر إلى ما يشق على النفس فلا يمكن الدوام عليه إلا بجهد جهيد وتعب شديد ويسمى ذلك تصبرا وإلى ما يكون من غير شدة تعب بل يحصل بأدنى تحامل على النفس ويخص ذلك باسم الصبر وإذا دامت التقوى وقوى التصديق بما في العاقبة من الحسنى تيسر الصبر ولذلك قال تعالى: ﴿ فأما من أعطى واتقى وصدق بالحسنى فسنيسره لليسرى ﴾ {} ومثال هذه القسمة قدرة المصارع على غيره فإن الرجل القوي يقدر على أن يصرع الضعيف بأدنى حملة وأيسر قوة بحيث لا يلقاه في مصارعته إعياء ولا لغوب ولا تضطرب فيه نفسه ولا ينبهر ولا يقوى على أن يصرع الشديد إلا بتعب ومزيد جهد وعرق جبين فهكذا تكون المصارعة بين باعث الدين وباعث الهوى فإنه على التحقيق صراع بين جنود الملائكة وجنود الشياطين ومهما أذعنت الشهوات وانقمعت وتسلط باعث الدين واستولى وتيسر الصبر بطول المواظبة اورث ذلك مقام الرضا كما سياتي في كتاب الرضا فالرضا أعلى من الصبر</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 3: Wonders of the Heart</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And these fluctuations and wonders of the creation of God the Exalted in their fluctuation from where knowledge does not guide to it, none know them except the observers and those who watch over their states with God the Exalted. And the hearts in steadfastness upon the good and the evil and the hesitation between them are three: a heart that has been inhabited by piety (Taqwa) and purified by spiritual discipline (Riyada) and cleansed from the impurities of character traits (Akhlaq), sparks of good from the treasuries of the unseen (Ghayb) and the entrances of the dominion (Malakut) ignite in it, so the intellect (Aql) turns to reflecting upon what has occurred to it to know the subtleties of the good in it and to become aware of the secrets of its benefits, so its aspect is unveiled to it by the light of insight (Basira), so it judges that it must be done, so it urges it upon it and calls it to act by it. And the angel (Malak) looks at the heart and finds it good in its essence, pure by its piety (Taqwa), illuminated by the radiance of the intellect (Aql), inhabited by the lights of knowledge (Ma'rifa), so he sees it suitable to be for him a dwelling and a descent, so at that time he supplies it with unseen troops and guides it to other goodnesses until good leads to good, and likewise perpetually, and his supply with encouragement to good and facilitation of the matter for it does not cease. And to it is the allusion by His saying the Exalted: 'So as for he who gave and was pious (Taqwa) and believed in the best, We will ease him to the ease.' And in such a heart shines the light of the lamp from the niche of lordship (Rububiyya) until the hidden polytheism (Shirk) which is more hidden than the crawling of the black ant on a dark night is not concealed in it, so nothing hidden is concealed from this light, and nothing from the tricks of Satan (Shaytan) deceives it, rather Satan stands and inspires adorned speech as delusion, so it does not pay attention to it. And this heart after its purification from the destructive things becomes, in proximity, inhabited by the saving things which we will mention: gratitude (Shukr), patience (Sabr), fear (Khawf), hope (Raja'), poverty (Faqr), asceticism (Zuhd), love (Mahabbah), contentment (Rida'), longing (Shawq), reliance (Tawakkul), reflection (Tafakkur), self-accounting (Muhasabah), and others. And it is the heart upon which God the Mighty and Majestic has turned His face, and it is the contented heart intended by His saying the Exalted: 'Unquestionably, by the remembrance (Dhikr) of God hearts are contented,' and by His saying the Mighty and Majestic: 'O contented soul (Nafs).'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;

The evidence for this interpretation is many reports about punishing the disobedient and the measures of punishment, and his saying: 'He will be brought out of the Fire whoever had in his heart an atom's weight of faith (Iman)' so how can he be brought out if he did not enter? And from the Quran, His saying: 'Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills' and the exception with will indicates division, and His saying: 'And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, for him is the Fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally' and specifying it with disbelief is arbitrary, and His saying: 'Unquestionably, the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment' and He said: 'And whoever comes with an evil deed - their faces will be overturned into the Fire' so these generalities are in opposition to their generalities, and it is necessary to apply specification and interpretation to both sides because the reports are explicit that the disobedient are punished.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>فإن قلت: فما شبهة المعتزلة والمرجئة وما حجة بطلان قولهم. فأقول شبهتهم عمومات القرآن أما المرجئة فقالوا لا يدخل المؤمن النار وإن أتي بكل المعاصي لقوله عز وجل: ﴿ فمن يؤمن بربه فلا يخاف بخسا ولا رهقا ﴾ {} ولقوله سبحانه وتعالى: ﴿ والذين آمنوا بالله ورسله أولئك هم الصديقون ﴾ {} الآية ولقوله تعالى: ﴿ كلما ألقي فيها فوج سألهم خزنتها. ﴾ {} إلى قوله: ﴿ فكذبنا وقلنا ما نزل الله من شيء ﴾ {} فقوله كلما ألقي فيها فوج عام فينبغي أن يكون من ألقي في النار مكذبا ولقوله تعالى: ﴿ لا يصلاها إلا الأشقى الذي كذب وتولى ﴾ {} وهذا حصر وإثبات ونفي ولقوله تعالى: ﴿ من جاء بالحسنة فله خير منها وهم من فزع يومئذ آمنون ﴾ {} فالإيمان رأس الحسنات ولقوله تعالى: ﴿ والله يحب المحسنين ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ إنا لا نضيع أجر من أحسن عملا ﴾ {} ولا حجة لهم في ذلك فإنه حيث ذكر الإيمان في هذه الآيات أريد به الإيمان مع العمل إذ بينا أن الإيمان قد يطلق ويراد به الإسلام وهو الموافقة بالقلب والقول والعمل ودليل هذا التأويل أخبار كثيرة في معاقبة العاصين ومقادير العقاب وقوله ﭬ: (يخرج من النار من كان في قلبه مثقال ذرة من إيمان) فكيف يخرج إذا لم يدخل ومن القرآن قوله تعالى: ﴿ إن الله لا يغفر أن يشرك به ويغفر ما دون ذلك لمن يشاء ﴾ {} والاستثناء بالمشيئة يدل على الانقسام وقوله تعالى: ﴿ ومن يعص الله ورسوله فإن له نار جهنم خالدين فيها ﴾ {} وتخصيصه بالكفر تحكم وقوله تعالى: ﴿ ألا إن الظالمين في عذاب مقيم ﴾ {} وقال تعالى: ﴿ ومن جاء بالسيئة فكبت وجوههم في النار ﴾ {} فهذه العمومات في معارضة عموماتهم ولا بد من تسليط التخصص والتأويل على الجانبين لأن الأخبار مصرحة بأن العصاة يعذبون</div></div></div>"}},"16":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.1","c":"الَّذِي","d":"alladhī","e":"àِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.73","c":"كَذَّبَ","d":"kadhaba","e":"َbَّhdَk"},{"b":"1.9","h":"3.16","c":"وَتَوَلَّى","d":"watawallā","e":"ٰàَّlَwَtَw"}],"a":{"g":"Who had denied and turned away."}},"17":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.3","c":"وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا","d":"wasayujannabuhā","e":"āَhُbَّnَjgُyَsَw"},{"b":"3","h":"3.06","c":"الْأَتْقَى","d":"l-atqā","e":"àَqْtَaʾْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"But the righteous one will avoid it -"}},"18":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.45","c":"الَّذِي","d":"alladhī","e":"àِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"1.0","h":"2.11","c":"يُؤْتِي","d":"yu'tī","e":"àِtْwʾُy"},{"b":"1.8","h":"3.38","c":"مَالَهُ","d":"mālahu","e":"ۥُhَlāَm"},{"b":"2.9","h":"5.08","c":"يَتَزَكَّى","d":"yatazakkā","e":"ٰàَّkَzَtَy"}],"a":{"g":"[He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself"}},"19":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.8","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"āَmَw"},{"b":"0.63","h":"1.69","c":"لِأَحَدٍ","d":"li-aḥadin","e":"ٍdَḥَaʾِl"},{"b":"1.6","h":"3.16","c":"عِنْدَهُ","d":"ʿindahu","e":"ۥُhَdnِʿع"},{"b":"3.3","h":"5.49","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"4.5","h":"6.49","c":"نِعْمَةٍ","d":"niʿ'matin","e":"ٍẗَmْʿعِّn"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.65","c":"تُجْزَى","d":"tuj'zā","e":"ٰٓàَzْjgُt"}],"a":{"g":"And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded"}},"20":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.25","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"0.54","h":"1.13","c":"ابْتِغَاءَ","d":"ib'tighāa","e":"َءٓāَغِtْbٱ"},{"b":"3.3","h":"3.95","c":"وَجْهِ","d":"wajhi","e":"ِhْjgَw"},{"b":"3.9","h":"4.86","c":"رَبِّهِ","d":"rabbihi","e":"ِhِّbَr"},{"b":"4.9","h":"6.51","c":"الْأَعْلَى","d":"l-aʿlā","e":"ٰàَlْʿعَaʾْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High."}},"21":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"0.03","c":"وَلَسَوْفَ","d":"walasawfa","e":"َfْwَsَlَw"},{"b":"1.1","h":"1.83","c":"يَرْضَى","d":"yarḍā","e":"ٰàَḍْrَy"}],"a":{"g":"And he is going to be satisfied."}}}
