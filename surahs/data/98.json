Therefore, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'How can I enjoy comfort when the possessor of the Trumpet (Soor) has taken the horn in his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow?' [144] Muqatil said: The Trumpet (Soor) is the horn, and that is because Israfil (upon him be peace) has placed his mouth on the horn like the shape of a trumpet, and the circumference of the head of the horn is like the expanse of the heavens and the earth, and he is fixing his gaze toward the Throne (Arsh), waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first blowing. When he blows, those in the heavens and the earth are struck unconscious, meaning every living creature dies from the intensity of the terror, except whom Allah wills, and that is Jibril, Mika'il, Israfil, and the Angel of Death (Malak al-Mawt). Then the Angel of Death is commanded to take the soul (Ruh) of Jibril, then the soul (Ruh) of Mika'il, then the soul (Ruh) of Israfil, then the Angel of Death is commanded and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blowing in the Intermediate State (Barzakh) for forty years. Then Allah, the Exalted, revives Israfil and commands him to blow the second blowing, and that is His saying, the Exalted: 'Then it will be blown into it another time, and behold, they are standing, looking.' [Quran 39:68] On their feet, looking at the Resurrection (Ba'ath). And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'When I was sent, I was sent to the possessor of the Trumpet (Soor), and he brought it to his mouth, advanced one foot and delayed another, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow. Indeed, fear the blowing!' [145] So reflect on the creation and their humiliation, their brokenness, and their submission at the time of being raised, out of fear of this striking unconscious and waiting for it.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.35em; line-height: 2; color: #1a1a1a; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", \"Noorehuda\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #e8e0c8;'>فلو لم يكن بين يدي الموتي إلا هول تلك النفخة لكان ذلك جديرا بأن يتقى فإنها نفخة وصيحة يصعق بها من فى السموات والأرض يعنى يموتون بها إلا من شاء الله وهو بعض الملائكة ولذلك قال رسول الله ﭬ: (كيف أنعم وصاحب الصور قد التقم القرن وحنى الجبهة وأصغى بالأذن متى يؤمر فينفخ[144]) قال مقاتل: الصور هو القرن وذلك أن إسرافيل عليه السلام واضع فاه على القرن كهيئة البوق ودائرة رأس القرن كعرض السموات والأرض وهو شاخص بصره نحو العرش ينتظر متى يؤمر فينفخ النفخة الأولى فإذا نفخ صعق من فى السموات والأرض أى مات كل حيوان من شدة الفزع إلا من شاء الله وهو جبريل وميكائيل وإسرافيل وملك الموت ثم يأمر ملك الموت أن يقبض روح جبريل ثم روح ميكائيل ثم روح إسرافيل ثم يأمر ملك الموت فيموت ثم يلبث الخلق بعد النفخة الأولى فى البرزخ أربعين سنة ثم يحيى الله تعالى إسرافيل فيأمره أن ينفخ الثانية فذلك قوله تعالى: ﴿ ثم نفخ فيه أخرى فإذا هم قيام ينظرون ﴾ {} على أرجلهم ينظرون إلى البعث وقال رسول الله ﭬ: (حين بعث إلى بعث إلى صاحب الصور فأهوى به إلى فيه وقدم رجلا وأخر أخرى ينتظر متى يؤمر بالنفخ ألا فاتقوا النفخة[145]) فتفكر فى الخلائق وذلهم وانكسارهم واستكانتهم عند الانبعاث خوفا من هذه الصعقة وانتظارا لم</div></div></div>"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.2","h":"0.4","c":"وَمَا","d":"wamā","e":"ٓāَmَw"},{"b":"1.8","h":"2.34","c":"أُمِرُوا","d":"umirū","e":"۟āٓwُrِmُaʾ"},{"b":"3.8","h":"4.67","c":"إِلَّا","d":"illā","e":"āَّlِiʾ"},{"b":"4.6","h":"5.98","c":"لِيَعْبُدُوا","d":"liyaʿbudū","e":"۟āwُdُbْʿعَyِl"},{"b":"5.6","h":"7.71","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.11","c":"مُخْلِصِينَ","d":"mukh'liṣīna","e":"َnyِṣِlْhkُm"},{"b":"7.6","h":"11.12","c":"لَهُ","d":"lahu","e":"ُhَl"},{"b":"8.0","h":"11.79","c":"الدِّينَ","d":"l-dīna","e":"َnyِّdlٱ"},{"b":"8.8","h":"13.13","c":"حُنَفَاءَ","d":"ḥunafāa","e":"َءٓāَfَnُḥ"},{"b":"11.3","h":"15.9","c":"وَيُقِيمُوا","d":"wayuqīmū","e":"۟āwُmyِqُyَw"},{"b":"12.3","h":"17.75","c":"الصَّلَوةَ","d":"l-ṣalata","e":"َẗٰwَlَّṣlٱ"},{"b":"13.","h":"19.52","c":"وَيُؤْتُوا","d":"wayu'tū","e":"۟āwُtْwʾُyَw"},{"b":"14.1","h":"20.92","c":"الزَّكَوةَ","d":"l-zakata","e":"َẗٰwَkَّzlٱ"},{"b":"17.1","h":"25.05","c":"وَذَلِكَ","d":"wadhālika","e":"َkِlَٰhdَw"},{"b":"18.1","h":"26.59","c":"دِينُ","d":"dīnu","e":"ُnyِd"},{"b":"18.8","h":"27.69","c":"الْقَيِّمَةِ","d":"l-qayimati","e":"ِẗَmِّyَqْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah.
