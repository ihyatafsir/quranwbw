Its meaning is: that is for the one who observed his Lord [rabbahu], Glorified and Exalted is He, and held his soul [nafs] to account and provisioned for his final return.\n\nAnd God, Exalted is He, has said: \"O you who have believed, when you go forth in the cause of God, investigate...\" And He, Exalted is He, has said: \"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a wicked person with information, investigate...\" And He, Exalted is He, has said: \"And We have certainly created man and We know what his soul [nafs] whispers to him.\" Mentioning that as a warning and an alert to guard against it in the future.\n\nAnd Luqman said: \"Indeed, when the believer sees the consequence, he is safe from regret.\"\n\nAnd Shaddad ibn Aws reported from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: \"The intelligent one [al-kayyis] is he who holds his soul [nafs] to account and works for what is after death, and the fool [al-ahmaq] is he who follows his soul [nafs] in its caprice and makes wishes upon God.\" The hadith \"The intelligent one is he who holds his soul to account and works for what is after death\" has preceded. \"Holds his soul to account\" means: he accounts for it. And the Day of Recompense [yawm al-din] is the Day of Account [yawm al-hisab]. And His saying, \"Are we indeed to be held to account [madinun]?\" means: are we to be called to account [muhasabun]?\n\nAnd Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: \"Hold yourselves to account before you are held to account, and weigh yourselves before you are weighed, and prepare for the Greatest Presentation.\"\n\nAnd he wrote to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: \"Hold your soul [nafs] to account in times of ease before the accounting of hardship.\"\n\nAnd he said to Ka'b: \"How do you find it in the Book of God?\" He said: \"Woe to the judges of the earth from the Judge of the heavens,\" so he struck him with the whip and said: \"Except for the one who holds his soul [nafs] to account.\" So Ka'b said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, it is next to it in the Torah, there is not a letter between them: 'Except for the one who holds his soul to account.'\"\n\nAll of this is an indication to the accounting for the future, as he said: \"he who holds his soul [nafs] to account works for what is after death.\" Its meaning is: weigh matters first, and measure them, and look into them, and reflect upon them, then proceed upon them and undertake them.\n\n**The Second Station: Observation [al-muraqaba]**\n\nIf a person enjoins his soul [nafs] and stipulates upon it what we have mentioned, nothing remains but to observe it [muraqaba] when plunging into deeds and to watch it with a vigilant eye, for if it is left, it transgresses and becomes corrupt.\n\nLet us mention the virtue of observation [muraqaba] then its levels.\n\nAs for the virtue: Gabriel, peace be upon him, asked about excellence [al-ihsan], so he said: \"That you worship God as if you see Him.\" A hadith agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Umar, and it has preceded. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Worship God as if you see Him, for if you do not see Him, indeed He sees you.\" The hadith \"Worship God as if you see Him\" has preceded.\n\nAnd He, Exalted is He, has said: \"Is He who is standing over every soul [nafs] for what it has earned...?\" And He, Exalted is He, has said: \"Does he not know that God sees?\" And God, Exalted is He, has said: \"Indeed, God is ever, over you, an Observer [raqib].\" And He, Exalted is He, has said: \"And those who are to their trusts and their covenant attentive [ra'un], and those who are to their testimonies upright [qa'imun].\"\n\nAnd Ibn al-Mubarak said to a man: \"Observe [raqqib] God, Exalted is He.\" So he asked him about its interpretation, and he said: \"Be always as if you see God, Glorified and Exalted is He.\"\n\nAnd Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: \"If my Master is an Observer [raqib] over me, I care not for other than Him.\"\n\nAnd Abu Uthman al-Maghribi said: \"The best thing a person obliges his soul [nafs] with in this path is accounting [muhasaba] and observation [muraqaba] and governing his action with knowledge [ilm].\"\n\nAnd Ibn Ata said: \"The best of acts of obedience is observing [muraqaba] the Truth in the continuity of moments.\"\n\nAnd al-Jurayri said: \"Our affair is built upon two foundations: that you oblige your soul [nafs] with observation [muraqaba] for God, Glorified and Exalted is He, and that knowledge [ilm] stands established over your outward state.\"\n\nAnd Abu Uthman said: \"Abu Hafs said to me: 'When you sit with the people, be an admonisher to your soul [nafs] and your heart [qalb], and let it not deceive you.'\"</div></div></div>"}}}
