To this, the one who said, \"Coitus interruptus [al-'azl] is one of the two forms of infanticide,\" alluded. Therefore, the one who engages in intercourse is striving to complete what God, Exalted is He, loves to be completed, and the one who turns away is nullifying and wasting what God dislikes to be wasted. And due to God's love [mahabbah] for the survival [baqa'] of souls [al-nufus], He commanded feeding and urged towards it, and He expressed it through the worship of the loan, saying: \"Who is it that will lend God a goodly loan?\"\n\nIf you say: Your statement that the survival of progeny and the soul is beloved [mahbub] implies that their annihilation [fana'] is disliked [makruh] in the sight of God, and this creates a distinction between death [al-mawt] and life [al-hayah] in relation to God's will [iradah]. Yet it is known that everything is by God's will [mashiyyah], and that God is Self-Sufficient [ghani] over all the worlds. So from where is their death distinguished from their life, or their survival from their annihilation, in His sight?\n\nKnow that this statement is true, but a falsehood is intended by it. For what we have mentioned does not contradict attributing all existent things to God's will [iradah]—their good and their evil, their benefit and their harm. However, love [al-mahabbah] and dislike [al-karahiyah] are opposites, and both do not contradict the will [al-iradah]. For many a willed thing is disliked, and many a willed thing is beloved. Disobediences [al-ma'asi] are disliked, and they, despite the dislike, are willed. And acts of obedience [al-ta'at] are willed, and their determined existence is willed, beloved, and pleasing. As for disbelief [al-kufr] and evil [al-sharr], we do not say it is pleasing [mardiy] and beloved [mahbub], but rather it is willed [murad]. And God, Exalted is He, has said: \"Nor is He pleased with disbelief for His servants.\" So how can annihilation [al-fana'] be in relation to God's love [mahabbah] and dislike [karahiyah] like survival [al-baqa']?

Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute.'\" And the news reached Abu Bakr while he was with the Banu Al-Harith ibn Al-Khazraj, so he came and entered upon the Messenger of God. He looked at him, then leaned over him and kissed him, then said, \"May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of God. God Almighty would not make you taste death twice. For by God, the Messenger of God has indeed died [tuwuffiya].\" Then he went out to the people and said, \"O people, whoever was worshipping Muhammad, then Muhammad has died. And whoever was worshipping the Lord of Muhammad, then He is Living [hayy], does not die. God Almighty has said: 'And Muhammad is not but a messenger; messengers have passed before him. So if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels?'\" So it was as if the people had not heard this verse until that day.</div></div></div>"}},"31":{"w":[{"b":"0.06","h":"2.15","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3.36","c":"إِنَّكُمْ","d":"innakum","e":"ْmُkَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"3.0","h":"5.32","c":"يَوْمَ","d":"yawma","e":"َmْwَy"},{"b":"3.6","h":"6.31","c":"الْقِيَامَةِ","d":"l-qiyāmati","e":"ِẗَmَٰyِqْlٱ"},{"b":"4.9","h":"8.29","c":"عِنْدَ","d":"ʿinda","e":"َdnِʿع"},{"b":"6.4","h":"9.75","c":"رَبِّكُمْ","d":"rabbikum","e":"ْmُkِّbَr"},{"b":"7.4","h":"11.52","c":"تَخْتَصِمُونَ","d":"takhtaṣimūna","e":"َnwُmِṣَtْhkَt"}],"a":{"g":"Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute."}},"32":{"w":[{"b":"0.03","h":"1.55","c":"فَمَنْ","d":"faman","e":"ْnَmَf"},{"b":"0.59","h":"2.21","c":"أَظْلَمُ","d":"aẓlamu","e":"ُmَlْẓَaʾ"},{"b":"1.4","h":"3.82","c":"مِمَّنْ","d":"mimman","e":"nَّmِm"},{"b":"4.3","h":"5.57","c":"كَذَبَ","d":"kadhaba","e":"َbَhdَk"},{"b":"4.9","h":"6.45","c":"عَلَى","d":"ʿalā","e":"àَlَʿع"},{"b":"5.4","h":"7.17","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"8.51","c":"وَكَذَّبَ","d":"wakadhaba","e":"َbَّhdَkَw"},{"b":"7.3","h":"10.11","c":"بِالصِّدْقِ","d":"bil-ṣid'qi","e":"ِqْdِّṣlٱِb"},{"b":"8.3","h":"11.75","c":"إِذْ","d":"idh","e":"ْhdِiʾ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"12.31","c":"جَاءَهُ","d":"jāahu","e":"ٓۥُhَءٓāَjg"},{"b":"11.7","h":"17.45","c":"أَلَيْسَ","d":"alaysa","e":"َsْyَlَaʾ"},{"b":"12.4","h":"18.37","c":"فِي","d":"fī","e":"àِf"},{"b":"12.8","h":"19.08","c":"جَهَنَّمَ","d":"jahannama","e":"َmَّnَhَjg"},{"b":"14.7","h":"21.07","c":"مَثْوًى","d":"mathwan","e":"àًwْhtَm"},{"b":"15.5","h":"21.99","c":"لِلْكَافِرِينَ","d":"lil'kāfirīna","e":"َnyِrِfَٰkْlِّl"}],"a":{"g":"So who is more unjust than one who lies about Allah and denies the truth when it has come to him?

For the meaning of Oneness [tawhid] is that there is no agent [fa'il] except God, Exalted is He; and the meaning of the Sacred Law [shar'] is affirming actions [af'al] for the servants [ibad]. If the servant [abd] is an agent [fa'il], then how can God, Exalted is He, be the agent [fa'il]? And if God, Exalted is He, is the agent [fa'il], then how can the servant [abd] be an agent [fa'il]? An effect [maf'ul] between two agents [fa'ilayn] is not comprehensible?\n\nThen I say: Yes, that is not comprehensible if the agent [fa'il] has a single meaning. But if it has two meanings, and the name is a general term [mujmal] oscillating between them, there is no contradiction. Just as it is said: 'The commander [amir] killed so-and-so,' and it is said: 'The executioner [jallad] killed him.' However, the commander [amir] is a killer [qatil] in one sense, and the executioner [jallad] is a killer [qatil] in another sense. Likewise, the servant [abd] is an agent [fa'il] in one sense, and God, Mighty and Majestic, is an agent [fa'il] in another sense.\n\nFor the meaning of God, Exalted is He, being the agent [fa'il] is that He is the Inventor [mukhtari'], the Bringer-into-Being [mawjid]. And the meaning of the servant [abd] being an agent [fa'il] is that he is the locus [mahall] in which power [qudra] was created after will [irada] was created in him, after knowledge [ilm] was created in him. Thus, power [qudra] became connected to will [irada], and movement [haraka] became connected to power [qudra] with the connection of a condition [shart] to what is conditioned [mashrut]. And it became connected to the power [qudra] of God with the connection of an effect [ma'lul] to its cause [illa] and the connection of the invented [mukhtara'] to the Inventor [mukhtari'].\n\nEverything that has a connection to a power [qudra], then the locus [mahall] of that power [qudra] is called an agent [fa'il] for it, however the connection may be. Just as the executioner [jallad] is called a killer [qatil] and the commander [amir] is called a killer [qatil], because the killing [qatl] was connected to the power [qudra] of both of them, but in two different ways. Therefore, it was called an action [fi'l] for both of them. Likewise is the connection of the foreordained things [maqdurat] to the two powers [qudratayn].\n\nAnd due to the correspondence and alignment of this, God, Exalted is He, ascribed the actions [af'al] in the Qur'an at one time to the angels [mala'ika] and at another time to the servants [ibad], and He ascribed the very same actions [af'al] at another time to Himself. Thus, God, Exalted is He, said concerning death [mawt]: \"Say, 'The Angel of Death [malak al-mawt] takes you'\" (32:11).
