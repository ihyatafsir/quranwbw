To this, the one who said, \"Coitus interruptus [al-'azl] is one of the two forms of infanticide,\" alluded. Therefore, the one who engages in intercourse is striving to complete what God, Exalted is He, loves to be completed, and the one who turns away is nullifying and wasting what God dislikes to be wasted. And due to God's love [mahabbah] for the survival [baqa'] of souls [al-nufus], He commanded feeding and urged towards it, and He expressed it through the worship of the loan, saying: \"Who is it that will lend God a goodly loan?\"\n\nIf you say: Your statement that the survival of progeny and the soul is beloved [mahbub] implies that their annihilation [fana'] is disliked [makruh] in the sight of God, and this creates a distinction between death [al-mawt] and life [al-hayah] in relation to God's will [iradah]. Yet it is known that everything is by God's will [mashiyyah], and that God is Self-Sufficient [ghani] over all the worlds. So from where is their death distinguished from their life, or their survival from their annihilation, in His sight?\n\nKnow that this statement is true, but a falsehood is intended by it. For what we have mentioned does not contradict attributing all existent things to God's will [iradah]—their good and their evil, their benefit and their harm. However, love [al-mahabbah] and dislike [al-karahiyah] are opposites, and both do not contradict the will [al-iradah]. For many a willed thing is disliked, and many a willed thing is beloved. Disobediences [al-ma'asi] are disliked, and they, despite the dislike, are willed. And acts of obedience [al-ta'at] are willed, and their determined existence is willed, beloved, and pleasing. As for disbelief [al-kufr] and evil [al-sharr], we do not say it is pleasing [mardiy] and beloved [mahbub], but rather it is willed [murad]. And God, Exalted is He, has said: \"Nor is He pleased with disbelief for His servants.\" So how can annihilation [al-fana'] be in relation to God's love [mahabbah] and dislike [karahiyah] like survival [al-baqa']? For He, Exalted is He, says: \"I have not hesitated in anything as I hesitate in seizing the soul of My believing servant. He dislikes death, and I dislike to distress him, yet death is inevitable for him.\" His statement, \"death is inevitable for him,\" is an allusion to the precedence of the will [al-iradah] and the decree [al-taqdir] mentioned in His saying, Exalted is He: \"We have decreed death among you,\" and in His saying, Exalted is He: \"Who created death and life.\" And there is no contradiction between His saying, Exalted is He: \"We have decreed death among you,\" and His saying: \"and I dislike to distress him.\" However, clarifying the truth in this requires verifying the meaning of will [al-iradah], love [al-mahabbah], and dislike [al-karahiyah], and elucidating their realities [haqa'iq].</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>ولذلك عظم الشرع الأمر في القتل للأولاد وفي الوأد لأنه منع لتمام الوجود وإليه أشار من قال العزل أحد الوأدين فالناكح ساع في إتمام ما أحب الله تعالى تمامه والمعرض معطل ومضيع لما كره الله ضياعه ولأجل محبة الله تعالى لبقاء النفوس أمر بالإطعام وحث عليه وعبر عنه بعبادة القرض فقال من ذا الذي يقرض الله قرضا حسنا فإن قلت قولك إن بقاء النسل والنفس محبوب يوهم أن فناءها مكروه عند الله وهو فرق بين الموت والحياة بالإضافة إلى إرادة الله تعالى ومعلوم أن الكل بمشيئة الله وإن الله غني عن العالمين فمن أين يتميز عنده موتهم عن حياتهم أو بقاؤهم عن فنائهم فاعلم أن هذه الكلمة حق أريد بها باطل فإن ما ذكرناه لا ينافي إضافة الكائنات كلها إلى إرادة الله خيرها وشرها ونفعها وضرها ولكن المحبة والكراهية يتضادان وكلاهما لا يضادان الإرادة فرب مراد مكروه ورب مراد محبوب فالمعاصي مكروهة وهي مع الكراهة مرادة والطاعات مرادة ومزمع كونها مرادة محبوبة ومرضية أما الكفر والشر فلا نقول إنه مرضي ومحبوب بل هو مراد. وقد قال الله تعالى ولا يرضى لعباده الكفر فكيف يكون الفناء بالإضافة إلى محبة الله وكراهته كالبقاء فإنه تعالى يقول (ما ترددت في شيء كترددي في قبض روح عبدي المسلم هو يكره الموت وأنا أكره مساءته ولا بد له من الموت) فقوله لا بد له من الموت إشارة إلى سبق الإرادة والتقدير المذكور في قوله تعالى (نحن قدرنا بينكم الموت) وفي قوله تعالى (الذي خلق الموت والحياة) ولا مناقضة بين قوله تعالى (نحن قدرنا بينكم الموت) وبين قوله (وأنا أكره مساءته) ولكن إيضاح الحق في هذا يستدعي تحقيق معنى الإرادة والمحبة والكراهة وبيان حقائقها.</div></div></div>"}},"8":{"w":[{"b":"0.2","h":"0.05","c":"وَإِذَا","d":"wa-idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾَw"},{"b":"1.0","h":"1.01","c":"مَسَّ","d":"massa","e":"َّsَm"},{"b":"1.6","h":"1.97","c":"الْإِنْسَانَ","d":"l-insāna","e":"َnَٰsnِiʾْlٱ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"4.36","c":"ضُرٌّ","d":"ḍurrun","e":"ٌّrُḍ"},{"b":"5.4","h":"6.25","c":"دَعَا","d":"daʿā","e":"āَʿعَd"},{"b":"6.0","h":"7.18","c":"رَبَّهُ","d":"rabbahu","e":"ۥُhَّbَr"},{"b":"7.0","h":"8.75","c":"مُنِيبًا","d":"munīban","e":"āًbyِnُm"},{"b":"8.1","h":"10.13","c":"إِلَيْهِ","d":"ilayhi","e":"ِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"14.6","h":"11.25","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"16.0","h":"12.55","c":"إِذَا","d":"idhā","e":"āَhdِiʾ"},{"b":"16.6","h":"13.35","c":"خَوَّلَهُ","d":"khawwalahu","e":"ۥُhَlَّwَhk"},{"b":"17.9","h":"15.27","c":"نِعْمَةً","d":"niʿ'matan","e":"ًẗَmْʿعِn"},{"b":"19.6","h":"17.16","c":"مِنْهُ","d":"min'hu","e":"ُhْnِّm"},{"b":"20.1","h":"17.97","c":"نَسِيَ","d":"nasiya","e":"َàِsَn"},{"b":"20.7","h":"18.82","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"21.1","h":"19.39","c":"كَانَ","d":"kāna","e":"َnāَk"},{"b":"21.7","h":"20.36","c":"يَدْعُوا","d":"yadʿū","e":"۟āٓwُʿعْdَy"},{"b":"23.9","h":"22.49","c":"إِلَيْهِ","d":"ilayhi","e":"ِhْyَlِiʾ"},{"b":"31.6","h":"39.22","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"nِm"},{"b":"32.8","h":"40.22","c":"قَبْلُ","d":"qablu","e":"ُlْbَq"},{"b":"33.5","h":"41.19","c":"وَجَعَلَ","d":"wajaʿala","e":"َlَʿعَjgَw"},{"b":"34.1","h":"42.04","c":"لِلَّهِ","d":"lillahi","e":"ِhَّlِl"},{"b":"35.3","h":"43.81","c":"أَنْدَادًا","d":"andādan","e":"āًdāَdnَaʾ"},{"b":"36.8","h":"45.49","c":"لِيُضِلَّ","d":"liyuḍilla","e":"َّlِḍُyِّl"},{"b":"38.2","h":"47.36","c":"عَنْ","d":"ʿan","e":"nَʿع"},{"b":"39.5","h":"48.49","c":"سَبِيلِهِ","d":"sabīlihi","e":"ۦِhِlyِbَs"},{"b":"41.1","h":"52.6","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"ْlُq"},{"b":"41.5","h":"52.94","c":"تَمَتَّعْ","d":"tamattaʿ","e":"ْʿعَّtَmَt"},{"b":"42.5","h":"54.39","c":"بِكُفْرِكَ","d":"bikuf'rika","e":"َkِrْfُkِb"},{"b":"43.6","h":"55.95","c":"قَلِيلًا","d":"qalīlan","e":"āًlyِlَq"},{"b":"45.4","h":"59.4","c":"إِنَّكَ","d":"innaka","e":"َkَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"46.8","h":"60.95","c":"مِنْ","d":"min","e":"ْnِm"},{"b":"47.2","h":"61.53","c":"أَصْحَابِ","d":"aṣḥābi","e":"ِbَٰḥْṣَaʾ"},{"b":"48.3","h":"63.25","c":"النَّارِ","d":"l-nāri","e":"ِrāَّnlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"And when adversity touches man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him [alone]; then when He bestows on him a favor from Himself, he forgets Him whom he called upon before, and he attributes to Allah equals to mislead [people] from His way.

To exhaust all the verses regarding the station of patience [sabr] would be lengthy.\n\nAs for the narrations, He (peace be upon him) said: \"Patience [sabr] is half of faith [iman],\" according to what will come regarding the aspect of it being half. And He (peace be upon him) said: \"The least of what you have been given is certainty [yaqin] and the resolve of patience [sabr]. Whoever is given his share of these two will not care what he missed of night prayer and daytime fasting. And for you to be patient [tasbiroo] upon what you are upon is more beloved to me than for every one of you to meet me with the like of the deeds of all of you. But I fear that the world [dunya] will be opened up to you after me, so you will deny one another, and the people of the heavens will deny you.

The second is the successors [al-khulafa'], the kings, and the sultans, and their rule over the elite and the common people all together, but over their outward state only, not over their inward state. The third is the knowers of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and of His religion, who are the inheritors of the Prophets, and their rule is over the inward state of the elite only, and the understanding of the common people does not rise to benefit from them, nor does their power extend to managing their outward states through obligation, prevention, and legislation. The fourth is the preachers [al-wu'az], and their rule is over the inward states of the common people only. The most noble of these four crafts after prophethood is imparting knowledge [ifadat al-'ilm] and refining the souls [nufus] of people from the blameworthy, destructive character traits and guiding them to the praiseworthy, felicitous character traits, and this is what is intended by teaching. We only said that this is better than all other professions and crafts because the nobility of crafts is known by three matters: either by consideration of the innate faculty [gharizah] by which one attains its knowledge, like the superiority of intellectual faculties over linguistic ones, for wisdom [hikmah] is perceived by the intellect [al-'aql] and language by hearing, and the intellect is nobler than hearing. Or by looking at the generality of benefit, like the superiority of agriculture over goldsmithing. Or by observing the locus [mahall] in which the management occurs, like the superiority of goldsmithing over tanning, for the locus of one is gold and the locus of the other is the skin of a dead animal. And it is not hidden that the religious sciences, which are the jurisprudence [fiqh] of the path to the Hereafter, are only attained by the perfection of the intellect and the clarity of intelligence, and the intellect is the noblest of human attributes, as its clarification will come later, for by it the trust [amanah] of God is accepted and by it one attains proximity to God, Glorified is He. As for the generality of benefit, there is no doubt in it, for its benefit and its fruit is the felicity [sa'adah] of the Hereafter. As for the nobility of the locus, how can it be hidden, when the teacher manages the hearts [qulub] of humans and their souls [nufus], and the noblest existent on earth is the human species, and the noblest part of the essences [jawhar] of a human is his heart, and the teacher is occupied with perfecting it, polishing it, purifying it, and leading it to proximity [qurb] to God, Mighty and Majestic is He. So teaching knowledge is, from one aspect, worship ['ibadah] for God, Exalted is He, and from another aspect, vicegerency [khilafah] for God, Exalted is He, and it is among the greatest vicegerencies of God, for God, Exalted is He, has opened upon the heart of the knower [al-'alim] the knowledge which is His most specific attribute, so he is like the treasurer for the most precious of His treasuries. Then he is permitted to spend from it upon everyone in need of it. So what rank is greater than the servant being an intermediary between his Lord, Glorified is He, and His creation in bringing them nearer to God and leading them to the Garden of Refuge? May God make us among them by His grace, and may God send blessings upon every chosen servant.\n\n**The Second Chapter: On the Praiseworthy and Blameworthy Knowledge, Their Divisions and Their Rulings, and in it is a clarification of what is an individual obligation [fard 'ayn] and what is a communal obligation [fard kifayah], and a clarification of the position of speech [kalam] and jurisprudence [fiqh] within the knowledge of the religion—to what limit it is—and the superiority of the knowledge of the Hereafter.**\n\n**Clarification of the Knowledge Which is an Individual Obligation**\n\nThe Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.\" And he also said, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Seek knowledge, even if it is in China.\" And the people differed regarding the knowledge which is an obligation upon every Muslim, so they split into more than twenty sects concerning it, and we will not prolong by transmitting the details. But its essence is that every group applied the obligation to the knowledge they were engaged in. So the theologians [al-mutakallimun] said: It is the knowledge of theological discourse ['ilm al-kalam], for by it monotheism [al-tawhid] is realized and the Essence of God, Glorified is He, and His attributes are known. And the jurists [al-fuqaha'] said: It is the knowledge of jurisprudence ['ilm al-fiqh], for by it the acts of worship ['ibadat], the lawful [halal] and the prohibited [haram], and what is forbidden and what is permitted in transactions are known, and they meant by it what individuals need, excluding rare occurrences. And the exegetes [al-mufassirun] and the hadith scholars [al-muhaddithun] said: It is the knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah, for by them one attains all the sciences. And the Sufis [al-mutasawwifah] said: What is intended by it is this knowledge. So some of them said: It is the knowledge of the servant of his state [hal] and his station [maqam] from God, Mighty and Majestic is He. And some of them said: It is knowledge of sincerity [ikhlas] and the diseases of the souls [afat al-nufus] and distinguishing the prompting of the angel from the prompting of the devil. And some of them said: It is the knowledge of the inward [al-batin], and that is obligatory upon specific people who are its people, and they diverted the wording from its generality. And Abu Talib al-Makki said: It is the knowledge of what the hadith which contains the foundations of Islam comprises, and it is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: \"Islam is built upon five: the testimony that there is no god but God...\" to the end of the hadith. Because the obligation is these five, so knowledge of the manner of acting upon them and the manner of their obligation becomes obligatory. And what the accomplished one should be decisive about and have no doubt in is what we will mention, and it is that knowledge, as we presented in the introduction of the book, is divided into the knowledge of transaction ['ilm al-mu'amalah] and the knowledge of unveiling ['ilm al-mukashafah], and what is intended by this knowledge is nothing but the knowledge of transaction. And the transaction which the rational, mature servant is charged to act upon is of three kinds: belief [i'tiqad], action [fi'l], and abstention [tark]. So when the rational man reaches maturity... and He, Exalted is He, said: \"So who is more unjust than one who lies about God and denies the truth when it has come to him?\" (Az-Zumar: 32)</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;

For the meaning of Oneness [tawhid] is that there is no agent [fa'il] except God, Exalted is He; and the meaning of the Sacred Law [shar'] is affirming actions [af'al] for the servants [ibad]. If the servant [abd] is an agent [fa'il], then how can God, Exalted is He, be the agent [fa'il]? And if God, Exalted is He, is the agent [fa'il], then how can the servant [abd] be an agent [fa'il]? An effect [maf'ul] between two agents [fa'ilayn] is not comprehensible?\n\nThen I say: Yes, that is not comprehensible if the agent [fa'il] has a single meaning. But if it has two meanings, and the name is a general term [mujmal] oscillating between them, there is no contradiction. Just as it is said: 'The commander [amir] killed so-and-so,' and it is said: 'The executioner [jallad] killed him.' However, the commander [amir] is a killer [qatil] in one sense, and the executioner [jallad] is a killer [qatil] in another sense. Likewise, the servant [abd] is an agent [fa'il] in one sense, and God, Mighty and Majestic, is an agent [fa'il] in another sense.\n\nFor the meaning of God, Exalted is He, being the agent [fa'il] is that He is the Inventor [mukhtari'], the Bringer-into-Being [mawjid]. And the meaning of the servant [abd] being an agent [fa'il] is that he is the locus [mahall] in which power [qudra] was created after will [irada] was created in him, after knowledge [ilm] was created in him. Thus, power [qudra] became connected to will [irada], and movement [haraka] became connected to power [qudra] with the connection of a condition [shart] to what is conditioned [mashrut]. And it became connected to the power [qudra] of God with the connection of an effect [ma'lul] to its cause [illa] and the connection of the invented [mukhtara'] to the Inventor [mukhtari'].\n\nEverything that has a connection to a power [qudra], then the locus [mahall] of that power [qudra] is called an agent [fa'il] for it, however the connection may be. Just as the executioner [jallad] is called a killer [qatil] and the commander [amir] is called a killer [qatil], because the killing [qatl] was connected to the power [qudra] of both of them, but in two different ways. Therefore, it was called an action [fi'l] for both of them. Likewise is the connection of the foreordained things [maqdurat] to the two powers [qudratayn].\n\nAnd due to the correspondence and alignment of this, God, Exalted is He, ascribed the actions [af'al] in the Qur'an at one time to the angels [mala'ika] and at another time to the servants [ibad], and He ascribed the very same actions [af'al] at another time to Himself. Thus, God, Exalted is He, said concerning death [mawt]: \"Say, 'The Angel of Death [malak al-mawt] takes you'\" (32:11).

Then Satan says to him: \"How could your repentance possibly be accepted?\" Thus, he despairs [yaqnaṭu] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is incumbent to suppress that despair [al-qanūṭ] with hope [ar-rajā'], and to remember: \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins [adh-dhunūb],\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair [lā taqnaṭū] of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And return [in repentance] to your Lord.'\" He commanded them to return [al-inābah]. And He, the Exalted, says: \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\" So, if one anticipates forgiveness alongside repentance, then he is a true hopeful one [rājin].

Then Satan says to him: \"How could your repentance possibly be accepted?\" Thus, he despairs [yaqnaṭu] of the mercy of Allah, the Exalted. At this point, it is incumbent to suppress that despair [al-qanūṭ] with hope [ar-rajā'], and to remember: \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins [adh-dhunūb],\" and that Allah is Generous, accepting repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. Allah, the Exalted, says: \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair [lā taqnaṭū] of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And return [in repentance] to your Lord.'\" He commanded them to return [al-inābah]. And He, the Exalted, says: \"And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\" So, if one anticipates forgiveness alongside repentance, then he is a true hopeful one [rājin].
