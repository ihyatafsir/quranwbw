So to break it before the limit of its maturity, not in a manner by which His servants may benefit, is a contravention of the intended wisdom [maqsud al-hikmah] and a deviation from justice [al-'adl]. For if one has a sound purpose [gharad sahih], then that is permissible for him, since the tree and the animal were made a ransom [fida'] for the purposes of man. For they are both perishable, destined for ruin. So the perishing of the baser for the survival of the nobler for a period is closer to justice than wasting them both. And to this is the allusion in His, the Exalted's, saying: \"And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, all from Him.\" [45:13]. Yes, if one breaks that which is the property [mulk] of another, then he is also an oppressor [zalim], even if he is in need. For every single tree does not suffice for the needs of all the servants of Allah, but suffices for a single need. And if one person were to claim exclusive right to it without any preponderant reason [tarjihan] or specific claim [ikhtisas], it would be injustice. So the one with the specific claim is he who obtained the seed and placed it in the earth and channeled water to it and undertook its care; he is more entitled to it than others, and his claim is thereby established. If it grew in barren land [mawat al-ard] without human effort, then the claim belongs to the one who planted it or to the one who sowed it. Otherwise, another specific claim must be sought, and that is precedence in taking it [al-sabuq ila akhdhi-hi]; for the one who is first has the specific quality of precedence. So justice is that he be the most entitled to it. And the poor have expressed this preponderance as ownership [mulk], and this is purely metaphorical [majaz mahd], for there is no ownership except for the King of Kings [Malik al-Muluk] to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. How can a servant be an owner when he himself does not own his own self, but is rather owned by another? Indeed, creation are the servants of Allah, and the earth is the table [ma'idah] of Allah, and He has permitted them to eat from His table according to their need, like a king who sets a table for his servants. So if one takes a morsel with his right hand and encloses it within his fist, and another servant comes and wishes to snatch it from his hand, he cannot be allowed to do so—not because the morsel has become his property by taking it with the hand, for the hand and the owner of the hand are also owned—but because each specific morsel does not suffice for the need of every servant. So justice in allocation lies in the occurrence of some form of preponderance and specific claim. The taking establishes a specific claim by which the servant is singled out, and thus one who cannot present such a claim is prevented from competing with him. This is how you should understand the command of Allah concerning His servants. And for this reason We say: Whoever takes from the wealth of the world [amwal al-dunya] more than his need and hoards it and withholds it, while among the servants of Allah are those who are in need of it, he is an oppressor, and he is among those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah [sabil Allah]. And the way of Allah is obedience to Him, and the provision for creation in His obedience is the wealth of the world, for by it their necessities are repelled and their needs are lifted.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وأما الشجر فإنه خلقه الله تعالى وخلق له العروق وساق إليه الماء وخلق فيه قوة الاغتذاء والنماء ليبلغ منتهى نشوه فينتفع به عباده فكسره قبل منتهى نشوة لا على وجه ينتفع به عباده مخالفة لمقصود الحكمة وعدول عن العدل فإن كان له غرض صحيح فله ذلك إذ الشجر والحيوان جعلا فداء لأغراض الإنسان فإنهما جميعا فانيان هالكان فإفناء الأخس في بقاء الأشرف مدة ما أقرب إلى العدل من تضييعهما جميعا وإليه الإشارة بقوله تعالى: ﴿ وسخر لكم ما في السموات وما في الأرض جميعا منه ﴾ نعم إذا كسر ذلك من ملك غيره فهو ظالم أيضا وإن كان محتاجا لأن كل شجرة بعينها لاتفى بحاجات عباد الله كلهم بل تفى بحاجة واحدة ولو خصص واحد بها من غير رجحان واختصاص كان ظلما فصاحب الاختصاص هو الذى حصل البذر ووضعه في الأرض وساق إليه الماء وقام بالتعهد فهو أولى به من غيره فيرجع جانبه بذلك، فإن نبت ذلك في موات الأرض لا بسعى آدمى اختص بمغرسة أو بغرسه فلا بد من طلب اختصاص آخر وهو السبق إلى أخذه فللسابق خاصية السبق. فالعدل هو أن يكون أولى به، وعبر الفقراء عن هذا الترجيح بالملك، وهو مجاز محض، إذ لا ملك إلا لملك الملوك الذى له ما في السموات والأرض وكيف يكون العبد مالكا وهو في نفسه ليس يملك نفسه بل هو ملك غيره، نعم الخلق عباد الله والأرض مائدة الله وقد أذن لهم في الأكل من مائدته بقدر حاجتهم كالملك ينصب مائدة لعبيده، فمن أخذ لقمة بيمينه واحتوت عليها براجمه فجاء عبد آخر وأراد انتزاعها من يده لم يمكن منه لا لأن اللقمة صارت ملكا له بالأخذ باليد فإن اليد وصاحب اليد أيضا مملوك ولكن إذا كانت كل لقمة بعينها لا تفى بحاجة كل العبيد فالعدل في التخصيص عند حصول ضرب من الترجيح والاختصاص والأخذ اختصاص ينفرد به العبد فمنع من لا يدلى بذلك الاختصاص عن مزاحمته فهكذا ينبغى أن تفهم أمر الله في في عباده ولذلك نقول من أخذ من أموال الدنيا أكثر من حاجته وكنزه وأمسكه وفي عباد الله من يحتاج إليه فهو ظالم وهو من الذين يكنزون الذهب والفضة ولا ينفقونها في سبيل الله وإنما سبيل الله طاعته وزاد الخلق في طاعته أموال الدنيا، إذ بها تندفع ضروراتهم وترتفع حاجاتهم.</div></div></div>"}},"14":{"w":[{"b":"0.04","h":"0.35","c":"قُلْ","d":"qul","e":"lُq"},{"b":"0.49","h":"0.51","c":"لِلَّذِينَ","d":"lilladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlِّl"},{"b":"1.6","h":"2.99","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.98","c":"يَغْفِرُوا","d":"yaghfirū","e":"۟āwُrِfْغَy"},{"b":"3.7","h":"6.98","c":"لِلَّذِينَ","d":"lilladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlِl"},{"b":"4.9","h":"9.07","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"5.3","h":"9.87","c":"يَرْجُونَ","d":"yarjūna","e":"َnwُjgْrَy"},{"b":"6.4","h":"11.85","c":"أَيَّامَ","d":"ayyāma","e":"َmāَّyَaʾ"},{"b":"7.3","h":"13.72","c":"اللَّهِ","d":"l-lahi","e":"ِhَّllٱ"},{"b":"8.3","h":"15.32","c":"لِيَجْزِيَ","d":"liyajziya","e":"َàِzْjgَyِl"},{"b":"9.2","h":"17.05","c":"قَوْمًا","d":"qawman","e":"āًۢmْwَq"},{"b":"10.6","h":"19.07","c":"بِمَا","d":"bimā","e":"āَmِb"},{"b":"11.2","h":"20.21","c":"كَانُوا","d":"kānū","e":"۟āwُnāَk"},{"b":"12.1","h":"21.91","c":"يَكْسِبُونَ","d":"yaksibūna","e":"َnwُbِsْkَy"}],"a":{"g":"Say, [O Muhammad], to those who have believed that they [should] forgive those who expect not the days of Allah so that He may recompense a people for what they used to earn."}},"15":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"0.1","c":"مَنْ","d":"man","e":"ْnَm"},{"b":"0.42","h":"0.55","c":"عَمِلَ","d":"ʿamila","e":"َlِmَʿع"},{"b":"1","h":"1.7","c":"صَالِحًا","d":"ṣāliḥan","e":"āًḥِlَٰṣ"},{"b":"2.6","h":"4.16","c":"فَلِنَفْسِهِ","d":"falinafsihi","e":"ۦِhِsْfَnِlَf"},{"b":"4.2","h":"8.2","c":"وَمَنْ","d":"waman","e":"ْnَmَw"},{"b":"4.7","h":"9.15","c":"أَسَاءَ","d":"asāa","e":"َءٓāَsَaʾ"},{"b":"7.1","h":"11.43","c":"فَعَلَيْهَا","d":"faʿalayhā","e":"āَhْyَlَʿعَf"},{"b":"8.9","h":"16.1","c":"ثُمَّ","d":"thumma","e":"َّmُht"},{"b":"10.1","h":"17.68","c":"إِلَى","d":"ilā","e":"ٰàَlِiʾ"},{"b":"10.7","h":"18.7","c":"رَبِّكُمْ","d":"rabbikum","e":"ْmُkِّbَr"},{"b":"11.9","h":"20.81","c":"تُرْجَعُونَ","d":"tur'jaʿūna","e":"َnwُʿعَjgْrُt"}],"a":{"g":"Whoever does a good deed - it is for himself; and whoever does evil - it is against the self.

And you remember what God, exalted is He, warned you through the tongue of His Messenger, where He said: (They said: \"O Messenger of God, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" He said: \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when there is no cloud obscuring it?\" They said: \"No.\" He said: \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the full moon on a clear night when there is no cloud obscuring it?\" They said: \"No.\" He said: \"Then, by the One in Whose hand is my soul [nafs], you will have no more difficulty in seeing your Lord. Then the servant will be cast forth, and He will say to him: 'Did I not honor you, make you master, give you spouses, subjugate for you horses and camels, and let you lead and live in comfort?' The servant will say: 'Yes.' He will say: 'Did you think you would meet Me?' He will say: 'No.' He will say: 'Then I will forget you as you forgot Me.'\") So imagine yourself, O wretched one, when the angels have taken you by your arms and you are standing before God, exalted is He, and He questions you directly, saying to you: \"Did I not bestow upon you youth? In what did you expend it? Did I not grant you respite in your lifespan? In what did you waste it? Did I not provide you with wealth? From where did you acquire it, and in what did you spend it? Did I not honor you with knowledge ['ilm]? What did you act upon from what you knew?\" How then do you see your shame and your disgrace, as He enumerates for you His blessings [in'ām] and your acts of disobedience [ma'āṣī], His favors [ayādī] and your misdeeds [masāwī]?
