And likewise, whoever breaks a branch from a tree without an urgent, important need and without a valid purpose has disbelieved in the blessing (Ni'mah) of Allah the Exalted in creating the trees and creating the hand. As for the hand, it was not created for futility but for obedience (al-Ta'ah) and works that assist in obedience (al-Ta'ah). And as for the tree, Allah the Exalted created it and created for it roots and directed water to it and created in it the power of nourishment and growth so that it reaches the peak of its maturity, then His servants (al-'Ibad) benefit from it, so breaking it before the peak of its maturity not in a manner that His servants (al-'Ibad) benefit from it is contrary to the purpose of wisdom (al-Hikmah) and a deviation from justice (al-'Adl). If he has a valid purpose, then he has that, for the tree and the animal were made as ransom for human purposes, for they are both perishable, vanishing, so the perishing of the lower in the survival of the nobler for a period is closer to justice (al-'Adl) than wasting them both, and to this is the allusion by His saying the Exalted: 'And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him.' {} Yes, if he breaks that from the property of another, he is also an oppressor even if he is needy, because each specific tree does not fulfill the needs of all the servants (al-'Ibad) of Allah but fulfills one need, and if one is specified with it without preference and specification, it would be injustice, so the one with specification is the one who obtained the seed and placed it in the earth and directed water to it and undertook the care, so he is more entitled to it than others, and his side returns with that. If that grew in barren land without human effort, it is specified by its planting place or by planting it, so there must be seeking another specification, which is precedence in taking it, for the precedent has the characteristic of precedence. So justice (al-'Adl) is that he be more entitled to it, and the poor expressed this preference as ownership, and it is purely metaphorical, for there is no ownership except for the King of Kings (Malik al-Muluk) who has what is in the heavens and the earth, and how can the servant (al-'Abd) be an owner when he himself does not own himself but is owned by another?

If you are incapable of all that, then be a lover of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), diligent in venerating his traditions (Sunnah), yearning to observe the hearts (Qulub) of the righteous (Salihin) from his community, and seeking blessings (Tabarruk) through their supplications. Perhaps you will attain from his intercession (Shafa'ah) or their intercession, and thus be saved by intercession if you are of little merchandise. (Description of Intercession) Know that when entry into the Fire becomes due for groups of the believers, then Allah the Exalted, by His grace, accepts among them the intercession of the Prophets and the Truthful Ones (Siddiqin), indeed the intercession of the scholars and the righteous, and everyone who has status (Jah) and good dealings with Allah the Exalted, then he has intercession for his family, relatives, friends, and acquaintances. So be diligent to acquire for yourself with them the rank of intercession, and that is by not despising any human being at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His friendship (Wilayah) in His servants, so perhaps the one whom your eye belittles is the friend (Wali) of Allah. And do not deem any sin small at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His anger in His prohibitions (Ma'asi), so perhaps the wrath (Maqt) of Allah is in it. And do not deem any obedience small at all, for Allah the Exalted has concealed His pleasure (Rida) in His obedience, so perhaps His pleasure is in it, even if it be a good word or a good intention or what runs its course.

And those who follow their desires (Hawā) exit from this monotheism (Tawḥīd), for every follower of his desire has taken his desire as his god. Allah the Exalted said: 'Have you seen he who has taken his desire as his god?' (Al-Jāthiyah: 23). And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'The most hated god worshipped on earth to Allah the Exalted is the desire.' And in truth, whoever contemplates knows that the idol-worshipper does not worship the idol but rather worships his desire, for his soul (Nafs) is inclined to the religion of his forefathers, so he follows that inclination, and the inclination of the soul to familiar things is one of the meanings expressed by 'desire' (Hawā). And from this monotheism exits discontent with creation and turning attention to them, for how can one who sees everything as from Allah the Mighty and Majestic be discontent with other than Him? Indeed, monotheism is an expression of this station (Maqām), which is the station of the truthful ones (Ṣiddīqīn). So look at what he has turned to and with which shell (Qishr) he has contented himself, and how they have taken this as a refuge in boasting and pride with what is named praiseworthy while being bankrupt of the meaning that deserves true praise. That is like the bankruptcy of one who rises in the morning and turns to the qiblah and says: 'I have turned my face to He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining to truth' (Al-Anʿām: 79). And it is the first lie he opens with to Allah every day if the face of his heart (Qalb) is not turned to Allah the Exalted in particular, for if he intends by 'face' the apparent face, then his face is only to the Kaaba, and he has only diverted it from other directions, and the Kaaba is not a direction for He who created the heavens and the earth, so that the one turning to it is turning to Him, exalted is He above being limited by directions and regions, and</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>والثالث: وهو اللباب أن يرى الأمور كلها من الله تعالى رؤية تقطع التفاته عن الوسائط وأن يعبده عبادة يفرده بها فلا يعبد غيره ويخرج عن هذا التوحيد أتباع الهوى فكل متبع هواه فقد اتخذ هواه معبوده قال الله تعالى: (أفرأيت من اتخذ إلهه هواه( (الجاثية: 23). وقال صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أبغض إله عبد في الأرض عند الله تعالى هو الهوى)[92]. وعلى التحقيق من تأمل عرف أن عابد الصنم ليس يعبد الصنم وإنما يعبد هواه إذ نفسه مائلة إلى دين آبائه فيتبع ذلك الميل وميل النفس إلى المألوفات أحد المعاني التي يعبر عنها بالهوى ويخرج من هذا التوحيد التسخط على الخلق والالتفات إليهم فإن من يرى الكل من الله عز وجل كيف يتسخط على غيره فلقد كان التوحيد عبارة عن هذا المقام وهو مقام الصديقين فانظر إلى ماذا حول وبأي قشر قنع منه وكيف اتخذوا هذا معتصما في التمدح والتفاخر بما اسمه محمود مع الإفلاس عن المعنى الذي يستحق الحمد الحقيقي وذلك كإفلاس من يصبح بكرة ويتوجه إلى القبلة ويقول: (وجهت وجهي للذي فطر السموات والأرض حنيفا( (الأنعام: 79). وهو أول كذب يفاتح الله به كل يوم إن لم يكن وجه قلبه متوجها إلى الله تعالى على الخصوص فإنه إن أراد بالوجه وجه الظاهر فما وجهه إلا إلى الكعبة وما صرفه إلا عن سائر الجهات والكعبة ليست جهة للذي فطر السموات والأرض حتى يكون المتوجه إليها متوجها إليه تعالى عن أن تحده الجهات والأقطار وإن</div></div><hr style='border-top: 1px dashed #ddd; margin: 15px 0;'><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><a href='../books/vol1_Vol1-book-4.doc.txt' target='_blank' class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;'>📖 Vol 1: Secrets of Prayer</a></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>And the one who takes refuge in it has no object of worship except Allah (God) the Exalted.

Meaning that the Heart (Qalb) empty from the Passion (Hawa) does not enter it the Satan (Shaytan). And for that reason, Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, My servants, you have no authority over them.'

[45] And it does not erase the whispering (Waswasah) of the Satan (Shaytan) from the Heart (Qalb) except the remembrance (Dhikr) of other than what he whispers with, because if there occurs in the Heart (Qalb) the remembrance (Dhikr) of something, what was in it before disappears from it. But everything other than Allah the Exalted and other than what is related to Him, it is also permissible to be a field for the Satan (Shaytan). And the remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah is that which secures his side and he knows that there is no field for the Satan (Shaytan) in it. And the thing is not treated except by its opposite, and the opposite of all the whisperings (Waswasah) of the Satan (Shaytan) is the remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah with seeking refuge and disavowal from power and strength, and it is the meaning of your saying: 'I seek refuge in Allah from the Satan (Shaytan), the accursed,' and 'There is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.' And that is not capable of it except the God-fearing (Muttaqun) who are predominant over them the remembrance (Dhikr) of Allah the Exalted. And indeed, the Satan (Shaytan) circulates around them in times of slips (Falatat) on the way of stealth (Khalsah). Allah the Exalted said: 'Indeed, those who fear (Ittaqaw) when a touch from the Satan (Shaytan) touches them, they remember (Tadhakkara), then they are seeing (Mubsirun).'</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em;
