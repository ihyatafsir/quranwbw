Al-Shafi’i, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Three, if you honor them, they will disgrace you, and if you disgrace them, they will honor you: the woman, the servant, and the Nabatean.\" He meant that if you offer pure honor and do not mix your sternness with your gentleness, nor your harshness with your kindness. And in summary, by justice [‘adl] the heavens and the earth stand. So everything that exceeds its limit reverses to its opposite. Therefore, you should follow the path of moderation [iqtisad] in opposition and agreement, and follow the truth [haqq] in all of that, to be safe from their evil, for *\"their scheming is tremendous\"*, and their evil is widespread, and what predominates in them is bad character [su' al-khuluq] and weakness of intellect [rakakat al-'aql]. And that is not balanced in them except by a kind of gentleness [lutf] mixed with governance [siyasah]. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"The likeness of a righteous woman among women is like a white-bellied crow among a hundred crows.\" And in the advice of Luqman to his son: \"O my son, beware of the wicked woman [al-mar'ah al-su'], for she will turn you gray before old age; and beware of the worst of women, for they do not call to any good; and be on guard even from the best of them.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Seek refuge from the three destroyers,\" and he counted among them the wicked woman [al-mar'ah al-su'], for she is the one who turns gray before old age. And in another wording: \"If you enter upon her, she insults you, and if you are absent from her, she betrays you.\" And indeed, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding the best of women: \"Indeed, you are the companions of Yusuf,\" meaning that your turning Abu Bakr away from leading the prayer was an inclination from you away from the truth [haqq] toward desire [hawa]. Allah, the Exalted, said when they disclosed the secret of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him: \"If you two repent to Allah, then your hearts [qulub] have inclined,\" meaning they leaned. And He said that regarding the best of his wives, the two women: ‘A’ishah and Hafsa. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"A people will never succeed who are ruled by a woman.\" And ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, rebuked his wife when she argued with him and said: \"You are nothing but a plaything in the corner of the house; if we have need of you, [well]; otherwise, sit as you are.\" So there is evil in them, and there is weakness in them. Governance [siyasah] and roughness are the cure for the evil, and compliance and mercy [rahmah] are the cure for the weakness. The skilled physician is the one who measures the treatment according to the disease. So let the man first look at her character [akhlaq] through experience, then let him treat her with what rectifies her, as her condition requires. Fifth: Moderation in jealousy [ghayrah]. It is that he does not neglect the beginnings of matters whose dire consequences are feared, nor does he exaggerate in bad suspicion [su' al-zann] and severity and spying into the hidden. For the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade \"that you pursue the private matters of women.\" And in another wording: \"that you surprise women.\" And when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, returned from a journey, he said before entering the city: \"Do not enter upon your women at night.\" But two men opposed him and went ahead, and each one saw in his home what he disliked. And in the famous report: \"The woman is like a rib; if you try to straighten it, you will break it, so leave it and enjoy it with its crookedness.\" And this is regarding refining her character [akhlaq]. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, among jealousy [ghayrah] is a jealousy that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, hates, and it is the jealousy of a man regarding his family without suspicion [raybah].\" For that is from the bad suspicion [su' al-zann] we have been forbidden from, for *\"some suspicion is sin.\"* And ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"Do not be excessively jealous [ghayrah] over your family, lest you be accused of evil on your account.\" As for jealousy [ghayrah] in its proper place, it is indispensable and is praiseworthy. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, is jealous [yaghār], and the believer is jealous [yaghār]; and the jealousy [ghayrah] of Allah, the Exalted, is that a believing man should commit what Allah has forbidden to him.\" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: \"Do you wonder at the jealousy [ghayrah] of Sa‘d? By Allah, I am more jealous [aghār] than him, and Allah is more jealous [aghār] than me.\" And because of the jealousy [ghayrah] of Allah, the Exalted, He has forbidden immoralities, what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And no one loves an excuse more than Allah, and for that reason He sent the warners and the bearers of good tidings. And no one loves praise more than Allah, and for that reason He promised Paradise.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>قال الله تعالى حين أفشين سر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم (إن تتوبا إلى الله فقد صغت قلوبكما) أي مالت وقال ذلك في خير أزواجه والمرأتان عائشة وحفصة.</div></div></div>"}},"5":{"w":[{"b":"0.11","h":"0.45","c":"عَسَى","d":"ʿasā","e":"ٰàَsَʿع"},{"b":"0.78","h":"1.44","c":"رَبُّهُ","d":"rabbuhu","e":"ٓۥُhُّbَr"},{"b":"3.2","h":"4.22","c":"إِنْ","d":"in","e":"nِiʾ"},{"b":"3.5","h":"5.21","c":"طَلَّقَكُنَّ","d":"ṭallaqakunna","e":"َّnُkَqَّlَṭ"},{"b":"6.4","h":"8.35","c":"أَنْ","d":"an","e":"nَaʾ"},{"b":"7.4","h":"9.45","c":"يُبْدِلَهُ","d":"yub'dilahu","e":"ٓۥُhَlِdْbُy"},{"b":"9.6","h":"12.34","c":"أَزْوَاجًا","d":"azwājan","e":"āًjgَٰwْzَaʾ"},{"b":"10.","h":"14.4","c":"خَيْرًا","d":"khayran","e":"āًrْyَhk"},{"b":"11.4","h":"15.64","c":"مِنْكُنَّ","d":"minkunna","e":"َّnُknِّm"},{"b":"14.5","h":"19.03","c":"مُسْلِمَاتٍ","d":"mus'limātin","e":"ٍtَٰmِlْsُm"},{"b":"19.7","h":"28.3","c":"مُؤْمِنَاتٍ","d":"mu'minātin","e":"ٍtَٰnِmْwʾُّm"},{"b":"22.0","h":"31.04","c":"قَانِتَاتٍ","d":"qānitātin","e":"ٍtَٰtِnَٰq"},{"b":"24.3","h":"34.3","c":"تَائِبَاتٍ","d":"tāibātin","e":"ٍtَٰbِyʾَٰٓt"},{"b":"27.2","h":"37.73","c":"عَابِدَاتٍ","d":"ʿābidātin","e":"ٍtَٰdِbَٰʿع"},{"b":"29.5","h":"40.96","c":"سَائِحَاتٍ","d":"sāiḥātin","e":"ٍtَٰḥِyʾَٰٓs"},{"b":"33.2","h":"44.96","c":"ثَيِّبَاتٍ","d":"thayyibātin","e":"ٍtَٰbِّyَht"},{"b":"35.3","h":"48.06","c":"وَأَبْكَارًا","d":"wa-abkāran","e":"āًrāَkْbَaʾَw"}],"a":{"g":"Perhaps his Lord, if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married and virgins."}},"6":{"w":[{"b":"0.1","h":"0.76","c":"يَاأَيُّهَا","d":"yāayyuhā","e":"āَhُّyَaʾَٰٓy"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.77","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.41","c":"ءَامَنُوا","d":"āmanū","e":"۟āwُnَmāَء"},{"b":"4.7","h":"7.33","c":"قُوا","d":"qū","e":"۟āٓwُq"},{"b":"6.7","h":"8.89","c":"أَنْفُسَكُمْ","d":"anfusakum","e":"ْmُkَsُfnَaʾ"},{"b":"8.7","h":"11.37","c":"وَأَهْلِيكُمْ","d":"wa-ahlīkum","e":"ْmُkyِlْhَaʾَw"},{"b":"9.9","h":"13.69","c":"نَارًا","d":"nāran","e":"āًrāَn"},{"b":"10.7","h":"14.82","c":"وَقُودُهَا","d":"waqūduhā","e":"āَhُdwُqَw"},{"b":"12.4","h":"17.24","c":"النَّاسُ","d":"l-nāsu","e":"ُsāَّnlٱ"},{"b":"14.0","h":"18.88","c":"وَالْحِجَارَةُ","d":"wal-ḥijāratu","e":"ُẗَrāَjgِḥْlٱَw"},{"b":"20.0","h":"21.42","c":"عَلَيْهَا","d":"ʿalayhā","e":"āَhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"21.0","h":"23.51","c":"مَلَائِكَةٌ","d":"malāikatun","e":"ٌẗَkِyʾَٰٓlَm"},{"b":"23.7","h":"26.42","c":"غِلَاظٌ","d":"ghilāẓun","e":"ٌẓāَlِغ"},{"b":"25.2","h":"38.65","c":"شِدَادٌ","d":"shidādun","e":"ٌdāَdِhs"},{"b":"26.3","h":"40.12","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَّl"},{"b":"26.7","h":"41.19","c":"يَعْصُونَ","d":"yaʿṣūna","e":"َnwُṣْʿعَy"},{"b":"27.8","h":"43.03","c":"اللَّهَ","d":"l-laha","e":"َhَّllٱ"},{"b":"33.","h":"44.59","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"ٓāَm"},{"b":"33.4","h":"44.69","c":"أَمَرَهُمْ","d":"amarahum","e":"ْmُhَrَmَaʾ"},{"b":"36.3","h":"47.87","c":"وَيَفْعَلُونَ","d":"wayafʿalūna","e":"َnwُlَʿعْfَyَw"},{"b":"37.6","h":"50.41","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"38.0","h":"51.25","c":"يُؤْمَرُونَ","d":"yu'marūna","e":"َnwُrَmْwʾُy"}],"a":{"g":"O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded.","ihya":"<div class='ihya-container' style='margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #d4af37; border-radius: 4px;'><h4 style='color: #d4af37; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: \"Cinzel\", serif;'>Ihya 'Ulum al-Din Commentary</h4><div class='ihya-entry'><div style='margin-bottom: 10px;'><span class='badge badge-light' style='color: #666; border: 1px solid #ddd;'>Vol 2: Etiquette of Marriage</span></div><div class='ihya-text' style='font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px;'>Know that the path in disciplining children [tarbiyat al-sibyan] is among the most important and most obligatory of matters. The child is a trust [amanah] in the hands of his parents, and his pure heart [qalb] is a precious, simple jewel, empty of every engraving and image. It is receptive to everything that is engraved upon it and inclines towards everything to which it is made to incline. If he is accustomed to good and taught it, he grows upon it and finds felicity [sa'ada] in this world [dunya] and the Hereafter [akhira], and his father, and every teacher and educator of his, shares in its reward. But if he is accustomed to evil and neglected like cattle are neglected, he is wretched and ruined, and the burden [wizr] is upon the neck of the one responsible for him and charged with his care. Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has said: \"O you who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire...\" And however much a father protects him from the fire of this world, it is more fitting that he protect him from the Fire of the Hereafter. His protection is by educating him, refining him, teaching him the beauties of character [mahasin al-akhlaq], guarding him from evil companions, and not accustoming him to luxury, nor making him love adornment and comfort, lest he waste his life in seeking them when he grows up and thus be ruined with eternal ruin. Rather, one must watch over him from the very beginning of his affair, so that none is employed in his nursing and breastfeeding except a religious woman who eats what is lawful [halal], for the milk produced from what is unlawful [haram] has no blessing [barakah] in it. For when the child's growth is founded upon it, his very clay [tinah] is kneaded from the impure, and his innate disposition [tab'] inclines towards that which corresponds to impurities.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وقال صلى الله عليه وسلم (كفى بالمرء إثما أن يضيع من يعول) ومن يقصر عن القيام بحقهن وإن كان حاضرا فهو بمنزلة هارب فقد قال تعالى (قوا أنفسكم وأهليكم نارا) أمرنا أن نقيهم النار كما نقي أنفسنا والإنسان قد يعجز عن القيام بحق نفسه وإذا تزوج تضاعف عليه الحق وانضافت إلى نفسه نفس أخرى والنفس أمارة بالسوء إن كثرت عليها الحقوق كثر الأمر بالسوء غالبا.</div></div></div>"}},"7":{"w":[{"b":"0.13","h":"2.55","c":"يَاأَيُّهَا","d":"yāayyuhā","e":"āَhُّyَaʾَٰٓy"},{"b":"2.8","h":"3.87","c":"الَّذِينَ","d":"alladhīna","e":"َnyِhdَّlٱ"},{"b":"3.7","h":"5.44","c":"كَفَرُوا","d":"kafarū","e":"۟āwُrَfَk"},{"b":"4.6","h":"6.95","c":"لَا","d":"lā","e":"āَl"},{"b":"5","h":"7.57","c":"تَعْتَذِرُوا","d":"taʿtadhirū","e":"۟āwُrِhdَtْʿعَt"},{"b":"8.0","h":"9.43","c":"الْيَوْمَ","d":"l-yawma","e":"َmْwَyْlٱ"},{"b":"8.5","h":"12.9","c":"إِنَّمَا","d":"innamā","e":"āَmَّnِiʾ"},{"b":"10.1","h":"14.89","c":"تُجْزَوْنَ","d":"tuj'zawna","e":"َnْwَzْjgُt"},{"b":"11.1","h":"16.6","c":"مَا","d":"mā","e":"āَm"},{"b":"11.4","h":"17.31","c":"كُنْتُمْ","d":"kuntum","e":"ْmُtnُk"},{"b":"13.0","h":"19.54","c":"تَعْمَلُونَ","d":"taʿmalūna","e":"َnwُlَmْʿعَt"}],"a":{"g":"O you who have disbelieved, make no excuses that Day.

And it is susceptible that the intended meaning by it is the perfection of the light [nur] in other than what was illuminated in the world [dunya] with an illumination needing increase in completion and radiance; thus, that is what is intended by its perfection. And to this is the allusion by His saying, the Exalted: \"Their light [nur] runs before them and on their right hands; they say, 'Our Lord, perfect for us our light [nur]'\" for the perfection of the light [nur] has no effect except in increasing the unveiling [kashf], and for this reason none are successful with the degree of gazing [nazar] and vision [ru'ya] except the knowers [al-'arifun] in the world [dunya], because knowledge [ma'rifa] is the seed which is transformed in the Hereafter [al-akhira] into direct witnessing [mushahada], just as the seed-pit is transformed into a tree and the grain into a crop. And he who has no seed-pit in his land, how can he obtain a palm tree? And he who did not sow the grain, how can he harvest the crop? Likewise, he who did not know [arafa] God, the Exalted, in the world [dunya], how can he see Him in the Hereafter [al-akhira]? And since knowledge [ma'rifa] is upon varying degrees, the manifestation [tajalli] is also upon varying degrees. Thus, the difference of the manifestation [tajalli] in relation to the difference of the knowledges [ma'arif] is like the difference of plants in relation to the difference of seeds, for they differ inevitably in their abundance and scarcity, their goodness and strength, and their weakness.</div><div class='ihya-arabic' style='font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; text-align: right; direction: rtl; font-family: \"Traditional Arabic\", serif; background: #fff; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid #eee;'>وروى في تفسير قوله تعالى: ﴿ يوم لا يخزى الله النبي والذين آمنوا معه ﴾ (أن الله تعالى أوحى إلى نبيه ﭬ إني أجعل حساب أمتك إليك قال لا يارب أنت أرحم بهم مني فقال إذن لا نخزيك فيهم)</div></div></div>"}},"9":{"w":[{"b":"0.08","h":"0.65","c":"يَاأَيُّهَا","d":"yāayyuhā","e":"āَhُّyَaʾَٰٓy"},{"b":"2.7","h":"3.7","c":"النَّبِيُّ","d":"l-nabiyu","e":"ُّàِbَّnlٱ"},{"b":"4.2","h":"5.55","c":"جَاهِدِ","d":"jāhidi","e":"ِdِhَٰjg"},{"b":"5.0","h":"6.94","c":"الْكُفَّارَ","d":"l-kufāra","e":"َrāَّfُkْlٱ"},{"b":"6.3","h":"9.08","c":"وَالْمُنَافِقِينَ","d":"wal-munāfiqīna","e":"َnyِqِfَٰnُmْlٱَw"},{"b":"8.1","h":"12.21","c":"وَاغْلُظْ","d":"wa-ugh'luẓ","e":"ْẓُlْغٱَw"},{"b":"8.9","h":"13.46","c":"عَلَيْهِمْ","d":"ʿalayhim","e":"ْmِhْyَlَʿع"},{"b":"10.3","h":"17.15","c":"وَمَأْوَاهُمْ","d":"wamawāhum","e":"ْmُhٰàَwْaʾَmَw"},{"b":"11.","h":"19.34","c":"جَهَنَّمُ","d":"jahannamu","e":"ُmَّnَhَjg"},{"b":"13.4","h":"23.19","c":"وَبِئْسَ","d":"wabi'sa","e":"َsْyʾِbَw"},{"b":"14.1","h":"24.49","c":"الْمَصِيرُ","d":"l-maṣīru","e":"ُryِṣَmْlٱ"}],"a":{"g":"O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them.
