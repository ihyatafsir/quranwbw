The Book of Reflection
This is the Ninth Book of the Quarter of the Deliverances from The Revival of the Religious Sciences.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, for Whose majestic might no direction or region is appointed as a limit, and Who has not made the ascent of imagination's feet or the target of understanding's arrows a path to the sanctuary of His grandeur. Rather, He has left the hearts of seekers in the desert of His majesty, bewildered and lost. Whenever they stir to attain their object, the splendors of divine majesty repel them by force. And when they despairingly intend to turn away, they are called from the pavilions of divine beauty: "Patience, patience!" Then it is said to them: "Occupy yourself in the humility of servitude with your thought, for if you were to reflect on the majesty of Lordship, you could not gauge its measure. And if you seek beyond thought concerning your own attributes, then look at the favors of God, the Exalted, and His bounties—how they have come to you in succession. Renew for every one of them remembrance and gratitude. And contemplate the oceans of divine decrees—how they have overflowed upon all beings with good and evil, benefit and harm, hardship and ease, triumph and loss, mending and breaking, folding and unfolding, faith and disbelief, recognition and denial. But if you pass from observing the actions to observing the Essence, then you have attempted a momentous affair and hazarded your soul by transgressing the limit of human capacity, wrongfully and unjustly. For minds are dazzled before the beginnings of Its radiance and are turned back on their heels, compelled and overpowered."

And blessings upon Muhammad, the master of the children of Adam—even if he did not count his mastery a cause for pride—a blessing that will remain for us as provision and treasure on the plains of Resurrection. And upon his family and his companions, each of whom became a full moon in the sky of religion and a leader for the communities of the Muslims. And abundant peace be upon him.

Now then, a tradition has been conveyed stating that "reflection for an hour is better than a year of worship." The hadith: "Reflection for an hour is better than worship for a year" was reported by Ibn Hibban in the Book of Divine Greatness from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with the wording "sixty years," by a weak chain. Through his route, Ibn al-Jawzi cited it in "The Fabricated Traditions." Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in "The Unique Paradise Collection" from the narration of Anas with the wording "eighty years," and its chain is very weak. Abu al-Shaykh reported it from the saying of Ibn Abbas with the wording "better than standing in prayer for a night."

Exhortation to ponder, take heed, observe, and reflect is abundant in the Book of God, the Exalted. It is not hidden that reflection is the key to lights, the beginning of insight, the net for sciences, and the snare for knowledge and understandings. Most people have recognized its merit and rank, but they are ignorant of its reality, its fruit, its source, its outlet, its course, its field, its path, and its method. They do not know how to reflect, in what to reflect, why to reflect, and what is sought by it. Is it desired for its own sake, or for a fruit gained from it? If it is for a fruit, then what is that fruit? Is it from the sciences, or from the spiritual states, or from both together? Uncovering all of this is important. We will mention first the virtue of reflection, then the reality of reflection and its fruit, then the courses of thought and its fields, if God, the Exalted, wills.

**The Virtue of Reflection**
God, the Exalted, has commanded reflection and pondering in His Mighty Book in countless places and praised those who reflect, saying, the Exalted: "Those who remember God while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: 'Our Lord, You have not created this in vain.'" Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Some people reflected on God, the Almighty, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Reflect on the creation of God and do not reflect on God, for you will never be able to gauge His measure.'" The hadith of Ibn Abbas: "Some people reflected on God, the Almighty, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Reflect on the creation of God and do not reflect on God, for you will never be able to gauge His measure.'" Abu Nu'aym reported it in "The Adornment" with its raised attribution, by a weak chain. Al-Isbahani reported it in "Exhortation and Warning" from another, sounder route. Al-Tabarani reported it in "The Medium-Sized Collection" and al-Bayhaqi in "The Branches" from the narration of Ibn Umar, and said: "This chain requires scrutiny." I say: In it is al-Wazi' ibn Nafi', who is abandoned.

And from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he came upon a group of people one day while they were reflecting. He said: "What is the matter with you that you do not speak?" They said: "We are reflecting on the creation of God, the Almighty." He said: "Do so, then. Reflect on His creation and do not reflect on Him. For in this west there is a white land whose light is its whiteness and its whiteness is its light, a journey of the sun for forty days. In it are creatures from the creation of God, the Almighty, who have not disobeyed God for the blink of an eye." They said: "O Messenger of God, where is Satan among them?" He said: "They do not know whether Satan was created or not." They said: "From the children of Adam?" He said: "They do not know whether Adam was created or not." The hadith: "He came upon a group of people one day while they were reflecting..." We have narrated it in a segment from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Salam.

And from 'Ata' who said: "I went out one day..."

I and 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr went to 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). She spoke to us while a curtain was between us and her. She said, "O 'Ubayd, what prevents you from visiting us?" He said, "The saying of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him): 'Visit infrequently, and love will increase.'" Ibn 'Umayr said, "So inform us of the most amazing thing you saw from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)." She wept and said, "All his affairs were amazing. He came to me during my night until his skin touched my skin. Then he said, 'Let me worship my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.' He got up to the water skin, performed ablution from it, then stood to pray. He wept until his beard became wet. Then he prostrated until the ground became wet. Then he lay on his side until Bilal came to give the call for the dawn prayer. He said, 'O Messenger of Allah, what makes you weep when Allah has forgiven your past and future sins?' He said, 'Woe to you, O Bilal! And what prevents me from weeping when Allah, the Exalted, has revealed to me this night: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding."' Then he said, 'Woe to the one who recites it and does not reflect upon it.'"

The narration of 'Ata': I and 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr went to 'A'ishah... the hadith. Ibn 'Umayr said, "So inform us of the most amazing thing you saw from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)"... the hadith concerning the revelation of "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth..." and his saying, "Woe to the one who recites it and does not reflect upon it."

It has preceded in the chapter on Patience and Gratitude that it is in the Sahih of Ibn Hibban from the narration of 'Abd al-Malik ibn Abi Sulayman from 'Ata'. It was said to al-Awza'i, "What is the ultimate extent of reflecting upon them?" He said, "To recite them and comprehend them."

From Muhammad ibn Wasil: A man from the people of Basra traveled to Umm Dhar after the death of Abu Dhar and asked her about the worship of Abu Dhar. She said, "He would spend his entire day in a corner of the house, reflecting."

From al-Hasan: "Reflection for an hour is better than standing in prayer for a night."

From al-Fudayl: "Reflection is a mirror that shows you your good deeds and your evil deeds."

It was said to Ibrahim, "You prolong reflection." He said, "Reflection is the marrow of the intellect."

Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah would often recite the saying of the poet: "If a person has reflection, then in everything there is a lesson for him."

From Tawus: The disciples said to 'Isa ibn Maryam, "O Spirit of Allah, is there on earth today anyone like you?" He said, "Yes, whoever's speech is remembrance, whose silence is reflection, and whose gaze is a lesson, then he is like me."

Al-Hasan said: "Whoever's speech is not wisdom, it is idle talk; whoever's silence is not reflection, it is heedlessness; and whoever's gaze is not contemplation, it is amusement."

Regarding His saying, the Exalted: "I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right" – He said: "I prevent their hearts from reflecting upon My affair."

From Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "Give your eyes their share of worship." They said, "O Messenger of Allah, and what is their share of worship?" He said, "Looking into the Mus'haf, reflecting upon it, and taking lessons from its wonders."

The hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "Give your eyes their share of worship"... Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it, and through his route, Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban in the book "Al-'Azamah" with a weak chain.

From a woman who lived in the desert near Makkah: She said, "If the hearts of the God-fearing were to gaze with their reflection upon what has been stored for them in the veils of the unseen from the good of the Hereafter, no life in this world would seem pleasant to them, and no eye in this world would find contentment."

Luqman would prolong sitting alone. His master would pass by him and say, "O Luqman, you persistently sit alone. If you sat with people, it would be more comforting for you." Luqman said, "Lengthy solitude leads to deeper reflection, and lengthy reflection is a guide to the path of Paradise."

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: "The reflection of a person never lengthened except that he gained knowledge, and a person never gained knowledge except that he acted."

'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: "Reflection upon the favors of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is among the best worship."

'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak said one day to Sahl ibn 'Ali, seeing him silent and reflective, "Where have you reached?" He said, "The Sirat (the Bridge over Hell)."

Bishr said: "If people reflected upon the majesty of Allah, they would not disobey Allah, the Mighty and Majestic."

From Ibn 'Abbas: "Two moderate rak'ahs performed with reflection are better than standing in prayer for a night without presence of heart."

While Abu Shurayh was walking, he sat down and covered himself with his garment and began to weep. He was asked, "What makes you weep?" He said, "I reflected upon the passing of my life, the scarcity of my deeds, and the nearness of my appointed time."

Abu Sulayman said: "Accustom your eyes to weeping and your hearts to reflection."

Abu Sulayman said: "Reflection upon this world is a veil from the Hereafter and a punishment for the people of divine friendship (wilayah). Reflection upon the Hereafter bequeaths wisdom and brings hearts to life."

Hatim said: "From contemplation, knowledge increases; from remembrance, love increases; from reflection, fear increases."

Ibn 'Abbas said: "Reflection upon good calls one to act upon it, and regret for evil calls one to abandon it."

It is narrated that Allah, the Exalted, said in some of His scriptures: "I do not accept the speech of every wise one, but I look to his concern and his desire. If his concern and his desire are for Me, I make his silence reflection and his speech praise, even if he does not speak."

Al-Hasan said: "The people of intellect have not ceased..."

They would return from remembrance to reflection, and from reflection to remembrance, until their hearts spoke, and they uttered wisdom.

Ishaq ibn Khalaf related: Dawud al-Ta’i, may God have mercy upon him, was on a rooftop on a moonlit night, contemplating the dominion of the heavens and the earth while gazing at the sky and weeping, until he fell into a neighbor’s courtyard. The owner of the house leapt from his bed naked, sword in hand, thinking it was a thief. When he saw Dawud, he turned back, put down the sword, and said, “Who threw you from the roof?” He replied, “I was not aware of it.”

Al-Junayd said: The noblest and highest of gatherings is to sit with thought in the arena of divine unity, to inhale the breeze of gnosis, to drink from the cup of love from the ocean of affection, and to gaze with good expectation toward God, Mighty and Majestic. Then he said, “O what gatherings, how magnificent they are! And what a drink, how sweet it is! Blessed is he to whom it is granted.”

Al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy upon him, said: Seek help for speech through silence, and for deduction through reflection. He also said: Sound judgment in affairs is salvation from delusion; resolution in opinion is safety from negligence and regret; deliberation and reflection unveil determination and acumen; consulting the wise brings steadiness to the soul and strength to insight. Therefore, reflect before you resolve, consider before you rush, and consult before you advance. He also said: The virtues are four: the first is wisdom, whose foundation is reflection; the second is chastity, whose foundation lies in appetite; the third is strength, whose foundation lies in anger; the fourth is justice, whose foundation is the equilibrium of the soul’s faculties. These are the sayings of the scholars concerning reflection, yet none of them embarked upon explaining its reality and clarifying its channels.

**Explanation of the Reality of Reflection and Its Fruit**

Know that the meaning of reflection is to bring two cognitions to the heart so that a third cognition may be produced from them. An example is one who inclines toward the immediate world, prefers this worldly life, and wishes to know that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference than the immediate. He has two paths: one is to hear from another that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference than this world, so he follows him and believes him without insight into the reality of the matter, thus inclining his action toward preferring the Hereafter based merely on that statement. This is called imitation and is not called knowledge. The second path is for him to know that what is more enduring is more deserving of preference, then to know that the Hereafter is more enduring. From these two cognitions, a third cognition is attained: that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference. Realizing the knowledge that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference is impossible except through the two preceding cognitions. Bringing these two preceding cognitions to the heart in order to reach the third cognition is called reflection, consideration, remembrance, contemplation, meditation, and deliberation. As for deliberation, meditation, and reflection, they are synonymous expressions for a single meaning, with no different meanings underlying them. As for the names remembrance, consideration, and contemplation, their meanings differ even though the referent is one, just as the names “the cutter,” “the Indian,” and “the sword” converge upon one thing but with different considerations. “The cutter” indicates the sword insofar as it severs; “the Indian” indicates it with respect to its origin; and “the sword” indicates it absolutely without implying these additional aspects. Similarly, “consideration” applies to bringing two cognitions insofar as one crosses from them to a third cognition. If the crossing does not occur and one can only stop at the two cognitions, then the name “remembrance” applies to it, not “consideration.” As for “contemplation” and “reflection,” they apply to it insofar as there is a seeking of a third cognition. One who does not seek a third cognition is not called a contemplator. Thus, every reflector is a rememberer, but not every rememberer is a reflector. The benefit of remembrance is to repeat cognitions upon the heart so they become firmly rooted and are not erased from the heart. The benefit of reflection is to increase knowledge and to summon a cognition that was not previously attained. This is the distinction between remembrance and reflection.

When cognitions gather in the heart and pair in the heart in a specific arrangement, they yield another cognition. Thus, knowledge is the product of knowledge. When another cognition is attained and pairs with another cognition, another product results from that. In this way, production continues, sciences continue, and reflection continues without end. The path to increasing cognitions is only blocked by death or by obstacles. This is for one who is capable of cultivating sciences and guided to the path of thinking. As for most people, they are prevented from increase in sciences due to the lack of capital, which are the cognitions by which sciences are cultivated, like one who has no merchandise and thus cannot profit. Or one may possess the merchandise but not know the craft of trade, so he gains nothing. Similarly, one may possess the cognitions that are the capital of sciences but not know how to employ them, combine them, and effect the pairing that leads to production.

The outcome therein and the knowledge of the method of utilization and benefit sometimes come through a divine light in the heart, acquired by innate disposition as was the case with the prophets, prayers of God be upon them all, and that is exceedingly rare. It may also come through learning and practice, which is the more common way. Then, the contemplator may find these insights present and attain the fruit without being aware of how they were acquired, nor able to express them due to lack of practice in the art of expression in presentation. For how many a person knows that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference with a true knowledge, yet if asked about the cause of his knowledge, he would be unable to present and express it, even though his knowledge was attained only through the two prior cognitions: that what is more lasting is more deserving of preference, and that the Hereafter is more lasting than this world. Thus, a third knowledge is attained: that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference. So the essence of true contemplation reverts to bringing forth two cognitions in order to reach a third through them. As for the fruit of thought, it is sciences, states, and works. But its specific fruit is knowledge alone. Indeed, when knowledge is established in the heart, the state of the heart changes; and when the state of the heart changes, the works of the limbs change. Thus, works follow the state, the state follows knowledge, and knowledge follows thought. Therefore, thought is the principle and key to all goodness. This reveals to you the virtue of contemplation and that it is better than remembrance and recollection, for thought is remembrance and more. And the remembrance of the heart is better than the action of the limbs; indeed, the nobility of action lies in the remembrance it contains. Hence, contemplation is superior to all works collectively. Therefore, it has been said: "An hour of contemplation is better than a year of worship." It is said to be that which transfers from the disliked to the beloved, and from desire and greed to asceticism and contentment. It is also said to be that which produces witnessing and God-consciousness. Therefore, the Almighty said: "That they may become God-conscious or it may bring them to remembrance." If you wish to understand how the state changes through thought, its example is what we mentioned regarding the matter of the Hereafter. For thought makes us know that the Hereafter is more deserving of preference. When this knowledge is firmly established as certainty in our hearts, the hearts change to desiring the Hereafter and renouncing this world. This is what we meant by the state, for the state of the heart before this knowledge was love for the immediate and inclination towards it, aversion from the Hereafter, and little desire for it. Through this knowledge, the state of the heart changes and its will and desire are transformed. Then, the change in will yields works of the limbs in discarding the world and turning towards the works of the Hereafter. Here, then, are five degrees: the first is recollection, which is bringing the two cognitions to the heart; the second is contemplation, which is seeking the intended knowledge from them; the third is attaining the desired knowledge and the heart's illumination by it; the fourth is the change in the heart's state from what it was due to the acquisition of the light of knowledge; and the fifth is the service of the limbs to the heart according to what renews for it from the state. Just as a stone is struck against iron, producing fire that illuminates the place, making the eye seeing after it was not seeing, and the limbs rise to work, so too the flint of the light of knowledge is thought. It brings together the two cognitions as one brings together stone and iron, and combines them in a specific combination, just as the stone is struck against the iron in a specific manner, and the light of knowledge emanates as fire emanates from the iron. The heart changes because of this light until it inclines towards what it did not incline to before, just as sight changes by the light of fire and sees what it did not see. Then the limbs rise to work according to the state of the heart, just as one incapable of work due to darkness rises to work when sight perceives what it did not see. Therefore, the fruit of thought is sciences and states. Sciences are endless, and the states that can be imagined to alternate upon the heart cannot be enumerated. For this reason, if a seeker wished to enumerate the varieties of thought and its courses, and in what one contemplates, he would be unable, for the courses of thought are not limited and its fruits are boundless. Indeed, we strive to delineate its courses in relation to the important religious sciences and in relation to the states that are the stations of the wayfarers, and this will be a general delineation, for detailing that would require explaining all the sciences. The sum of these books is like an explanation for some of them, for they encompass the sciences of those sciences derived from specific thoughts. So let us proceed to delineate the comprehensive principle therein to attain an understanding of the courses of thought.

Explanation of the Courses of Thought

Know that thought may run in a matter pertaining to religion or in what does not pertain to religion. Our aim is only what pertains to religion, so we will leave the other category and focus on religion, meaning the transaction between the servant and the Lord, exalted be He. Thus, all the thoughts of a servant either pertain to the servant and his attributes

His states either pertain to the worshipped and His attributes and actions, or they cannot escape these two divisions. What pertains to the servant is either contemplation of what is beloved to the Lord, exalted be He, or of what is detested, with no need for thought beyond these two divisions. What pertains to the Lord, exalted be He, is either contemplation of His essence, attributes, and beautiful names, or of His actions, dominion, sovereignty, and all that is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. It becomes clear to you that thought is confined to these divisions through an example: the state of those journeying to God, exalted be He, and those yearning to meet Him pertains to their Beloved or to themselves. If he contemplates his Beloved, he either contemplates His beauty and the loveliness of His form in His essence to delight in thinking of Him and witnessing Him, or he contemplates His subtle, good actions indicative of His character and attributes, so that this may intensify the pleasure and strengthen his love. If he contemplates himself, his thought is either of the attributes that lower him in the sight of his Beloved, so that he may abstain from them, or of the attributes that bring him near to Him and endear him to Him, so that he may adorn himself with them. If he contemplates something outside these divisions, that is beyond the bounds of passionate love and is a deficiency therein, for complete, perfect passionate love is what overwhelms the lover and fills the heart so that it leaves no room for anything else. Thus, the lover of God, exalted be He, ought to be like this, so his gaze and thought do not stray from his Beloved. Whenever his thought is confined to these four divisions, it is not at all outside the requirement of love. So let us begin with the first division, which is his contemplation of the attributes of his self and the actions of his self, to distinguish the beloved from the detested therein, for this thought pertains to the science of spiritual practice, which is the aim of this book. As for the other division, it pertains to the science of unveiling.

Then, each of what is detested by God or beloved is divided into the outward, like acts of obedience and disobedience, and the inward, like the saving and destructive attributes whose place is the heart, the details of which we have mentioned in the Book of Destructive and Saving Matters. Disobediences are divided into what pertains to the seven limbs and what is ascribed to the entire body, like fleeing from battle, disobedience to parents, and settling in a forbidden abode. For each of the detested matters, it is necessary to contemplate three things: first, to contemplate whether it is detested by God or not, for there may be something whose detestability is not apparent but is grasped through subtle consideration; second, to contemplate that if it is detested, what is the way to avoid it; and third, that this detested matter—is he characterized by it at present, so he should abandon it, or is he exposed to it in the future, so he should guard against it, or has he committed it in past states, so he needs to make amends for it? Likewise, each of the beloved matters is divided into these divisions. When you combine these divisions, the channels of thought in the divisions exceed one hundred, and the servant is driven to thought either in all of them or in most of them. Explaining each of these divisions at length would be lengthy, but this division is confined to four types: acts of obedience, disobediences, destructive attributes, and saving attributes. So let us mention in each type an example by which the seeker may measure the rest, and the door of thought may open for him and his path may expand.

The first type: disobediences. A person ought to examine each morning all his seven limbs in detail, then his body in general: is he at present engaged in a disobedience through it, so he should abandon it; or did he engage in it yesterday, so he should make amends by abandoning and regretting it; or is he exposed to it during his day, so he should prepare to avoid and distance himself from it? He looks at the tongue and says that it is exposed to backbiting, lying, self-praise, mocking others, argumentation, jesting, delving into what does not concern him, and other detested matters. He first affirms in himself that they are detested by God, exalted be He, and contemplates the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah on the severity of punishment therein. Then he contemplates his own states: how is he exposed to them without realizing? Then he contemplates how he may avoid it, and knows that this is not achieved for him except through seclusion and solitude, or by not keeping company except with a righteous, pious person who would disapprove of him whenever he speaks with what God detests; otherwise, he should place a stone in his mouth when he keeps company with others, so that it may remind him. Thus is the thought on the means of avoidance. And he contemplates his hearing: does he listen with it to backbiting, lying, superfluous speech, amusement, and innovation, and that he only hears that from so-and-so, and that he ought to avoid it by isolation or by forbidding wrong? Whenever that is the case, he contemplates his stomach: he only disobeys God, exalted be He, through it by eating and drinking, either by excessive eating of the lawful, for that is detested by God and strengthens

Regarding the desire which is the weapon of Satan, the enemy of God, whether through consuming the unlawful or the dubious, one must examine the source of his food, clothing, dwelling, and earnings—what he earns—and reflect on the path of the lawful and its avenues. Then he reflects on the means of acquiring from it and guarding against the unlawful, and resolves within himself that all acts of worship are wasted with the consumption of the unlawful, and that consuming the lawful is the foundation of all acts of worship, and that God Almighty does not accept the prayer of a servant if the price of his garment contains an unlawful dirham—a hadith: "God does not accept the prayer of a servant in a garment containing an unlawful dirham," reported by Ahmad from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a chain containing an unknown narrator, as previously mentioned, and the report is as such. Thus, he reflects on his limbs; in this measure, there is sufficiency without exhaustive detail. Whenever true knowledge of these states is attained through reflection, he occupies himself with vigilance throughout the day to protect his limbs from them.

As for the second type, which is acts of obedience, he first looks at the prescribed obligations upon him: how he performs them and how he guards them from deficiency and shortcoming, or how he compensates for their deficiency with abundant voluntary acts. Then he returns to each limb and reflects on the actions related to it that God Almighty loves. For example, he says: "The eye was created to look at the dominion of the heavens and the earth as a lesson, and to be used in obedience to God Almighty, and to look into the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace be upon him. I am capable of occupying the eye with studying the Quran and the Sunnah, so why do I not do it? I am capable of looking at so-and-so, the obedient one, with an eye of reverence, thereby bringing joy to his heart, and looking at so-and-so, the corrupt one, with an eye of disdain, thereby deterring him from his disobedience—so why do I not do it?"

Similarly, he says regarding his hearing: "I am capable of listening to the speech of one in distress, or listening to wisdom and knowledge, or listening to recitation and remembrance. Why do I leave it idle when God has bestowed it upon me as a favor, entrusting it to me so that I may thank Him? Why do I show ingratitude for God's favor in it by wasting or neglecting it?" Likewise, he reflects on the tongue and says: "I am capable of drawing near to God Almighty through teaching, admonition, showing affection to the hearts of the righteous, inquiring about the conditions of the poor, and bringing joy to the heart of Zayd the righteous and 'Amr the scholar with a good word—and every good word is charity."

Similarly, he reflects on his wealth and says: "I am capable of giving such-and-such wealth in charity, for I am independent of it, and whenever I need it, God Almighty will provide me with its like. And if I am in need now, then the reward of preferring others is more deserving of me than that wealth." Thus, he scrutinizes all his limbs, his entire body, his wealth, and even his animals, servants, and children, for all of these are his tools and means, and he is capable of obeying God Almighty with them. Through subtle thought, he deduces the possible forms of obedience with them, reflects on what encourages him to hasten to those acts of obedience, reflects on sincerity of intention in them, and seeks the grounds for their worthiness so that his deed may be purified. Apply this analogy to all other acts of obedience.

As for the third type, these are the destructive traits whose place is the heart. He recognizes them from what we have mentioned in the Quarter of the Destructive, which are the domination of desire, anger, miserliness, arrogance, vanity, ostentation, envy, ill thoughts, heedlessness, delusion, and others. He examines his heart for these traits. If he thinks his heart is free from them, he reflects on how to test himself and seek evidence through the signs, for the soul always promises good from itself and then breaks its promise. If it claims humility and freedom from arrogance, it should be tested by carrying a bundle of firewood in the market, as the early ones used to test themselves. If it claims forbearance, it is exposed to anger from others, then tested in suppressing rage. Likewise for all other traits. This is reflection on whether he is characterized by the disliked trait or not, and for that there are signs we have mentioned in the Quarter of the Destructive. If the signs indicate its presence, he reflects on the reasons that make those traits reprehensible to him and clarifies that their origin is from ignorance, heedlessness, and evil inner nature. For instance, if he sees in himself vanity over an action, he reflects and says: "I only acted with my body, my limbs, my ability, and my will, and all of that is not from me nor to me; rather, it is from the creation of God and His favor upon me. He is the One who created me, created my limbs, created my ability and my will, and He is the One who moved my limbs with His power—and likewise my ability and my will. So how can I be vain about my action or about myself, when I cannot even sustain myself by myself?" If he senses arrogance in himself, he resolves within himself the foolishness therein and says to it: "Why do you see yourself as greater, when the Greater is God?"

Who is great in the sight of God? That is unveiled only after death. How many a disbeliever in this life dies drawn near to God Almighty by his renunciation of disbelief, and how many a Muslim dies wretched by the change of his state at death through an evil ending. When one knows that arrogance is ruinous and its root is folly, he should reflect on the remedy to remove it by adopting the actions of the humble. If he finds in himself craving and greed for food, let him reflect that this is a trait of beasts. If perfection lay in appetite for food and intercourse, it would be among the attributes of God and the angels, like knowledge and power, but it is rather ascribed to beasts. The more dominant greed is over him, the more he resembles beasts and the farther he is from the angels brought nigh. Likewise, he should affirm within himself regarding anger, then reflect on the path of remedy. All this we have mentioned in these books. So whoever wishes to expand his path of reflection must acquire what is in these books.

As for the fourth type, which are the saviors, they are: repentance and remorse for sins, patience in affliction, gratitude for blessings, fear and hope, renunciation of the world, sincerity and truthfulness in acts of obedience, love of God and reverence for Him, contentment with His acts, longing for Him, humility and submission to Him. All this we have mentioned in this quarter, and we have mentioned their causes and signs. So let the servant reflect each day in his heart: what does he lack of these qualities that draw near to God Almighty? If he is deficient in any of them, let him know that these are states that are only yielded by knowledge, and knowledge is only yielded by reflection. If he wishes to acquire for himself the states of repentance and remorse, let him first search out his sins, reflect upon them, gather them against himself, and magnify them in his heart. Then let him look at the warnings and severity that have come in the Sacred Law regarding them, and let him be certain within himself that he is exposed to the wrath of God Almighty, until the state of remorse surges within him.

If he wishes to stir from his heart the state of gratitude, let him look at God’s favor upon him and His bounties to him, and at the sending of His beautiful covering over him, as we have explained some of it in the Book of Gratitude—let him study that. If he desires the state of love and longing, let him reflect on the majesty of God, His beauty, His greatness, and His grandeur, by contemplating the wonders of His wisdom and the marvels of His creation, as we shall point to a part of it in the second section of reflection. If he desires the state of fear, let him first look at his outward and inward sins, then at death and its agonies, then at what comes after it: the questioning of Munkar and Nakīr, the torment of the grave, its life, its scorpions and worms; then at the terror of the call at the blowing of the Trumpet; then at the horror of the Gathering when all creatures are assembled on a single plain; then at the scrutiny in the reckoning over the smallest speck; then at the Bridge, its fineness and sharpness; then at the peril of the matter before him—that he be turned to the left and become among the companions of the Fire, or be turned to the right and alight in the Abode of Permanence. Then let him bring to his heart, after the terrors of the Resurrection, the image of Hell, its depths, its cudgels, its horrors, its chains, its fetters, its Zaqqūm, its pus, and the varieties of torment within it; the ugliness of the forms of the Zabāniya entrusted with it; that whenever their skins are roasted they are given other skins; that whenever they wish to leave it they are returned to it; that when they see it from a distant place they hear its raging and roaring—and so on to all that has come in the Qur’an concerning its description.

If he wishes to attract the state of hope, let him look at Paradise and its bliss, its trees, its rivers, its houris, its youths, its everlasting delight and its eternal dominion. Such is the path of reflection by which one seeks the knowledge that yields the attraction of beloved states or purification from blameworthy traits. We have mentioned for each of these states a separate book to aid in detailing reflection. As for gathering its sources, nothing is more beneficial than reading the Qur’an with reflection, for it gathers all stations and states; in it is healing for the worlds; in it is what bequeaths fear and hope, patience and gratitude, love and longing, and all other states; and in it is what restrains from all blameworthy traits. So the servant should recite it and repeat the verse he needs to reflect upon again and again, even a hundred times. For reading one verse with reflection and understanding is better than a complete recitation without contemplation and understanding. Let him pause in pondering it, even for a whole night, for beneath every word of it are secrets without limit, which are only reached by subtle reflection arising from purity of heart after truthful conduct. Likewise, studying the reports of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, for he was given the comprehensive speech—a hadith states that he was given the comprehensive speech—and every word of his words is an ocean from the oceans of wisdom. If a scholar were to contemplate them truly...

Contemplation never ceased its gaze throughout his lifetime, and expounding upon individual verses and narrations would be lengthy. So consider the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "Indeed, the Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: Love whom you love, for you shall part from them. Live as you wish, for you shall die. And do as you wish, for you shall be recompensed for it." This hadith, "Indeed the Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: Love whom you love, for you shall part from them," has been mentioned previously more than once. For these words encompass the wisdom of the former and the latter, and they are sufficient for those who contemplate them for a lifetime. If they were to grasp their meanings and they overcame their hearts with the dominance of certainty, it would consume them entirely, and that state would stand between them and turning towards the world completely. This, then, is the path of reflection concerning the sciences of spiritual conduct and the attributes of the servant from the perspective of what is beloved or detested in the sight of God, the Exalted.

The beginner should be wholly absorbed in these thoughts until his heart is inhabited by praiseworthy character traits and noble spiritual stations, and his inner and outer self are purified from detestable qualities. Let him know that this, although it is superior to all other acts of worship, is not the ultimate objective for him. Rather, one preoccupied with it is veiled from the quest of the truthful ones, which is to delight in reflecting upon the majesty and beauty of God, the Exalted, and the total absorption of the heart to the point of annihilation from his own self—that is, he forgets himself, his states, his stations, and his attributes—so that his concern becomes wholly absorbed in the Beloved, like the enraptured lover at the meeting with the beloved. He does not spare a moment to look at the states and descriptions of his own self; rather, he is like one stunned, heedless of himself, and this is the ultimate delight of the lovers. As for what we have mentioned, it is reflection upon adorning the inner self to make it fit for proximity and union. If he wastes his entire lifetime in rectifying his own self, when then will he delight in proximity? For this reason, one of the elect was wandering in the deserts. Al-Husayn ibn Mansur met him and said, "In what are you engaged?" He replied, "I wander in the deserts to rectify my state in reliance upon God." Al-Husayn said, "You have spent your lifetime in building your inner self; so where is the annihilation in divine unity?" For annihilation in the One True Reality is the ultimate aim of the seekers and the pinnacle of the bliss of the truthful ones.

As for purification from the destructive attributes, it is like the procedure of exiting the waiting period in marriage. And as for being characterized by the saving attributes and all other acts of obedience, it is like preparing the woman, her trousseau, her adornment, her face, and combing her hair so that she may thereby become fit to meet her husband. If she spent her entire lifetime in cleansing the womb and beautifying the face, that would be a veil for her from meeting the Beloved. Thus should you understand the path of religion if you are among the people of intimate companionship. But if you are like the wicked servant who does not move except from fear of beating and hope for wages, then for you are the amusements of the body with outward works, for between you and the heart is a thick veil. If you fulfill the due of works, you will be among the people of Paradise, but for intimate companionship there are others more worthy.

When you have understood the scope of reflection concerning the sciences of spiritual conduct between the servant and his Lord, you should make it your constant habit, morning and evening. Do not be heedless of your self and of your attributes that distance you from God, the Exalted, nor of your states that draw you near to Him, Glorified and Exalted is He. Rather, every aspirant should have a register in which he records a summary of the destructive attributes, a summary of the saving attributes, and a summary of sins and acts of obedience. He should present himself to it every day. Concerning the destructive ones, it is sufficient for him to look at ten, for if he is safe from them, he is safe from the others. They are: miserliness, arrogance, vanity, ostentation, envy, intense anger, greed for food, greed for intercourse, love of wealth, and love of status. Among the saving attributes are ten: remorse for sins, patience in tribulation, contentment with divine decree, gratitude for blessings, moderation between fear and hope, renunciation of the world, sincerity in deeds, good character with creation, love of God the Exalted, and humility before Him. These are twenty traits: ten blameworthy and ten praiseworthy. Whenever he is spared from one of the blameworthy ones, he should cross it off in his register, cease reflecting upon it, and thank God, the Exalted, for sparing him from it and purifying his heart of it. He should know that this was not accomplished except by the facilitation and help of God, the Exalted. Had He left him to himself, he would not have been able to erase the least of the vices from himself. Then he should turn to the remaining nine, and act thus until he crosses off all of them. Likewise, he should demand of himself to be characterized by the saving attributes. If he becomes characterized by one of them, such as repentance and remorse for example, he crosses it off and occupies himself with the remainder. This is needed by the striving aspirant.

As for most people, counted among the righteous, they should record in their registers the outward sins, such as consuming the doubtful, letting the tongue loose with backbiting, slander, argumentation, self-praise, excess in hostility towards enemies and partisanship for friends, and currying favor with people by neglecting to enjoin good and forbid evil.

For most who count themselves among the righteous are not free from a host of these sins in their limbs. And unless the limbs are cleared of offenses, it is impossible to engage in building and purifying the heart. Rather, each group of people is dominated by a type of sin, so they ought to be vigilant in searching for it and reflecting upon it, not upon sins from which they are distant. An example is the pious scholar, for he is seldom free from displaying his knowledge, seeking fame, and spreading renown—whether through teaching or preaching. Whoever does this exposes himself to a great trial from which none are saved except the truthful. For if his speech is accepted and finds good reception in hearts, he is not free from self-admiration, arrogance, ostentation, and affectation—and these are among the destructive traits. And if his speech is rejected, he is not free from anger, haughtiness, and rancor toward the one who rejects it—and this is greater than his anger toward one who rejects another's speech. Satan may deceive him, saying, "Your anger is because he rejected the truth and denied it." But if he finds a distinction between his own speech being rejected and that of another scholar being rejected, he is deluded and a laughingstock to Satan. Then, whenever he finds pleasure in acceptance, joy in praise, and aversion to rejection or disregard, he is not free from straining and affectation to embellish his wording and delivery, out of eagerness to attract praise—and Allah loves not those who strain. Satan may deceive him, saying, "Your eagerness to embellish words and strain in them is so that the truth may spread and find good reception in the heart, exalting Allah's religion." But if his joy at the beauty of his own words and people's praise of him is greater than his joy at people's praise of one of his peers, he is deceived; he is merely revolving around seeking status while thinking he seeks religion. Whenever these traits stir in his conscience, they manifest outwardly, so that those who respect him and believe in his merit show him greater reverence and find more joy and gladness in meeting him than in excessively favoring another—even if that other is deserving of loyalty. Matters may even reach the point where people of knowledge become jealous like women, so that it becomes hard for one of them if some of his students attend another, even if he knows they benefit from the other and gain from him in their religion. All of this is an effusion of the destructive traits hidden in the secret heart, which a scholar may think he is safe from while he is deluded therein. This is only revealed by these signs. So the trial of the scholar is great; he is either a master or ruined, and he has no hope in the safety of the common folk. Whoever feels these traits in himself, it is obligatory upon him to seclude himself, seek obscurity, and resist giving legal opinions whenever asked. For in the time of the Companions—may Allah be pleased with them all—the mosque contained all the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, yet they were all cautious, and they would defer legal rulings; each who gave a ruling wished that another would suffice him. At this point, one should beware the devils among mankind if they say, "Do not do this, for if this door is opened, knowledge will vanish from among the people." Let him say to them, "The religion of Islam is independent of me, for it was flourishing before me and will be after me. Were I to die, the pillars of Islam would not collapse, for the religion is independent of me. As for me, I am not independent of rectifying my heart." As for the claim that this leads to the vanishing of knowledge, it is an illusion indicating extreme ignorance. For if people were imprisoned, shackled with chains, and threatened with fire for seeking knowledge, the love of leadership and superiority would drive them to break the chains, demolish fortress walls, emerge, and occupy themselves with seeking knowledge. Knowledge will not vanish as long as Satan makes leadership beloved to creation, and Satan will not cease from his work until the Day of Resurrection. Rather, people will rise to spread knowledge who have no share in the Hereafter, as the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, Allah supports this religion by people who have no portion (in the Hereafter)." The hadith "Allah supports this religion by people who have no portion" has preceded, and "Allah supports this religion by a wicked man" has also preceded in the chapter on knowledge. So the scholar should not be deceived by these deceptions and occupy himself with mixing with people until love of status, praise, and veneration grows in his heart, for that is the seed of hypocrisy. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Love of status and wealth grows hypocrisy in the heart as water grows plants." The hadith "Love of wealth and status grows hypocrisy in the heart" has preceded. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Two hungry wolves sent into a sheepfold do not cause more corruption in it than love of status and wealth in the religion of a Muslim." The hadith "Two hungry wolves sent into a sheepfold" has preceded. And love of status is not uprooted from the heart except by Allah's grace.

The heart cannot be purified except by withdrawing from people, fleeing from their company, and abandoning all that increases one's prestige in their hearts. Therefore, the scholar's reflection should be focused on discerning the hidden traits within his own heart and on discovering the path to salvation from them. This is the duty of the God-fearing scholar. As for the likes of us, our reflection should be on what strengthens our faith in the Day of Reckoning, for if the righteous predecessors saw us, they would certainly say, "These people do not believe in the Day of Reckoning," for our deeds are not the deeds of those who believe in Paradise and Hellfire. Whoever fears something flees from it, and whoever hopes for something seeks it. We know that fleeing from the Fire is by abandoning doubtful matters, the forbidden, and sins, yet we are immersed in them. And seeking Paradise is by multiplying supererogatory acts of obedience, yet we are negligent in fulfilling the obligatory acts. Thus, the only fruit of knowledge we have attained is that we are emulated in greed for this world and in scrambling for it. It is said, "If this were blameworthy, the scholars would be more entitled and more obliged to avoid it than we are." Would that we were like the common folk, so that when we die, our sins die with us! How great is the trial that has befallen us, if we were to reflect! So we ask God Almighty to reform us, to reform others through us, and to grant us success in repentance before He takes our souls. Indeed, He is the Generous, the Kind to us, the Benefactor upon us.

These are the channels of thought for scholars and the righteous in the science of spiritual conduct. When they have completed this, their attention detaches from themselves, and they ascend from it to reflecting on the majesty and greatness of God and to delighting in witnessing Him with the eye of the heart. This is not perfected except after being freed from all destructive traits and being adorned with all saving traits. If anything of it appears before that, it is adulterated, defective, troubled, and intermittent; it is weak like a fleeting flash of lightning that does not settle or last. It is like a lover who is alone with the beloved, but beneath his garments are snakes and scorpions that sting him repeatedly, spoiling for him the delight of witnessing. He has no path to the perfection of delight except by removing the scorpions and snakes from his garments. These blameworthy traits are scorpions and snakes; they are harmful and disturbing. In the grave, the pain of their sting increases beyond the sting of scorpions and snakes. This amount is sufficient to alert one to the channels of a servant's thought regarding the traits of his soul that are beloved and detested by his Lord, the Exalted.

The second category: Reflection on the majesty, greatness, and grandeur of God. Within it are two stations. The highest station is reflection on His Essence, His Attributes, and the meanings of His Names. This is something that has been prohibited, as it is said, "Reflect on the creation of God Almighty, and do not reflect on the Essence of God." This is because minds become bewildered in it. None can extend their gaze toward it except the truthful ones, and even they cannot endure constant gazing. Rather, the condition of all creation's sight in relation to the majesty of God Almighty is like the condition of a bat's sight in relation to the light of the sun, for it cannot bear it at all; rather, it hides by day and only moves about at night, looking at the remnant of the sun's light when it falls upon the earth. The condition of the truthful ones is like the condition of a person looking at the sun: he is able to look at it but cannot endure constancy, and he fears for his sight if he persists in looking. His snatched glances at it cause dimness of vision and scatter the sight. Similarly, gazing upon the Essence of God Almighty causes bewilderment, stupefaction, and disturbance of the intellect. Therefore, the correct course is not to venture into the channels of thought regarding the Essence of God, glorified and exalted is He, and His Attributes, for most minds cannot bear it. Rather, the slight amount that some scholars have explicitly stated—that God Almighty is sanctified above place and exalted beyond directions and spatial relations, that He is not inside the world nor outside it, not connected to the world nor separate from it—has bewildered the minds of some people to the point that they denied it, for they could not bear hearing it and knowing it. Indeed, a group was too weak to bear even less than this, for when it was said to them that He is too great and exalted to have a head, a foot, a hand, an eye, or a limb, and to be a physical body having measure and volume, they denied this and thought it detracted from the greatness and majesty of God. Until some foolish commoners said, "This is a description of an Indian melon, not a description of the Deity!"—due to the poor wretch's assumption that majesty and greatness lie in these limbs. This is because man knows only himself, so he only considers greatness in himself. Thus, whatever does not match him in its attributes, he cannot comprehend greatness in it. Indeed, his utmost is to imagine himself as beautiful in form, seated on his throne, with servants before him carrying out his command. No wonder his utmost in regard to God Almighty and Exalted is to imagine that in order to comprehend greatness. If a fly had intellect and were told, "Your Creator does not have two wings, nor a hand, nor a foot, nor does He fly," it would deny that and say, "How can my Creator be deficient compared to me? Would He be wing-clipped, or be disabled and unable to fly, or would I have an instrument and capability that He does not have, when He is my Creator and Fashioner?" And the intellects of most...

Creation is akin to this intellect, and indeed man is ignorant, oppressive, and ungrateful. Therefore, God Almighty revealed to some of His prophets: "Do not inform My servants of My attributes, lest they deny Me. Rather, inform them about Me with what they can comprehend." Since contemplating the essence and attributes of God Almighty is perilous from this perspective, the propriety of the Sacred Law and the welfare of creation necessitate that one not venture into the channels of thought regarding it. Instead, we turn to the second station, which is contemplating His acts, the courses of His decree, the wonders of His craftsmanship, and the marvels of His command within His creation. For these indicate His majesty, grandeur, holiness, and exaltation, and they point to the perfection of His knowledge and wisdom, and to the execution of His will and power. Thus, one looks at His attributes through the traces of His attributes, for we cannot bear to look at His attributes directly, just as we cannot bear to look at the earth when it is illuminated by the sun's light. We infer from this the greatness of the sun's light in comparison to the light of the moon and other stars, because the earth is an effect of the sun's light. Contemplating the effects indicates the effector in a certain manner, even though it does not substitute for contemplating the effector itself. All existent things in the world are an effect from the effects of God Almighty's power and a light from the lights of His essence. Indeed, there is no darkness more intense than non-existence, and no light more manifest than existence. The existence of all things is a light from the lights of His exalted and holy essence, for the subsistence of things' existence is through His Self-Subsisting essence, just as the subsistence of bodies' light is through the light of the sun which is luminous in itself. Whenever some of the sun is uncovered, it is customary to place a basin of water so that the sun may be seen in it and one can look at it. Thus, the water becomes an intermediary that slightly diminishes the sun's light until it can be endured. Similarly, actions are an intermediary through which we witness the attributes of the Actor, and we are not dazzled by the lights of the Essence after we have distanced ourselves from it through the intermediary of actions. This is the secret of His saying, peace be upon him: "Reflect upon the creation of God, and do not reflect upon the essence of God Almighty."

Explanation of the Manner of Reflecting upon the Creation of God Almighty

Know that everything in existence besides God Almighty is God's action and creation. Every single atom among atoms, whether substance, accident, attribute, or qualified entity, contains wonders and marvels through which God's wisdom, power, majesty, and greatness are manifested. Enumerating that is impossible, for if the sea were ink for that, the sea would be exhausted before a tenth of its tenth is exhausted. However, we point to a summary of it so that it may serve as an example for what is beyond it. We say: Created existents are divided into that whose origin is unknown, so we cannot reflect upon it—and how many existents we do not know, as God Almighty said: "And He creates what you do not know." Glory be to Him who created all pairs from what the earth grows, and from themselves, and from what they do not know. And He said: "And We will develop you in what you do not know."—and into that whose origin and totality are known, but whose details are not known, so we can reflect upon its details. These are divided into what we perceive with the sense of sight and what we do not perceive with sight. As for what we do not perceive with sight, such as the angels, jinn, devils, the Throne, the Footstool, and others, the scope of thought in these things is narrow and obscure. So let us turn to what is closer to comprehension, which is what is perceived by the sense of sight, namely the seven heavens and the earth and what is between them. The heavens are observed with their stars, sun, moon, and their movement and rotation in their rising and setting. The earth is observed with what it contains of its mountains, minerals, rivers, seas, animals, and plants. What is between the heaven and the earth, which is the atmosphere, is perceived with its clouds, rains, snows, thunder, lightning, thunderbolts, shooting stars, and stormy winds. These are the observable genera from the heavens, the earth, and what is between them. Each genus of them divides into species, each species divides into categories, and each category branches into varieties. There is no end to the branching and division of that in the variation of its attributes, forms, and apparent and hidden meanings. All of that is a field for reflection. Not a single atom moves in the heavens and the earth, whether inanimate, plant, animal, celestial sphere, or star, except that God Almighty is its mover, and in its movement there is one wisdom, or two, or ten, or a thousand wisdoms—all of that bears witness to God Almighty's oneness and indicates His majesty and grandeur. These are the signs pointing to Him, and the Qur'an has come urging reflection upon these signs, as God Almighty said: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding." And as He Almighty said: "And among His signs..." from the beginning of the Qur'an to its end. So let us mention the manner of reflection upon some of the signs. Among His signs is the human being, created from a sperm-drop. The closest thing to you is your own self, and within you are wonders indicating the greatness of God.

How can lifetimes suffice to comprehend even a tenth of its tenth, while you remain heedless of it? O you who are heedless of your own self and ignorant of it, how can you aspire to know another when God Almighty has commanded you to contemplate your own soul in His Noble Book, saying, "And in yourselves—will you not then see?" He reminded that you were created from a base drop, saying, "Cursed is man; how ungrateful he is! From what did He create him? From a drop He created him and proportioned him, then made the way easy for him, then causes him to die and buries him, then when He wills, He will resurrect him." And He said, "And among His signs is that He created you from dust, then, behold, you are human beings dispersing." And He said, "Was he not a drop of semen emitted? Then he became a clinging clot; then He created and proportioned." And He said, "Did We not create you from a despised fluid, then placed it in a firm lodging for a known term?" And He said, "Does man not see that We created him from a drop, and at once he is a clear adversary?" And He said, "We created man from a mingled drop, then..." He then mentioned how He made the drop a clinging clot, the clot a lump of flesh, and the lump bones. He said, "And We did create man from an extract of clay, then We placed him as a drop in a secure lodging, then We made the drop a clinging clot..." The repetition of mentioning the drop in the Noble Book is not merely to hear its word and neglect reflection on its meaning. So look now at the drop—a droplet of base water that, if left for an hour exposed to air, would spoil and stink—how did the Lord of Lords extract it from the loins and ribs? How did He unite the male and female and cast affection and love into their hearts? How did He lead them by the chain of love and desire to union? How did He draw forth the drop from the man through the motion of intercourse? How did He gather menstrual blood from the depths of the veins and collect it in the womb? Then how did He create the infant from the drop, nourish it with menstrual fluid until it grew, increased, and became large? How did He make the drop, which is white and bright, a red clinging clot? Then how did He make it a lump? Then how did He divide the parts of the drop, which are equal and similar, into bones, nerves, veins, tendons, and flesh? Then how did He compose from the flesh, nerves, and veins the apparent limbs: the roundness of the head, the apertures of hearing, sight, nose, mouth, and other openings? Then He extended the hand and foot, dividing their ends into fingers, and the fingers into tips. Then how did He construct the internal organs: the heart, stomach, liver, spleen, lungs, womb, bladder, and intestines, each with a specific form, specific measure, for a specific function? Then how did He divide each of these organs into other parts, constructing the eye from seven layers, each layer with a specific attribute and specific form; if one layer were missing or one of its attributes removed, the eye would be disabled from sight. If we were to describe the wonders and signs in each of these organs, lifetimes would not suffice. Now look at the bones—solid, strong bodies—how did He create them from a weak, delicate drop, then made them the framework and support of the body? Then He proportioned them with different measures and different forms: some small, some large, some long, some round, some hollow, some solid, some broad, some slender. Since man needs to move with his whole body and with some of his limbs, requiring mobility for his needs, He did not make his bone a single bone but many bones with joints between them to facilitate movement, and He shaped each according to the movement required of it. Then He connected their joints and bound some to others with tendons that He grew from one end of the bone and attached to the other bone like a tie. Then He created at one end of the bone protruding extensions and at the other sunken cavities matching the shape of the extensions so they enter and fit into them. Thus, when the servant wishes to move a part of his body, it does not resist him; were it not for the joints, it would be impossible for him. Then observe how He created the bones of the head and how He assembled and constructed them; He constructed them from fifty-five bones of different shapes and forms, joining some to others so that the head's sphere became even as you see. Among them, six pertain to the cranium, fourteen to the upper jaw, two to the lower jaw, and the remainder are the teeth—some broad, suitable for grinding; some sharp, suitable for cutting: the canines, molars, and incisors. Then He made the neck a mount for the head and constructed it from seven hollow, rounded vertebrae with curves, additions, and diminutions so that they fit upon one another—the explanation of the wisdom in this would be lengthy. Then He set the neck upon the back and constructed the back from below the neck to the end of the sacrum from twenty-four vertebrae, and constructed the sacrum from three different parts. Connected to it from below is the coccyx bone, which is also composed of three parts. Then He connected the bones of the back to the bones of the chest, the shoulder bones, the bones of the arms, and the pubic bones.

and the bones of the coccyx, the thigh bones, the shin bones, and the toes of the feet. We shall not prolong by enumerating the count of these. The total number of bones in the human body is two hundred and forty-eight bones, excluding the small bones that fill the gaps of the joints. So consider how all of this was created from a lowly, delicate drop. The purpose of mentioning the number of bones is not merely to know their count, for this is a superficial knowledge known to physicians and anatomists. Rather, the aim is to contemplate through them their Manager and Creator—how He measured them, arranged them, varied their forms and sizes, and specified them with this particular number. For if He had increased them by one, it would have been a detriment to the human, requiring its removal; and if He had decreased them by one, it would have been a deficiency requiring its mending. Thus, the physician looks at them to know the method of treatment in mending them, while the people of insight look at them to infer from them the majesty of their Creator and Fashioner. How vast is the difference between the two perspectives!

Then consider how God, exalted is He, created instruments to move the bones, which are the muscles. He created in the human body five hundred and twenty-nine muscles. A muscle is composed of flesh, nerve, ligament, and membranes, and they vary in size and shape according to the difference in their locations and the measure of their needs. Twenty-four of them are for moving the pupil of the eye and its eyelids; if one from their total were missing, the function of the eye would be disrupted. Likewise, for every organ there are muscles of a specific number and specific measure. And the matter of the nerves, veins, and arteries—their number, origins, and branches—is more wondrous than all of this, and its explanation would be lengthy. Thus, there is scope for reflection in each of these parts, then in the totality of the body. All of that is a contemplation of the wonders of the body's forms, but the wonders of the meanings and attributes that are not perceived by the senses are greater. So look now at the outward and inward of the human, at his body and his attributes, and you will see in him such wonders and craftsmanship that compel astonishment. All of that is the making of God within a foul drop of water. So if you see His making in a drop of water, then what of His making in the dominion of the heavens and its stars, and what of His wisdom in their arrangements, forms, measures, numbers, the coming together of some and the separation of others, the difference in their images, and the variation of their risings and settings? Do not think that an atom of the dominion of the heavens is devoid of wisdom and judgment; rather, it is more perfect in structure, more precise in craftsmanship, and more comprehensive of wonders than the human body. Indeed, there is no comparison between all that is on earth and the wonders of the heavens. For that reason, God, exalted is He, said: "Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? He constructed it. He raised its ceiling and proportioned it. And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness."

Now return to the drop and contemplate its state initially and what it became subsequently. And contemplate that if the jinn and mankind were to gather to create for the drop hearing, sight, intellect, power, knowledge, spirit, or to create in it a bone, vein, nerve, skin, or hair, would they be capable of that? Rather, if they wished to know the reality of its essence and the manner of its creation after God, exalted is He, had created it, they would be incapable of it. So the wonder is from you if you look at the image of a human depicted on a wall, where the painter has refined its depiction until it nearly resembles the form of a human, and the observer says, "It is as if it were a human," you are amazed at the craftsmanship of the painter, his skill, the deftness of his hand, and the completeness of his acumen, and he holds a great place in your heart—even though you know that this image was only completed with paint, pen, hand, capability, knowledge, and will, and not one of these is from the action or creation of the painter; rather, it is from the creation of another. The utmost of his action is merely combining the paint and the wall in a specific arrangement. Yet you greatly marvel at him and esteem him, while you see that the foul drop was nonexistent, then its Creator created it in the loins and ribs, then brought it forth from them, formed it, perfected its formation, measured it, perfected its measurement and imaging, divided its similar parts into different parts, firmly set the bones in their places, beautified the forms of its limbs, adorned its outward and inward, arranged its veins and nerves, made them a passage for its nourishment to be a cause for its permanence, and made it hearing, seeing, knowing, and speaking. He created for it the back as a foundation for its body, the belly as a container for the instruments of its nourishment, and the head as a gatherer of its senses. He opened the two eyes, arranged their layers, perfected their form, color, and conditions, then protected them with eyelids to cover them, preserve them, polish them, and repel impurities from them. Then He manifested within the measure of its lens the image of the heavens despite the vastness of their expanses and the remoteness of their extremities, so it gazes upon them. Then He slit its two ears and deposited in them a bitter water to preserve its hearing and repel insects from them, and surrounded them with the concha of the ear to gather sound and return it to its auditory canal, and to sense the creeping of insects toward it. And He placed in them curves and bends to increase the movement of what creeps within them.

And his path lengthens, so the sleeper awakens when a mount intends it in the state of sleep. Then He raised the nose from the center of the face and perfected its form, opened its nostrils, and placed within it the sense of smell, that he might discern through inhaling scents his sustenance and nourishment, and that he might inhale through the passage of the nostrils the spirit of the air as nourishment for his heart and a cooling for the inner heat. And He opened the mouth and placed within it the tongue as a speaker, interpreter, and articulator of what is in the heart. He adorned the mouth with teeth to be instruments for grinding, breaking, and cutting, firmly setting their roots, sharpening their tips, whitening their color, and arranging their rows with even tips and harmonious order, as if they were strung pearls. He created the lips and beautified their color and shape to close upon the mouth, sealing its opening, and to complete with them the letters of speech. He created the throat and prepared it for the emission of sound, and created for the tongue a capacity for movements and segmentations, that the sound might be divided into different points of articulation, differing thereby the letters, broadening thereby the path of utterance through their multitude. Then He created the larynxes of differing forms in narrowness and breadth, roughness and smoothness, hardness and softness of substance, and length and shortness, until because of them the voices differed, so that no two voices are alike; rather, a distinction appears between every two sounds, so that the listener may distinguish some people from others by mere voice in the darkness. Then He adorned the head with hair and temples, adorned the face with the beard and eyebrows, adorned the eyebrow with the fineness of hair and the arch of form, and adorned the eyes with eyelashes.

Then He created the inner organs and subjugated each one to a specific function: He subjugated the stomach to digest food, the liver to transform food into blood, and the spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys to serve the liver. Thus the spleen serves it by drawing black bile away from it, the gallbladder serves it by drawing yellow bile away from it, the kidneys serve it by drawing watery fluid away from it, and the bladder serves the kidneys by receiving water from them, then expelling it through the urethra. The veins serve the liver in conveying blood to all parts of the body.

Then He created the two hands and lengthened them to reach for objectives, widened the palm, divided the five fingers, and divided each finger into three phalanges, placing the four on one side and the thumb on the other, so that the thumb may revolve around all of them. Had the first and the last gathered to devise, with subtle thought, another manner for the arrangement of the fingers besides that upon which they were placed—with the thumb apart from the four, the variation of the four in length, and their arrangement in a single row—they would not have been capable of it. For by this arrangement the hand became fit for grasping and giving: if he spreads it, it becomes a tray upon which he places what he wills; if he closes it, it becomes an instrument for striking; if he cups it incompletely, it becomes a scoop for him; if he spreads it and closes its fingers, it becomes a shovel for him. Then He created nails upon their tips as an adornment for the fingertips and a support for them from behind, so that they are not severed, and that he may pick up with them delicate things that the fingertips cannot take, and scratch his body with them when needed. For the nail, which is the basest of limbs, if a human lacked it and an itch appeared on him, he would be the most helpless and weakest of creatures, and none could take its place in scratching his body. Then He guided the hand to the place of the itch, so that it extends to it even in sleep and heedlessness, without need for seeking; and if he sought help from another, he would not find the place of the itch except after long toil.

Then He created all of this from a sperm-drop while it is inside the womb within three darknesses. Had the cover and membrane been removed and sight extended to it, one would see the delineation and formation appearing upon it gradually, but would not see the Former nor His instrument. Have you seen a former or an agent who does not touch His instrument and His creation, nor meet it, while He fashions within it? Glory be to Him! How magnificent is His affair and how evident His proof!

Then observe, along with the perfection of His power, the completeness of His mercy. For when the womb became too narrow for the child as he grew, how did He guide him to the way until he turned upside down, moved, and emerged from that constriction, seeking the exit as if he were an intelligent seer of what he needed? Then when he emerged and needed nourishment, how did He guide him to seize the breast? Then when his body was delicate, unable to bear dense foods, how did He arrange for him in creating the subtle milk, extracting it from between dung and blood as a pure, pleasant drink? And how did He create the two breasts and gathered within them the milk, and caused to grow from them two nipples of a measure that the child’s mouth can encompass? Then He opened in the nipple of the breast an extremely narrow hole, so that milk does not come out from it except gradually through sucking, for the infant cannot tolerate from it except a little. Then how did He guide him to suck, so that he extracts from that narrow passage much milk in times of severe hunger?

Then look at His compassion, mercy, and tenderness: how He delayed the creation of teeth until the completion of two years, because during the two years he is nourished only by milk, thus having no need for teeth; and when he grows older, the subtle milk no longer suits him.

He requires coarse food, and the food requires chewing and grinding, so He caused teeth to grow for him at the time of need—neither before nor after. Glory be to Him! How did He bring forth those hard bones within those soft gums? Then He instilled tenderness in the parents’ hearts to care for him at a time when he was incapable of managing his own affairs. Had God not cast mercy upon their hearts, the child would have been the most helpless of creatures in managing himself. Then observe how He provided him with capability, discernment, intellect, and guidance gradually until he reached maturity and became complete, passing through adolescence, then youth, then middle age, then old age—whether as an ungrateful or grateful one, obedient or disobedient, believer or disbeliever—in confirmation of His exalted word: “Has there come upon man a period of time when he was nothing remembered? Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture that We may test him; and We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful.” So look at the subtle kindness and generosity, then at the power and wisdom; the wonders of the Divine Presence will astonish you. Yet the greatest wonder is of one who sees beautiful calligraphy or an exquisite design on a wall, admires it, and devotes all his thought to pondering the calligrapher and the designer—how he designed and wrote it, and how he mastered it—continuing to marvel inwardly, saying, “How skillful he is! How perfect his craft and how excellent his ability!” Then he looks at these wonders within himself and others yet remains heedless of their Maker and Fashioner, neither awestruck by His greatness nor bewildered by His majesty and wisdom. These are but a glimpse of the wonders of your own body, which cannot be fully enumerated; it is the closest field for your reflection and the clearest witness to the greatness of your Creator. Yet you are heedless of this, preoccupied with your belly and your private parts, knowing nothing of yourself except that you hunger so you eat, become full so you sleep, desire so you copulate, and become angry so you fight. All animals share with you in knowing that. The distinctive quality of the human being, which is veiled from animals, is knowing God Almighty through contemplation of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and the wonders of the horizons and the selves, for through this the servant enters the company of the angels brought near and is resurrected among the prophets and the truthful, brought close to the presence of the Lord of the worlds. This station is not for animals, nor for a human who is content with the worldly desires of animals, for he is worse than animals by far, since the animal has no capacity for that, whereas he—God created for him the capacity, then he left it idle and was ungrateful for God’s blessing in it. Those are like cattle—rather, they are more astray in way. When you know the path of reflection upon yourself, then reflect upon the earth, which is your dwelling place, then upon its rivers, mountains, and mines. Then rise from it to the kingdom of the heavens. As for the earth, among His signs is that He made the earth a resting place and a bed, and placed therein broad pathways, and made it subservient so that you may travel through its tracts, and made it stable so that it does not shake, and set therein mountains as pegs to hold it firm lest it sway, then spread out its expanses until human beings, despite long lives and much travel, are unable to reach all its regions. Thus He says, “And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are its expander. And the earth We spread out, and excellent are the spreaders.” And He says, “It is He who made the earth subservient to you, so walk through its tracts.” And He says, “Who made for you the earth a resting place.” He has frequently mentioned the earth in His mighty Book so that one may reflect upon its wonders: its surface is an abode for the living and its interior a resting place for the dead. He says, “Have We not made the earth a container for the living and the dead?” Look at the earth when it is lifeless; then when water is sent down upon it, it quivers, swells, grows green, and brings forth wondrous plants, and from it emerge various kinds of animals. Then observe how He has fortified the sides of the earth with towering, lofty, solid, firm mountains, and how He stored waters beneath it, gushing forth springs and causing rivers to flow upon its surface, and brought forth from dry stones and turbid soil delicate, sweet, pure, fresh water, and with it gave life to every living thing, bringing forth thereby varieties of trees and plants—grains, grapes, herbs, olives, date palms, pomegranates, and countless fruits differing in shapes, colors, tastes, qualities, and scents, some excelling others in edibility, all watered by one water and emerging from one earth. If you say their difference is due to the difference in their seeds and origins, when was there in a date pit a palm tree laden with clusters of fresh dates? When was there in a single grain ears of wheat, each ear bearing a hundred grains? Then look at the desert land and examine its surface and interior; you will find it uniform soil. Yet when water is sent down upon it, it quivers, swells, and brings forth from every splendid pair varied colors and plants, similar and dissimilar, each with a taste, scent, color, and shape distinct from the other. Consider their abundance, the diversity of their kinds, the multitude of their forms, then the differing natures of plants and the abundance of their benefits, and how He deposited...

Allah, exalted be He, has created remedies with wondrous benefits: this plant nourishes, that one strengthens, this one revives, that one kills, this cools, that heats. This, when it reaches the stomach, suppresses yellow bile from the depths of the veins; that transforms into yellow bile. This suppresses phlegm and black bile; that transforms into them. This purifies the blood; that corrupts it. This gladdens; that induces sleep. This strengthens; that weakens. Not a single leaf or blade sprouts from the earth without containing benefits whose essence mankind cannot fully comprehend. Each of these plants requires the farmer to employ a specific method in its cultivation: date palms are affected by generosity and are pruned; crops are cleared of weeds and thickets. Some are propagated by scattering seed in the earth, some by planting cuttings, some by grafting onto trees. Were we to attempt to describe the different genera of plants, their varieties, benefits, conditions, and marvels, the days would be insufficient for such description. Let a brief mention from each genus suffice to guide you to the path of reflection. These are the marvels of plants.

Among His signs are the precious substances deposited beneath the mountains and the minerals obtained from the earth. In the earth are adjacent yet diverse regions. Consider the mountains: how from them emerge precious substances like gold, silver, turquoise, ruby, and others. Some are malleable under hammers, like gold, silver, copper, lead, and iron; some are not, like turquoise and ruby. And how Allah has guided mankind to extract them, purify them, and fashion from them vessels, tools, currency, and ornaments. Then consider the earth's minerals: petroleum, sulfur, pitch, and others, the least of which is salt, needed only to season food. Were a land to be devoid of it, destruction would swiftly befall it. Consider the mercy of Allah, exalted be He: how He created some lands inherently saline, so that when pure rainwater collects there, it transforms into a burning, intensely salty brine, of which not a speck could be consumed—yet it serves to season your food when you eat it, so that your life may be pleasant.

There is no inanimate object, animal, or plant that does not contain wisdom and purpose of this kind. He created none of them in vain, for sport, or in jest. Rather, He created all in truth, as is fitting, in the manner that is fitting, and as befits His Majesty, Generosity, and Subtlety. Therefore, He, exalted be He, said: "We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in play. We created them not except in truth." (Qur'an 44:38-39)

Among His signs are the various kinds of animals and their division into those that fly and those that walk; and the division of those that walk into those that walk on two legs, on four, on ten, or on a hundred, as observed in some insects. Then consider their division in benefits, forms, shapes, morals, and natures. Look at the birds of the air, the wild beasts of the land, and the domesticated animals: you will see in them marvels, and you will have no doubt concerning the greatness of their Creator, the power of their Determiner, and the wisdom of their Fashioner. How could this be exhaustively described? Indeed, were we to mention the marvels of the flea, the ant, the date palm, or the spider—which is among the small animals—in its building of its home, its gathering of its sustenance, its affection for its mate, its storing for itself, its skill in the geometry of its house, and its guidance to its needs, we would be incapable of doing so.

You see the spider building its house on the bank of a river. It first seeks two proximate points with a gap of about an arm's length or less, so it can span a thread between the two ends. Then it begins, casting the saliva which is its thread onto one side so it adheres, then goes to the other side and fastens the other end of the thread. It repeats this a second and third time, arranging the distances between them in proportional, geometrical harmony. When it has firmly secured the knots and arranged the threads like the warp, it works on the weft, placing the weft upon the warp, joining some to some, and firmly tying the knot at the point where the weft meets the warp. It observes geometrical proportion in all of this, making it a net in which fleas and flies are caught. It sits in a corner, lying in wait for prey to fall into the net. If prey falls, it hastens to seize and eat it. If it fails to catch prey thus, it seeks for itself a corner of a wall, connects the two sides of the corner with a thread, then suspends itself in it with another thread and remains hanging in the air, waiting for a fly to fly by. When one flies, it launches itself at it, seizes it, winds its thread around its legs, secures it, then eats it.

There is no animal, small or large, without marvels beyond enumeration. Do you suppose it learned this craft by itself? Or that it fashioned itself? Or that it is a human who taught it? Or that it has no guide and no teacher? Can one of insight doubt that it is a feeble, weak, incapable creature? Even the elephant, immense in body and manifest in strength, is incapable of managing its own affairs. How then is this?

The feeble animal—does it not testify through its form, image, movement, guidance, and wondrous craftsmanship to its Wise Originator, its Powerful, Knowing Creator? The discerning observer sees in this small creature such majesty of the All-Sustaining Creator, such grandeur, such perfection of His power and wisdom, that minds and intellects are bewildered—let alone other animals. This subject too is boundless, for animals, their forms, their dispositions, and their natures are beyond enumeration. The heart’s wonder at them has faded only due to familiarity from constant observation. Yet if one sees a strange creature, even a worm, fresh amazement arises, and he says, “Glory to God, how wondrous it is!” And man is the most wondrous of animals, yet he does not marvel at himself. Rather, if he looks at the livestock he is accustomed to, observing their forms and images, then their benefits and uses—their skins, wool, hair, and fur which God has made as clothing for His creation and as dwellings for them in travel and settlement, as vessels for their drinks and containers for their food, and protection for their feet; and He has made their milk and meat nourishment for them; then appointed some as mounts for display and others as bearers of burdens, traversing distant deserts and wastelands—most observers would be amazed at the wisdom of their Creator and Fashioner. For He created them only with an all-encompassing knowledge of all their benefits, preceding their creation. So glory be to Him to whom matters are unveiled in His knowledge without reflection, without pondering and deliberation, and without aid of any minister or advisor. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, the All-Powerful. Indeed, with the least of what He has created, He has drawn forth sincere testimony from the hearts of those who know His oneness. So creation has no choice but to submit to His overwhelming power, acknowledge His lordship, and confess inability to comprehend His majesty and greatness. For who can enumerate praise of Him? Rather, He is as He has praised Himself. The utmost of our knowledge is to confess inability to know Him. So we ask God Almighty to honor us with His guidance through His grace and compassion.

And among His signs are the deep seas encompassing the regions of the earth, which are parts of the great ocean surrounding the entire earth, such that all that is exposed of deserts, mountains, and land compared to the water is like a small island in a vast sea, and the rest of the earth is covered by water. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The earth in the sea is like a stable on land.” Compare a stable to the entire earth and know that the earth compared to the sea is like that. I have witnessed the wonders of the earth and what is in it; now contemplate the wonders of the sea, for the marvels of its creatures and jewels are many times greater than the marvels you observe on the face of the earth, just as its expanse is many times greater than the earth’s expanse. Due to the sea’s immensity, there are in it such enormous creatures that you see their backs in the sea and think they are islands, so passengers disembark upon them; then perhaps they sense fires when lit, so they move, and it is known they are animals. There is no category of land animal—be it horse, bird, cattle, or human—but that in the sea there are their like and multiples thereof, and there are kinds that have no counterpart on land. Their descriptions have been recorded in volumes, collected by people devoted to sailing the seas and gathering its wonders.

Then observe how God created the pearl and its roundness within its shell under water, and see how coral grows from solid rocks beneath the water—it is a plant in the form of a tree growing from stone. Then consider besides that ambergris and varieties of precious things which the sea casts forth and from which they are extracted. Then look at the marvel of ships—how God Almighty holds them upon the surface of the water, and merchants, seekers of wealth, and others travel in them, and He has subjected the vessels to carry their burdens. Then He sends winds to drive the ships, and He has made sailors acquainted with the sources, directions, and timings of the winds. The wonders of God’s craftsmanship in the sea cannot be exhaustively recorded in volumes.

Yet more astonishing than all that is what is more evident than every evident thing: the nature of a drop of water. It is a delicate, subtle, flowing, transparent body, its parts connected as if a single subtle structure, readily accepting division as if separate, subservient to manipulation, capable of separation and union. Through it is the life of every animal and plant on the face of the earth. If a servant needed a sip of water and was denied it, he would give all the treasuries of the earth and the dominion of the world to obtain it, if he possessed that. Then if he drank it and was prevented from expelling it, he would give all the treasuries of the earth and the dominion of the world to expel it. So it is astonishing how man esteems the dinar and dirham and precious jewels, yet neglects God’s blessing in a sip of water—for if he needed to drink it or relieve himself of it, he would give the entire world for it. Reflect.

In the wonders of waters, rivers, wells, and seas, there is ample scope for reflection and contemplation. All of these are manifest testimonies and harmonious signs, speaking through their very state, eloquently declaring the majesty of their Creator, expressing the perfection of His wisdom within them. They call out to the possessors of hearts with their melodies, saying to every possessor of intellect: "Do you not see me and see my form, my composition, my attributes, my benefits, the variation of my states, and the multitude of my uses? Do you suppose that I created myself, or that one of my own kind created me? Or do you not feel ashamed to look upon a word inscribed with three letters and conclude that it is from the craft of a human being—a knowing, capable, willing, speaking being—then look upon the wonders of the divine lines inscribed upon the pages of my face by the divine pen, whose essence, movement, and connection to the place of inscription the eyes cannot comprehend? Yet your heart is unmoved by the majesty of its Maker."

And the sperm-drop says to the possessors of hearing and heart—not to those who are isolated from hearing—"Imagine me, immersed in the darkness of the womb, soaked in menstrual blood, at the time when delineation and formation appear upon my face, and the engraver unfurls my pupil, my eyelids, my forehead, my cheek, and my lip. You see the curvature appear gradually, yet you see no engraver within the sperm-drop, nor outside it, nor inside the womb, nor outside it. Nor is there any news of it from the mother, nor the father, nor the sperm-drop, nor the womb. Is this engraving not more wondrous than what we observe being engraved by a pen into an astonishing form? If you looked upon it once or twice, you would learn it. But are you able to learn this kind of engraving and formation that encompasses the exterior and interior of the sperm-drop and all its parts, without touching the sperm-drop and without connection to it, neither from within nor from without? If you are not astonished by these wonders and do not understand through them that the One who formed, engraved, and ordained has no equal and no engraver or fashioner matches Him—just as His engraving and creation are unmatched by any engraving or creation—for between the agents is a distinction and distance like that between the acts. If you are not astonished by this, then be astonished at your lack of astonishment, for it is more astonishing than every wonder. For He who blinded your insight despite this clarity and prevented you from discernment despite this explanation is truly worthy of your astonishment."

Glory be to the One who guides and leads astray, who misguides and directs, who makes wretched and makes happy, and who opened the insights of His beloved so they witnessed Him in all the atoms of the world and its parts, and blinded the hearts of His enemies and veiled Himself from them with His might and loftiness. To Him belongs creation and command, grace and favor, gentleness and overpowering might. None can repel His decree nor reverse His judgment.

And among His signs is the subtle air, confined between the concave of the sky and the convex of the earth. Its substance is perceived by the sense of touch when the winds blow, yet its person and totality are not seen by the eye. It is like a single sea, and the birds soar in the atmosphere of the sky and race swimming within it with their wings, just as the creatures of the sea swim in water. Its sides and waves are agitated when the winds blow, just as the waves of the sea are agitated. So when God sets the air in motion and makes it a blowing wind, if He wills, He makes it a herald of His mercy, as He, glorified be He, said: "And We send the fertilizing winds." Through its movement, the spirit of the air reaches animals and plants, preparing them for growth. And if He wills, He makes it a punishment upon the disobedient among His creation, as God Almighty said: "Indeed, We sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune, plucking the people as if they were uprooted palm trunks."

Then observe the subtlety of the air, then its intensity and strength. However much it is compressed in water, the inflated bladder which a strong man strives to submerge in water, he is unable to do so. And solid iron placed upon the surface of water sinks in it. So see how the air resists the water with its strength despite its subtlety. And by this wisdom, God Almighty holds ships upon the face of the water. Likewise, every hollow containing air does not sink in water because the air resists submerging in water and does not separate from the interior surface of the ship. Thus the heavy ship, despite its strength and solidity, remains suspended in the subtle air, like one who falls into a well and clings to the garment of a strong man, preventing him from falling into the well. So the ship, with its concave hull, clings to the garments of the strong air until it is prevented from falling and sinking into the water. Glory be to the One who suspends the heavy vessel in the subtle air without a visible link or a tightening knot.

Then observe the wonders of the atmosphere and what appears within it of clouds, thunder, lightning, rain, snow, meteors, and thunderbolts. These are wonders between the heaven and the earth. The Quran has alluded to the totality of this in His saying: "And We did not create the heavens and the earth and that between them in play." And this is that which is between them. And He alluded to its details in various places where He said: "And the clouds subjected between the heaven and the earth," and where He mentions the thunder, lightning, clouds, and rain. So if you have no share of...

This statement, unless you see the rain with your own eyes and hear the thunder with your own ears, then the beast shares in this knowledge with you. So rise from the lowly realm of beasts to the world of the Highest Assembly. For your eyes have been opened, and you have perceived its outward aspect. Now close your outward eye and look with your inner insight to behold the wonders of its inward aspect and the marvels of its secrets. This too is a door that stretches the intellect, for there is no hope of exhausting it. So contemplate the dense, dark cloud: how you see it gather in a clear atmosphere, free of any turbidity, and how Allah the Exalted creates it when He wills and as He wills. Despite its softness, it carries the heavy water and holds it within the atmosphere of the sky until Allah permits the sending down of the water and the breaking of the layers, each drop with the measure that Allah the Exalted has willed and in the form that He has desired. You see the cloud sprinkle water upon the earth, sending it down as separate droplets; one drop does not overtake another, nor does one connect with another. Rather, each descends upon the path that has been decreed for it, not deviating from it, so the later does not advance nor the earlier delay, until it reaches the earth drop by drop. If the first and the last were to gather to create from it a single drop, or to know the number of what descends in a single town or village, the calculation of jinn and mankind would fall short of that. None knows their number except the One who brought them into being. Then, each drop is designated for every part of the earth and for every living creature upon it—bird, wild beast, all insects and animals. Written upon that drop, in a divine script imperceptible to the outward sight, is that it is the provision for such-and-such worm in such-and-such corner of such-and-such mountain, reaching it at the time of its thirst at such-and-such moment. This is alongside the marvels, beyond enumeration, in the formation of solid hail from subtle water and in the scattering of snow like carded cotton. All of this is a favor from the Compelling, the Omnipotent, and a subjugation from the Creator, the Overpowering, in which no creature has any partnership or entry. Rather, for the believers regarding His creation there is only submission and humility before His majesty and greatness, and for the blind deniers there is only ignorance of its nature and the casting of conjectures concerning its cause and reason. Thus, the deluded ignorant one says, "Water descends only because it is heavy by its nature, and this is the cause of its descent." He thinks this is a knowledge that has been unveiled to him and rejoices in it. If it were said to him, "What is the meaning of 'nature'? What created it? Who created the water whose nature is heaviness? And what raised the water poured at the base of the tree to the tops of the branches, when it is heavy by its nature? How did it descend downward, then ascend upward within the cavities of the trees, bit by bit, unseen and unobserved, until it spreads to all the extremities of the leaves, nourishing every part of each leaf, flowing to them through the cavities of minute capillary veins, watering the vein that is the origin of the leaf? Then from that large vein extended along the length of the leaf spread smaller veins, as if the large one were a river and what branched from it were streams. Then from the streams branch smaller channels, then from them spread delicate, spider-web-like threads, escaping the perception of sight, until they extend across the entire breadth of the leaf, so the water reaches within its cavities to all parts of the leaf to nourish it, make it grow, and adorn it, preserving its freshness and radiance. And likewise to all parts of the fruits. If water moves by its nature downward, how then did it move upward?" If it is said that a force of attraction draws it, then what subjugated that attracting force? And if it ultimately leads back to the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Compeller of the dominion and the kingdom, then why not refer it to Him from the very outset? The end of the ignorant is the beginning of the wise. Among His signs is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them of the celestial bodies, and that is the whole matter. Whoever comprehends the whole but misses the wonders of the heavens has indeed missed the whole in truth. The earth, the seas, the air, and every body other than the heavens, in comparison to the heavens, are but a drop in an ocean, and smaller still. Then observe how Allah magnified the affair of the heavens and the stars in His Book. There is no chapter except that it contains their glorification in various places. How many oaths in the Qur'an are sworn by them, such as His saying, "By the sky full of constellations," and "By the sky and the night comer," and "By the sky with its pathways," and "By the sky and He who constructed it," and His saying, "By the sun and its brightness and the moon when it follows it," and His saying, "So I swear by the retreating stars," and His saying, "By the star when it descends. No! I swear by the setting of the stars—and indeed, it is a great oath, if you only knew." You have learned that the wonders of the filthy drop have confounded the knowledge of the first and the last, and Allah did not swear by it. So what is your thought concerning that by which Allah the Exalted has sworn, and upon which He has made the provisions depend, attributing them to it, saying, "And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised," and He praised those who reflect upon it, saying, "And they reflect."

In the creation of the heavens and the earth. And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Woe to him who recites this verse and then wipes his forehead with it"—a hadith meaning: "Woe to him who recites this verse and then wipes his forehead with it," that is, the saying of the Exalted: "And who reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth." It means to pass over it without reflection, and He censured those who turn away from it, saying: "And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away." So what is the proportion of all the seas and the earth to the sky, when they are subject to change in proximity, while the heavens are solid, strong, preserved from change until the Book reaches its term? For this reason, God the Exalted named it 'protected,' saying: "And We made the sky a protected ceiling," and He, glorified be He, said: "And We constructed above you seven strong [heavens]," and He said: "Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? He constructed it. He raised its ceiling and proportioned it." So look to the dominion that you may see the wonders of might and sovereignty. And do not suppose that the meaning of looking to the dominion is by extending your sight to it so that you see the blueness of the sky and the light of the stars and their dispersion, for the beasts share with you in this looking. If this were the intended meaning, then why did God the Exalted praise Abraham by saying: "And thus did We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth"? Rather, everything perceived by the sense of sight, the Quran expresses with 'kingdom' and 'the witnessed,' and what is absent from sights, He expresses with 'the unseen' and 'the dominion.' And God the Exalted is Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Compeller of the kingdom and the dominion. And no one encompasses anything of His knowledge except by what He wills. And He is Knower of the unseen, so He does not reveal His unseen to anyone except a messenger He has approved. So consider, O intelligent one, reflect upon the dominion, perhaps the gates of heaven will be opened for you and you may roam with your heart in its regions until your heart stands before the Throne of the Merciful. At that point, perhaps you may hope to reach the rank of Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, when he said: "My heart saw my Lord." This is because reaching the utmost cannot be except after traversing the nearest. The nearest thing to you is your own self, then the earth which is your abode, then the air enveloping you, then the plants and animals and what is on the face of the earth, then the wonders of the atmosphere, which is what is between the heaven and the earth, then the seven heavens with their stars, then the Footstool, then the Throne, then the angels who are the bearers of the Throne and the keepers of the heavens. Then from there you pass to gazing upon the Lord of the Throne, the Footstool, the heavens and the earth, and what is between them. Yet between you and these great distances, vast spans, and towering obstacles, you have not yet finished with the nearest, descending obstacle, which is knowledge of the outward aspect of your own self. Then you have the audacity to let loose your tongue and claim knowledge of your Lord, saying: "I have known Him and known His creation." So in what shall I reflect? To what shall I aspire? So raise your head now to the sky and look into it and into its stars, and into their rotation, their rising and setting, its sun and moon, the variation of their risings and settings, and their constant, unceasing motion without slackening in their movement and without change in their course. Rather, they all run in ordained stations by a determined measure, neither increasing nor decreasing, until God the Exalted folds them up like the rolling up of a scroll for a record. And ponder the number of its stars and their multitude, and the variation of their colors: some incline to redness, some to whiteness, some to a leaden color. Then observe the manner of their forms: some are in the shape of a scorpion, some in the shape of Aries, Taurus, Leo, and the human. There is no form on earth except that it has a likeness in the sky. Then observe the course of the sun in its orbit over the period of a year, yet it rises each day and sets by another motion which its Creator has subjugated for it. Were it not for its rising and setting, night and day would not differ, times would not be known, and darkness would perpetually prevail, or light perpetually, so that time for livelihood would not be distinguished from time for rest. So see how God the Exalted has made the night a covering and sleep a repose, and the day for livelihood. And look at His insertion of the night into the day and the day into the night, and His bringing increase and decrease upon them in a specific order. And look at His inclining the course of the sun from the center of the sky, whereby summer and winter, spring and autumn differ. When the sun declines from the center of the sky in its course, the air cools and winter appears; when it is at the center of the sky, the heat intensifies; and when it is between them, the season is moderate. The wonders of the heavens are beyond any hope of enumerating a tenth of a tenth of their parts. This is merely an alert to the path of reflection. And believe in a general way that there is no star among the stars except that God the Exalted has many wise purposes in its creation, then in its size, then in its shape, then in its color, then in its placement in the sky and its proximity to the stars beside it and its distance. And apply this analogy to what...

We have mentioned the parts of your body, for there is no part except that within it lies wisdom—indeed, many wisdoms and divine commands. The realm of heaven is greater; indeed, there is no comparison between the earthly realm and the heavenly realm, neither in the vastness of bodies nor in the abundance of meanings. Measure the disparity between them in the abundance of meanings by the disparity between them in the vastness of the Earth. You know from the Earth’s enormity and the expanse of its reaches that no human can encompass it or traverse its sides. Observers have agreed that the Sun is about one hundred and sixty times the size of the Earth, and in reports there is evidence of its greatness—the hadith indicating the Sun’s magnitude, narrated by Ahmad from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, saw the Sun as it set and said, “In the blazing fire of Allah; were it not for what restrains it by Allah’s command, it would destroy all that is on Earth.” And in al-Tabarani’s al-Kabir, from the hadith of Abu Umamah: “Nine angels are entrusted with the Sun, casting snow upon it every day; were it not for that, nothing would remain unburned.” Then the stars you see—the smallest of them is about eight times the Earth, and the largest reaches nearly one hundred and twenty times the Earth. By this you know their height and distance, for to the servant they appear small, and thus Allah the Exalted alluded to their distance, saying, “He raised its canopy and fashioned it.” In reports, the distance between each heaven is a journey of five hundred years—a hadith: “Between each heaven and the next is five hundred years,” reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of al-Hasan from Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is rare. He said it is also narrated from Ayyub, Yunus ibn ‘Ubayd, and ‘Ali ibn Zayd, who said al-Hasan did not hear from Abu Hurayrah. Abu al-Shaykh reported it in al-‘Azamah from the narration of Abu Nasrah from Abu Dharr, and its narrators are trustworthy, though it is not known if Abu Nasrah heard from Abu Dharr. If a single star is estimated to be multiples of the Earth, then consider the multitude of stars, then look to the heaven in which the stars are fixed and its immensity, then observe the speed of its motion while you do not perceive its movement, let alone comprehend its speed. Yet you do not doubt that in a moment it travels the width of a star, for the time from the rising of the first part of a star to its completion is brief, and that star is about one hundred times the Earth or more. Thus, the celestial sphere in that moment has traveled the equivalent of one hundred Earths, and so it rotates perpetually while you are heedless of it. Consider how Gabriel, peace be upon him, expressed the speed of his motion when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked him, “Has the Sun set?” He said, “No. Yes.” He said, “How do you say ‘No, yes’?” He replied, “From the moment I said ‘No’ until I said ‘Yes,’ the Sun traveled a distance of five hundred years.” A hadith states that he said to Gabriel, “Has the Sun set?” He said, “No. Yes.” He said, “How do you say ‘No, yes’?” He replied, “From the moment I said ‘No’ until I said ‘Yes,’ the Sun traveled a journey of five hundred years”—I found no source for it. Reflect on the greatness of its form, then on the lightness of its motion, then consider the power of the Wise Creator, how He established its image despite the vastness of its expanse within the pupil of the eye despite its smallness, so that you sit on Earth, open your eyes toward it, and see it entirely. This heaven, with its immensity and multitude of stars—do not gaze at it, but look to its Maker, how He created it, then held it without pillars you can see and without supports from above it. The entire world is like a single house, with the heaven as its roof. It is astonishing that you enter the house of a wealthy person and see it adorned with dyes and embellished with gold, and your amazement at it does not cease; you continually mention and describe its beauty your whole life. Yet you are always looking at this great house—its ground, its roof, its air, the wonders of its furnishings, the marvels of its animals, and the exquisite engravings—then you do not converse about it nor turn your heart to it. How is this house less than that house you describe? Rather, that house is also a part of the Earth, which is the lowliest part of this house, and despite this you do not contemplate it. There is no reason for this except that it is the house of your Lord—He alone built and arranged it—and you have forgotten yourself, your Lord, and the house of your Lord, preoccupied with your belly and your private parts, having no concern except your desire or your reputation. The utmost of your desire is to fill your belly, yet you cannot eat a tenth of what an animal eats, so the animal surpasses you by ten degrees. The utmost of your reputation is that ten or a hundred of your acquaintances flatter you with their tongues in your presence while concealing vile beliefs about you. Even if they are sincere in their affection for you, they possess for you nor for themselves any benefit, harm, death, life, or resurrection. There may be in your land wealthy Jews and Christians whose status exceeds yours, and you have busied yourself with this vanity and neglected to reflect on the beauty of the kingdom of the heavens and the Earth, then neglected to delight in gazing upon the majesty of the Master of the Kingdom.

The king and what is like you and your intellect is but like an ant emerging from its hole, which it has dug within a towering, fortified palace of the king, lofty in construction, strong in foundations, adorned with maidens and servants, and various treasures and precious things. When it emerges from its hole and meets its companion, if it were capable of speech, it would speak only of its nest, its sustenance, and how it stores it. As for the state of the palace and the king within it, it is remote from that and from contemplating it. Indeed, it has no capacity to extend its gaze beyond itself, its sustenance, and its nest to anything else. And just as the ant is heedless of the palace, its ground, its roof, its walls, and all its structure, and is also heedless of its inhabitants, so too are you heedless of the House of God Almighty and of His angels who are the inhabitants of its courtyards. You know of the heaven only what the ant knows of the roof of your house, and you know of the angels of the heavens only what the ant knows of you and the inhabitants of your house. Indeed, the ant has no way to know you and the wonders of your palace and the marvels of the Maker's craftsmanship within it. But as for you, you have the capacity to roam in the dominion and know of its wonders what creation is heedless of.

Let us rein in the discourse from this pattern, for it is a field without end. Were we to expend long lifetimes, we could not manage to explain what God Almighty has favored us with in knowing. All that we have known is a scant, trivial little in comparison to what the totality of scholars and saints have known. And what they have known is a scant, trivial little in comparison to what the prophets, upon them be prayers and peace, have known. And the totality of what they have known is little in comparison to what Muhammad, our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, has known. And what all the prophets have known is little in comparison to what the close angels, such as Israfil and Jibril and others, have known. Then, all the knowledge of the angels, the jinn, and mankind, when compared to the knowledge of God, Glorified and Exalted be He, does not deserve to be called knowledge. Rather, it is closer to being called bewilderment, perplexity, inadequacy, and incapacity. So glory be to Him who made known to His servants what He made known, then addressed all of them saying, "And you have not been given of knowledge except a little."

This is an exposition of the focal points around which the thoughts of those who reflect upon the creation of God Almighty revolve. There is no reflection therein upon the Essence of God Almighty, but from reflection upon creation inevitably comes knowledge of the Creator, His majesty, His grandeur, and His power. The more you increase in knowledge of the wondrous craftsmanship of God Almighty, the more complete becomes your knowledge of His grandeur and majesty. This is like your venerating a scholar due to your knowledge of his knowledge; you continually discover the marvels of his compositions or his poetry, thereby increasing in knowledge of him and increasing in reverence, veneration, and respect for him because of its beauty. Indeed, every word of his words and every wondrous line of his poetry elevates his station in your heart, calling forth veneration for him within yourself. Thus, contemplate the creation, composition, and arrangement of God Almighty. Everything in existence is from the creation and composition of God, and gazing upon it and reflecting upon it is absolutely endless. However, for every servant there is only a portion of it according to what he has been granted.

Let us confine ourselves to what we have mentioned, and let us add to this what we have detailed in the Book of Gratitude. For in that book we contemplated the act of God Almighty from the perspective of it being a beneficence to us and a favor upon us. In this book, we have contemplated it solely from the perspective that it is the act of God. Everything we have contemplated—the naturalist contemplates it and his contemplation becomes a cause of his misguidance and wretchedness, while the divinely aided contemplates it and it becomes a cause of his guidance and happiness. There is not a single particle in the heaven and the earth except that God, Glorified and Exalted be He, misguides by it whom He wills and guides by it whom He wills. So whoever contemplates these matters from the perspective that they are the act and craftsmanship of God Almighty derives from it knowledge of the majesty and grandeur of God Almighty and is guided by it. And whoever contemplates them, limiting his gaze to them from the perspective of the effect of some upon others, not from the perspective of their connection to the Causer of Causes, has indeed become wretched and has donned the garment of misguidance. We seek refuge in God from misguidance, and we ask Him to keep us from the stumbling places of the feet of the ignorant, by His grace, generosity, favor, bounty, and mercy.

The ninth book of the Quarter of the Deliverers is completed. Praise be to God alone, and His prayers upon Muhammad and his family, and His peace. Following it is the Book of the Remembrance of Death and What Comes After It, and with it the entire volume is completed by the praise of God Almighty and His generosity.
