The Book of Marriage Etiquette
Being the Second Book of the Quarter of Customs from the book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences"
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, whose wondrous craftsmanship is such that the arrows of conjecture find no path within it, and intellects, when they turn to the beginnings of His marvels, return only bewildered and confounded. The subtleties of His blessings upon all beings flow in succession, descending upon them by choice and by compulsion. Among the marvels of His subtleties is that He created humankind from water, and made for them kinship and affinity. He subjected creation to a desire which compels them, by force, to cultivation, and through it preserves their progeny by overpowering constraint. Then He magnified the matter of lineages and gave them a high station, forbidding because of them illicit intercourse, and greatly censuring and deterring from it, making its commission a foul crime and a grave matter. And He commended and enjoined marriage, recommending and commanding it. Glory be to Him who decreed death for His servants, thereby humbling them in ruin and breaking, then scattered the seeds of sperm in the fields of wombs, and brought forth from them creation, making it a compensation for the breaking of death—as a reminder that the seas of divine decree overflow upon all beings with benefit and harm, good and evil, hardship and ease, folding and unfolding. And prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, sent with warning and glad tidings, and upon his family and companions, with prayers whose number and limit calculation cannot encompass, and abundant salutations.

Now then: Marriage is an aid to religion, a humiliation for the devils, and a strong fortress against the enemy of God. It is a cause for multiplication, through which the Master of the Messengers will boast over all other prophets. How fitting it is, then, to diligently seek its causes, preserve its traditions and etiquettes, elucidate its purposes and intents, and detail its chapters and sections. The essential portion of its rulings is revealed in three chapters:

• Chapter One: On Encouragement Toward It and Away From It.
• Chapter Two: On the Etiquettes Observed in the Contract and the Contracting Parties.
• Chapter Three: On the Etiquettes of Cohabitation After the Contract Until Separation.

Chapter One: On Encouragement Toward Marriage and Away From It
Know that the scholars have differed regarding the merit of marriage. Some have extolled it to such a degree that they claimed it superior to withdrawing for the worship of God. Others acknowledged its merit but gave precedence to withdrawing for God's worship, provided the self does not incline toward marriage with a craving that disturbs one's state and calls to intercourse. Yet others said that abstaining is preferable in our time, though it held merit previously when livelihoods were not forbidden and women's characters were not blameworthy. The truth in this matter is only unveiled by first presenting what has been transmitted of reports and traditions concerning encouragement toward it and away from it, then explaining the benefits of marriage and its perils, so that from this the merit of marriage and of abstaining from it may become clear for everyone, whether they are safe from its perils or not.

Encouragement Toward Marriage: As for verses, God Almighty has said: "And marry the unmarried among you" [24:32]—and this is a command. And He said: "So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands" [2:232]—and this is a prohibition of prevention and a forbiddance. And He said, describing and praising the messengers: "And We certainly sent messengers before you and gave them wives and offspring" [13:38]—mentioning this in the context of conferring favor and displaying grace. And He praised His allies by their supplication for it, saying: "And those who say, 'Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes'" [25:74]. It is said that God Almighty did not mention in His Book any prophets except those who were married. They said that Yahya (peace be upon him) married but did not have intercourse; it is said he did that to attain merit and establish the tradition, and it is said to lower the gaze. As for Jesus (peace be upon him), he will marry when he descends to earth and will have children.

As for the reports, there is his saying (peace be upon him): "Marriage is my tradition. So whoever turns away from my tradition has turned away from me." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Marriage is my tradition. So whoever loves my natural disposition, let him follow my tradition." And he also said (peace be upon him): "Marry and multiply, for I will boast of you before the nations on the Day of Resurrection, even with the miscarried fetus." And he also said (peace be upon him): "Whoever turns away from my tradition is not of me, and indeed from my tradition is marriage. So whoever loves me, let him follow my tradition." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever forsakes marriage out of fear of poverty is not of us"—and this is a censure for the reason of abstention, not for abstention itself. And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever has the means, let him marry." And he said: "Whoever among you can afford it, let him marry, for it is more restraining for the gaze and more protective for the private parts. And whoever cannot, then let him fast, for fasting is a shield for him." This indicates that the reason for encouraging it is the fear of corruption in the eye and the private parts. "Shield" is an expression for the crushing of the testicles of a stud animal so that its virility is removed; it is used metaphorically here.

Due to weakness in abstaining from intercourse during fasting, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When someone whose religion and trustworthiness pleases you comes to you, then marry him (to your daughter). If you do not do so, there will be tribulation on earth and great corruption." This is also an explanation for the encouragement, out of fear of corruption. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever marries for the sake of Allah and gives in marriage for the sake of Allah, deserves the guardianship of Allah." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever marries has safeguarded half of his religion; so let him fear Allah regarding the other half." This also indicates that its virtue is for the purpose of guarding against transgression, as a protection from corruption. It is as if the corruptor of a person's religion is, for the most part, his private parts and his stomach, and marriage suffices for one of them. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Every deed of the son of Adam ceases except three: a righteous child who prays for him." And this is only attained through marriage.

As for the narrations, 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "Nothing prevents marriage except incapacity or immorality." Thus, he clarified that religion is not a barrier to it, and he confined the barrier to two blameworthy matters. And Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: "The worship of the worshipper is not complete until he marries." It is possible that he considered it part of worship and a completion of it, but the apparent meaning is that he meant by it that one's heart is not safe from the dominance of desire except through marriage, and worship is not complete except with a heart free (from such preoccupation). For this reason, he would gather his young servants when they reached the age of 'Ikrimah, Kuraib, and others, and say: "If you desire marriage, I will marry you off, for when a servant commits fornication, faith is stripped from his heart." And Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: "If only ten days remained of my life, I would love to marry so that I do not meet Allah unmarried." And the two wives of Mu'adh bin Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) died in the plague, and he was also afflicted, so he said: "Marry me off, for I dislike meeting Allah unmarried." This from both of them indicates that they saw in marriage a virtue, not merely from the perspective of guarding against the consequences of desire. And 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would marry frequently and say: "I only marry for the sake of children."

And one of the Companions had devoted himself to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), serving him and staying with him at night in case a need arose for him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to him: "Will you not marry?" He said: "O Messenger of Allah, I am poor and have nothing, and I would be cut off from serving you." He remained silent, then asked a second time, and he gave the same reply. Then the Companion reflected and said: "By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) knows better what is good for me in my worldly life and my Hereafter, and what brings me closer to Allah than I do. If he asks me a third time, I will certainly do it." So he asked him a third time: "Will you not marry?" He said: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, marry me.'" He said: "Go to the tribe of so-and-so and say: 'The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) commands you to marry your young woman to me.'" He said: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I have nothing.'" So he said to his companions: "Gather for your brother the weight of a date stone of gold." They gathered it for him, and they went with him to the people, and they married him to her. He said to him: "Hold a wedding feast," and they gathered a sheep for the feast from among the companions. This repetition indicates a virtue inherent in marriage itself, and it is possible that he perceived in him a need for marriage.

It is narrated that one of the worshippers among past nations surpassed the people of his time in worship. His prophet mentioned his excellent worship and said: "What an excellent man he is, were it not that he has abandoned something from the Sunnah." The worshipper was grieved when he heard that and asked the prophet about it. He said: "You have abandoned marriage." He said: "I do not consider it forbidden, but I am poor and I am dependent on people." He said: "I will marry you to my daughter," and the prophet (peace be upon him) married him to his daughter.

And Bishr ibn al-Harith said: "Ahmad ibn Hanbal surpassed me in three things: in seeking the lawful for himself and for others, while I seek it only for myself; in his expansiveness in marriage while I am constrained from it; and because he was appointed as an Imam for the general public." It is said that Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) married on the second day after the death of the mother of his son 'Abdullah and said: "I dislike spending the night unmarried." As for Bishr, when it was said to him: "People are speaking about you for abandoning marriage, and they say he has abandoned the Sunnah," he said: "Tell them he is occupied with the obligatory over the recommended." And he was reproached another time, so he said: "Nothing prevents me from marriage except the saying of Allah, the Exalted: 'And for them [women] is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.'" This was mentioned to Ahmad, and he said: "And where is the equal of Bishr? He has placed himself upon the edge of a spear." Despite this, it is narrated that he was seen in a dream and was asked: "What has Allah done with you?" He said: "My stations in Paradise were raised, and I was elevated to the ranks of the Prophets, but I did not reach the stations of the married ones." In another narration, he said: "He said to me: 'I did not love that you meet Me unmarried.'" He said: "So we asked him: 'What happened to Abu Nasr al-Tammar?' He said: 'He was raised seventy degrees above me.' We said: 'By what? For we used to see you above him.' He said: 'By his patience with his daughters and dependents.'"

And Sufyan ibn 'Uyainah said: "Having many wives is not from the worldly life, for 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was the most ascetic of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and he had four wives and seventeen slave-girls."

Marriage is an established tradition and a characteristic of the prophets. A man once said to Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, "Blessed are you, for you have devoted yourself to worship through celibacy." He replied, "A single moment of awe from you due to dependents is better than all that I am engaged in." The man asked, "What then prevents you from marrying?" He answered, "I have no need for a woman, nor do I wish to entice a woman with myself."

It has been said that the superiority of the married over the celibate is like that of the warrior over the sedentary, and one prayer cycle of a married person is better than seventy of a celibate. As for what has come in discouragement from marriage, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The best of people after two hundred are the light, skillful one who has neither family nor children." And he said, "A time will come upon people when a man's ruin will be at the hands of his wife, parents, and children; they will reproach him for poverty and burden him with what he cannot bear, so he enters into means that cause his religion to perish, and he is ruined." In a report, few dependents are one of the two forms of ease, and many are one of the two forms of poverty.

Abu Sulayman al-Darani was asked about marriage and said, "Patience in abstaining from them is better than patience with them, and patience with them is better than patience with the Fire." He also said, "The solitary one finds a sweetness in deeds and a freedom of heart that the married does not find." And he once said, "I have not seen any of our companions marry and remain steadfast at his initial rank." He also said, "Three things, whoever seeks them has inclined toward the world: seeking a livelihood, marrying a woman, or writing down hadith."

Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, said, "When God intends good for a servant, He does not distract him with family or wealth." Ibn Abi al-Hawari said, "A group debated this hadith, and their consensus settled on that its meaning is not that one should not have them, but that one should have them and not be distracted by them." This alludes to the saying of Abu Sulayman al-Darani, "Whatever distracts you from God, be it family, wealth, or children, is an ill omen for you."

In summary, no one has transmitted encouragement to abstain from marriage absolutely, except when coupled with a condition, whereas encouragement toward marriage has come both absolutely and with conditions. So let us unveil the matter by enumerating the harms and benefits of marriage.

The Harms and Benefits of Marriage

It contains five benefits:
   1. Offspring
   2. Curbing desire
   3. Managing the household
   4. Increasing kinship ties
   5. Striving against the self by fulfilling these duties

The first benefit is offspring, which is the foundation and the purpose for which marriage was instituted. The aim is the preservation of progeny and that the world not be devoid of the human species. Indeed, desire was created as an instigator and motivator, like one entrusted with the male to emit the seed and with the female to enable cultivation, as a gentle means of leading them to seize offspring through intercourse, just as one gently scatters the seed that the bird desires to lure it into the net. The Eternal Power is not incapable of creating individuals initially without cultivation and pairing, but Wisdom necessitated arranging effects upon causes while being independent of them, to manifest Power, complete the wonders of craftsmanship, and realize what the Will has decreed and the Pen has recorded.

In attaining offspring, there is nearness to God from four aspects, which are the basis for encouraging it when safe from the perils of desire, such that none of them would wish to meet God as a celibate.

The first: Conforming to God's love by striving to obtain offspring to preserve the human species.
The second: Seeking the love of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in multiplying those he takes pride in.
The third: Seeking blessing through the supplication of a righteous child after one.
The fourth: Seeking intercession through the death of a young child if it dies before him.

As for the first aspect, it is the most subtle and farthest from the understanding of the masses, yet it is the most rightful and strongest among those with penetrating insight into the wonders of God's creation and the courses of His wisdom. Its explanation is that if a master entrusts his servant with seed and tools for cultivation, prepares for him land ready for tilling, and the servant is capable of tilling, and one is appointed to demand it of him, then if he is negligent, leaves the tools idle, and lets the seed go to waste until it spoils, and wards off the appointed one with some sort of trick, he deserves the disdain and reproach of his master. And God, exalted is He, created the two spouses, created the male and the two females, created the sperm in the backbone, prepared for it in the two females vessels and passages, and created the womb as a resting place and repository for the sperm, and empowered the demander of desire over each of the male and female.

Thus, these actions and tools bear witness with an eloquent tongue in expressing the intent of their Creator, and call out to the possessors of intellect to recognize what they have been prepared for—this, even if the Creator, exalted is He, had not explicitly stated the intent through His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, when He said, "Marry and procreate." How much more so when He has explicitly commanded and revealed the secret? So every one who refrains from marriage is turning away from cultivation, wasting the seed, and nullifying what God has created of...

The instruments prepared and arranged according to the aim of primordial nature and the wisdom understood from the evidences of creation, inscribed upon these limbs with a divine script—not a composition of letters and sounds—read by everyone possessing a penetrating divine insight into perceiving the subtleties of eternal wisdom.

For this reason, the Sacred Law magnified the prohibition regarding killing children and infanticide, because it prevents the completion of existence. To this, the one who said, “Coitus interruptus is one of the two forms of infanticide,” alluded. Thus, the one who marries strives to complete what God, exalted is He, loves to be completed, while the one who abstains nullifies and wastes what God dislikes to be wasted. Due to God’s love for the preservation of souls, He commanded feeding and urged it, expressing it as the worship of lending, saying, “Who is it that will lend God a good loan?” If you say, “Your statement that the preservation of progeny and soul is beloved implies that their annihilation is disliked in God’s sight,” this distinguishes between death and life in relation to God’s will. It is known that everything is by God’s decree, and God is independent of all worlds. So how can their death be distinguished from their life, or their preservation from their annihilation, in His sight? Know that this statement is true, but a falsehood is intended by it. For what we have mentioned does not contradict attributing all occurrences—good and evil, benefit and harm—to God’s will. However, love and dislike are opposites, yet neither opposes will. For sometimes what is willed is disliked, and sometimes what is willed is beloved. Disobediences are disliked, yet despite being disliked, they are willed. Obediences are willed and determined to be willed, beloved, and pleasing. As for disbelief and evil, we do not say they are pleasing and beloved, but they are willed.

God has said, “He does not approve for His servants disbelief.” So how can annihilation, in relation to God’s love and dislike, be like preservation? For He says, “I have not hesitated in anything as I hesitate in seizing the soul of My believing servant: he dislikes death, and I dislike displeasing him, yet he must die.” His statement, “he must die,” alludes to the precedence of will and decree mentioned in His saying, “We have decreed death among you,” and in His saying, “Who created death and life.” There is no contradiction between His saying, “We have decreed death among you,” and His saying, “I dislike displeasing him.” But clarifying the truth in this requires verifying the meaning of will, love, and dislike, and explaining their realities.

What first comes to minds regarding them are matters analogous to the will, love, and dislike of creation—but far be it! Between God’s attributes and the attributes of creation is a distance like that between His exalted essence and their essence. Just as the essences of creation are substance and accident, and God’s essence is sanctified above that, and what is not substance and accident does not correspond to substance and accident, likewise His attributes do not correspond to the attributes of creation. These realities belong to the knowledge of unveiling and lie beyond the secret of divine decree, which is prohibited from divulging. So let us refrain from mentioning it and limit ourselves to what we have indicated regarding the distinction between proceeding to marriage and refraining from it.

For one of them wastes progeny whose existence God has perpetuated from Adam, peace be upon him, generation after generation until it reached him. Thus, the one who abstains from marriage severs the sustained existence from the time of Adam’s existence, peace be upon him, upon himself, so he dies cut off without progeny. If the motive for marriage were merely to satisfy desire, Mu‘adh would not have said regarding the plague, “Marry me off, so I do not meet God unmarried.” If you say, “Mu‘adh did not expect a child at that time, so what is the reason for his desire in it?” I say: A child results from intercourse motivated by desire, which is a matter not subject to choice. What is tied to the servant’s choice is bringing about what stirs desire, and that is expected in every circumstance. So whoever contracts marriage has fulfilled his duty and done what is upon him; the remainder is beyond his choice. For this reason, marriage is recommended even for the impotent, for the stirrings of desire are subtle and unknown, such that even for the castrated one who does not expect a child, the recommendation does not cease, in the manner that passing the razor over the head is recommended for the bald man, following others and emulating the righteous predecessors.

Just as hastening and draping the upper garment are recommended in Hajj now, though their initial purpose was to display strength to the disbelievers, so following and emulating those who displayed strength became a practice for those after them. This recommendation weakens in relation to the recommendation for one capable of cultivation, and it may weaken further due to the dislike of leaving a woman idle and wasting her in what pertains to fulfilling natural desire, for that is not without a kind of risk. This meaning alerts to the severity of their disapproval of abandoning marriage despite diminished desire.

The second aspect is striving in the love of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and his pleasure by multiplying that by which he is glorified, for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, explicitly stated that, and it indicates observance of the matter.

The child is a comprehensive benefit in all respects, as narrated from 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, that he used to marry frequently and would say, "I marry only for the sake of children." And as narrated from the reports censuring the barren woman, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "A mat in the corner of the house is better than a woman who does not bear children." And he said: "The best of your women are the childbearing, the affectionate." And he said: "A fertile black woman is better than a beautiful woman who does not bear children." This indicates that seeking children is more integral to realizing the virtue of marriage than seeking to repel the onslaught of lust, for the beautiful woman is more suitable for chastity, lowering the gaze, and cutting off lust.

The third aspect is that a righteous child remains after him, who will pray for him, as mentioned in the report: "All the deeds of the son of Adam cease except three"—and he mentioned the righteous child. And in the report: "Supplications are presented to the deceased on platters of light." The objection that the child may not be righteous is ineffective, for he is a believer, and righteousness is predominant among the children of the religious, especially if one resolves to raise him and guide him to righteousness. In summary, the supplication of a believer for his parents is beneficial, whether they were righteous or wicked; he is rewarded for his supplications and good deeds, for they are from his earnings, and he is not held accountable for their evil deeds, for no bearer of burdens bears the burden of another. Therefore, God Almighty said: "We will join them with their offspring, and We will not deprive them of any of their deeds." That is, We did not diminish them of their deeds, and We made their children an increase in their good deeds.

The fourth aspect is that the child may die before him and thus be an intercessor for him. It is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Indeed, the child drags his parents to Paradise." And in some reports: "He takes hold of their garment as I am now taking hold of your garment." And he also said, peace and blessings be upon him: "The newborn is told, 'Enter Paradise,' so he stops at the gate of Paradise, filled with rage and anger, and says, 'I will not enter Paradise unless my parents are with me.' So it is said, 'Let his parents enter with him.'" In another report: "The children gather at the standing place on the Day of Resurrection when the creatures are presented for reckoning. It is said to the angels, 'Take these to Paradise.' They stop at the gate of Paradise and are told, 'Welcome, O offspring of the Muslims! Enter, there is no reckoning upon you.' They say, 'Then where are our fathers and mothers?' The keepers say, 'Your fathers and mothers are not like you; they had sins and misdeeds, so they are held accountable for them and questioned.' So they cry out and wail at the gates of Paradise with a single cry. God, glorified and exalted, who knows them best, says, 'What is this cry?' They say, 'Our Lord, the children of the Muslims say they will not enter Paradise except with their parents.' God Almighty says, 'Pass through the crowd and take the hands of their fathers and bring them into Paradise.'"

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has two children die has been shielded by a shield from the Fire." A woman from the Ansar came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, two of my sons besides this one have died." He said, "You have indeed shielded yourself from the Fire with a strong shield." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has three children die before reaching the age of puberty, God will admit him to Paradise by the grace of His mercy upon them." It was said, "O Messenger of God, what about two?" He said, "And two."

It is recounted that one of the righteous was offered marriage but refused for a period of time. He said, "Then I awoke from sleep one day and said, 'Marry me, marry me!' So they married him. He was asked about that, and he said, 'Perhaps God will grant me a child and then take him, so he will be an advance provision for me in the Hereafter.' Then he said, 'I saw in a dream as if the Resurrection had been established and I was among the creatures at the standing place, and I had such thirst that it nearly severed my neck, and likewise the creatures were in severe thirst and distress. While we were like that, children were passing through the crowd, upon them were handkerchiefs of light, and in their hands were pitchers of silver and cups of gold, and they were giving drink to one after another, passing through the crowd and bypassing most of the people. I stretched my hand to one of them and said, "Give me drink, for thirst has exhausted me." He said, "You have no child among us; we only give drink to our fathers." I said, "And who are you?" They said, "We are from among the children of the Muslims who died."'"

One of the meanings mentioned in His saying, exalted is He: "So come to your tillage when and how you will, and send forth good for yourselves," is the sending forth of children to the Hereafter. Thus, it has become clear through these four aspects that the greater virtue of marriage is for the sake of it being a cause for children. The second benefit is protection from Satan, breaking the intensity of desire, repelling the onslaughts of lust, lowering the gaze, and guarding the private parts. This is alluded to in his saying, peace be upon him: "Whoever marries has safeguarded half of his religion; so let him fear God regarding the other half." And it is alluded to in his saying: "Upon you is marriage, and whoever is unable, then upon him is fasting, for fasting is a shield for him."

Most of the traditions and reports we have transmitted point to this meaning, and this meaning is less than the first.

The first reason is that desire is tasked with demanding the procurement of offspring, so marriage suffices to occupy it, repels its harm, and diverts the evil of its domination. For one who responds to his Lord out of longing to attain His pleasure is not like one who responds merely to seek deliverance from the peril of this delegation. Thus, desire and offspring are both decreed, and between them is a connection. It is not permissible to say that the aim is pleasure and offspring is a necessary consequence of it, just as, for example, relieving oneself is a necessary consequence of eating but is not an aim in itself. Rather, offspring is the aim by innate disposition and wisdom, and desire is an instigator toward it.

By my life, within desire there is another wisdom besides urging toward procreation, which is the pleasure found in its fulfillment—a pleasure unparalleled if it were to endure. It serves as an alert to the pleasures promised in the Gardens, for encouraging toward a pleasure one has never tasted is of no benefit. If an impotent man were encouraged regarding the pleasure of intercourse, or a child regarding the pleasure of kingship and dominion, the encouragement would be useless. One of the benefits of worldly pleasures is the desire for their permanence in Paradise, so that it becomes an incentive for the worship of God. Observe, then, the wisdom, then the mercy, then the divine arrangement—how under a single desire two lives are arranged: an apparent life and a hidden life. The apparent life is a person's life through the survival of his progeny, for it is a kind of continuation of existence. The hidden life is the afterlife, for this deficient pleasure, which quickly vanishes, stirs desire for the complete pleasure, the pleasure of permanence, thus urging one toward the worship that leads to it. The servant benefits, through the intensity of his desire for it, by the facilitation of perseverance in what brings him to the bliss of the Gardens. There is not a single atom within a person's body, inwardly or outwardly, nor indeed the atoms of the dominion of the heavens and the earth, except that beneath it lie subtleties and wonders of wisdom at which minds are bewildered.

However, this is only unveiled to pure hearts in proportion to their clarity and their turning away from the adornment, delusion, and perils of this world. Thus, marriage, due to repelling the peril of desire, is important in religion for everyone who is not afflicted by incapacity or impotence—and they are the majority of creation. For if desire overpowers and the strength of piety does not resist it, it leads to plunging into abominations. To this He alluded in His saying, exalted is He: "If you do not do it, there will be turmoil on earth and great corruption." And if it is bridled by the bridle of piety, its utmost is to restrain the limbs from responding to desire, so one lowers the gaze and guards the private parts.

As for guarding the heart from whisperings and thoughts, that does not fall under one's control. Rather, the soul continually pulls at him and converses with him about matters of intercourse, and the whispering Satan does not leave him alone most of the time. This may even occur to him during prayer, such that there passes through his mind matters of intercourse which, if he were to express them before the basest of people, he would be ashamed, and God is aware of his heart. The heart, in relation to God, is like the tongue in relation to creation. The foremost matter for the seeker traversing the path of the Hereafter is his heart. Perseverance in fasting does not cut off the source of whisperings for most people, unless it is coupled with bodily weakness and a corruption of temperament. Therefore, Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "The devotion of the devout is not complete except through marriage." This is a widespread trial from which few are delivered.

Qatadah said regarding the meaning of His saying, exalted is He: "And do not burden us with what we have no strength to bear"—it is youthful passion. And from 'Ikrimah and Mujahid, they said regarding the meaning of His saying: "And man was created weak"—that he cannot abstain from women. And Fayyad ibn Najih said: "When a man's sexual urge arises, two-thirds of his intellect depart." Some say: "Two-thirds of his religion depart." And in the rare interpretations from Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, regarding "and from the evil of the darkening night when it settles," he said: "The rising of the sexual urge." This is a dominant affliction which, when it rages, neither intellect nor religion can withstand it.

And although it is fit to be an incentive for the two lives as previously mentioned, it is the strongest tool of Satan against the children of Adam. To this he, peace and blessings be upon him, alluded in his saying: "I have not seen anyone more overpowering to men of sound understanding than you." And that is due to the raging of desire.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in his supplication: "O God, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing, my sight, my heart, and the evil of my sexual urge." And he said: "I ask You to purify my heart and guard my private parts." That from which the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sought refuge—how can it be permissible for anyone else to be negligent regarding it?

Some of the righteous would frequently marry, such that he was hardly ever without two or three wives. One of the Sufis criticized him for this, so he said: "Does any of you know that he sat before God, exalted is He, in a sitting, or stood before Him in a standing during worship, and a thought of desire crossed his heart?" They said: "We experience much of that." He said: "If I were content in my entire life with a state like yours at a single moment, I would not have married. But whenever a thought occurs to my heart that distracts me from my state, I fulfill it so that I find relief and return to my occupation. And since..."

For forty years, no sinful thought ever crossed my heart.

Some people criticized the state of the Sufis. A man of religion said to one of them, "What do you find fault with in them?" He replied, "They eat a great deal." The man said, "You too, if you were as hungry as they are, would eat as they eat." He said, "They marry frequently." The man said, "You too, if you guarded your eyes and your private parts as they guard theirs, would marry as they marry."

Al-Junayd used to say, "I need intercourse as I need sustenance." Indeed, a wife is truly a sustenance and a cause for the purity of the heart.

Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded everyone whose glance falls upon a woman and his soul yearns for her to go to his wife, for that repels whisperings from the soul.

Jabir, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw a woman, then went in to Zaynab and fulfilled his need with her, and came out and said, peace and blessings be upon him, "Verily, when a woman approaches, she approaches in the form of a devil. So if one of you sees a woman and she pleases him, let him go to his wife, for with her is the like of what is with her." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Do not enter upon women whose husbands are absent, for indeed Satan flows in one of you like blood." We said, "Even in you?" He said, "Even in me, but God helped me against him, so I am safe." Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah said, "'So I am safe' means I am safe from him." This means that Satan is not safe. And so narrated 'Ali ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, who was among the ascetics and scholars of the Companions, that he would break his fast from fasting with intercourse before eating, and sometimes he would have intercourse with three of his slave-girls in Ramadan before the last supper.

Ibn 'Abbas said, "The best of this community are those with the most women." Since desire is predominant in the temperament of the Arabs, the righteous among them marrying frequently was more intense, and for the sake of emptying the heart, marrying a slave woman was permitted when fearing distress, even though it entails enslaving the child, which is a kind of destruction and is forbidden for everyone who is able to marry a free woman. But enslaving the child is lighter than destroying one's religion, and it only entails embittering the child's life for a period, whereas in plunging into immorality lies the forfeiture of the afterlife, which makes long lifetimes seem contemptible compared to a single one of its days.

It is reported that people departed one day from the gathering of Ibn 'Abbas, but a young man remained and did not leave. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "Do you have a need?" He said, "Yes, I wanted to ask a question but was shy before the people, and now I am in awe of you and revere you." Ibn 'Abbas said, "The scholar is in the position of a father. What you would have confided to your father, confide to me." He said, "I am a young man with no wife, and I sometimes fear distress for myself, so I sometimes masturbate with my hand. Is that a sin?" Ibn 'Abbas turned away from him, then said, "Ugh! Ugh! Marrying a slave woman is better than that, and it is better than fornication." This is an indication that the celibate young man afflicted with desire is faced with three evils: the least of them is marrying a slave woman, which entails enslaving the child; more severe than that is masturbation with the hand; and the most vile is fornication.

Ibn 'Abbas did not declare absolute permissibility for any of them, because they are both feared matters one resorts to out of caution from falling into a more severe feared matter, just as one resorts to eating carrion out of fear for the loss of life. Therefore, preferring the lesser of two evils is not in the sense of absolute permissibility, nor in the sense of absolute good. And cutting off a hand that is consuming good things is not permitted, even though it is indicated when the soul is on the brink of destruction. Thus, in marriage there is merit from this perspective. But this does not apply to all, rather to most. For perhaps a person's desire has weakened due to old age, illness, or other reasons, so this motive is absent in his case, and what was mentioned concerning the child remains. That is general except for the impotent man, which is rare. And among temperaments are those overpowered by desire to the extent that one woman cannot protect him, so it is recommended for such a person to increase beyond one to four. If God facilitates affection and mercy for him and his heart finds tranquility with them, well and good; otherwise, it is recommended for him to replace them.

Indeed, 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, married seven nights after the death of Fatimah, peace be upon her. And it is said that Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali was given to frequent marriage, to the extent that he married more than two hundred women, and he would sometimes contract marriage with four at one time, and sometimes divorce four at one time and replace them. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Al-Hasan, "You resemble my character and my form." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Al-Hasan is from me and Al-Husayn is from 'Ali." Thus, his frequent marriage was one of the things by which he resembled the character of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.

Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah married eighty women. Among the Companions were those who had three or four, and those who had two are innumerable. Whenever the motive is known, the remedy should be proportionate to the ailment. The aim is to pacify the soul, so one should consider that in terms of abundance and scarcity. The third benefit...

Refreshing the soul and delighting it through companionship, gazing, and playful interaction provides relief for the heart and strengthens it for worship. For the soul is easily wearied and averse to the truth, because it goes against its nature. If it were compelled to persist under duress in what opposes it, it would become unruly and rebellious. But when refreshed with permissible pleasures at times, it gains strength and vigor. In finding solace with women, there is a form of rest that dispels distress and comforts the heart. The souls of the God-fearing should have respites through lawful means, and for this reason God Almighty said, "that you might find tranquility in her."

And Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "Give the hearts respite for an hour, for if they are forced, they become blind." And in a tradition it is said, "It is incumbent upon the intelligent person to have three periods: a period in which he communes with his Lord, a period in which he takes account of himself, and a period in which he is alone with his food and drink, for in this period there is support for those other periods." Similar to this is another wording: "The intelligent person should not be journeying except for three things: provision for the Hereafter, mending his livelihood, or a pleasure in what is not forbidden."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Every worker has a period of intense effort, and every intense effort has a period of lassitude. So whoever's lassitude is toward my Sunnah has been guided." The "intense effort" is striving and exertion with sharpness and strength, and that is at the beginning of resolve; and the "lassitude" is pausing for rest.

And Abu al-Darda' used to say, "I indeed refresh my soul with some amusement so that I may thereby gain strength for the truth afterward." And in some reports from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, "I complained to Gabriel, peace be upon him, about my weakness for intercourse, so he directed me to harisa (a nutritious dish)." Except that preparation for rest cannot be explained as merely repelling desire, for it is an arousal of desire, and from the absence of desire comes the absence of much of this solace. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three things from your world have been made beloved to me: perfume, women, and the coolness of my eye in prayer." This, too, is a benefit not denied by one who has experienced exhausting his soul in thoughts, remembrances, and various works, and it is distinct from the two previous benefits, such that it applies even to the eunuch and one who has no desire, except that this benefit gives marriage a virtue in addition to this intention. And few intend marriage for that, whereas intending children and intending to repel desire and the like are among the common intentions.

Then, perhaps a person finds solace in looking at flowing water, greenery, and the like, and does not need to refresh the soul by conversing with women and playing with them. This varies according to circumstances and individuals, so let one be mindful of it.

The fourth benefit is emptying the heart from managing the household and undertaking the tasks of cooking, sweeping, spreading bedding, cleaning utensils, and preparing the necessities of life. For if a person had no desire for intercourse, living alone in his house would be difficult for him, since if he undertook all the household chores, most of his time would be wasted and he would not be free for knowledge and work. Thus, a righteous wife for the home is an aid to religion in this way, and the disruption of these arrangements are distractions, disturbances for the heart, and spoilers of life. For this reason, Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, said, "A righteous wife is not from this world, for she frees you for the Hereafter," and her freeing you is through managing the household and fulfilling desire together.

And Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi said regarding the meaning of God Almighty's saying, "Our Lord, grant us good in this world," he said, "A righteous wife." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Let one of you acquire a grateful heart, a remembering tongue, and a believing, righteous wife who aids him in his Hereafter." See how he combined her with remembrance and gratitude. And in some interpretations of God Almighty's saying, "We will surely grant him a goodly life," it is said, "A righteous wife."

And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, used to say, "God has not given a servant after faith in God anything better than a righteous wife, and among them are sheep from which one is not shod, and among them are crops from which one is ransomed." And his saying "is not shod" means he is not compensated with a gift. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "I have been favored over Adam with two traits: his wife was an aid to him in disobedience, and my wives are aids to me in obedience; and his devil was a disbeliever, and my devil is a Muslim who commands only good." So he counted her assistance in obedience as a virtue. This, too, is among the benefits intended by the righteous, except that it is specific to some individuals who have no caretaker or manager, and it does not call for two wives, for having multiple wives may spoil life and unsettle household affairs.

Included in this benefit is the intention of increasing through her kinship and the strength obtained through the intermingling of kinsfolk, for that is needed to repel evils and seek safety. For this reason it is said, "He is humiliated who has no helper," and whoever finds someone to repel evils from him, his state is secure and his heart is free for worship, for humiliation disturbs the heart, and honor through numbers repels humiliation.

The fifth benefit is striving against the ego and disciplining it through guardianship, stewardship, and fulfilling the rights of one's family, being patient with their dispositions, enduring harm from them, striving to rectify and guide them to the path of religion, exerting effort to earn lawful provision for their sake, and undertaking the upbringing of one's children. All these are works of immense merit, for they constitute guardianship and stewardship, and the family and children are a trust. The merit of guardianship is great; only he who refrains from it does so out of fear of falling short in fulfilling its rights. Otherwise, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "A single day of a just ruler is better than the worship of seventy years." Then he said, "Verily, each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock." [43] He who is occupied with rectifying himself and others is not like he who is occupied with rectifying himself alone, nor is he who patiently endures harm like he who indulges and gives ease to himself. Enduring the family and children is akin to striving in the path of God.

For this reason, Bishr al-Hafi said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, "You excel over me in three things, one of which is that you seek lawful provision for yourself and for others." The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "What a man spends on his family is charity, and indeed a man is rewarded for the morsel he raises to his wife's mouth." [44] Someone said to a certain scholar, "God has granted me a share in every good deed," mentioning Hajj, jihad, and others. The scholar asked him, "Where are you concerning the work of the bodies?" He asked, "What is it?" He replied, "Earning lawful provision and spending on one's dependents."

Ibn al-Mubarak, while with his brothers in military expedition, said, "Do you know of a deed better than what we are engaged in?" They said, "We do not know." He said, "I know." They asked, "What is it?" He said, "A chaste man with a family who rises at night, sees his children sleeping uncovered, and covers them with his garment—his deed is better than what we are engaged in." The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "He whose prayer is excellent, whose dependents are many, whose wealth is little, and who does not backbite the Muslims will be with me in Paradise like these two (fingers)." [45] In another narration, "Indeed, God loves the poor, chaste father of dependents." [46] In a hadith, "When the sins of a servant multiply, God afflicts him with dependents to expiate them for him." [47] Some of the predecessors said, "Among sins are those not expiated except by the worry over dependents." Therein is a report from the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said, "Among sins are those not expiated except by the anxiety of seeking livelihood." [48]

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "Whoever has three daughters, provides for them, and treats them well until God makes them independent of him, God has made Paradise absolutely obligatory for him, absolutely, unless he commits an unforgivable sin." [49] Ibn 'Abbas, when narrating this, would say, "By God, it is among the rare and precious hadiths." It is narrated that a certain worshipper used to excel in caring for his wife until she died. Marriage was proposed to him, but he declined, saying, "Solitude is more comforting to my heart and more conducive to my concentration." Then he said, "I saw in a dream after a week of her death as if the gates of heaven opened and men were descending, moving through the air, one following another. Whenever one descended, he looked at me and said to those behind him, 'This is the ill-omened one.' The other would say, 'Yes,' the third would say likewise, and the fourth would say, 'Yes.' I was afraid to ask them out of awe, until the last of them passed by me; he was a youth. I said to him, 'O this one, who is this ill-omened one you are indicating?' He said, 'You.' I asked, 'And why is that?' He said, 'We used to raise your deed among the deeds of those who strive in the path of God. Since a week ago, we were ordered to place your deed with the laggards. We do not know what you have introduced.'" He then said to his brothers, "Marry me! Marry me!" and thereafter he was never without two or three wives.

Among the stories of the prophets (peace be upon them) is that a group of people entered upon the Prophet Yunus (peace be upon him) as his guests. He would go in and out of his home, and his wife would harm him and behave arrogantly towards him while he remained silent. They were amazed at this. He said, "Do not be amazed, for I asked God Almighty, saying, 'Whatever punishment You have for me in the Hereafter, hasten it for me in this world.' He said, 'Your punishment is the daughter of so-and-so; marry her.' So I married her, and I am patient with what you see from her." In patience upon that is discipline of the ego, breaking anger, and refining character. For he who is alone or shares with one of good character, the vile, hidden aspects of the ego do not seep out, nor are the inner faults exposed. It is incumbent upon the traveler on the path of the Hereafter to test himself by exposing himself to such provocations and to accustom himself to patience upon them, so that his character may become balanced, his ego disciplined, and his inner self purified of blameworthy traits. Patience upon one's family, while being a discipline and striving, also entails providing for them and caring for them, which is worship in itself. This, too, is among the benefits, but none benefits from it except one of two men: either a man who intends striving, discipline, and refinement of character because he is at the beginning of the path—it is not far-fetched that he sees this as a way of striving and his ego becomes disciplined thereby—or a man from...

For the worshippers, there is no inward journey nor movement of thought and heart; their work is merely the work of the limbs, through prayer, pilgrimage, or the like. Thus, his work for his family and children—by earning lawful provision for them and undertaking their upbringing—is better for him than bodily devotions whose benefit does not extend to others.

As for the man of refined character, whether by innate sufficiency in his original nature or through prior spiritual struggle, if he has an inward journey and a movement of the heart's thought in the sciences and spiritual unveilings, then he should not marry for this purpose, for spiritual discipline suffices him therein. As for worship through the work of earning for them, knowledge is superior to that, for it too is a work, and its benefit is greater, more general, and more comprehensive for all creation than the benefit of earning for dependents. These are the benefits of marriage in religion, by which it is judged virtuous.

As for the harms of marriage, they are three. The first—and it is the strongest—is incapacity in seeking lawful provision, for that is not easy for everyone, especially in these times with the turmoil of livelihoods. Thus, marriage becomes a cause for expanding one's seeking and feeding from the unlawful, and in that lies his destruction and the destruction of his family. The celibate person is secure from that, while the married person, for the most part, enters into avenues of evil, following his wife's desires and selling his Hereafter for his worldly life. In the report: "Verily, the servant will be stood before the Scale, and he will have mountains of good deeds, yet he will be questioned about the care of his family and his fulfilling his duty to them, and about his wealth: from where did he earn it and on what did he spend it? Until those inquiries consume all his works, and not a single good deed remains for him. Then the angels will call out: 'This is the one who consumed his good deeds through his family in the world, and today he is held in pledge by his deeds.'"

And it is said that the first to cling to a man on the Day of Resurrection will be his family and children. They will stand him before God, Exalted is He, and say, "Our Lord, take our right from him, for he did not teach us what we were ignorant of, and he fed us the unlawful while we did not know." Then restitution will be taken from him for them. Some of the predecessors said: "When God desires evil for a servant, He empowers over him in this world fangs that tear at him"—meaning dependents. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No one will meet God with a sin greater than the ignorance of his family." This is a general harm; few are saved from it except one who has inherited wealth or lawfully acquired wealth sufficient for himself and his family, and who has contentment that prevents him from seeking increase. Such a one is saved from this harm. Or one who is a craftsman or diligent in earning lawful provision from permissible means, such as gathering firewood or hunting, or who is in a trade not connected to rulers and is able to deal with righteous people, and whose outward state is sound and the majority of his wealth is lawful.

Ibn Salim, may God have mercy on him, was asked about marriage and said: "It is better in our time for one overcome by overpowering lust, like a donkey mounting a jenny, who is not stopped by beating and cannot control himself. If he can control himself, then leaving it is preferable." The second harm is falling short in fulfilling their rights and being patient with their characters and enduring harm from them. This is less general than the first, for the capability for this is easier than the capability for the first. Improving one's character with women and fulfilling their due shares is lighter than seeking lawful provision. Yet in this too there is peril, for he is a shepherd and responsible for his flock. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "It is enough sin for a man that he neglects those he provides for." And it is narrated that one who flees from his dependents is like a runaway slave; his prayer and fasting are not accepted until he returns to them. And one who falls short in fulfilling their rights, even if present, is like one who has fled. God Almighty has said: "Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire." He commanded us to protect them from the Fire as we protect ourselves. A person may be incapable of fulfilling the right of his own self; when he marries, the right is multiplied upon him, and another self is added to his own. The self is prone to evil; if rights upon it multiply, the command to evil often multiplies.

Therefore, some excused themselves from marriage, saying: "I am afflicted with my own self; how can I add another self to it?" As it is said: "The mouse's burrow will not hold it when it attaches a broom to its tail." Likewise, Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, excused himself, saying: "I will not deceive a woman with myself, nor do I have need for them"—meaning from fulfilling their rights, protecting them, and giving them pleasure—"and I am incapable of that." Similarly, Bishr excused himself, saying: "What prevents me from marriage is His saying, Exalted is He: 'And for them is like that which is upon them.'" And he used to say: "If I were providing for a chicken, I would fear I would become a toll-collector on the bridge." Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah, may God have mercy on him, was seen at the ruler's gate, and it was said to him: "This is not your place." He replied: "Have you ever seen a man with dependents prosper?" And Sufyan would say: "How excellent is bachelorhood, and the key, and a dwelling torn by the winds, with no clamor and no shouting." This too is a general harm, though less general than the first. None is safe from it except a wise, intelligent person of good character, insightful into women's habits, patient with them.

His tongue is restrained from following his desires, diligent in fulfilling their rights, overlooking their slips, and managing their dispositions with his intellect. Predominant among people are folly, harshness, sharpness, recklessness, bad character, and lack of fairness while demanding complete fairness. Such a person inevitably increases in corruption from this aspect through marriage; thus, solitude is safer for him.

The third affliction, lesser than the first and second, is that family and children become a distraction from God Almighty, pulling him toward seeking worldly life and improving livelihood for the children through excessive accumulation and hoarding of wealth for them, and seeking pride and boasting through them. Anything that distracts from God—be it family, wealth, or children—is ill-omened for its possessor. I do not mean by this that it calls to the forbidden, for that falls under the first and second afflictions, but rather that it calls him to indulgence in the permissible, even to immersion in playfulness with women, keeping their company, and excessive enjoyment of them. From marriage arise various distractions of this kind that consume the heart, so that night and day pass without a person finding leisure in them for reflection on the Hereafter and preparation for it. Therefore, Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, said, "He who becomes accustomed to the thighs of women will produce nothing."

And Abu Sulayman, may God have mercy on him, said, "He who marries has inclined toward the world," meaning it calls him to lean toward the world. These are the collective afflictions and benefits. To judge a single individual absolutely that marriage or celibacy is better for him is a failure to encompass the totality of these matters. Rather, these benefits and afflictions are taken as criteria and judges, and the seeker presents himself to them. If the afflictions are absent in his case and the benefits are combined—such as having lawful wealth, good character, complete religious diligence so that marriage does not distract him from God, and being a youth in need of calming desire and solitary in need of managing a household and protection through family—then there is no dispute that marriage is better for him, along with the endeavor to obtain offspring. If the benefits are absent and the afflictions combined, then celibacy is better for him. If the two matters are balanced, which is most common, then they should be weighed with the scale of justice: the portion of that benefit in increasing his religion and the portion of those afflictions in decreasing it. If preponderance of one is most likely, judgment is made accordingly. The most apparent benefits are offspring and calming desire; the most apparent afflictions are the need to earn unlawfully and distraction from God. Let us assume these matters are balanced: we say that for one who is not harmed by desire and the benefit of his marriage lies in striving to obtain offspring, while the affliction is the need to earn unlawfully and distraction from God, then celibacy is preferable for him. There is no good in what distracts from God, nor in earning unlawfully.

And the matter of offspring does not compensate for the deficiency of these two matters, for marriage for offspring is a striving to seek a hypothetical life for the child. This is a definite deficiency in religion; preserving his own life and protecting it from destruction is more important than striving for offspring. That is profit, and religion is the capital. In the corruption of religion lies the nullification of the afterlife and loss of capital. This benefit does not counterbalance either of these two afflictions. If, in addition to the matter of offspring, there is a need to break desire due to the soul's craving for marriage, then consider: if the bridle of piety is not strong in his mind and he fears for himself falling into fornication, then marriage is preferable for him, for he is wavering between plunging into fornication or consuming unlawful earnings, and unlawful earning is the lesser of two evils. If he trusts himself that he will not fornicate but cannot, despite that, lower his gaze from the unlawful, then abstaining from marriage is preferable, for looking is unlawful and earning from improper means is unlawful. Earning occurs constantly and involves his disobedience and that of his family, while looking occurs occasionally, is specific to him, and passes quickly. Looking is the fornication of the eye, but if it is not followed by genital action, it is closer to forgiveness than consuming unlawful earnings, unless he fears that looking will lead to genital sin, which reverts to fear of hardship. If this is established, then the third state is that he is strong in lowering his gaze but cannot repel distracting thoughts that occupy the heart; that is more deserving of abstaining from marriage, for the heart's action is closer to forgiveness, as the heart is desired to be free for worship.

And worship is not complete with unlawful earning, consuming it, or feeding it. Thus, these afflictions should be weighed against the benefits, and judgment made accordingly. Whoever comprehends this will not be perplexed by anything we have transmitted from the predecessors regarding encouragement toward marriage at one time and aversion to it at another, for that is correct according to circumstances. If you ask: For one who is safe from afflictions, what is better for him: to devote himself to worshiping God or to marry? I say: combine them, for marriage is not a hindrance to devoting oneself to worshiping God in terms of being a contract, but in terms of need.

As for earning, if one is capable of lawful earning, then marriage is also superior, because the night and all other times of the day allow for seclusion for worship and constant devotion without interruption being possible. If we suppose his condition to be wholly absorbed in earning, such that no time remains for him except for the times of obligatory prayers, sleep, eating, and answering the call of nature, then if the man is of those who do not tread the path of the Hereafter except through supererogatory prayers, Hajj, and similar bodily works, marriage is superior for him. For in lawful earning, providing for the family, striving to obtain offspring, and patience with the dispositions of women are types of worship whose merit is not less than that of supererogatory acts of worship.

If, however, his worship is through knowledge, reflection, and inner spiritual journey, and earning disturbs that for him, then abstaining from marriage is superior. If you were to say: Why then did Jesus, peace be upon him, abstain from marriage despite its merit, and if the superior course is seclusion for the worship of God, why did our Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, take many wives? Know then that the superior course is to combine both for one who has the capacity and whose spiritual aspiration is strong and lofty, such that no preoccupation distracts him from God. Our Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, took the course of strength and combined the merit of worship and marriage, and indeed he was with nine women. And in another narration of his, they were eleven, while he was secluded for the worship of God. The fulfillment of natural desire through marriage, in his case, was not a hindrance, just as answering the call of nature is not a hindrance for those preoccupied with worldly affairs from managing them, even though they are outwardly engaged in answering the call of nature while their hearts are attached to their concerns, not heedless of their important matters. And the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, due to the loftiness of his station, was not prevented by any matter of this world from the presence of his heart with God, exalted is He, so revelation would descend upon him while he was on the bed of his wife. If such a station is granted to another, it is not far-fetched that streams may alter what the vast ocean does not alter, so others should not be measured against him. As for Jesus, peace be upon him, he took the course of caution, not strength, and was protective of himself. Perhaps his situation was one in which preoccupation with family would be detrimental, or lawful provision would be difficult to obtain, or combining marriage and seclusion for worship would not be feasible, so he chose seclusion for worship. They are most knowledgeable of the secrets of their own conditions and the rulings of their eras regarding wholesome earnings, the dispositions of women, the perils of marriage for the one who marries, and its benefits. Since conditions are divided such that marriage is superior in some and abstention is superior in others, it is incumbent upon us to interpret the actions of the prophets according to what is superior in every situation, and God knows best.

**Chapter Two: Concerning What is Considered Regarding the State of the Contract from the Conditions of the Woman and the Stipulations of the Contract**

As for the contract, its pillars and conditions for its validity and establishing permissibility are four:
*   The first: The permission of the guardian; if there is none, then the ruler.
*   The second: The consent of the woman, if she is a non-virgin who has reached puberty, or if she is a virgin who has reached puberty but is being given in marriage by someone other than her father.
*   The third condition: The presence of two witnesses of apparent uprightness. If they are of concealed character, we rule its validity due to necessity.
*   The fourth: An offer and acceptance connected to it, with the wording of marriage (nikah or tazwij) or their specific meaning in every language, from two legally responsible persons, neither of whom is a woman, whether it is the husband, the guardian, or their agent.

As for its etiquettes: Preceding it with a proposal to the guardian, not while the woman is in her waiting period, but after its completion if she is in one, and not when another has preceded with a proposal, for it is prohibited to propose over a proposal. One should not propose over the proposal of his brother until the first proposer desists and gives him permission. Among its etiquettes is the proposal before the marriage, and mixing praise (tahmid) with the offer and acceptance. So the one giving in marriage says: "Praise be to God and blessings upon the Messenger of God, I give you my daughter so-and-so in marriage," and the husband says: "Praise be to God and blessings upon the Messenger of God, I accept her marriage upon this dowry." Let the dowry be known and light. Praise before the proposal is also recommended. Among its etiquettes is that the matter of the husband be conveyed to the hearing of the wife, and if she is a virgin, that is more conducive and more appropriate for affection. For this reason, it is recommended to look at her before marriage, for it is more likely to foster harmony between them.

Among the etiquettes is gathering a number of righteous people in addition to the two witnesses who are pillars for validity. Among them is to intend by the marriage the establishment of the Sunnah, lowering the gaze, seeking offspring, and all the benefits we have mentioned, and not for his aim to be mere passion and enjoyment, lest his action become among worldly actions. This does not preclude these intentions, for many a right coincides with passion. 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy on him, said: "When right coincides with passion, it is like musk with ambergris." It is not impossible for each one to be from the share...

The soul and religious duty are both motivators. It is recommended to contract marriage in the mosque and in the month of Shawwal. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, married me in Shawwal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwal." As for the woman to be married, two categories are considered: one for permissibility and the second for a wholesome life and the attainment of objectives. The first category is what is considered for permissibility, which is that she be free from the impediments to marriage. The impediments are nineteen:

The first: that she be married to another.
The second: that she be in a waiting period for another, whether it is a waiting period due to death, divorce, intercourse by mistake, or she is in a period of ascertaining freedom from pregnancy following intercourse with a slave woman owned.
The third: that she be an apostate from the religion due to a word of disbelief having passed her tongue.
The fourth: that she be a Zoroastrian.
The fifth: that she be an idolatress or a heretic who does not ascribe to a prophet and a scripture, including those who believe in the doctrine of permissiveness; thus, marriage to them is not lawful. Likewise, any woman who believes in a corrupt doctrine whose adherent is judged to be an unbeliever.
The sixth: that she be a scriptuary who adhered to their religion after alteration or after the mission of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and, moreover, she is not of Israelite descent. If both characteristics are absent, marriage to her is not lawful. If only the descent is absent, there is a difference of opinion.
The seventh: that she be a slave woman and the marrying man is free, capable of providing for a free woman, or not fearing hardship.
The eighth: that she, in whole or in part, be owned by the marrying man as a slave.
The ninth: that she be a relative of the husband, such that she be from his roots, his branches, the branches of his first roots, or from the first branch of every root after a root. By 'roots' I mean mothers and grandmothers; by 'his branches,' children and grandchildren; by 'branches of his first roots,' sisters and their children; and by 'the first branch of every root after a root,' paternal aunts and maternal aunts, but not their children.
The tenth: that she be prohibited due to fosterage. What is prohibited by lineage from roots and branches is prohibited by fosterage, as previously mentioned, but the prohibition requires five sucklings; less than that does not prohibit.
The eleventh: prohibition by affinity, which is that the marrying man has married her daughter or her grandmother, or possessed by contract or semblance of contract before, or had intercourse with them by mistake under a contract; or he had intercourse with her mother or one of her grandmothers by contract or semblance of contract. The mere contract with a woman prohibits her mothers but does not prohibit her descendants except by intercourse; or that his father or his son had married her before.
The twelfth: that the woman to be married be a fifth, meaning the marrying man has four others besides her, either in the marriage itself or in the waiting period for revocation. If she is in a waiting period for irrevocable divorce, she does not prevent the fifth.
The thirteenth: that the marrying man has her sister, her paternal aunt, or her maternal aunt under his marriage, thus combining both through marriage. Any two persons between whom there is a kinship such that if one were male and the other female, marriage between them would not be permissible, then it is not permissible to combine them.
The fourteenth: that this marrying man has divorced her thrice, so she is not lawful for him unless another husband has intercourse with her in a valid marriage.
The fifteenth: that the marrying man has imprecated against her, for she is forever prohibited to him after the imprecation.
The sixteenth: that she be in a state of ritual consecration for Hajj or 'Umrah, or the husband is likewise, so the marriage is not contracted except after the completion of the state of dissolution.
The seventeenth: that she be a non-virgin who is a minor, so her marriage is not valid except after puberty.
The eighteenth: that she be an orphan, so her marriage is not valid except after puberty.
The nineteenth: that she be from the wives of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, from those whom he passed away from or had entered upon, for they are the Mothers of the Believers. This does not exist in our time. These are the prohibitive impediments.

As for the qualities that sweeten life, which must be observed in a woman for the contract to endure and its objectives to be fulfilled, they are eight: religion, character, beauty, lightness of dowry, fertility, virginity, lineage, and that she not be a close relative.

The first: that she be righteous, possessing religion. This is the foundation, and it is upon this that care should be taken. For if she is weak in religion regarding safeguarding herself and her chastity, she will disgrace her husband, blacken his face among people, trouble his heart with jealousy, and thereby embitter his life. If he takes the path of zeal and jealousy, he will remain in tribulation and ordeal. If he takes the path of leniency, he will be negligent of his religion and honor and be ascribed to lack of zeal and self-respect. If she is beautiful along with corruption, her tribulation is more severe, for it is difficult for the husband to part from her; he cannot be patient without her nor be patient with her. He would be like the one who came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, I have a wife who does not refuse the hand of a toucher." He said, "Divorce her." He said, "But I love her." He said, "Then keep her." He only commanded him to keep her out of fear for him, that if he divorced her, he would follow his soul and also become corrupt with her. So he saw that in the continuation of his marriage lay the repulsion of corruption from him.

He whose heart is narrow is more deserving [of a wife], even if she is corrupt in religion, by exhausting his wealth or by another means, his life will remain troubled with her. If he remains silent and does not denounce it, he is a partner in the sin, opposing the words of the Almighty: "Guard yourselves and your families against a Fire." If he denounces and disputes, his life becomes bitter.

For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, strongly urged seeking a woman of religion, saying: "A woman is married for her wealth, her beauty, her lineage, and her religion. So choose the one with religion, may your hands be dusty." In another narration: "Whoever marries a woman for her wealth and beauty is deprived of her beauty and wealth. Whoever marries her for her religion, God will grant him her wealth and beauty." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not marry a woman for her beauty, for perhaps her beauty will ruin her. Nor for her wealth, for perhaps her wealth will make her arrogant. Marry a woman for her religion." He emphasized urging towards religion because such a woman is an aid to religion. If she is not religious, she becomes a distraction from religion and a cause of confusion for it.

The second [quality] is good character, which is an important foundation in seeking tranquility and assistance for religion. If she is sharp-tongued, abusive in speech, of bad character, and ungrateful for blessings, the harm from her is greater than the benefit. Patience with the tongues of women is something by which the righteous are tested. Some Arabs said: "Do not marry from women six types: not the moaner, nor the reminder of favors, nor the yearner, nor the covetous-eyed, nor the glittering, nor the garrulous." As for the moaner, she is the one who frequently moans and complains, tying up her head every hour. Marrying the chronically ill or the one who feigns illness holds no good. The reminder of favors is she who reminds her husband of favors, saying, "I did such and such for your sake." The yearner is she who yearns for another husband or her child from another husband, and this too must be avoided. The covetous-eyed is she who casts her glance at everything, desires it, and obliges her husband to buy it. The glittering carries two meanings: one, that she spends the entire day polishing and adorning her face so that her face has a glitter achieved by artifice; the second, that she becomes angry over food and eats only alone, considering her share of everything insufficient. This is a Yemeni expression; they say the woman 'glittered' and the child 'glittered' the food when he becomes angry at it. The garrulous is the excessively talkative, from which is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "God Almighty detests the garrulous, the pompous speakers."

God detests the eloquent man who picks his teeth with his tongue like a cow picks with its tongue. It is narrated that the ascetic Al-Azdi met Ilyas, peace be upon him, during his ascetic journey. He commanded him to marry and forbade him from celibacy, then said: "Do not marry four: the divorcer, the rivalrous, the fornicatress, and the rebellious." As for the divorcer, she is the one who seeks divorce every hour without cause. The rivalrous is she who boasts over others, vaunting worldly means. The fornicatress is the immoral woman known for a paramour or intimate friend; she is the one about whom God Almighty said: "Nor those who take secret lovers." The rebellious is she who elevates herself above her husband in action and speech; 'nushuz' is the elevated part of the ground. Ali, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "The worst traits in men are the best traits in women: stinginess, pride, and cowardice. For if a woman is stingy, she safeguards her wealth and her husband's wealth. If she is proud, she refrains from speaking to just anyone with soft, suspicious speech. If she is cowardly, she fears everything and does not leave her house, and she avoids places of suspicion out of fear of her husband." These accounts guide to the comprehensive morals desired in marriage.

The third is a beautiful face, for that is also desired, as through it chastity is attained, and nature is seldom content with ugliness. How can it be, when generally good character and good form do not separate? What we have transmitted urging towards religion and that a woman should not be married for her beauty is not a deterrent from considering beauty, but rather a deterrent from marrying for the sake of pure beauty alongside corruption in religion. For beauty alone, in most cases, encourages marriage and makes the matter of religion seem trivial. Indicating the consideration of the meaning of beauty is that affection and love are generally achieved through it. The Sacred Law has encouraged considering the causes of affection, and for that reason recommended looking, as he said: "If God places in the heart of one of you [desire] for a woman, then let him look at her, for it is more likely to bring affection between them," meaning to unite them, from the occurrence of 'adama' upon 'adama,' which is the inner skin and the epidermis, the outer skin. This was mentioned to emphasize harmony. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is something in the eyes of the Ansar, so if one of you wishes to marry from them, let him look at them." It is said there was a weakness in their eyes, or smallness. Some of the devout would not...

They marry their noble women only after seeing them, as a precaution against deception. Al-A'mash said: "Every marriage that occurs without prior sight ends in sorrow and grief." It is known that sight does not reveal character, religion, or wealth; it only distinguishes beauty from ugliness. It is related that a man married during the caliphate of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, and had dyed his hair, but the dye wore off. The woman's family complained to 'Umar, saying, "We thought he was a young man." 'Umar had him beaten severely and said, "You deceived the people."

It is also related that Bilal and Suhayb came to an Arab household to propose marriage. They were asked, "Who are you?" Bilal replied, "I am Bilal, and this is my brother Suhayb. We were astray, and God guided us; we were slaves, and God freed us; we were poor, and God enriched us. If you marry us to your women, praise be to God; if you refuse us, glory be to God." They said, "Rather, we will marry you to them, praise be to God." Suhayb said, "If only I had mentioned our battles and merits with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." Bilal said, "Be silent, for truth has married you off."

Deception can occur regarding both beauty and character. It is recommended to dispel deception about beauty by sight, and about character by description and inquiry. This should be done before marriage. One should only seek description of her character and beauty from someone who is discerning, truthful, knowledgeable of outward and inward states, who does not favor her so as to exaggerate praise, nor envy her so as to diminish it. For human nature tends, in the beginnings of marriage and in describing brides, toward excess or neglect; few are truthful and moderate therein. Rather, deceit and enticement are more common, and caution is vital for one who fears longing for other than his wife. As for one who seeks from a wife merely the Sunnah, or children, or management of the household, if he turns away from beauty, he is closer to asceticism, for it is generally a door to worldly life, though it may assist religion for some individuals.

Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "Asceticism is in everything, even regarding women: a man marries an old woman preferring asceticism in this world." Malik ibn Dinar, may God have mercy on him, used to say: "One of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl, for which he would be rewarded if he feeds and clothes her—she is of light maintenance, content with little—and instead marries the daughter of so-and-so, meaning children of the world, who then craves desires upon him and says, 'Clothe me with this and that.'" Ahmad ibn Hanbal chose a one-eyed woman over her sister, who was beautiful. He asked which of them was more intelligent, and was told the one-eyed one. He said, "Marry me to her." This is the practice of one who does not intend enjoyment. As for one who does not feel secure in his religion unless he has enjoyment, let him seek beauty, for taking pleasure in the permissible is a fortress for religion. It has been said: "If a woman is beautiful, of excellent character, with black pupils and hair, large eyes, intense whiteness of complexion, loving her husband, and restraining her gaze to him alone, she is in the image of the wide-eyed maidens (hur al-'in)." For God Almighty described the women of Paradise with these attributes in His saying: "good and beautiful" (khayrat hisan), meaning by "good" excellence of character; and in His saying: "restraining their glances" (qasirat al-tarf); and in His saying: "devoted, of equal age" ('urub atrab). The 'arub is one passionately in love with her husband, desiring intimacy, through which pleasure is complete. Al-hur is whiteness, and al-hawra' is one with intensely white eyes and intense blackness therein, with black hair; and al-'ayna' is wide-eyed.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The best of your women is she who, when her husband looks at her, she pleases him; when he commands her, she obeys him; and when he is absent, she guards herself and his property." She pleases him when he looks at her only if she is loving toward her husband.

Fourth: that she be of light dowry. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The best of women is she with the most beautiful face and the lightest dowry." Extravagance in dowry has been prohibited. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, married some of his wives for ten dirhams and household furnishings, which included a hand-mill, a water jar, and a leather cushion stuffed with palm fiber. And he gave a wedding feast for some of his wives with two mudd of barley. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to forbid extravagance in dowry and say: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, did not marry, nor give his daughters in marriage, for more than four hundred dirhams." If extravagance in women's dowries were an honor, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would have preceded others to it. Some Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, married for a gold nugget worth five dirhams. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab gave his daughter in marriage to Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, for two dirhams, then he himself carried her to him at night, brought her in through the door, then departed. He came to her after seven days and greeted her. If one marries for ten dirhams to avoid scholarly disagreement, there is no harm in it.

In the tradition, among the blessings of a woman are her quick marriage, her quick womb (i.e., childbirth), and the ease of her dowry. And just as extravagance in dowry from the woman's side is disliked, so too is asking about her wealth.

From the man's perspective, he should not marry out of greed for wealth. Al-Nuri said: If a man marries and says anything to the woman, know that he is a thief. And if he gives them a gift, he should not do so to compel them to reciprocate with more than it. Likewise, if they gift him something with the intention of seeking increase, that intention is corrupt. As for mutual gift-giving, it is recommended and is a cause of affection. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Give gifts to one another, and you will love one another." As for seeking increase, it falls under the saying of Allah, the Exalted: "And do not confer favors to gain more," meaning you give in order to seek more. And under His saying: "And whatever you give in usury so that it may increase in the wealth of people," for usury is increase, and this is seeking increase in general, even if it is not in usurious wealth. All of that is disliked and is an innovation in marriage resembling trade and gambling, and it corrupts the purposes of marriage.

Fifth, that the woman be fertile. If she is known to be barren, one should refrain from marrying her. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Marry the fertile, loving woman." If she has no husband and her condition is unknown, then her health and youth should be considered, for she will likely be fertile with these two qualities.

Sixth, that she be a virgin. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Jabir when he married a previously married woman: "Why not a virgin, so that you may play with her and she may play with you?" In virginity there are three benefits:

First, that she will love her husband and become attached to him, which influences the meaning of affection. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Marry the loving woman." Natures are disposed to familiarity with the first companion. As for one who has experienced men and known various conditions, she may not be pleased with some qualities that differ from what she is accustomed to, and thus she may dislike her husband.

Second, that it is more complete in his affection for her, for nature recoils from one whom someone other than the husband has touched, a certain recoil, and that weighs heavily on nature whenever it is remembered. Some natures are even more averse in this regard.

Third, that she will not yearn for a first husband, for the strongest love is usually that which occurs with the first beloved.

The seventh is that she be of noble lineage, meaning from a household of religion and righteousness, for she will raise her daughters and sons. If she is not well-mannered, she will not excel in discipline and upbringing. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Beware of the green manure." It was asked, "What is green manure?" He said, "A beautiful woman in a foul environment." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Choose carefully for your offspring, for lineage is compelling."

The eighth is that she not be from close kinship, for that diminishes desire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Do not marry close relatives, for the child will be born frail." It is said he meant: marry strangers. It is also said: seek distant marriages, do not become emaciated—meaning thin—due to its effect in weakening desire. For desire only arises from the strength of sensation through sight and touch, and sensation is only strengthened by something strange and new. As for the familiar, which one has gazed upon for a period, it weakens the sense from fully perceiving and being affected by it, and desire does not arise from it. These are the qualities desirable in women.

The guardian must also consider the qualities of the husband and look after his noble daughter, not marrying her to one of bad character or creation, weak in religion, falling short in fulfilling her rights, or not matching her in lineage. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Marriage is enslavement, so let each of you consider where he places his noble daughter." Caution regarding her rights is more important, for she is enslaved by marriage with no escape, while the husband is always capable of divorce. Whoever marries his daughter to an oppressor, sinner, innovator, or drinker has wronged her religion and exposed himself to God's displeasure for severing the ties of kinship and poor choice. A man said to Al-Hasan, "Several men have proposed to my daughter; to whom should I marry her?" He said, "To one who fears God, for if he loves her he will honor her, and if he dislikes her he will not wrong her." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever marries his noble daughter to a sinner has severed her kinship."

Chapter Three: On the Etiquettes of Cohabitation and What Pertains to the Continuation of Marriage, Regarding the Duties of the Husband and the Duties of the Wife.

As for the husband, he must observe moderation and etiquette in twelve matters: the wedding feast, cohabitation, jesting, management, jealousy, maintenance, teaching, division of time, discipline in case of defiance, intercourse, childbirth, and separation by divorce.

The first etiquette: the wedding feast, which is recommended. Anas (may God be pleased with him) said, "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) saw a trace of yellow on Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf (may God be pleased with him) and said, 'What is this?' He said, 'I married a woman for the weight of a date stone of gold.' He said, 'May God bless you; hold a feast even with a sheep.'" And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) held a feast for Safiyyah with dates and parched barley. And he (peace be upon him) said, "The feast of the first day is a right, the second day is a tradition, and the third day is show; and whoever shows off, God will expose him." It is recommended to congratulate him; whoever visits the groom should say, "May God bless you and bestow blessings upon you and unite you both in goodness."

It is recommended to publicize the marriage. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The distinction between the lawful and the unlawful is the tambourine and the voice." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "Announce this marriage, hold it in mosques, and beat tambourines for it." And from al-Rabee' bint Mu'awwidh, she said, "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) came and entered on the morning of my wedding, sat on my bed, and our young girls were beating their tambourines and lamenting those of my fathers who were killed, until one of them said, 'And among us is a prophet who knows what is tomorrow.' He said to her, 'Leave this and say what you were saying before.'"

The second etiquette: good character with them and enduring harm from them out of mercy for them due to their weak intellect. God Almighty said, "And live with them in kindness," and in emphasizing their rights, "And they have taken from you a solemn covenant," and "the companion by your side"—it is said this refers to the wife. The last advice the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) gave were three things he repeated until his tongue faltered and his speech became faint; he kept saying, "Prayer, prayer, and those whom your right hands possess; do not burden them beyond their capacity. Fear God, fear God regarding women, for they are captives in your hands"—meaning prisoners you have taken under God's trust and made lawful their intimacy by God's word.

As for the advice concerning women, it is well-known that this was during the Farewell Pilgrimage. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever is patient with his wife's bad character, God will give him reward like that given to Job for his affliction; and whoever is patient with her husband's bad character, God will give her reward like that of Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh."

Know that good character with her is not merely refraining from harming her, but enduring harm from her and being forbearing during her folly and anger, following the example of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), for his wives would argue with him.

Speech and refraining from it, each of them for a day until night. A woman argued with Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, regarding speech, so he said, "Do you argue with me, O Ka'aa?" She said, "The wives of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, argue with him, and he is better than you." Umar said, "Hafsa has failed and lost if she argues with him." Then he said to Hafsa, "Do not be deceived by the daughter of Ibn Abi Quhafa, for she is beloved to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him," and he warned her against arguing. It is narrated that one of them pushed the chest of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and her mother scolded her, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Leave her, for they do more than that."

Words occurred between him and Aisha until they brought Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, as an arbitrator and witness. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her, "Will you speak, or shall I speak?" She said, "Rather, you speak, and do not say except the truth." So Abu Bakr struck her until her mouth bled, and he said, "O enemy of herself, would he say other than the truth?" She sought refuge with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and sat behind his back. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "We did not call you for this, nor did we intend this from you." She once said to him during an argument in which she became angry, "You are the one who claims to be the Prophet of Allah?" The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, smiled and bore it with forbearance and nobility. He used to say to her, "I indeed recognize your anger from your pleasure." She said, "How do you recognize it?" He said, "When you are pleased, you say, 'No, by the Lord of Muhammad,' and when you are angry, you say, 'No, by the Lord of Ibrahim.'" She said, "You have spoken truthfully; I only avoid your name." Her hadith is established, and it is said that the first love that occurred in Islam was the love of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. He used to say to her, "I am to you like Abu Zar' to Umm Zar', except that I will not divorce you."

He used to say to his wives, "Do not harm me regarding Aisha, for by Allah, revelation never descended upon me while I was in the blanket of any woman among you except her." Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most merciful of people toward women and children."

The third is to exceed bearing harm with playfulness, jesting, and amusement, for that gladdens the hearts of women. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to jest with them and descend to the levels of their intellects in actions and character. It is narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, used to race with Aisha in running; she outpaced him one day, and he outpaced her on other days. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "This is for that." In the report, he, peace and blessings be upon him, was among the most playful of people with his wives. Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said, "I heard the voices of some people from the Abyssinians and others while they were playing on the day of Ashura. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me, 'Would you like to see their play?' I said, 'Yes.' So he sent for them, and they came. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, stood between the two doors, placed his palm on the door, extended his hand, and I placed my chin on his hand. They began to play, and I watched. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, kept saying, 'Enough,' and I said, 'Be quiet,' two or three times. Then he said, 'O Aisha, enough?' I said, 'Yes.' So he gestured to them, and they departed." The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The most complete of the believers in faith are the best of them in character and the gentlest with their families." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The best of you are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives."

Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, despite his sternness, "A man should be among his family like a child, but when they seek what he possesses, they find a man." Luqman, may Allah have mercy on him, said, "The wise should be among his family like a child, and when among people, he is found a man." In interpreting the narrated report, "Indeed, Allah hates the harsh, the miserly," it is said he is the one severe with his family, arrogant in himself. This is among what is said regarding the meaning of His saying, exalted is He, "a tyrant." It is said the tyrant is the one with coarse speech, harsh-hearted toward his family. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Jabir, "Why not a virgin, so you play with her and she plays with you?" A Bedouin woman described her deceased husband, saying, "By Allah, he was laughing when he entered, silent when he left, eating what he found without asking about what was missing."

The fourth is not to expand in jesting, good character, and compliance by following her whims to a degree that corrupts her character and completely diminishes his awe before her. Rather, he observes moderation in it, not abandoning awe and restraint whenever he sees a wrong, nor opening the door to assisting in wrongs at all. Rather, whenever he sees what contradicts the Sacred Law and manliness, he becomes stern and displeased. Al-Hasan said, "By Allah, no man obeys his wife in what she desires except that Allah casts him into the Fire." Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Oppose women, for in opposing them is blessing." It has been said, "Consult them and oppose them." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said...

May peace and blessings be upon him (Wretched is the husband-slave). He said this because if a man obeys his wife in her whims, he is indeed her slave and is wretched. For Allah made the woman his possession, yet he made himself her possession, thus inverting the matter and reversing the case. He has obeyed Satan when he said, ("And I will command them so they will surely alter Allah's creation"), for it is the man's right to be followed, not a follower.

Allah has named men (maintainers of women) and called the husband a master, as He, the Exalted, said, ("And they found her master at the door"). So if the master becomes subjugated, he has indeed ("exchanged the favor of Allah for disbelief"). A woman's soul is akin to your own; if you loosen her rein a little, she will bolt with you for a long distance. If you slacken her bridle for a moment, she will drag you an arm's length. But if you curb her and tighten your grip upon her in times of severity, you will master her. Imam al-Shafi'i, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ("Three, if you honor them, they will disgrace you; and if you disgrace them, they will honor you: a woman, a servant, and a Nabatean.") He meant that if you offer pure honor without mixing your sternness with gentleness and your harshness with kindness.

The women of Arabia used to teach their daughters how to test husbands. A woman would say to her daughter: Test your husband before advancing and being bold with him. First, pull the shaft from his spear; if he remains silent, then cut meat upon his shield; if he remains silent, then break bones with his sword; if he remains silent, then place the saddle on his back and mount him, for he is but your donkey.

In summary, by justice the heavens and the earth are upheld. Everything that exceeds its limit reverts to its opposite. Therefore, one should follow the path of moderation in opposition and agreement, and pursue truth in all of that, to be safe from their harm, for ("their guile is immense"), their harm is widespread, and what predominates in them is bad character and weakness of intellect. This is not balanced in them except by a kind of gentleness mixed with governance. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("The likeness of a righteous woman among women is that of a white-bellied crow among a hundred crows")—al-A'sam meaning white-bellied. And in the advice of Luqman to his son: ("O my son, beware of the wicked woman, for she will age you before old age; and beware of the worst women, for they do not call to good. And be cautious even of the best among them.") And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("Seek refuge from the three destroyers"), counting among them the wicked woman, for she brings aging before gray hair. In another wording: If you are with her, she insults you, and if you are absent, she betrays you. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding the best of women, ("You are the companions of Yusuf"), meaning that your turning Abu Bakr away from leading the prayer was a inclination from truth to desire. Allah the Exalted said when they disclosed the secret of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, ("If you two repent to Allah, for your hearts have certainly inclined"), that is, leaned. And He said that about the best of his wives—the two women being 'A'ishah and Hafsa.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("A people will not succeed who are ruled by a woman"). 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, rebuked his wife when she argued with him, saying: You are but a plaything in the corner of the house; if we have need of you, fine, otherwise sit as you are. So there is evil in them and there is weakness in them. Governance and sternness are the remedy for the evil, and playfulness and mercy are the remedy for the weakness. The skilled physician is he who measures the treatment according to the disease. So let a man first look at her character through experience, then treat her with what rectifies her, as her condition requires.

The fifth is moderation in jealousy: that he not be neglectful of the beginnings of matters whose consequences are feared, nor exaggerate in ill suspicion, obstinacy, and spying into hidden affairs. For the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade ("seeking out the faults of women"). In another wording: that you surprise women. And when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, returned from a journey, he said before entering Medina, ("Do not enter upon women at night"). Two men opposed him and went ahead, and each saw in his home what he disliked. And in the well-known report: ("A woman is like a rib; if you try to straighten it, you will break it, so enjoy her while she is crooked"). This pertains to refining her character.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("Among jealousy is a jealousy that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, hates, and that is a man's jealousy toward his family without cause"), for that is from ill suspicion, which we are forbidden from, as ("some suspicion is sin"). And 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said, ("Do not be excessively jealous of your family, lest you be accused of evil on your account"). As for jealousy in its proper place, it is necessary and praiseworthy. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("Allah, the Exalted, is jealous, and the believer is jealous. And the jealousy of Allah, the Exalted, is that a believing man should commit what Allah has forbidden to him"). And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ("Do you marvel at the jealousy of Sa'd? By Allah, I am more jealous than him, and Allah is more jealous than I"). It is due to the jealousy of Allah, the Exalted, that He has forbidden immoralities, both apparent and concealed. And no one is more fond of accepting excuses than Allah, and for that reason He sent the warners.

And the bearers of glad tidings, and none is more beloved of praise than God, and for that reason He promised Paradise.  
And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “On the night I was taken on the heavenly journey, I saw in Paradise a palace, and in its courtyard a maiden. I said, ‘For whom is this palace?’ It was said, ‘For ‘Umar.’ I wished to look at her, but I remembered your protective jealousy, O ‘Umar.’” So ‘Umar wept and said, “Would I feel jealousy over you, O Messenger of God?”  
And al-Hasan used to say: “Do you send your women out to jostle with non-Arabs in the markets? May God disgrace the one who feels no protective jealousy.”  
And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “There is a protective jealousy that God loves and a protective jealousy that God hates; and there is pride that God loves and pride that God hates. As for the jealousy God loves, it is jealousy in matters of suspicion; and the jealousy God hates is jealousy in matters free of suspicion. And the pride God loves is a man’s pride in himself in battle and at the moment of clash; and the pride God hates is pride in falsehood.”  
And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “I am indeed jealous, and there is no man who lacks jealousy except one with an inverted heart.”  
The apparent meaning is that it refers to ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Hanafiyyah. The way that makes jealousy unnecessary is that men should not enter upon her, and she should not go out to the markets.  
And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to his daughter Fatimah, peace be upon her: “What is best for a woman?” She said, “That she not see a man and no man see her.” So he embraced her and said, “Offspring, one from another.” He approved of her statement.  
And the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to cover windows and holes in walls so that women would not look out at men. Mu‘adh saw his wife looking out through a window and struck her. And he saw his wife had given his servant an apple from which she had taken a bite, and he struck her.  
And ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: “Leave women in simple dress, and they will remain in their chambers.” He said that only because they would not desire to go out in shabby attire.  
And he said: “Accustom your women to saying ‘No.’”  
And indeed the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had permitted women to attend the mosque. But the correct position now is to prevent them, except for elderly women. Indeed, this was considered preferable even in the time of the Companions, so much so that ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: “If the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had known what women would innovate after him, he would have prevented them from going out.”  
And when Ibn ‘Umar said, “The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: ‘Do not prevent the female servants of God from the mosques of God,’” one of his sons said, “Yes, by God, we will prevent them.” So he struck him and became angry with him, saying, “You hear me say, ‘The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do not prevent,’ and you say, ‘Yes, we will’?”  
He dared to oppose only because he knew the times had changed. And he was angry with him only for uttering words of open opposition without showing the excuse.  
Likewise, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had permitted them to go out specifically on the festivals, but they should not go out except with their husbands’ consent.  
Going out is now permissible for a chaste woman with her husband’s consent, but staying at home is safer. And she should not go out except for a necessary matter, for going out for sightseeing and matters that are not necessary damages chivalry and may lead to corruption. If she does go out, she should lower her gaze from men.  
We do not say that a man’s face is, in her regard, like a nakedness as a woman’s face is in his regard; rather, it is like the face of a beardless youth in a man’s regard. Thus, looking is forbidden only when there is fear of temptation; if there is no temptation, then it is not, for men have always, throughout time, been with uncovered faces, and women have gone out veiled. If men’s faces were nakedness in women’s regard, they would have been commanded to veil or prevented from going out except out of necessity.  

Sixth: moderation in expenditure. One should not be stingy with them in spending, nor should one be extravagant, but rather be moderate. God Almighty said: “Eat and drink, but do not be extravagant.” And He said: “Do not keep your hand chained to your neck, nor stretch it out completely.”  
And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The best of you are the best to their families.” And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “A dinar you spend in the way of God, a dinar you spend to free a slave, a dinar you give in charity to a poor person, and a dinar you spend on your family—the greatest in reward is the one you spend on your family.”  
It is said that ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, had four wives, and he would buy for each one meat worth a dirham every four days.  
And al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, said: “They used to be generous with men and frugal with women and clothing.”  
And Ibn Sirin said: “It is recommended for a man to prepare for his family each week a sweet dish, as if it were a treat.” Even if sweets are not among necessities, abandoning them altogether is miserliness in custom.  
And he should instruct her to give in charity the leftovers of food and what would spoil if left, for this is the lowest degree of goodness. And a woman may do that according to the situation without explicit permission from the husband. Nor should he keep things exclusively for himself apart from his family.

If the food is wholesome, he should not withhold it from them, for that breeds resentment in hearts and distances one from proper companionship. If he intends to do so, he should eat it discreetly so his family does not know, and he should not describe a meal to them that he does not intend to share with them. When he eats, he should have all his household sit at his table, for Sufyan, may God be pleased with him, said: "It has reached us that God and His angels send blessings upon a household who eat together."

The most important duty for him to observe in expenditure is to provide for her from lawful means and not to enter into dubious avenues for her sake, for that is an offense against her, not consideration for her. We have mentioned the narrations concerning this when discussing the seventh pitfall of marriage: that the married man should learn from the knowledge of menstruation and its rulings what is necessary for obligatory precaution, and teach his wife the rulings of prayer, what must be made up from it during menstruation and what need not. For he is commanded to protect her from the Fire by God's saying, exalted is He: "Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire." Therefore, he must instruct her in the creed of the People of the Sunnah, remove from her heart any innovation she may have heard, admonish her for God's sake if she is negligent in religious matters, and teach her the rulings of menstruation and irregular bleeding that she needs. The knowledge of irregular bleeding is extensive. As for what women must be guided to regarding menstruation, it is clarifying the prayers they must make up. For whenever her bleeding ceases before Maghrib by the duration of a rak'ah, she must make up Dhuhr and 'Asr; and if it ceases before Fajr by the duration of a rak'ah, she must make up Maghrib and 'Isha'. This is the minimum that women should observe. If the man is diligent in teaching her, she has no need to go out to ask the scholars. If the man's knowledge is lacking but he asks on her behalf and informs her of the mufti's answer, she has no need to go out. If that is not the case, then she may go out to ask—indeed, she must do so—and the man sins by preventing her. Whenever she learns what is obligatory upon her, she may not go out to a gathering of remembrance or to learn additional merits except with his permission. If a woman neglects a ruling of menstruation or irregular bleeding and the man did not teach her, the man is held accountable with her and shares in the sin.

Eighth: If he has multiple wives, he should be just between them and not incline to some over others. If he travels and wishes to take one, he should draw lots between them. This is what the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to do. If he wrongs a wife by missing her night, he must make it up for her, for making it up is obligatory upon him. At that point, one needs to know the rulings of the division, and detailing that would be lengthy.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has two wives and inclines to one over the other—and in another wording: 'and does not be just between them'—will come on the Day of Resurrection with one of his sides drooping." His duty is justice in provision and nights spent. As for love and intimacy, that is not within one's control. God Almighty said: "You will never be able to be equal between wives, even if you should strive." That is, to be equal in the heart's desire and the soul's inclination, and from that follows disparity in intimacy. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to be just between them in provision and nights spent, saying: "O God, this is my effort in what I possess, and I have no power over what You possess and I do not," meaning love. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, was the most beloved of his wives to him, and his other wives knew that. He would be carried around during his illness each day and night, spending the night with each of them, and he would say, "Where am I tomorrow?" One of his wives understood this and said, "He is only asking about 'A'ishah's day." They said, "O Messenger of God, we have given you permission to be in 'A'ishah's house, for it is burdensome for you to be carried each night." He said, "Have you agreed to this?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Then move me to 'A'ishah's house." If one wife gives her night to her co-wife and the husband consents, her right is established.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to divide his time between his wives. He intended to divorce Sawdah bint Zam'ah when she grew old, so she gave her night to 'A'ishah and asked him to keep her as a wife so she would be resurrected among his wives. He left her, and he would not allocate a night for her but would allocate two nights for 'A'ishah and one night each for the rest of his wives. However, due to his justice and strength, peace and blessings be upon him, if his soul yearned for one of his wives outside her turn and he was intimate with her, he would go to all his wives during that day or night. From this is what is narrated from 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, "visited all his wives in one night." And from Anas that he, peace and blessings be upon him, visited nine wives in the forenoon. If a dispute occurs between them and matters are not reconciled, if it is from both of them or from the man, and the wife cannot be disciplined by her husband nor can he set her right, then it is necessary...

Two arbitrators are appointed, one from his family and the other from hers, to examine their situation and reconcile them if they desire reconciliation. God will bring about harmony between them. Indeed, Umar, may God be pleased with him, sent an arbitrator to a couple. He returned without having reconciled them, so Umar struck him with a whip and said, "God Almighty says, 'If they desire reconciliation, God will bring about harmony between them.'" The man returned, improved his intention, and dealt with them gently, and he reconciled them. However, if the discord is specifically from the wife, then "men are the protectors and maintainers of women," so he may discipline her and compel her to obedience by force. Likewise, if she is abandoning prayer, he may compel her to pray by force. However, he should proceed gradually in disciplining her. He should begin with admonition, warning, and intimidation. If that does not succeed, he should turn his back to her in bed or separate from her in the bed and avoid her while remaining with her in the house, from one night to three nights. If that does not succeed with her, he may strike her a non-severe beating that causes her pain but does not break a bone, draw blood, or strike her face, for that is prohibited.

It was said to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, "What is the right of the wife upon the husband?" He said, "That he feeds her when he eats, clothes her when he clothes himself, does not strike her face, does not beat her except with a non-severe beating, and does not shun her except in the bed." He may become angry with her and shun her in a matter of religion for ten, twenty, or a month. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did this when he sent a gift to Zaynab, and she returned it to him. The one who was in his house said to him, "She has certainly humiliated you by returning your gift." It is mentioned that he, peace and blessings be upon him, shunned his wives for a month when he sent a gift to Zaynab and she returned it. The one in his house said, "She has certainly humiliated you," meaning she belittled and demeaned you. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "You are more insignificant to God than that you could humiliate me." Then he was angry with all of them for a month until he returned to them.

The tenth concerns the etiquette of intercourse. It is recommended to begin by mentioning the name of God Almighty and first reciting "Say: He is God, the One," and to magnify and glorify God, and to say, "In the name of God, the Most High, the Most Great. O God, make it good offspring if You have decreed that it should come forth from my loins." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "If one of you, when he approaches his wife, says, 'O God, keep Satan away from me and keep Satan away from what You provide us,' then if a child is decreed for them, Satan will not harm it." And when ejaculation is near, say within yourself without moving your lips, "Praise be to God who created man from water and made him kindred and in-law, and your Lord is ever Powerful." Some of the companions of hadith would magnify God until the people of the house heard his voice, then he would turn away from the direction of prayer and not face the direction of prayer during intercourse out of reverence for it. And he should cover himself and his wife with a garment. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would cover his head, lower his voice, and say to the woman, "Upon you is tranquility."

In the report: "When one of you has intercourse with his wife, let them not both become naked like two donkeys." And he should precede it with gentle speech and kissing. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Let not one of you fall upon his wife like an animal falls. Let there be a messenger between them." It was said, "And what is the messenger, O Messenger of God?" He said, "The kiss and speech." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three things are from incapacity in a man: that he meets someone whose acquaintance he would love, then parts from him before learning his name and lineage; the second, that someone honors him and he rejects his honor; and the third, that a man approaches his female servant or his wife and takes her before speaking to her, keeping her company, and lying with her, so he fulfills his need from her before she fulfills her need from him." And it is disliked for him to have intercourse on three nights of the month: the first, the last, and the middle. It is said that Satan attends intercourse on these nights, and it is said that the devils have intercourse on them. This dislike is reported from Ali, Mu'awiyah, and Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with them.

Some scholars recommend intercourse on Friday and its night, affirming one of the two interpretations of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "May God have mercy on the one who washes and performs the major ablution." Then, when he has fulfilled his desire, let him remain with his wife until she also fulfills her craving, for her climax may be delayed, and then her desire is aroused, and then leaving her is harmful to her. The difference in the nature of climax causes aversion whenever the husband precedes in climax. Harmony in the timing of climax is more pleasurable for her. The man should occupy himself with her, for she may be shy. And he should come to her once every four nights, for that is most equitable, since the number of wives is four, so it is permissible to delay to this extent. Indeed, he should increase or decrease according to her need for chastity, for ensuring her chastity is obligatory upon him, even though demanding intercourse is not legally enforceable due to the difficulty of demanding and fulfilling it. And he should not come to her during menstruation nor after its cessation and before

Ghusl (ritual bath) is prohibited by explicit text of the Book, and it is said that it causes leprosy in the offspring. However, one may enjoy the entire body of a menstruating woman, but not approach her in the place (of intercourse), for approaching a menstruating woman is prohibited due to harm, and the harm is constant in other than the place, making it more severely prohibited than approaching her.

And the saying of the Almighty, "So approach your tilth when and how you will," means at whatever time you wish. He may also seek pleasure with her hands and enjoy what is beneath the waist-wrapper as he desires, apart from intercourse. It is proper for the woman to wear a waist-wrapper from her waist to above the knee during menstruation, as this is part of etiquette. He may eat with the menstruating woman and mix with her in bedding and otherwise, and he is not required to avoid her. If he wishes to have intercourse a second time after the first, he should first wash his private part. If he has a wet dream, he should not have intercourse until he washes his private part or urinates. Intercourse is disliked at the beginning of the night so that one does not sleep without purification. If he wishes to sleep or eat, he should first perform ablution like that for prayer, as this is the Sunnah. Ibn 'Umar said: I asked the Prophet, peace be upon him, "Does one of us sleep while in a state of major ritual impurity?" He said, "Yes, if he performs ablution." But a concession has been reported regarding it. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, would sleep in a state of major ritual impurity without touching water. Whenever he returns to his bed, he should wipe the surface of his bed or shake it, for he does not know what may have occurred on it after him. He should not shave, trim nails, remove hair, let blood, or separate any part of himself while in a state of major ritual impurity, for all his parts will be returned to him in the Hereafter, and he will return in a state of impurity. It is said that every hair will demand its due from his impurity. Among the etiquettes is not to practice withdrawal ('azl), but rather not to proceed except to the place of tilth, which is the womb. For there is no soul that God has decreed to exist except that it will come into being, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said.

If withdrawal is practiced, the scholars have differed regarding its permissibility and dislike into four schools: some permit it absolutely in all cases, some prohibit it absolutely in all cases, some say it is permissible with her consent and not permissible without her consent—as if this opinion prohibits harm but not withdrawal itself—and some say it is permissible with a slave woman but not with a free woman. The correct view according to us is that it is permissible. As for dislike, it is used for prohibition, for reprehensibility, and for abandoning what is superior. It is disliked in the third sense, meaning it involves abandoning a virtue, just as it is said: it is disliked for one sitting in the mosque to sit idle without engaging in remembrance or prayer, and it is disliked for one present in Mecca residing there not to perform Hajj every year. The meaning of this dislike is only abandoning what is preferable and virtuous. This is established due to the virtue in offspring we have explained and due to what is narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him: "A man may have intercourse with his wife and be written for him, due to his intercourse, the reward of a male child who fights in the path of God and is killed." He said that because if such a child were born to him, he would have the reward of being the means to him, even though God Almighty is his Creator, Giver of life, and Strengthener for jihad. What pertains to him from being the means, he has done, which is intercourse, and that is at the emission into the womb. We said there is no dislike in the sense of prohibition or reprehensibility because establishing a prohibition is only possible by text or analogy to a text, and there is no text nor principle to analogize from. Rather, here there is a principle to analogize from, which is abandoning marriage altogether, or abandoning intercourse after marriage, or abandoning emission after penetration. All of that is abandoning what is superior, but it is not abandoning a prohibition. There is no difference, since the child is formed by the sperm falling into the womb. It has four causes: marriage, then intercourse, then patience until emission after intercourse, then pausing so that the semen settles in the womb. Some of these causes are closer than others. Abstaining from the fourth is like abstaining from the third, and likewise the third like the second, and the second like the first. This is not like abortion and infanticide, for those are crimes against an existing being.

It also has degrees, and the first degree of existence is when the sperm falls into the womb and mixes with the woman's fluid, becoming ready to receive life. Corrupting that is a crime. If it becomes a clot and a clinging substance, the crime becomes more heinous. If the soul is blown into it and the creation is completed, the crime increases in heinousness. The utmost heinousness in crime is after separation alive. We said the beginning of the cause of existence is from the semen falling into the womb, not from its exit from the urethra, because the child is not created from the man's semen alone, but from both spouses—either from his fluid and her fluid, or from his fluid and menstrual blood. Some anatomists said that the clot is created, by God's decree, from menstrual blood, and the blood from it is like milk from curd, and the man's sperm is a condition for the clotting and congealing of menstrual blood, like rennet for milk, for by it the curd congeals. However it may be, the woman's fluid is a pillar in the congealing, so the two fluids operate as the affirmative cause.

Acceptance in legal existence within contracts: if one makes an offer then retracts before acceptance, they are not considered to have violated the contract through annulment or dissolution. Whenever offer and acceptance are combined, retraction thereafter constitutes revocation, dissolution, and termination. Just as the sperm within the backbone does not develop into a child, so too after exiting the urethra unless it mixes with the woman’s fluid and blood—this is the clear analogy. If you say: Since withdrawal is not disliked in terms of preventing the child’s existence, it is not far-fetched that it be disliked due to the intention motivating it, for nothing motivates it except a corrupt intention containing something of hidden polytheism’s impurities.

I say: The intentions motivating withdrawal are five. The first, concerning slave-concubines, is preserving property from destruction due to entitlement to emancipation, and intending to retain ownership by avoiding emancipation and removing its causes—this is not prohibited. The second is preserving the woman’s beauty and plumpness for continued enjoyment and safeguarding her life fearing the peril of childbirth—this too is not prohibited. The third is fearing excessive hardship due to numerous children and avoiding the need for toil in earning and entering corrupt avenues—this also is not prohibited, for reducing hardship aids religion. Indeed, perfection and virtue lie in reliance and trust in God’s guarantee, as He said: “There is no creature on earth but that its provision is upon God.” Undoubtedly, it falls short of the peak of perfection and forsakes the superior, but considering consequences and safeguarding and saving wealth, even if contrary to reliance, we do not say it is prohibited. The fourth is fearing female children due to the disgrace believed in marrying them, as was the custom of the Arabs in killing females—this is a corrupt intention; if marriage or intercourse itself were abandoned because of it, one would sin thereby, not by abandoning marriage and intercourse, so too in withdrawal. The corruption in believing disgrace in the Sunnah of God’s Messenger (peace be upon him) is more severe and equates to a woman who abandoned marriage out of disdain for being mounted by a man, thus imitating men—the dislike does not pertain to abandoning marriage itself. The fifth is the woman’s abstention due to her pride and extreme fastidiousness, avoiding childbirth, postpartum bleeding, and breastfeeding—this was the habit of Kharijite women due to their excessive use of water, even performing prayers of menstrual days and entering toilets only naked—this is an innovation opposing the Sunnah, thus a corrupt intention. One of them sought permission from ‘A’ishah (may God be pleased with her) when she arrived in Basra, but she did not permit her. Thus, the intent is corrupt, not preventing childbirth.

If you say: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Whoever abandons marriage fearing dependents is not of us—three times.” I say: Withdrawal is like abandoning marriage, and his saying “not of us” means not conforming to our Sunnah and way, and our Sunnah is doing the superior. If you say: He (peace be upon him) said regarding withdrawal, “That is the hidden infanticide,” and recited, “And when the buried infant is asked”—this is in the authentic collections—and his saying “hidden infanticide” is like his saying “hidden polytheism,” which necessitates dislike, not prohibition. If you say: Ibn ‘Abbas said, “Withdrawal is the minor infanticide, for what is prevented from existing by it is the minor buried infant.” We say: This is his analogy equating preventing existence with terminating it, and it is a weak analogy; thus, ‘Ali (may God be pleased with him) objected to him upon hearing it, saying, “And she is not a buried infant except after seven,” meaning after the other seven stages, and he recited the verse concerning stages of creation: “We created man from an extract of clay, then placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging…” until “…then We produced him as another creation,” meaning We breathed into him the soul, then he recited God’s verse, “And when the buried infant is asked.” If you reflect on what we presented in the method of analogy and consideration, the disparity in rank between ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbas (may God be pleased with them) in delving into meanings and grasping knowledge becomes clear. How so? In the agreed-upon authentic reports in the two Sahihs from Jabir that he said, “We practiced withdrawal during the time of God’s Messenger (peace be upon him) while the Qur’an was being revealed,” and in another wording, “We practiced withdrawal, and it reached the Prophet of God (peace be upon him), and he did not forbid us.” Also in them from Jabir that he said, “A man came to God’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and said, ‘I have a slave-girl who serves us and waters our palms, and I have intercourse with her but dislike her becoming pregnant.’ He (peace be upon him) said, ‘Practice withdrawal with her if you wish, for what is decreed for her will come to her.’ The man remained as long as God willed, then came to him and said, ‘The girl has become pregnant.’ He said, ‘I told you: What is decreed for her will come to her.’” All that is in the two Sahihs.

The eleventh: On the etiquette of childbirth, which are five:
The first: Not to excessively rejoice over a male nor grieve over a female, for one does not know in which lies the better good. How many...

Who is the companion of a son who wishes he had none, or wishes for a daughter instead? Nay, safety from them is greater, and the reward concerning them is more abundant. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has a daughter, and he educates her well, provides for her well, and bestows upon her from the bounty which God has bestowed upon him, she will be for him a shield and a means from the Fire to Paradise." [154] And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no one who raises two daughters and treats them well as long as they remain with him, except that they will admit him into Paradise." [155] And Anas reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has two daughters or two sisters and treats them well as long as they remain with him, I and he will be in Paradise like these two," [156] and he joined his two fingers. And Anas reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever goes out to one of the markets of the Muslims, buys something, carries it to his home, and gives it specifically to the females and not the males, God will look upon him; and whomsoever God looks upon, He will not punish." [157] And from Anas, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever carries a morsel from the market to his dependents, it is as if he carried charity to them until he places it among them. And let him begin with the females before the males. For whoever gladdens a female, it is as if he wept from fear of God; and whoever weeps from fear of Him, God will forbid his body to the Fire." [158] And Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has three daughters or three sisters and is patient with their troubles and hardships, God will admit him into Paradise by the grace of His mercy upon them." A man said: "And two, O Messenger of God?" He said: "And two." Another man said: "Or one?" He said: "And one." [159]

The second manner is to pronounce the call to prayer in the ear of the newborn. Rafi' reported from his father, who said: "I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, give the call to prayer in the ear of al-Husayn when Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, gave birth to him." [160] And it is reported from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Whoever has a child born to him, and gives the call to prayer in its right ear and the *iqamah* in its left ear, the harm of Umm al-Sibyan is warded off from it." [161] And it is recommended that they teach him, at the first loosening of his tongue, "There is no god but God," so that it may be his first speech. And circumcision on the seventh day is established by a report. [162]

The third manner is to give him a good name, for that is from the right of the child. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When you name, then worship." [163] And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The names most beloved to God are 'Abd Allah and 'Abd al-Rahman." [164] And he said: "Name by my name, but do not use my *kunya*." [165] In another wording: "You may name..." The scholars said: "That was in his time, peace and blessings be upon him, when he would be called, 'O Abu al-Qasim.' But now, there is no harm. However, it is not permissible to combine his name and his *kunya*, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Do not combine my name and my *kunya*.'" [166] And it is said that this also was during his lifetime. And a man was named Abu 'Isa, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, 'Isa has no father." [167] Thus, that is disliked. And a miscarried child should be named. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah said: "It reached me that the miscarried child will cry out on the Day of Resurrection behind his father, saying: 'You neglected me and left me without a name.'" So 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: "How can that be, when he may not know if it was a boy or a girl?" 'Abd al-Rahman said: "There are names that encompass both, like Hamzah, 'Amarah, Talhah, and 'Utbah."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "You will be called on the Day of Resurrection by your names and the names of your fathers, so make your names good." [168] And whoever has a name he dislikes, it is recommended to change it. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, changed the name al-'As to 'Abd Allah. [169] And the name of Zaynab was Barrah, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "She is declaring herself pure," and he named her Zaynab. [170] Likewise, the prohibition has been reported regarding naming [someone] Aflah, Yasar, Nafi', and Barakah, [171] because it may be said, "Is there any barakah (blessing)?" and one would have to say, "No."

The fourth is the *'aqiqah*: two sheep for a male and one sheep for a female, whether male or female [sheep]. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded that for a boy, two equivalent sheep be sacrificed as *'aqiqah*, and for a girl, one sheep. [172] And it is reported that he sacrificed one sheep for al-Hasan. [173] And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "With the boy is his *'aqiqah*; so shed blood on his behalf and remove harm from him." [174] And from the Sunnah is to give in charity the weight of his hair in gold or silver, for a report has come in it that he, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, on the seventh day of al-Husayn, to shave his hair and give in charity the weight of his hair in silver. [175] 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "No bone of the *'aqiqah* animal should be broken." The fifth is to give him his first taste (*tahnik*) with a date or something sweet. It is reported from Asma' bint Abi Bakr, may God be pleased with them both, who said: "I gave birth to 'Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in Quba', then I brought him to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. He placed him in his lap, then called for a date, chewed it, then put the saliva in his mouth." [176] So the first thing that entered his belly was the saliva of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.

May Allah's peace and blessings be upon him. Then he performed the *tahneek* for him with a date and supplicated for him and invoked blessings upon him. He was the first child born in Islam, so they rejoiced over him with immense joy because it had been said to them, "The Jews have bewitched you, so no child will be born to you."

The twelfth [chapter] is on divorce. Know that it is permissible, but it is the most detestable of permissible things to Allah, the Exalted. It is only permissible when it does not involve wrongful harm. Whenever he divorces her, he has harmed her, and it is not permissible to harm another except due to a transgression on her part or a necessity on his part. Allah, the Exalted, says: "If they obey you, then do not seek a way against them" (Quran 4:34), meaning do not seek a stratagem for separation. And if his father dislikes her, let him divorce her. Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "I had a wife whom I loved, but my father disliked her and ordered me to divorce her. So I consulted the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, 'O Ibn 'Umar, divorce your wife.'" This indicates that the right of the parent takes precedence, but a parent who dislikes her not for a corrupt motive, like 'Umar. Whenever she harms her husband or slanders his family, she is a transgressor. Likewise, if she is of bad character or corrupt in religion. Ibn Mas'ud said regarding the statement of Allah, the Exalted, "Nor should they leave unless they commit a clear immorality" (Quran 65:1): "Whenever she slanders his family and harms her husband, that is an immorality." This is intended regarding the waiting period, but it points to the intended meaning. If the harm is from the husband, she may ransom herself by offering wealth. It is disliked for the man to take from her more than he gave, for that is injustice to her and oppression against her, and a transaction over intimacy. Allah, the Exalted, says: "There is no blame upon them for what she gives up to secure her release" (Quran 2:229). Returning what he took or less is suitable for the ransom. If she asks for divorce without a valid reason, she is sinful. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Any woman who asks her husband for divorce without a valid reason will not smell the fragrance of Paradise." In another wording: "Paradise is forbidden to her." In another wording, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The women who seek *khul'* are the hypocritical women."

Then, the husband should observe four matters regarding divorce:
First, that he divorce her during a period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her. For divorce during menstruation or the period of purity in which he had intercourse is called forbidden, though it is effective, due to the prolongation of her waiting period. If he does that, let him take her back. Ibn 'Umar divorced his wife during menstruation, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to 'Umar: "Command him to take her back until she becomes pure, then menstruates, then becomes pure. Then if he wishes, he may divorce her, and if he wishes, he may retain her. That is the waiting period which Allah has commanded for divorcing women." He commanded him to wait after taking her back for two periods of purity so that the purpose of taking her back would not be solely for divorce.

Second, that he restrict himself to a single pronouncement of divorce and not combine the three, for a single pronouncement after the waiting period achieves the purpose. He benefits by the possibility of taking her back if he regrets it during the waiting period, and renewing the marriage contract if he wishes after the waiting period. If he pronounces divorce three times, he may regret it and then need to marry her to an intermediary (*muhallil*) and to wait a period. The contract of the intermediary is prohibited, and he would be the one initiating it. Then his heart would be attached to the wife of another, and his divorce—I mean the wife of the intermediary—after she is married to him, then that would result in aversion from the wife. All of that is the consequence of combining [the pronouncements]. In a single pronouncement, there is sufficiency for the intended purpose without any drawback. I do not say combining is forbidden, but it is disliked for these reasons, and by dislike I mean abandoning consideration for himself.

Third, that he be gentle in stating the reason for divorcing her, without harshness and belittlement, and to comfort her heart with a gift by way of enjoyment and compensation for the grief of separation that has afflicted her. Allah, the Exalted, says: "And provide for them" (Quran 2:241), and that is obligatory whenever a dowry was not specified for her in the original marriage contract.

Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both, was frequently divorcing and marrying. One day he sent one of his companions to divorce two of his wives and said, "Tell them to observe their waiting period," and he ordered him to give each one ten thousand dirhams. He did so. When he returned to him, he said, "What did they do?" He said, "As for one of them, she bowed her head and was dejected. As for the other, she wept and lamented, and I heard her say, 'A little provision from a beloved who is parting.'" Al-Hasan bowed his head and showed mercy for her, saying, "If I were to take back a wife after I had parted from her, I would take her back." Al-Hasan entered one day upon 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham, the jurist and leader of Medina, who had no equal in Medina. Concerning him, 'A'isha, may Allah be pleased with her, set an example when she said, "If I had not made that journey of mine, it would have been more beloved to me than to have sixteen sons from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, like 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham." Al-Hasan entered upon him in his house, and 'Abd al-Rahman honored him and seated him in his place of sitting and said, "Did you not send for me so I could come to you?" Al-Hasan said, "The need was ours." He said, "And what is it?" He said, "I have come to you as a suitor for your daughter." 'Abd al-Rahman bowed his head, then raised it and said, "By Allah, there is nothing against..."

The face of the earth, upon which one walks, is dearer to me than you. Yet you know that my daughter is a part of me; what saddens her saddens me, and what pleases her pleases me. And you are one who divorces frequently, so I fear you will divorce her. If you do, I dread that my heart may change in its love for you, and I would hate for my heart to change toward you, for you are a part of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. If you stipulate that you will not divorce her, I will marry her to you." Al-Hasan remained silent, then stood up and left. Some of his household members said they heard him walking and saying, "Abd al-Rahman intended nothing but to make his daughter a collar around my neck."

And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, was vexed by his frequent divorcing and would excuse himself for it from the pulpit, saying in his sermon, "Indeed, Hasan is one who divorces frequently, so do not marry him." Until a man from Hamdan stood and said, "By God, O Commander of the Faithful, we will marry him as much as he wishes; if he loves, he may keep, and if he wills, he may leave." This pleased 'Ali, and he said, "If I were a gatekeeper at the gate of Paradise, I would say to Hamdan, 'Enter in peace.'" This is an indication that if one criticizes a beloved from among family or children out of a kind of protective shame, it is not fitting to agree with him. Such agreement is ugly; rather, the proper conduct is to oppose it as much as possible, for that is more soothing to his heart and more in harmony with his inner essence. The purpose of this is to clarify that divorce is permissible, and God has promised sufficiency in both separation and marriage. He said, "And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty," and He, glorified and exalted, said, "But if they separate, Allah will enrich each from His abundance."

The fourth is not to divulge her secret, neither in divorce nor in marriage. Indeed, a severe threat regarding the divulgence of women's secrets has come in the authentic report—the hadith of the threat concerning divulging a woman's secret, narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Sa'id, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The greatest betrayal in the sight of God on the Day of Resurrection is for a man to have intimate relations with his wife and she with him, and then he divulges her secret." And it is narrated from some of the righteous that he intended to divorce a woman, and it was said to him, "What causes you doubt about her?" He replied, "The wise man does not tear the veil of his wife's privacy." When he divorced her, it was said to him, "Why did you divorce her?" He said, "What have I to do with a woman other than myself?" This clarifies what is incumbent upon the husband.

The second section of this chapter concerns looking into the rights of the husband over her. The sufficient statement on this is that marriage is a kind of bondage; she is his bondwoman. Thus, it is incumbent upon her to obey the husband absolutely in everything he requests of her concerning herself, wherein there is no disobedience. Numerous reports have come regarding the magnitude of the husband's right over her. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Any woman who dies while her husband is pleased with her will enter Paradise." And there was a man who had gone on a journey and enjoined his wife not to descend from the upper floor to the lower floor, while her father was below. He fell ill, and the woman sent to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, seeking permission to descend to her father. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Obey your husband." He died, and she sought his permission again. He said, "Obey your husband." Her father was buried, and then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent to her informing her that God had forgiven her father due to her obedience to her husband. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "If a woman prays her five prayers, fasts her month, guards her chastity, and obeys her husband, she will enter the Paradise of her Lord." And he added obedience to the husband to the foundations of Islam. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned women and said, "Carriers, bearers, nursers, compassionate toward their children; were it not for what they commit against their husbands, their praying women would enter Paradise." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "I looked into Hellfire, and most of its inhabitants were women." They said, "Why, O Messenger of God?" He said, "They frequently curse and show ingratitude to the companion," meaning the husband who cohabits. And in another report, "I looked into Paradise, and the least of its inhabitants were women." I said, "Where are the women?" He said, "They are preoccupied with the two red things: gold and saffron," meaning jewelry and dyeing clothes. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: A young woman came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, I am a young woman who is being proposed to, and I dislike marriage. What is the right of the husband over the woman?" He said, "If he were to have pus from his head to his feet, and she licked it, she would not have fulfilled his due." She said, "Should I not marry?" He said, "Yes, marry, for it is good." Ibn 'Abbas said: A woman from Khath'am came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I am a widow and wish to marry. What is the right of the husband?" He said, "Among the rights of the husband over the wife is that if he desires her and seeks her for himself while she is on the back of a camel, she should not deny him. And among his rights is that she not give anything from his house except with his permission. If she does that, the sin is upon her and the reward is for him. And among his rights is that she not observe a voluntary fast except with his permission. If she does, she will hunger and thirst, and it will not be accepted from her. And if she leaves her house without his permission, the angels curse her until she returns to his house or repents." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said...

Had I commanded anyone to prostrate to anyone, I would have commanded the woman to prostrate to her husband, due to the greatness of his right over her. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A woman is closest to the countenance of her Lord when she is in the innermost part of her house. And her prayer in the courtyard of her home is better than her prayer in the mosque, and her prayer inside her house is better than her prayer in the courtyard, and her prayer in her private chamber is better than her prayer inside her house." The private chamber is a room within a room, and this is for seclusion. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The woman is 'awrah (something to be concealed). So when she goes out, Satan makes her alluring." He also said: "The woman has ten 'awrahs. So when she marries, the husband covers one 'awrah, and when she dies, the grave covers the ten 'awrahs."

The rights of the husband over the wife are many, and the most important are two matters: one is safeguarding and seclusion, and the other is refraining from demanding beyond necessity and abstaining from his earnings if they are unlawful. Such was the habit of women among the pious predecessors. When a man would leave his home, his wife or daughter would say to him: "Beware of unlawful earnings, for we can endure hunger and hardship, but we cannot endure the Fire." A man from the predecessors intended to travel, and his neighbors disliked his journey. They said to his wife: "Why do you consent to his travel when he has left you no provision?" She replied: "My husband, since I have known him, I have known him as a consumer, and I have not known him as a provider. I have a Lord who is the Provider; the consumer departs, but the Provider remains." And Rabi'ah bint Isma'il was betrothed to Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari, but he disliked it due to his preoccupation with worship. He said to her: "By God, I have no inclination for women because I am occupied with my own state." She said: "I am more occupied with my own state than you are, and I have no desire. But I inherited abundant wealth from my husband, and I wished for you to spend it on your brothers, and I know through you the righteous, so that it may be a path for me to God, the Mighty and Majestic." He said: "Until I seek permission from my teacher." So he returned to Abu Sulayman al-Darani, who used to forbid me from marriage, saying: "None of our companions married except that he changed." When he heard her words, he said: "Marry her, for she is a friend of God. This is the speech of the truthful ones." So he married her. There was in our house a basin of plaster, and it wore out from the washing of the hands of those who hastened to leave after eating, let alone those who washed with soapwort. And he married three other women over her, and she would feed me delicious food, perfume me, and say: "Go with your energy and strength to your wives." This Rabi'ah was likened among the people of Syria to Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyyah in Basra. Among her obligations is that she must not be wasteful with his wealth; rather, she must safeguard it for him.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for her to feed anyone from his house except with his permission, except for fresh food that is feared will spoil. If she feeds with his pleasure, she has a reward like his, and if she feeds without his permission, he has the reward and she bears the burden." Among her rights upon her parents is that they teach her good companionship and the etiquettes of living with her husband. As it is narrated that Asma' bint Kharjah al-Fazari said to her daughter upon marriage: "You have left the nest in which you were raised and have come to a bed you do not know and a companion you are not accustomed to. So be for him a ground, and he will be for you a sky. Be for him a cushion, and he will be for you a pillar. Be for him a servant, and he will be for you a slave. Do not press him so that he becomes weary of you, and do not distance yourself from him so that he forgets you. If he draws near, draw near to him, and if he withdraws, withdraw from him. And guard his nose, his ear, and his eye, so that he smells from you only fragrance, hears only good, and sees only beauty."

And a man said to his wife: "Accept my pardon from me, and you will prolong my affection. Do not speak to me in my anger when I am enraged, and do not peck at me like the pecking of a tambourine once, for you do not know what the outcome will be. And do not complain excessively, lest it take away affection and my heart rejects you, for hearts change. Indeed, I have seen that when love and harm come together in the heart, love does not remain long before it departs." So the comprehensive statement regarding the etiquettes of a woman, without elaboration, is that she should be settled in the innermost part of her house, devoted to her spindle, not frequently ascending or looking out, speaking little to her neighbors, not entering upon them except in a situation that necessitates entry. She safeguards her husband in his absence and seeks to please him in all her affairs, not betraying him regarding herself or his wealth. She does not leave her house except with his permission. If she leaves with his permission, she is concealed in shabby attire, seeking empty places rather than streets and markets, cautious lest a stranger hear her voice or recognize her person. She does not make herself known to her husband's friend for her needs; rather, she disguises herself from one she thinks might recognize her or whom she recognizes. Her concern is the rectitude of her affairs and the management of her home, devoted to her prayer and fasting. If a friend of her husband seeks permission at the door and the husband is not present, she does not inquire further nor engage him in speech, out of protective jealousy for herself and her husband. She is content with what God has provided through her husband, giving precedence to his right over the right of herself and all her other relatives. She is pure in herself, prepared in all circumstances for him to enjoy her if he wishes, compassionate toward her children, preserving modesty for them, and brief.

The tongue should refrain from cursing children and arguing with the husband. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I and a woman with sunken cheeks will be like these two in Paradise: a woman who was widowed and devoted herself to her daughters until they returned [to a good state] or died." [194] And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God has forbidden Paradise to every human who would enter it before me, except that I looked to my right and saw a woman rushing ahead of me to the gate of Paradise. I said, 'What is with this one rushing ahead of me?' It was said to me, 'O Muhammad, this is a woman who was beautiful and lovely, and she had orphans under her care. She was patient with them until they reached their maturity.' So God rewarded her for that." [195]

Among her etiquettes is that she should not boast to her husband of her beauty, nor despise her husband for his ugliness. It has been narrated that Al-Aṣmaʿī said: "I entered the desert and saw a woman with the most beautiful face, married to a man with the ugliest face. I said to her, 'O this one, are you content for yourself to be with one like him?' She said, 'O you, be silent. You have erred in your speech. Perhaps he is better in what is between him and his Creator, and He has made me his reward. Or perhaps I have erred in what is between me and my Creator, and He has made him my punishment. Should I not be content with what God has chosen for me?' So she silenced me." And Al-Aṣmaʿī said: "I saw in the desert a woman wearing a red shirt, adorned with kohl, and with a rosary in her hand. I said, 'How far apart these two things are!' She said, 'For God, I have a portion I do not neglect, and for diversion and idleness, I have a portion.' So I knew she was a righteous woman who had a husband for whom she adorned herself."

Among the etiquettes of a woman is to adhere to righteousness and restraint in the absence of her husband, and to return to playfulness, cheerfulness, and means of pleasure in the presence of her husband. She should not harm her husband in any way. It is narrated from Muʿādh ibn Jabal that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No woman harms her husband in this world except that his wife from the wide-eyed maidens says, 'Do not harm him, may God fight you! He is only a sojourner with you, and he will soon leave you to come to us.'" [196]

Among the obligations upon her from the rights of marriage, if her husband dies, is that she should not observe the mourning period for more than four months and ten days, and she should avoid perfume and adornment during this period. Zaynab bint Abī Salamah said: "I entered upon Umm Ḥabībah, the wife of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when her father, Abū Sufyān ibn Ḥarb, died. She called for perfume containing a yellow dye or something else, and she anointed a slave girl with it, then touched her own cheeks with it. Then she said, 'By God, I have no need for perfume, except that I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in God and the Last Day to mourn for a deceased person for more than three days, except for her husband, which is four months and ten days."'" [197] It is obligatory for her to remain in the marital home until the end of the waiting period. She may not move to her family nor go out except out of necessity.

Among her etiquettes is to perform every service in the household that she is capable of. It is narrated from Asmāʾ bint Abī Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, may God be pleased with them both, that she said: "Al-Zubayr married me, and he had no wealth, slave, or anything on earth except his horse and his camel. I would feed his horse, take care of its needs, tend to it, crush date stones for his camel, feed it, draw water, mend the water skin, and knead dough. I would carry date stones on my head from two-thirds of a *farsakh* [a distance] until Abū Bakr sent me a slave girl, who relieved me of tending to the horse, and it was as if I had been set free." [198] "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, met me one day with his companions while I had date stones on my head. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Oh, oh,' and made his she-camel kneel to carry me behind him. I felt shy to travel with the men, and I remembered Al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, recognized that I felt shy. I went to Al-Zubayr and told him what happened. He said, 'By God, your carrying the date stones on your head is harder for me than your riding with him.'"

The Book of the Etiquettes of Marriage is completed, praise be to God, and from Him. And may God bless every chosen servant.

[22] Regarding Paradise: A hadith states that the newborn will be told, "Enter Paradise." He will then stand at the gate of Paradise, filled with rage and anger, and say, "I will not enter unless my parents enter with me." Ibn Hibban narrated this in "Al-Du'afa'" from the narration of Bahz ibn Hakim from his father from his grandfather, but it is not authentic. Al-Nasa'i has a version from the hadith of Abu Hurairah: "They will be told, 'Enter Paradise,' and they will say, 'Not until our fathers enter.' It will be said, 'Enter Paradise, you and your fathers.'" Its chain is sound.

[23] A hadith states: "The children will gather on the Day of Resurrection when the creation is presented for reckoning. It will be said to the angels, 'Take these to Paradise.' They will stand at the gate of Paradise and it will be said to them, 'Welcome, O offspring of the Muslims! Enter, there is no reckoning upon you.' They will say, 'Where are our fathers and mothers?'" I have not found a reliable source for this lengthy hadith.

[24] A hadith: "Whoever has two children die will be shielded by a shield from the Fire." Al-Bazzar and Al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of Zuhayr ibn Abi 'Alqamah.

[25] Muslim has from the hadith of Abu Hurairah regarding the woman who said, "I have buried three; I have indeed been shielded by a strong shield from the Fire."

[26] A hadith: "Whoever has three children die before reaching the age of puberty, Allah will admit him to Paradise by the grace of His mercy towards them." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah, what about two?" He said, "And two." Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Anas without mentioning the two. Ahmad has this addition from the hadith of Mu'adh, and it is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with similar wording.

[27] A hadith: "I have not seen anyone more overwhelming to men of understanding than you women, who are deficient in intellect and religion." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and both agreed upon it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, though Muslim did not cite its exact wording.

[28] The hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing and my sight, and the evil of my nature," has preceded in the chapter on supplications.

[29] A hadith: "I ask You to purify my heart and guard my private parts." Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in "Al-Da'awat" from the hadith of Umm Salamah with a chain containing some weakness.

[30] A hadith: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded that whoever's gaze falls upon a woman and his soul yearns for her should go to his wife." Ahmad narrated it from the hadith of Abu Kabshah Al-Anmari, when a woman passed by him and a desire for women arose in his heart, so he entered and went to one of his wives. He said, "And so you should do, for among your most excellent deeds is approaching what is lawful." Its chain is sound.

[31] A hadith: "Jabir saw a woman, so he entered upon Zaynab and fulfilled his need." Muslim and Al-Tirmidhi narrated it, and the wording is his; he said it is hasan sahih.

[32] A hadith: "Do not enter upon secluded women, for indeed Satan flows in one of you like the flowing of blood." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Jabir and said it is gharib. Muslim has it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar: "Let no man enter upon a secluded woman after this day of mine except with one or two men."

[33] A hadith from Ibn 'Abbas: "The best of this nation are those with the most women," meaning the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Al-Bukhari narrated it.

[34] A hadith: "He said to Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, 'You resemble my character and my form.'" I say: The well-known is that he said this wording to Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, as is agreed upon from the hadith of Al-Bara'. However, Al-Hasan also resembled the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, as is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Juhaifah, and Al-Tirmidhi graded it sahih, and Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Anas: "No one resembled the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, more than Al-Hasan."

[35] A hadith: "Al-Hasan is from me, and Al-Husayn is from 'Ali." Ahmad narrated it from the hadith of Al-Miqdad ibn Ma'dikarib with a sound chain.

[36] A hadith: "It is for a person of understanding to have three periods: a period in which he communes with his Lord, a period in which he holds himself to account, and a period in which he is alone with his food and drink." Ibn Hibban narrated it from the hadith of Abu Dharr in a lengthy hadith stating that this is in the scriptures of Ibrahim.

[37] The wise person only travels for three purposes: to provision for the Hereafter, to repair one's livelihood, or for a pleasure that is not forbidden. Ibn Hibban narrated it from the lengthy hadith of Abu Dharr, stating that this was in the scriptures of Abraham.

[38] Every worker has a period of zeal, and every zeal has a period of lassitude. Whoever's lassitude is toward my Sunnah has been guided. Ahmad and al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and al-Tirmidhi has something similar from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, calling it hasan sahih.

[39] I complained to Gabriel about my weakness for intercourse, so he directed me to eat harisa (a meat dish). Ibn 'Adi reported it from the hadith of Hudhayfah and Ibn 'Abbas, and al-'Uqayli from the hadith of Mu'adh and Jabir ibn Samurah. Ibn Hibban in his "Du'afa'" from Hudhayfah and al-Azdi in his "Du'afa'" from Abu Hurayrah, all with weak chains. Ibn 'Adi said it is mawdu' (fabricated), and al-'Uqayli said it is batil (false). If it were authentic, it has no valid interpretation.

[40] From your worldly life, perfume and women have been made beloved to me, and the coolness of my eyes is in prayer. Al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim narrated it from the hadith of Anas with a good chain, but al-'Uqayli weakened it.

[41] Let one of you acquire a grateful heart, a remembering tongue, and a believing wife who helps him in his Hereafter. Al-Tirmidhi reported it and graded it hasan, and Ibn Majah with this wording from a hadith with a broken chain.

[42] I was favored over Adam (peace be upon him) with two traits: His wife was a helper for him toward disobedience, and my wives are helpers for me toward obedience. His devil was a disbeliever, and my devil is a Muslim; he does not command except with good. Al-Khatib reported it in "al-Tarikh" from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, containing Muhammad ibn al-Walid ibn Aban ibn al-Qalanisi. Ibn 'Adi said he used to fabricate hadith. Muslim has from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "There is not one of you except that a companion from the jinn has been assigned to him." They said, "Even you, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Even me, except that God helped me against him, so he submitted and does not command me except with good."

[43] A day of a just ruler is better than the worship of seventy years. Then he said, "Indeed, each of you is a shepherd, and each of you is responsible for his flock." Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi reported it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas. It has preceded with the wording of sixty years without what follows it, for that is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.

[44] Whatever a man spends on his family is charity. Indeed, a man is rewarded for raising a morsel to his wife's mouth. Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "If a man spends on his family, seeking reward for it, it is charity for him." Both have from the hadith of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: "Whatever you spend is charity for you, even the morsel you raise to your wife's mouth."

[45] Whoever perfects his prayer, has many dependents, has little wealth, and does not backbite the Muslims, will be with me in Paradise like these two (fingers). Abu Ya'la reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with a weak chain.

[46] Indeed, God loves the poor, chaste man with many dependents. Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of 'Imran ibn Husayn with a weak chain.

[47] When a servant's sins become many, God afflicts him with the worry of dependents to expiate them. Ahmad reported it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, except he said "with grief." It contains Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, who is disputed.

[48] Among sins are sins that are not expiated except by the anxiety of seeking a livelihood. Al-Tabarani reported it in "al-Awsat," Abu Nu'aym in "al-Hilyah," and al-Khatib in "al-Talkhis al-Mutashabih" from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

[49] Whoever has three daughters, provides for them, and treats them well until God makes them independent of him, God has made Paradise absolutely obligatory for him, unless he commits an unforgivable sin. Al-Khara'iti reported it in "Makārim al-Akhlaq" from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain. He has it with another wording. Abu Dawud (with this wording) and al-Tirmidhi have from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Whoever supports three daughters, disciplines them, marries them off, and treats them well, for him is Paradise." Its narrators are trustworthy, though there is a difference in its chain.

[50] Indeed, the servant will be stood before the Scale, having mountains of good deeds, and will be asked about providing for his dependents and fulfilling their rights. I have not found a source for this hadith.

[51] No one will meet God with a sin greater than neglecting his family. The author of "al-Firdaws" mentioned it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, but his son Abu Mansur did not find it in his Musnad.

[52] It is sufficient sin for a man that he neglects those he provides for. Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported it with the wording: "Whoever..."

[53] A hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) gathered nine of his wives, narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas.

[54] A hadith that revelation would come to him while he was in the bed of his wife, narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas: "O Umm Salamah, do not harm me concerning 'A'ishah, for by Allah, revelation has never come to me while I was in the blanket of any woman among you except her."

[55] The hadith prohibiting proposing to a woman who is already engaged, agreed upon as authentic from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[56] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married me in Shawwal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwal," narrated by Muslim.

[57] A hadith: A man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "I have a wife who does not refuse the hand of any toucher." He said, "Divorce her." The hadith is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Nasa'i said it is not established, and the *mursal* version is more likely correct. Ahmad said it is a rejected (*munkar*) hadith, and Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned it among fabricated narrations.

[58] The hadith: "A woman is married for her wealth, her beauty, her lineage, and her religion. So choose the one with religion," agreed upon as authentic from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[59] The hadith narrated by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Anas: "Whoever marries a woman for her status, Allah will only increase him in humiliation. Whoever marries her for her wealth, Allah will only increase him in poverty. Whoever marries her for her lineage, Allah will only increase him in lowliness. But whoever marries a woman intending only to lower his gaze and guard his chastity, or to join ties of kinship, Allah will bless her for him and bless him for her." Ibn Hibban narrated it in *al-Du'afa'*.

[60] The hadith: "Do not marry a woman for her beauty, for perhaps her beauty will ruin her," narrated by Ibn Majah from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with a weak chain.

[61] The hadith: "Allah hates the garrulous, the pompous speech-makers," narrated by al-Tirmidhi who graded it as *hasan* from the narration of Jabir. And: "The most hateful of you to me and the farthest from me on the Day of Resurrection are the garrulous and the pompous," narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi who graded it as *hasan* from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

[62] The hadith: "When Allah places in the heart of one of you an inclination towards a woman, let him look at her, for that is more likely to foster affection between them," narrated by Ibn Majah with a weak chain from the narration of Ahmad ibn Maslamah, without the phrase "for that is more likely." Al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as *hasan*, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah narrate from al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah that he proposed to a woman, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Look at her, for that is more likely to foster affection between you."

[63] The hadith: "There is something in the eyes of the Ansar; so when one of you wishes to marry from among them, let him look at them," narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah in a similar wording.

[64] The hadith: "The best of your women is she who, when her husband looks at her, she pleases him; when he commands her, she obeys him; and when he is absent, she guards herself and his property," narrated by al-Nasa'i from the narration of Abu Hurayrah in a similar wording with a sound chain. And it adds: "And she does not oppose him concerning herself or his property." In Ahmad's version: "concerning herself and his property." Abu Dawud has a similar narration from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a sound chain.

[65] The hadith: "The best women are the most beautiful in face and the least in dowry," narrated by Ibn Hibban from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "The best of them is she whose dowry is easiest." And from the narration of 'A'ishah: "The good omen in a woman is the ease of her matter and the smallness of her dowry." Abu 'Umar al-Tawqani narrated in *Kitab Mu'asharat al-Ahlin*: "The woman of greatest blessing is the most beautiful in face and the least in dowry," and he authenticated it.

[66] The hadith prohibiting extravagance in the dowry, narrated by the compilers of the four Sunan as a statement of 'Umar, and al-Tirmidhi authenticated it.

[67] The hadith: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married some of his wives for a dowry of ten dirhams and some household furnishings: a hand-mill, a water jar, and a leather cushion stuffed with palm fiber," narrated by Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi and al-Bazzar from the narration of Anas: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married Umm Salamah for household furnishings worth ten dirhams." Al-Bazzar said: "I saw it in another place: He married her for household furnishings and a hand-mill worth forty dirhams." Al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Abu Sa'id, and both are weak. Ahmad has from the narration of 'Ali: When he married Fatimah to him, he sent with her a worn garment and a leather cushion stuffed with palm fiber.

[68] The Hadith: "He gave a wedding feast for one of his wives with two mudd of barley," reported by Al-Bukhari from the narration of 'A'ishah; "and for another with two mudd of dates and two mudd of sawiq (parched barley flour)," a Hadith; "and he gave a wedding feast for another with two mudd of dates and two mudd of sawiq," reported by the Four from the narration of Anas; "He gave a wedding feast for Safiyyah with sawiq and dates," and in Muslim's version: "A man would come with leftover dates and leftover sawiq." In the two Sahih collections: "dates, dried yoghurt, and clarified butter." None of the original sources specify the dates and sawiq as being two mudd.

[69] The Hadith: "Umar used to forbid extravagance (in dowries) and say, 'The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, did not marry, nor did he give his daughters in marriage, for more than four hundred dirhams,'" reported by the Four from the narration of 'Umar. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan Sahih.

[70] The Hadith: "One of the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, married for the weight of a date-stone of gold," it is said its value was five dirhams, agreed upon from the narration of Anas that 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf married for that, and its valuation as five dirhams is reported by Al-Bayhaqi.

[71] The Hadith: "From the blessings of a woman are the quickness of her marriage, the quickness of her womb (i.e., childbirth), and the ease of her dowry," reported by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi from the narration of 'A'ishah: "From the good fortune of a woman is that her proposal is made easy, her dowry is made easy, and her womb is made easy." 'Urwah said, meaning childbirth, and its chain is good. And he also said: "The most blessed of them are those with the least dowry." The Hadith: "The most blessed of them are those with the least dowry," reported by Abu 'Umar al-Tawqani in "Mu'asharat al-Ahlin" from the narration of 'A'ishah: "The most greatly blessed women are the most beautiful-faced and those with the least dowry," and this has preceded. And in Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi: "The most greatly blessed women are those whose dowry is easiest," and its chain is good.

[72] The Hadith: "Exchange gifts, and you will love one another," reported by Al-Bukhari in "Al-Adab al-Mufrad" and Al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a good chain.

[73] The Hadith: "You should marry the affectionate, fertile woman," reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i from the narration of Ma'qil ibn Yasar: "Marry the affectionate, fertile woman," and its chain is sound.

[74] The Hadith: "He said to Jabir when he married a previously married woman: 'Why not a virgin, so you could play with her and she could play with you?'" Agreed upon from the narration of Jabir.

[75] The Hadith: "Beware of the green growth on the dung heap." It was said, "And what is the green growth on the dung heap?" He said, "The beautiful woman in an evil environment," reported by Al-Daraqutni in "Al-Afrad" and Al-Ramahurmuzi in "Al-Amthal" from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Al-Daraqutni said: "Al-Waqidi alone reported it, and he is weak."

[76] The Hadith: "Choose carefully for your offspring (lit., your drops of semen), for lineage is a secret influencer," reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of 'A'ishah in an abbreviated form without the phrase "for lineage." And Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the narration of Anas: "Marry into righteous families, for lineage is a secret influencer." And Abu Musa al-Madini reported in "Kitab Tadyi' al-'Umr wa al-Ayyam" from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "And consider into which lineage you place your child, for lineage is a secret influencer." Both are weak.

[77] The Hadith: "Do not marry close relatives, for the child will be created weak (dawi)." Ibn al-Salah said: "I did not find a reliable source for it." I say: It is only known from the statement of 'Umar, that he said to the family of Al-Sa'ib: "You have become weak, so marry among the outstanding," reported by Ibrahim al-Harbi in "Gharib al-Hadith."

[78] The Hadith: "Marriage is enslavement, so let one of you consider where he places his precious daughter," reported by Abu 'Umar al-Tawqani in "Mu'asharat al-Ahlin" as a statement stopped at 'A'ishah and Asma', the two daughters of Abu Bakr. Al-Bayhaqi said: "And that is reported as elevated (to the Prophet), but the stopped version is more correct."

[79] The Hadith: "Whoever gives his precious daughter in marriage to a corrupt person has severed her kinship ties," reported by Ibn Hibban in "Al-Du'afa'" from the narration of Anas, and he reported it in "Al-Thiqat" as a saying of Al-Sha'bi with a sound chain.

[80] The Hadith: Anas saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, noticing on 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf a trace of saffron (perfume). He said, "What is this?" He said, "I married a woman for the weight of a date-stone of gold." He said, "May Allah bless you. Give a wedding feast, even if with a sheep." Agreed upon.

[81] The Hadith: "He gave a wedding feast for Safiyyah with sawiq and dates," reported by the Four from the narration of Anas, and Muslim has something similar. This has preceded.

[82] The hadith: "Food on the first day is an obligation, food on the second day is a tradition, and food on the third day is for show. And whoever does something for show, Allah will make him known for it." The author said: "Only Ziyad ibn 'Abdullah narrated it as a marfu' (attributed to the Prophet)." I say: This is what al-Tirmidhi said after reporting it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and he deemed it weak, and only Ziyad ibn 'Abdullah narrated it as marfu', and it is ghareeb (rare).

[83] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah regarding congratulating the groom: "May Allah bless you and bestow blessings upon you, and may He unite you both in goodness." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who authenticated it, and Ibn Majah. It was mentioned earlier in the Book of Supplications. And Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded this.

[84] The hadith: "What distinguishes the lawful from the unlawful is the drum and the voice." Reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it hasan (good), and Ibn Majah from the narration of Muhammad ibn Hatib.

[85] The hadith: "Announce this marriage, conduct it in the mosques, and beat the drum for it." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'A'ishah, and he graded it hasan, while al-Bayhaqi deemed it weak.

[86] The hadith of al-Rabee' bint Mu'awwidh: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came and entered upon me on the morning after my wedding. He sat on my bed, and our young girls were beating their drums..." Reported by al-Bukhari. He said: "The day of Badr" appears in some copies of the *Ihya'*; "the day of Bu'ath" is a mistake.

[87] Another hadith: "The last advice the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, gave were three things he kept repeating until his tongue faltered and his speech became faint. He kept saying: 'The prayer, and those whom your right hands possess (your slaves). Do not burden them with what they cannot bear. Fear Allah concerning women, for they are captives in your hands...'" Reported by al-Nasa'i in *al-Kubra* and Ibn Majah from the narration of Umm Salamah that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, while on his deathbed, kept saying: "The prayer, and those whom your right hands possess," and he kept repeating it until his tongue could no longer speak.

[88] Reported by Muslim from the lengthy narration of Jabir, and in it: "So fear Allah concerning women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah..."

[89] The hadith: "Whoever is patient with the bad character of his wife, Allah will grant him a reward like that which He granted Ayyub for his affliction." I have not found a source for this hadith.

[90] The hadith: "His wives, peace and blessings be upon him, used to argue with him..." and "One of them would refuse to speak to him from day until night." Agreed upon from the narration of 'Umar in the lengthy hadith concerning the verse: "But if you support one another against him..."

[91] The hadith: "A woman argued with 'Umar, so he said: 'Do you argue with me, O so-and-so?' She said: 'The wives of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, argue with him, and he is better than you.'" This is the previous hadith, and it does not contain his saying "O so-and-so" nor her saying "he is better than you."

[92] The hadith: "One of them pushed the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, in the chest, so her mother scolded her. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Leave her, for they do more than that.'" I have not found a source for this hadith.

[93] The hadith: "Words were exchanged between him and 'A'ishah until Abu Bakr was brought in as an arbitrator between them." Reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and al-Khatib in *al-Tarikh* from the narration of 'A'ishah with a weak chain.

[94] The hadith: "'A'ishah once said to him when she was angry with him: 'And you claim to be a Prophet?' So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, smiled." Reported by Abu Ya'la in his *Musnad* and Abu al-Shaykh in *Kitab al-Amthal* from the narration of 'A'ishah, and in its chain is Ibn Ishaq, and he narrated it with 'an'anah (an ambiguous link).

[95] The hadith: "He used to say to 'A'ishah: 'I certainly recognize your anger from your pleasure.'" Agreed upon.

[96] The hadith: "The first love in Islam was the love of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for 'A'ishah." Reported by the Two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of 'Amr ibn al-'As that he said: "O Messenger of Allah, which person is most beloved to you?" He said: "'A'ishah." As for it being the first, Ibn al-Jawzi reported it in *al-Mawdu'at* from the narration of Anas, and perhaps he meant in al-Madinah, as in the other hadith: "Ibn al-Zubayr was the first child born in Islam," meaning in al-Madinah. Otherwise, the Prophet's love for Khadijah is a well-known matter attested to by authentic hadiths.

[97] The hadith: "He used to say to 'A'ishah: 'I was to you like Abu Zar' was to Umm Zar', except that I will not divorce you.'" Agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah without the exception. Al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar and al-Khatib reported it with this addition.

[98] The hadith: "Do not harm me concerning 'A'ishah, for by Allah, revelation never came to me while I was in the bedclothes of any woman except hers."

[99] A narration from Anas: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most merciful of people towards women and children. Muslim narrated it with the wording: "I have not seen anyone more merciful to his family than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." 'Ali ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz and al-Baghawi added: "and children."

[100] A narration about his racing, peace and blessings be upon him, with 'A'ishah: he outran her, then she outran him, and he said, "This is for that." Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra, and Ibn Majah narrated it from 'A'ishah with a sound chain.

[101] A narration: He was among the most playful of people with his wives. Al-Hasan ibn Sufyan narrated it in his *Musnad* from Anas without the phrase "with his wives." Al-Bazzar and al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Saghir* and *al-Awsat*, saying "with a child." In its chain is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[102] A narration from 'A'ishah: I heard the voices of some people from Abyssinia and others who were playing on the day of 'Ashura'. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me, "Would you like to see their play?" The hadith is agreed upon, with differences: without mention of the day of 'Ashura'—he only said "on a day of celebration"—and without her saying "be quiet." In a narration by al-Nasa'i in *al-Kubra*, she said, "Do not rush," twice, and in it he said, "O Humayra'." Its chain is sound.

[103] A narration: The most complete of the believers in faith are the best of them in character and the gentlest with their families. Al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i narrated it—the wording is his—and al-Hakim said its narrators are trustworthy according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[104] A narration: The best of you are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives. Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and authenticated it from Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "and I am the best of you to my wives." He has it from 'A'ishah, and he authenticated it: "The best of you are the best to their families, and I am the best of you to my family."

[105] A narration: Verily, God detests the harsh and the miserly. Abu Bakr ibn Lal narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* from Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain. It is in the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of Jariyah ibn Wahb al-Khuza'i with the wording: "Shall I not inform you of the people of the Fire? Every coarse, miserly, arrogant one." Abu Dawud has: "The miserly and the harsh will not enter Paradise."

[106] A narration: He said to Jabir, "Why not a young bride, so you can play with her and she can play with you?" Agreed upon from his narration, and it has preceded.

[107] A narration: Wretched is the slave of the wife. I have not found a basis for it. The well-known one is: "Wretched is the slave of the Dinar and the slave of the Dirham." Al-Bukhari narrated it from Abu Hurayrah.

[108] A narration: The likeness of a righteous woman among women is that of a white-footed crow among a hundred crows. Al-Tabarani narrated it from Abu Umamah with a weak chain. Ahmad has it from 'Amr ibn al-'As: "We were with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, at Marr al-Zahran, and there were many crows, among them a white-footed crow with a red beak. He said, 'None shall enter Paradise from among women except like this crow among these crows.'" Its chain is sound, and it is in *al-Sunan al-Kubra* of al-Nasa'i.

[109] A narration: Seek refuge from the three calamities, and he counted among them the evil woman, for she brings gray hair before its time. In another wording: "If you are with her, she wears out your tongue, and if you are absent from her, she betrays you." Abu Mansur al-Daylami narrated it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain. The other wording was narrated by al-Tabarani from Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd: "Three from the calamities," and he mentioned among them, "and a woman who, if you are present, harms you, and if you are absent, betrays you." Its chain is good.

[110] A narration: "You are the companions of Yusuf." Agreed upon from 'A'ishah.

[111] A narration concerning the revelation of His saying, the Exalted: "If you both repent to God, for your hearts have inclined..." regarding the best of his wives. Agreed upon from 'Umar.

[113] A narration: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade seeking out the faults of women. Al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Awsat* from Jabir: "He forbade seeking the slips of women." The hadith is in Muslim with the wording: "He forbade a man from surprising his family at night, spying on them or seeking their faults." Al-Bukhari restricted it to mentioning the prohibition of surprising at night.

[114] A narration that he said before entering al-Madinah: "Do not surprise your families at night." Two men disobeyed him and hurried to their homes, and each one saw in his house what he disliked. Ahmad narrated it from Ibn 'Umar.

[119] The hadith: "On the night I was taken on the Night Journey, I saw in Paradise a palace with a maiden in its courtyard. I asked, 'For whom is this palace?' It was said, 'For 'Umar.'" Agreed upon from Jabir, without mentioning "the night I was taken on the Night Journey" and without mentioning the maiden. The mention of the maiden is in another version agreed upon from Abu Hurairah: "While I was sleeping, I saw myself in Paradise..."
[120] The hadith: "Verily, among jealousy is that which Allah loves and that which Allah hates." Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban from Jabir ibn 'Atik, which preceded four hadiths earlier.
[121] The hadith: "I am indeed jealous, and there is no man who is not jealous except that his heart is inverted." Its beginning was mentioned earlier, and its end was narrated by Abu 'Umar al-Tawqani in the book "Mu'asharat al-Ahlin" from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad, as a mursal report.
[122] The hadith: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to his daughter Fatimah, "What is best for a woman?" She replied, "That she does not see a man." Narrated by al-Bazzar and al-Daraqutni in "al-Afrad" from 'Ali with a weak chain.

[127] The hadith: "The best of you are the best to their families." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from 'A'ishah, and he graded it as sound. It has been mentioned earlier.
[128] The hadith: "A dinar you spend in the cause of Allah, a dinar you spend to free a slave, a dinar you give in charity to a poor person, and a dinar you spend on your family—the greatest in reward is the dinar you spend on your family." Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurairah.
[129] The hadith about drawing lots among his wives when he intended to travel is agreed upon from 'A'ishah.

Reported by the authors of the Sunan and Ibn Hibban from Abu Hurairah. Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban said: "inclines with one of them," and al-Tirmidhi said: "does not treat them justly."
[131] The hadith: "He would treat them justly and say, 'O Allah, this is my effort in what I possess, and I have no power over what You possess and I do not.'" Reported by the authors of the Sunan and Ibn Hibban from 'A'ishah in a similar manner.
[132] The hadith: "'A'ishah was the most beloved of his wives to him." Agreed upon from 'Amr ibn al-'As that he said, "O Messenger of Allah, who is the most beloved person to you?" He said, "'A'ishah." It has been mentioned earlier.

Reported by Ibn Sa'd in "al-Tabaqat" from the narration of Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn al-Husayn that the Prophet, peace be upon him, was carried in a garment and taken around to his wives while he was...

A sick man would divide his time among them, and in another report of his, when he became gravely ill, he said, "Where will I be tomorrow?" They said, "With so-and-so." He said, "And where will I be the day after tomorrow?" They said, "With so-and-so." Thus his wives understood that he intended 'A'ishah. The hadith. And in al-Bukhari from the narration of 'A'ishah: He would ask during the illness in which he died, "Where will I be tomorrow?" meaning the day of 'A'ishah. So his wives gave him permission to be wherever he wished. And in the two Sahihs: When he became gravely ill, he sought permission from his wives to be nursed in my house, and they gave him permission.

[134] Hadith: He would divide his time among his wives, and he intended to divorce Sawdah bint Zam'ah when she grew old, so she gifted her night to 'A'ishah. The hadith is narrated by Abu Dawud from the narration of 'A'ishah, who said: Sawdah, when she aged and feared that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, would part from her, said, "O Messenger of Allah, my day is for 'A'ishah." The hadith. And in al-Tabarani: He intended to part from her while he was... And in al-Bukhari with the wording: When Sawdah grew old, she gifted her day to 'A'ishah, and he would divide for her the day of Sawdah. And in al-Bayhaqi as a mursal report: He divorced Sawdah, so she said, "I wish to be resurrected among your wives." The hadith.

[135] Hadith of 'A'ishah: He would visit all his wives in one night. Muttafaqun 'alayh with the wording: I would perfume the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he would visit all his wives, then he would wake in the morning while the fragrance was still emanating.

[137] Hadith: He was asked, "What is the right of the woman upon the man?" He said, "That he feed her when he eats, clothe her when he clothes himself, not disfigure her face, and not strike her except with a non-severe strike, and not abandon her except within the house." Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra, and Ibn Majah from the narration of Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah with a sound chain. And he said, "And not strike the face, nor disfigure." And in a narration of Abu Dawud: "And not disfigure the face, nor strike."

[138] The hadith was mentioned by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Wafa without a chain. And in the two Sahihs from the narration of 'Umar: He had sworn not to enter upon them for a month due to the intensity of his displeasure with them. And in a narration from the narration of Jabir: Then he secluded himself from them for a month.

[143] Hadith: Three things are from incapacity in a man: that he meets someone whose acquaintance he desires, then parts from him before knowing his name... Narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami from the narration of someone shorter than him, and it is part of the previous hadith.

[144] Hadith: May Allah have mercy on him who washes and performs ghusl. Previously mentioned in the fifth chapter of prayer. The hadith.

[145] Hadith of Ibn 'Umar: I said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "Does one of us sleep while in a state of major impurity?" He said, "Yes, if he performs ablution." Muttafaqun 'alayh from his narration that 'Umar asked, not that 'Abdullah was the questioner.

[146] Hadith of 'A'ishah: He would sleep while in a state of major impurity without having touched water. Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah. And Yazid ibn Harun said that it is a mistake. Al-Bayhaqi transmitted from the Hafiz criticism of it, and said it is authentic from the perspective of transmission.

[147] Hadith: There is no soul whose creation Allah has decreed except that it will come to be. Muttafaqun 'alayh from the narration of Abu Sa'id.

[150] Hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding coitus interruptus: That is the hidden infanticide. Reported by Muslim from...

[151] We said: In the Sahih collections there are also authentic reports—sound hadiths—permitting coitus interruptus ('azl). Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: They asked him about 'azl, and he said, "There is no harm upon you if you do not do it." Al-Nasa'i narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sirmah. And the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] have it from the hadith of Jabir: "We used to practice 'azl during the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." Muslim added: "That reached the Prophet of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he did not forbid us." Al-Nasa'i has it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: He was asked about 'azl, and it was said, "The Jews claim it is the minor buried alive (al-maw'udah al-sughra)." He said, "The Jews have lied." Al-Bayhaqi said: "The narrators of permissibility are more numerous and more precise regarding permissibility."

[152] The hadith of Jabir, agreed upon in the two Sahih collections: "We used to practice 'azl during the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he did not forbid us." It is as mentioned, agreed upon, except that his statement "and he did not forbid us" was narrated solely by Muslim.

[153] The hadith of Jabir: A man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I have a slave girl who is our servant and our water-drawer for the palm trees. I have intercourse with her, but I dislike that she becomes pregnant." He said, "Practice 'azl with her if you wish." The author mentioned that it is in the two Sahih collections, but it is not so; rather, Muslim narrated it alone.

[154] The hadith: "Whoever has a daughter, then educates her well, provides her with excellent upbringing, and feeds her well..." Al-Tabarani narrated it in al-Kabir and al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.

[155] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "There is no one who is blessed with two daughters and treats them well as long as they remain with him, except that they will admit him into Paradise." Ibn Majah and al-Hakim narrated it, and he said its chain is sound.

[156] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever has two daughters or two sisters and treats them well as long as they remain with him, I and he will be in Paradise like these two," and he gestured with his two fingers. Al-Khara'iti narrated it in Makarim al-Akhlaq with a weak chain, and al-Tirmidhi narrated it with the wording: "Whoever provides for two girls," and said it is hasan gharib (good but rare).

[157] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever goes out to one of the markets of the Muslims, buys something, carries it to his home, and gives it specifically to the females and not the males, God will look upon him. And whomsoever God looks upon, He will not punish." Al-Khara'iti narrated it with a weak chain.

[158] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever carries a morsel from the market to his dependents, it is as if he carried charity to them." Al-Khara'iti narrated it with a very weak chain, and Ibn 'Adi narrated it in al-Kamil. Ibn al-Jawzi said it is a fabricated (mawdu') hadith.

[159] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever has three daughters or three sisters and is patient with their hardships..." Al-Khara'iti narrated it with this wording, and al-Hakim narrated it but did not say "or sisters," and he said its chain is sound.

[160] The hadith of Abu Rafi': "I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, give the call to prayer (adhan) in the ear of al-Husayn when Fatimah gave birth to him." Ahmad narrated it with this wording, and Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who graded it sound, except they both said "al-Hasan," making it grander. Ibn al-Qattan weakened it.

[161] The hadith: "Whoever has a child born to him and gives the call to prayer (adhan) in his right ear and the iqamah in his left ear, the affliction of Umm al-Sibyan is lifted from him." Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, Ibn al-Sunni in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah, and al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman narrated it from the hadith of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali with a weak chain.

[162] The hadith concerning circumcision on the seventh day: Al-Tabarani narrated it in al-Saghir from the hadith of Jabir with a weak chain: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, performed the 'aqiqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn and circumcised them on the seventh day." Its chain is weak, and there is disagreement about its chain; it is said: 'Abd al-Malik ibn Ibrahim ibn Zuhayr from his father from his grandfather.

[163] The hadith: "When you name, use 'Abd (servant of)..." Al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of 'Abd al-Malik ibn Abi Zuhayr from his father Mu'adh, and he authenticated its chain. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

[164] The hadith: "The names most beloved to God are 'Abd Allah and 'Abd al-Rahman." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.

[166] The hadith: "Do not combine my name and my kunyah." Ahmad and Ibn Hibban narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi—who graded it good—and Ibn Hibban have it from the hadith of Jabir: "Whoever is named with my name should not use my kunyah."

He who is named by my kunya should not be named by my given name.

[167] The hadith that Jesus had no father was reported by Abu 'Umar al-Tawqani in his book "Mu'asharat al-Ahlin" from Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain. Abu Dawud reported that 'Umar struck his son who had taken the kunya Abu 'Isa, and he rebuked al-Munirah ibn Shu'bah for taking the kunya Abu 'Isa. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "He has given me a kunya," and its chain is sound.

[168] The hadith, "You will be called on the Day of Resurrection by your names and the names of your fathers, so make your names good," was reported by Abu Dawud from Abu al-Darda'. Al-Nawawi said its chain is good, and al-Bayhaqi said it is *mursal*.

[169] The hadith that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, changed the name al-'As to 'Abd Allah was reported by al-Bayhaqi from 'Abd Allah ibn al-Harith ibn Juz' al-Zubaydi with a sound chain.

[170] The hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Zaynab—whose name was Barrah, meaning 'she who declares herself pure'—so he named her Zaynab. This is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[171] The hadith prohibiting the names Aflah, Yasar, Nafi', and Barakah was reported by Muslim from Samurah ibn Jundub, except he placed Rabah in place of Barakah. He also has from Jabir: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, intended to prohibit being named Ya'la and Barakah.

[172] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "For a boy, two equivalent sheep are commanded, and for a girl, one sheep." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it sound.

[173] The hadith: "Perform the 'aqiqah for al-Hasan with a sheep." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from 'Ali, who said its chain is not continuous. Al-Hakim connected it, but he said "al-Husayn." Abu Dawud reported it from Ibn 'Abbas, except he said "a ram." This is a concession to suffice with one.

[174] The hadith: "With the boy is his 'aqiqah, so shed blood on his behalf and remove harm from him." Reported by al-Bukhari from Salman ibn 'Amir al-Dabbi.

[175] The hadith: "Fatimah was commanded on the seventh day for al-Husayn to shave his hair and give in charity silver equal to its weight." Reported by al-Hakim, who graded it sound, from 'Ali. It is in al-Tirmidhi with a disconnected chain with the wording "Hasan," and he said its chain is not continuous. Ahmad reported it from Abu Rafi'.

[176] The hadith: Asma' gave birth to 'Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in Quba', then she came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he placed him in his lap, then called for a date, then softened it in his mouth... The hadith is agreed upon.

[177] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "I had a wife whom I loved, but my father disliked her, so he commanded me to divorce her..." Reported by the compilers of the Sunan, and al-Tirmidhi said it is good and sound.

[178] The hadith: "Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce without any cause will not smell the fragrance of Paradise." In another wording: "Paradise is forbidden to her." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban from Thawban.

[179] The hadith: "Women who seek divorce (khul') are the hypocrite women." Reported by al-Nasa'i from Abu Hurayrah, and he said al-Hasan did not hear it from Abu Hurayrah. He said, "Despite this, I have only heard it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah." I say: Al-Tabarani reported it from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir with a weak chain.

[180] The hadith: Ibn 'Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating, so the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to 'Umar, "Command him to take her back." The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[182] The hadith: A man went on a journey and enjoined upon his wife not to descend from the upper floor to the lower floor, and her father was on the lower floor, and he fell ill... Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from Anas with a weak chain, except he said, "Her father was forgiven."

[186] The hadith "I looked into Paradise and saw that the least of its inhabitants were women. I said, 'Where are the women?' He said, 'They were preoccupied with the two reds: gold and saffron.'" Ahmad narrated it from the narration of Abu Umamah with a weak chain. Al-Hariri mentioned "silk" instead of "saffron." Muslim narrated from the narration of 'Izzah al-Ashja'iyyah: "Woe to women from the two reds: gold and saffron," and its chain is weak.

[187] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "A young woman came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said, 'O Prophet of Allah, I am a young woman who is being proposed to, and I dislike marriage. So what is the right of the husband over the woman?'" Al-Hakim narrated it and authenticated its chain from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, without the phrase "Yes, so marry, for it is better," and I have not seen it from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[188] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "A woman from Khath'am came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and said, 'I am a widow and I wish to marry. So what is the right of the husband?'" Al-Bayhaqi narrated it, limiting it to a portion of the hadith, and narrated it in full from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, and there is weakness in it.

[189] The hadith: "If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone, I would command the woman to prostrate to her husband, and the child to his father, due to the greatness of their rights over them." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban narrated it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "and the child to his father," and I have not seen it. Similarly, Abu Dawud narrated it from the narration of Qays ibn Sa'd, and Ibn Majah from the narration of 'A'ishah, and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Ibn Abi Awfa.

[190] The hadith: "The closest a woman is to her Lord is when she is in the innermost part of her house. Her prayer in the courtyard of her house is better than her prayer in the mosque." Ibn Hibban narrated it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with the beginning of the hadith without its end. Its end was narrated by Abu Dawud in an abbreviated form from his narration without mentioning the courtyard. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the narration of 'A'ishah with the wording: "For her to pray in the house is better for her than to pray in the mosque," and its chain is good (hasan). Ibn Hibban has a similar narration from the narration of Umm Humayd.

[191] The hadith: "Woman is 'awrah (something to be concealed). When she goes out, Satan makes her appear alluring." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and said it is good and sound (hasan sahih), and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.

[192] The hadith: "A woman has ten 'awrahs (points of modesty/weakness). When she marries, the husband covers one 'awrah." Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn 'Umar al-Ju'abi narrated it in *Tarikh al-Talibiyyin* from the narration of 'Ali with a weak chain. Al-Tabarani has in *al-Saghir* from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "A woman has two coverings." It was said, "What are they?" He said, "The husband and the grave."

[193] The hadith: "It is not lawful for her to feed anyone from his house except with his permission, except for fresh dates (or fresh food)." Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi and al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar in a hadith which includes: "And do not give anything from his house except with his permission. If she does that, the reward is for him and the burden is upon her." Abu Dawud has from the narration of Sa'd: "A woman said, 'O Messenger of Allah, we all live off our fathers, our sons, and our husbands. So what of their wealth is lawful for us?' He said, 'Fresh food which you eat and give as a gift.'" Al-Daraqutni authenticated in *al-'Ilal* that this Sa'd is a man from the Ansar, not Ibn Abi Waqqas, and Ibn al-Qattan preferred this. Muslim has from the narration of 'A'ishah: "If a woman spends from the food of her house without causing waste, she has her reward for what she spent, and her husband has his reward for what he earned."

[194] The hadith: "I and a woman with dark cheeks are like these two," and he gestured with his index and middle fingers. Abu Dawud narrated it from the narration of Abu Malik al-Ashja'i with a weak chain.

[195] The hadith: "Allah has forbidden Paradise to every human that anyone should enter it before me, except that I looked to my right and saw a woman rushing ahead of me to the gate of Paradise." Al-Khara'iti narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

[196] The hadith of Mu'adh: "Let no woman harm her husband in this world, for his wife from the al-Hur al-'In will say, 'Do not harm him.'" Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and said it is good and rare (hasan gharib), and Ibn Majah.

[197] The hadith of Umm Habibah: "It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for a deceased person..."

More than three days except for a spouse, four months and ten days, agreed upon.
