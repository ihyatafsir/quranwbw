The Book of the Lawful and the Prohibited
Which is the Fourth Book of the Quarter of Customs from The Revival of the Religious Sciences
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who created man from clinging clay and sticky mud, then fashioned his form in the most excellent symmetry and perfect proportion. Then He nourished him in the earliest stage of his growth with milk, purified from between digested food and blood, a drink as palatable as pure water. Then He protected him with the wholesome provisions He bestowed, from the causes of weakness and dissolution. Then He restrained his appetite, which is hostile to him, from domination and aggression, and subdued it by what He obligated upon him: the seeking of lawful sustenance. And He defeated, by breaking it, the forces of Satan, who gird themselves for leading astray. Indeed, it used to course through the son of Adam like flowing blood, but the honor of the lawful constricted its channel and scope, since nothing could drive it into the depths of the veins except the appetite inclined to overpowering and indulgence. Thus, when it was reined in by the bridle of the lawful, it remained disappointed and losing, with no helper or ally. And blessings upon Muhammad, the guide from misguidance, and upon his family, the best of families, and abundant salutations.

To proceed: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Seeking the lawful is an obligation upon every Muslim." (The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Seeking the lawful is an obligation upon every Muslim" was mentioned previously in the section on Zakat, without the phrase "upon every Muslim." Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat narrates from the hadith of Anas: "…is a duty upon every Muslim," but its chain is weak. It is narrated by Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him.) This obligation, among all other obligations, is the most difficult for minds to comprehend and the heaviest upon limbs to perform. Therefore, it has become completely effaced, both in knowledge and practice, and the obscurity of its knowledge became a cause for the effacement of its practice. For the ignorant presumed that the lawful is lost, that the path to attaining it is blocked, and that nothing remains of wholesome things except sweet water and grass growing in barren land, and that all else has been rendered foul by transgressing hands and corrupted by corrupt transactions. When contentment with grass from vegetation becomes impossible, no option remains except to expand into the prohibited matters. Thus, they rejected this central pillar of religion entirely and perceived no distinction or separation between types of wealth. Far from it, far from it! The lawful is clear, and the prohibited is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters. And these three remain conjoined however circumstances may change.

Since this is an innovation whose harm has become widespread in the religion and whose sparks have scattered among creation, it is necessary to remove the veil from its corruption by guiding to the means of distinguishing between the lawful and the prohibited and the ambiguous matter, with clarity and explanation, without taking it out of the realm of possibility. We shall clarify this in seven chapters:

Chapter One: On the virtue of seeking the lawful and the blame of the prohibited, and the degrees of the lawful and the prohibited.
Chapter Two: On the levels of ambiguities, their sources, and distinguishing them from the lawful and the prohibited.
Chapter Three: On investigation, inquiry, presumption, and negligence, and their places regarding the lawful and the prohibited.
Chapter Four: On the manner of the repentant one's restitution for financial wrongs.
Chapter Five: On the revenues of rulers and their gifts, what is lawful and what is prohibited thereof.
Chapter Six: On entering upon rulers and associating with them.
Chapter Seven: On miscellaneous issues.

Chapter One: On the virtue of the lawful and the blame of the prohibited, and explaining the categories of the lawful and its degrees, and the categories of the prohibited and the degrees of scrupulousness therein.

The virtue of the lawful and the blame of the prohibited. God Almighty said: "Eat of the good things and do righteous deeds." He commanded eating from the good things before the deed, and it is said the meaning is the lawful. And He said: "And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly." And He said: "Indeed, those who consume the wealth of orphans unjustly..." (the verse). And He said: "O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of usury, if you should be believers." Then He said: "And if you do not, then be informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger." Then He said: "But if you repent, you may have your principal." Then He said: "And whoever returns to it – those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally." Thus, He made the consumer of usury, at first, one who announces war with God, and in the end, one exposed to the Fire. The verses concerning the lawful and the prohibited are innumerable.

Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Seeking the lawful is an obligation upon every Muslim." And when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim" (the hadith "Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim" was mentioned previously in the Book of Knowledge), some scholars said he meant by it seeking knowledge of the lawful and the prohibited, making the meaning of the two hadiths one. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever strives for his dependents from his lawful earnings is like a warrior in the cause of God. And whoever seeks worldly gain lawfully, in chastity, is in the rank of the martyrs." (The hadith: "Whoever strives for his dependents from his lawful earnings...")

Like the mujahid in the path of God, and whoever seeks worldly provision in chastity is in the rank of the martyrs. Al-Tabarani recorded it in Al-Awsat from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever strives for his dependents is in the path of God." And Abu Mansur in Musnad al-Firdaws: "Whoever seeks lawful earnings from a lawful door to shield his face from begging from people, and for his children and dependents, will come on the Day of Resurrection with the prophets and the truthful ones." Their chains are weak. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever eats lawful sustenance for forty days, God will illuminate his heart and cause springs of wisdom to flow from his heart upon his tongue." The hadith: "Whoever eats lawful sustenance for forty days, God will illuminate his heart and cause springs of wisdom to flow from his heart upon his tongue," was recorded by Abu Nu'aym in Al-Hilyah from the hadith of Abu Ayyub: "Whoever is sincere to God for forty days, springs of wisdom will appear from his heart upon his tongue." And Ibn 'Adi has something similar from the hadith of Abu Musa, and said it is a munkar hadith. In a narration: "God will instill in him detachment from the world." And it is narrated that Sa'd asked the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, to ask God Almighty to make his supplications answered. He said to him: "Purify your sustenance, and your supplication will be answered." The hadith: "Sa'd asked the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, to ask God to make his supplications answered. He said to him: 'Purify your sustenance, and your supplication will be answered,'" was recorded by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and in it is one whom I do not know. And when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned the one greedy for the world, he said: "A disheveled, dusty man, wandering in journeys, his food unlawful, his clothing unlawful, nourished by the unlawful, raises his hands and says: 'O Lord, O Lord!' So how can that be answered?" The hadith: "A disheveled, dusty man, wandering in journeys, his food unlawful, his clothing unlawful..." was recorded by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording: "Then he mentioned a man who travels long, disheveled, dusty..." And in the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "God has an angel over Bayt al-Maqdis who calls out every night: 'Whoever eats unlawful, no voluntary nor obligatory act is accepted from him.'" The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "God has an angel over Bayt al-Maqdis who calls out every night: 'Whoever eats unlawful, no voluntary nor obligatory act is accepted from him,'" I have not found a source for it. And Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whoever eats a morsel of unlawful, no prayer is accepted from him for forty nights." The hadith is munkar. It is said: "Al-sarf" is the voluntary, and "al-'adl" is the obligatory. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams, and in its price is one dirham of unlawful, God will not accept his prayer as long as any of it is upon him." The hadith: "Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams, and in its price is one dirham of unlawful, God will not accept his prayer as long as any of it is upon him," was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Every flesh nourished by the unlawful, the Fire is more deserving of it." The hadith: "Every flesh nourished by the unlawful, the Fire is more deserving of it," was recorded by Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Ka'b bin 'Ujrah, and he graded it hasan, and it has preceded. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever does not care from where he earns wealth, God will not care from where He admits him into the Fire." The hadith: "Whoever does not care from where he earns wealth, God Almighty will not care from where He admits him into the Fire," was recorded by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn al-'Arabi in 'Aridat al-Ahwadhi, Sharh al-Tirmidhi, said it is batil, not sahih, nor is it sound. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Worship has ten parts, nine of them are in seeking the lawful." The hadith: "Worship has ten parts, so nine of them are in seeking the lawful," was narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami from the hadith of Anas, except that he said: "Nine of them are in silence, and the tenth is earning with the hand from the lawful," and it is munkar. This is narrated as marfu' and as mawquf upon some Companions as well. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever spends the evening weary from seeking the lawful, he goes to sleep forgiven and awakens with God pleased with him." The hadith: "Whoever spends the evening weary from seeking the lawful, he goes to sleep forgiven and awakens with God pleased with him," was recorded by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "Whoever spends the evening weary from the work of his hands, he spends the evening forgiven," and in it is weakness. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever acquires wealth from sin and then uses it to maintain kinship ties, or gives it in charity, or spends it in the path of God, God gathers all that together and then hurls it into the Fire." The hadith: "Whoever acquires wealth from sin and then uses it to maintain kinship ties, or gives it in charity, or spends it in the path of God, God gathers all that together and then hurls it into the Fire," was narrated by Abu Dawud in Al-Marasil from the narration of Al-Qasim bin Mukhaymira, mursal. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The best of your religion is scrupulousness." The hadith: "The best of your religion is scrupulousness," has preceded in the chapter on knowledge. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever meets God while scrupulous, God will give him the reward of Islam in its entirety." The hadith: "Whoever meets God while scrupulous, God will give him the reward of Islam in its entirety," I have not found a source for it. And it is narrated that God Almighty said in some of His scriptures: "And as for..."

The God-fearing—I am ashamed to hold them to account. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A single dirham of usury is more severe in the sight of God than thirty acts of fornication in Islam." (A dirham of usury is more severe in the sight of God than thirty acts of fornication in Islam.) This is narrated by Ahmad and Al-Daraqutni from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Hanzhalah, who said thirty-six, and its narrators are trustworthy. It is also reported from Hanzhalah the Ascetic from Ka'b, attributed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. And Al-Tabarani in Al-Saghir from the hadith of Ibn Abbas has thirty-three, but its chain is weak. And in the hadith of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him: "The stomach is the basin of the body, and the veins lead to it. When the stomach is healthy, the veins flow with health, and when it is sick, they flow with sickness." (Abu Hurairah: The stomach is the basin of the body, and the veins lead to it.) This hadith was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat and Al-'Uqayli in Al-Du'afa', who said it is baseless and has no origin.

The likeness of lawful sustenance in religion is like the foundation of a building. When the foundation is firm and strong, the building stands upright and rises. When the foundation is weak and crooked, the building collapses and falls. And God, the Exalted, says: "Is he who founded his building upon reverence for God and His good pleasure better, or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling bank?" [Quran 9:109]. And in the hadith: "Whoever acquires wealth from what is unlawful, if he gives it in charity, it will not be accepted from him, and if he leaves it behind, it will be his provision for the Fire." (Whoever acquires wealth from what is unlawful, if he gives it in charity, it will not be accepted from him, and if he leaves it behind, it will be his provision for the Fire.) Narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain. And Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Whoever gathers wealth from what is unlawful and then gives it in charity, he will have no reward for it, and its burden will be upon him."

We have mentioned a collection of reports in the Book of the Etiquettes of Earning which reveal the virtue of lawful earning. As for the narrations, it has been reported that Al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, drank some milk from the earnings of his servant, then asked his servant. He said, "I practiced soothsaying for some people and they gave me [this]." So he put his fingers into his mouth and began to vomit until I thought his soul would depart. Then he said, "O God, I seek Your pardon for what has been carried by the veins and mixed with the intestines." (Indeed, Abu Bakr drank milk from the earnings of his servant, then asked him. He said, 'I practiced soothsaying for some people and they gave me.' So he put his finger into his mouth and began to vomit.) In some reports, when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was informed of this, he said, "Did you not know that nothing enters the belly of Al-Siddiq except what is pure?" Narrated by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'A'ishah: Abu Bakr had a servant who collected the tribute for him, and Abu Bakr would eat from his tribute. One day he brought something and Abu Bakr ate from it. The servant said to him, "Do you know what this is?" He said, "What is it?" He said, "I practiced soothsaying for a man in the pre-Islamic period..." He mentioned it without attributing it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and I did not find it attributed. In some reports, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was informed of this and said, "Did you know that nothing enters the belly of Al-Siddiq except what is pure?"

Similarly, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, drank from the milk of charity camels by mistake, so he put his finger [in his mouth] and vomited. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said, "You neglect the best of worship: it is scrupulous piety." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Even if you were to pray until you become like bent bows and fast until you become like taut strings, that would not be accepted from you except with a restraining piety." And Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, said, "No one attained [spiritual station] who attained except by being mindful of what enters his belly." And Al-Fudayl said, "Whoever knows what enters his belly, God records him as a truthful one. So consider with whom you break your fast, O wretched one!" And it was said to Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, "Why do you not drink from the water of Zamzam?" He said, "If I had a bucket, I would drink from it." And Sufyan al-Thawri, may God be pleased with him, said, "Whoever spends from unlawful wealth in obedience to God is like one who cleanses a garment soiled with urine with urine. A soiled garment is not purified except by water, and sin is not expiated except by what is lawful." And Yahya ibn Mu'adh said, "Obedience is a treasure from the treasures of God, except that its key is supplication and its teeth are bites of lawful sustenance." And Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said, "God does not accept the prayer of a person in whose belly is unlawful." And Sahl al-Tustari said, "A servant does not reach the reality of faith until he possesses four traits: performing the obligations according to the Sunnah, eating the lawful with scrupulous piety, avoiding the forbidden in outward and inward matters, and being patient in that until death." And he said, "Whoever loves to be unveiled with the signs of the truthful ones, let him eat nothing but the lawful, and let him act only according to the Sunnah or out of necessity." And it is said, "Whoever eats from doubtful matters for forty days, his heart becomes darkened." This is an interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: "No! Rather, that which they have earned has covered their hearts with rust." [Quran 83:14]. And Ibn al-Mubarak said, "Rejecting a single dirham from doubtful matters is more beloved to me than giving a hundred thousand dirhams in charity"—and a hundred thousand, and a hundred thousand—until he reached six hundred thousand. And some of the predecessors said, "A servant eats a morsel, and his heart becomes overturned and tainted as leather is tanned, and it never returns to its state." And Sahl, may God be pleased with him, said, "Whoever eats the unlawful, his limbs disobey him, whether he wills it or not, whether he knows or does not know. And whoever..."

If one's sustenance is lawful, his limbs obey him and he is granted success in good deeds. Some of the pious predecessors said: The first morsel a servant eats from lawful provision, his past sins are forgiven. And whoever stations himself in a position of humility in seeking the lawful, his sins fall away like leaves falling from a tree. It is narrated in the traditions of the pious predecessors that when a preacher would sit to address the people, the scholars would say: Scrutinize him for three things. If he holds to an innovation, do not sit with him, for he speaks from the tongue of Satan. If his sustenance is foul, he speaks from desire. And if he is not sound of intellect, he corrupts with his speech more than he rectifies, so do not sit with him. In the well-known narrations from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, and others: "The lawful of this world is accounted for, its unlawful is punishment." Others added: "And its doubtful matters are reproach." It is narrated that one of the righteous offered food to one of the *abdāl* (substitutes, righteous servants), but he did not eat. He was asked about that, and he said: "We only eat what is lawful, therefore our hearts remain upright, our state endures, we unveil the unseen realm, and we witness the Hereafter. If we were to eat what you eat for three days, we would not return to anything of the knowledge of certainty, and fear and witnessing would depart from our hearts." The man said to him: "But I fast perpetually and complete the Qur'an thirty times every month." The *badal* (substitute) said: "This drink you saw me drink last night is more beloved to me than thirty completions of the Qur'an in three hundred rak'ahs of your deeds." And his drink was from the milk of a wild doe.

There was a long companionship between Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma'in. Ahmad shunned him when he heard him say: "I do not ask anyone for anything, and even if Satan gave me something, I would eat it." Until Yahya apologized and said: "I was joking." He said: "You joke about religion? Do you not know that eating is from religion? God Almighty gave it precedence over righteous deeds, saying: 'Eat of the good things and do righteous deeds.'" In a report, it is written in the Torah: "Whoever does not care from where his food comes, God will not care from which gates of Hellfire He enters him." And from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, it is narrated that after 'Uthman was killed and the house was looted, he did not eat any food unless it was sealed, out of caution from doubt.

Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad, Ibn 'Uyaynah, and Ibn al-Mubarak gathered with Wahb ibn al-Ward in Mecca. They mentioned dates. Wahb said: "They are among the most beloved food to me, except that I do not eat them because the dates of Mecca are mixed with the orchards of Zubaydah and others." Ibn al-Mubarak said to him: "If you look into such matters, bread will become narrow for you." He said: "And what is its cause?" He said: "Because the origins of estates have become mixed with endowments." Wahb was overcome (by this). Sufyan said: "You have killed the man." Ibn al-Mubarak said: "I only intended to make it easier for him." When he regained consciousness, he said: "I make a vow to God that I will never eat bread until I meet Him." It is said he would drink milk. His mother came to him with milk, and he asked her. She said: "It is from the sheep of the family of so-and-so." He inquired about its price and from where they had obtained it. She mentioned it. When he brought it near his mouth, he said: "It remains: from where did it graze?" She was silent, so he did not drink it because it had grazed in a place containing a right belonging to the Muslims. His mother said: "Drink, for God will forgive you." He said: "I do not love that He forgive me while I have drunk it, attaining His forgiveness through disobedience to Him."

Bishr al-Hafi, may God have mercy on him, was among the scrupulous. He was asked: "From where do you eat?" He said: "From where you eat. But one who eats while weeping is not like one who eats while laughing." And he said: "A hand shorter than a hand, and a morsel smaller than a morsel." And thus they would guard against doubtful matters among the varieties of the lawful and its avenues.

Know that the detailed explanation of the lawful and unlawful is undertaken by the books of jurisprudence. The seeker can dispense with its elaboration by having a specific, known sustenance whose lawfulness he knows through a legal verdict, not eating from other than it. As for one who expands in eating from various avenues, he needs knowledge of all the lawful and unlawful, as we have detailed in the books of jurisprudence. We now point to its aggregates in the context of a division, which is that wealth is only prohibited either due to a meaning in its essence or due to a defect in the manner of its acquisition.

The first division: The unlawful due to a characteristic in its essence, like wine, swine, and others. Its detail is that the edible entities on the face of the earth do not exceed three categories. They are either from minerals, like salt and clay and others; or from plants; or from animals. As for minerals, they are parts of the earth and all that comes out of it. Their consumption is not prohibited except insofar as they harm the eater. In some of them is what functions like poison. Even bread, if it were harmful, its consumption would be prohibited. The clay that is habitually eaten is not prohibited except due to harm. The benefit of our statement that it is not prohibited even though it is not eaten is that if something from them fell into a broth or liquid food, it would not become unlawful by it.

As for plants, nothing from them is prohibited except what removes the intellect, or removes life, or health. That which removes the intellect is *banj* (henbane) and wine and all intoxicants. That which removes life is poisons. That which removes health is medicines at other than their proper time.

The entirety of this discussion essentially pertains to what is harmful, except for intoxicants like wine and other substances that cause inebriation. Even that which does not cause intoxication from them is also forbidden due to its very essence and its attribute, which is the intense, pleasurable stimulation. As for poison, if it ceases to be harmful due to its minute quantity or because it is mixed with something else, then it is not forbidden. Regarding animals, they are divided into those that may be eaten and those that may not, with the details elaborated in the Book of Foods. The discussion becomes extensive in detailing this, especially concerning exotic birds, land and sea creatures. That which is permissible to eat from them is only so if slaughtered according to the prescribed Islamic method, observing the conditions pertaining to the slaughterer, the instrument, and the act of slaughter itself, all of which is mentioned in the Book of Hunting and Slaughtered Animals. Whatever is not slaughtered Islamically or dies [of itself] is forbidden, except for two dead creatures: fish and locusts. In their meaning are included food substances that undergo transformation, such as apple worms, vinegar, and cheese, for avoiding them is not possible. However, if they are isolated and eaten, their ruling is that of the fly, beetle, scorpion, and everything that does not have flowing blood. The sole reason for their prohibition is repulsiveness; were it not for that, they would not be disliked. If a person is found who does not find them repulsive, no attention is paid to his individual disposition, for they are classified among the foul things due to the general consensus of repulsiveness. Thus, eating them is disliked, just as if one were to collect mucus and drink it, that would be disliked. This dislike is not due to their impurity, for the correct view is that they are not rendered impure by death, since the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded that a fly be dipped into food if it falls in—a hadith narrated by al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah. Perhaps it is hot, and that becomes the cause of its death. If an ant or a fly falls into a cooking pot, it is not obligatory to discard the contents, for the repulsive element is its physical body if it retains its form; it does not become impure so as to be forbidden due to impurity. This indicates that its prohibition is due to repulsiveness. Therefore, we say: if a part of a dead human being, even weighing a *danīq*, falls into a pot, the entirety becomes forbidden, not due to its impurity—for the correct view is that a human being is not rendered impure by death—but because eating it is forbidden out of reverence, not repulsiveness. As for permissible animals when slaughtered according to Islamic law, not all their parts become lawful; rather, the blood and dung and everything judged impure from them are forbidden. Indeed, consuming impurity is absolutely forbidden. However, among tangible substances, nothing is both forbidden and impure except from animals. As for from plants, it is only intoxicants, excluding that which removes reason but does not intoxicate, like *banj* (henbane). The impurity of intoxicants is an added severity to deter from it, as it is a precursor to craving. If a drop of impurity or a part of solid impurity falls into a broth, food, or oil, eating all of it becomes forbidden, but using it for purposes other than eating is not forbidden. Thus, it is permissible to use impure oil for lighting lamps, and similarly for coating ships, animals, and other things. These are the general categories of what is forbidden due to an attribute in its essence.

The second category is what is forbidden due to a defect in the manner of establishing possession over it, and herein the discussion expands. We say: Acquiring wealth is either by the owner's choice or not by his choice. That which is not by his choice is like inheritance. That which is by his choice is either not from an owner, like extracting minerals, or is from an owner. That which is taken from an owner is either taken by force or taken by mutual consent. That taken by force is either due to the forfeiture of the owner's protection, like spoils of war, or due to a right to take, like the *zakāh* from those who refuse to pay it and the obligatory expenditures upon them. That taken by mutual consent is either taken in exchange for a consideration, like sale, dowry, and wages, or taken without consideration, like gifts and bequests. From this discourse, six divisions result:

The first is what is taken from a non-owner, like extracting minerals, reviving dead land, hunting, gathering firewood, drawing water from rivers, and collecting herbs. This is lawful on the condition that what is taken is not specifically reserved for someone with inviolability among human beings. If it is free from such reservations, the one who takes it owns it. The details of this are in the Book of Reviving Dead Land.

The second is what is taken by force from those who have no inviolability, which is *fay'* (booty from non-combat), *ghanīmah* (spoils of war), and all the wealth of disbelievers and combatants. This is lawful for the Muslims if they extract the one-fifth (*khums*) and distribute the remainder justly among those entitled, and they do not take it from a disbeliever who has inviolability, safe-conduct, or a treaty. The details of these conditions are in the Book of Military Expeditions from the Book of *Fay'* and *Ghanīmah* and the Book of *Jizyah*.

The third is what is taken by force due to a rightful claim when one upon whom it is obligatory refuses, so it is taken without his consent. This is lawful if the cause for the claim is established, the description of the claimant which validates his claim is complete, and he restricts himself to the amount he is entitled to, receiving it from one who has the authority to enforce it, like a judge, ruler, or rightful claimant. The details of this are in the Book of Distributing Alms, the Book of Endowments, and the Book of Expenditures, for therein lies the examination of the description of those entitled to *zakāh*, endowments, maintenance, and other rights. When their conditions are fulfilled, the taken wealth...

The fourth category of lawful earnings is that which is taken by mutual consent through exchange, and this is lawful provided the conditions of both the exchange and the contracting parties are observed, along with the condition of the verbal expressions—namely, offer and acceptance—in addition to what the Sacred Law has ordained in avoiding invalidating conditions. The details of this are explained in the Book of Sales, Advance-Payment Contracts, Leasing, Transfer of Debt, Guarantee, Profit-Sharing Partnerships, Partnerships, Irrigation Partnerships, Pre-emption, Settlements, Divorce by Redemption, Manumission Contracts, Dowries, and all other exchanges.

The fifth category is that which is taken willingly without compensation, and it is lawful provided the conditions of the subject matter, the contracting parties, and the contract itself are observed, and it does not lead to harm to an heir or others. This is mentioned in the Book of Gifts, Bequests, and Charities.

The sixth category is that which is acquired without choice, such as inheritance, and it is lawful if the deceased acquired the wealth through one of the five lawful means, and then after settling debts, executing bequests, equitably dividing shares among heirs, and paying obligatory alms, pilgrimage, and expiations if due. This is mentioned in the Book of Bequests and Inheritance Shares.

These are the comprehensive sources of lawful and unlawful matters. We have alluded to them in summary so that the seeker may know that if his sustenance comes from various unspecified sources, he cannot dispense with knowledge of these matters. Everything he consumes from any of these sources should be referred to the people of knowledge, and he should not proceed in ignorance. For just as it is said to the learned, "Why have you opposed your knowledge?" it is said to the ignorant, "Why have you persisted in your ignorance and not sought learning after the obligation of seeking knowledge has been made incumbent upon every Muslim?"

Know that all unlawful things are impure, but some are more impure than others; and all lawful things are pure, but some are purer and clearer than others. Just as a physician judges all sweet things to be heating, yet says some are heating in the first degree like sugar, some in the second like refined sugar, some in the third like syrup, and some in the fourth like honey, so too is the unlawful: some are impure and heating in the first degree, some in the second, third, or fourth. Likewise, the lawful varies in degrees of purity and goodness. Let us then follow the convention of physicians in approximating four degrees, though in truth this limitation is not absolute, for within each degree there is also boundless variation. For some sugar is more heating than other sugar, and likewise for others.

Therefore, we say that scrupulousness regarding the unlawful has four degrees:

The first is the scrupulousness of the upright, which is obligatory; transgressing it constitutes immorality, nullifies uprightness, establishes the name of disobedience, and exposes one to the Fire. It is scrupulousness regarding everything that the legal verdicts of the jurists forbid.

The second is the scrupulousness of the righteous, which is abstaining from what may possibly involve prohibition, though the jurist permits consumption based on outward appearance. It is among the matters of ambiguity in general. We term caution in this the scrupulousness of the righteous, and it is of the second degree.

The third is that which legal verdicts do not forbid and there is no ambiguity in its permissibility, but one fears it may lead to something forbidden. It is abandoning what is not harmful out of fear of what is harmful. This is the scrupulousness of the certain. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "A servant does not reach the degree of the God-fearing until he abandons what is not harmful out of fear of what is harmful." This hadith is reported by Ibn Majah and has been mentioned earlier.

The fourth is that which is not harmful at all, nor is there fear it will lead to what is harmful, but it is consumed not for God’s sake and without the intention of using it to strengthen oneself in worshiping God, or its facilitating causes involve dislike or disobedience. Abstaining from this is the scrupulousness of the truthful.

These are the degrees of the lawful in summary, until we elaborate them with examples and evidences.

As for the unlawful we mentioned in the first degree, which requires scrupulousness for uprightness and discarding the mark of immorality, it too has degrees in impurity. That taken through a invalid contract, such as a non-verbal exchange in what does not permit it, is unlawful but not to the degree of that seized by force. Rather, seizure is more severe, for it involves abandoning the lawful means of acquisition prescribed by the Sacred Law and harming others, whereas the non-verbal exchange involves no harm but only abandoning the prescribed mode of worship. Then, abandoning the prescribed mode through non-verbal exchange is lighter than abandoning it through usury. This variation is understood through the severity, warning, and emphasis of the Sacred Law regarding certain prohibitions, as will come in the Book of Repentance when discussing the difference between major and minor sins. Indeed, that taken unjustly from a poor person, a righteous person, or an orphan is more impure and greater than that taken from a strong, rich, or immoral person, because the degrees of harm differ according to the degrees of the one harmed. These are subtleties in the details of impurities that should not be overlooked. Were it not for the varying degrees of sinners, the degrees of punishment would not differ.

The Fire. And when the grounds for severity are known, there is no need to confine it to three or four degrees, for that is mere arbitrary imposition and following whim; it is to seek confinement for that which cannot be confined. The differing degrees of prohibition in their vileness is indicated by what will come regarding conflicting prohibitions and preferring some over others, such that when compelled to eat carrion, or eat another's food, or eat game from the Sacred Precinct, we give precedence to some of this over some of that. Examples of the four degrees in scrupulous piety and their evidences: As for the first degree, which is the scrupulous piety of the upright, it is everything that a legal verdict necessitates is prohibited, from what enters the six avenues we mentioned as avenues to the prohibited due to the absence of a condition. This is the absolute prohibition, whose perpetrator is ascribed to wickedness and disobedience, and it is what we intend by the absolute prohibition, needing no examples or evidences.

As for the second degree, its examples are every doubt whose avoidance is not obligatory but is recommended, as will come in the chapter on doubts. For among doubts are those whose avoidance is obligatory, thus aligning with the prohibited; among them are those whose avoidance is disliked, so scrupulous piety regarding them is the piety of the obsessive, like one who refrains from hunting for fear that the game may have escaped from a person who captured and owned it—and this is obsession; and among them are those whose avoidance is recommended but not obligatory. This is what the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, applies to: "Leave what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt." The hadith "Leave what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt" was reported by al-Nasa'i, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali. We interpret it as a prohibition of a recommendatory nature. Likewise, his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Eat what you have stunned and leave what you have caused to flee." The hadith "Eat what you have stunned and leave what you have caused to flee" was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, and by al-Bayhaqi as a statement of Ibn 'Abbas, who said the elevated chain is weak. "Causing to flee" is when the game runs and disappears from sight, then one finds it dead, for it is possible it died from a fall or another cause. What we prefer, as will come, is that this is not prohibited, but leaving it is from the scrupulous piety of the righteous. His saying "Leave what causes you doubt" is a recommendatory command, for in some narrations it states: "Eat it, even if it disappears from you, as long as you do not find on it a mark other than your arrow." Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to 'Adi ibn Hatim regarding the trained dog: "If it eats, then do not eat, for I fear it may have caught it for itself." This is on the level of recommendation due to caution, for he said to Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani: "Eat it." He said, "Even if it ate from it?" He said, "Even if it ate." The hadith: He said to Abu Tha'labah: "Eat it." He said, "Even if it ate?" He said, "Even if it ate." Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather, and from the hadith of Abu Tha'labah also in a concise form, and their chains are good. Al-Bayhaqi reported it as a statement of Abu Tha'labah and said the elevated chain is weak. This is because the circumstance of Abu Tha'labah, who was poor and earning, could not bear this level of scrupulous piety, while the circumstance of 'Adi could bear it. It is related from Ibn Sirin that he left four thousand dirhams for a partner because something stirred in his heart, despite the consensus of the scholars that there is no harm in it. Examples of this degree we will mention when dealing with the degrees of doubt. So everything that is a doubt whose avoidance is not obligatory is an example of this degree.

As for the third degree, which is the scrupulous piety of the God-fearing, it is attested by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "A servant does not reach the degree of the God-fearing until he leaves what is harmless out of fear of what is harmful." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "We used to leave nine-tenths of the lawful out of fear of falling into the unlawful." It is said this is from Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both. And Abu al-Darda' said: "From the perfection of God-consciousness is that a servant fears God regarding an atom's weight, to the point that he leaves some of what he sees as lawful, fearing it may be unlawful, so that it becomes a barrier between him and the Fire." For this reason, one of them was owed one hundred dirhams by a man, and when he brought them, he took ninety-nine and scrupulously refrained from taking the full amount, fearing an excess. And some of them would be cautious: for everything he collected, he would take two grains less, and what he gave, he would give with two grains extra, so that would be a barrier from the Fire. From this degree is cautioning against what people are lenient about, for that is lawful according to legal verdict, but one fears that opening its door may lead to other things, and the soul becomes accustomed to laxity and abandons scrupulous piety. From that is what is related from 'Ali ibn Ma'bad that he said: "I was living in a rented house, and I wrote a document and wanted to take some dust from the wall to dry and absorb the ink. Then I said: 'The wall is not mine.' My soul said to me: 'And what is the amount of dust from a wall?' So I took the dust I needed. When I slept, I saw a person standing saying: 'O 'Ali ibn Ma'bad, tomorrow he will know who says: 'And what is the amount of dust from a wall?'" Perhaps the meaning of that is that he will see how it lowers his station, for God-consciousness has a degree that is lost with the loss of the scrupulous piety of the God-fearing. The intent is not that he deserves punishment for his action.

Among such accounts is what has been narrated: When ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) received some musk from Bahrain, he said, “I wish a woman would weigh it so I could distribute it among the Muslims.” His wife ‘Ātikah said, “I am skilled at weighing.” He remained silent. Then he repeated his wish, and she repeated her reply. He said, “I would not like you to place it on the scale-pan and then say, ‘There is dust on it,’ and wipe it on your neck, thereby gaining some extra benefit over the Muslims.” And when musk for the Muslims was being weighed before ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, he held his nose so the scent would not reach him, saying, “Does one benefit from it except by its fragrance?”—due to his scrupulousness in that matter.

And al-Hasan (may God be pleased with him) took a date from the charity dates when he was young, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Kakh, kakh!”—a narration that al-Bukhārī transmitted from the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah—meaning, “Throw it away.”

And among such accounts is what some have narrated: A man was present at the bedside of a dying person who passed away at night. He said, “Extinguish the lamp, for the heirs now have a right to the oil.”

And Sulaymān al-Taymī narrated from Nu‘aymah the perfume-seller, who said: “‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) would give his wife some perfume from the Muslims’ perfume to sell. She sold me some perfume, and she would stand up, adding and subtracting, breaking it with her teeth. A bit stuck to her finger, and she said, ‘Like this,’ with her finger, then wiped it on her headscarf. ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) entered and said, ‘What is this scent?’ She informed him. He said, ‘The Muslims’ perfume, and you take it?’ He snatched the headscarf from her head, took a jug of water, and began pouring water on the headscarf, rubbing it in the dirt, then smelling it, then pouring water, rubbing it in the dirt and smelling it until no scent remained.” She said, “Then I visited her another time, and when she weighed some, a bit stuck to her finger. She put her finger in her mouth, then wiped it on the ground.” This is from ‘Umar’s scrupulous piety, fearing that the matter might extend to others. Otherwise, washing the headscarf would not have returned the perfume to the Muslims, but he destroyed it upon her as a deterrent and restraint, and to guard against the matter spreading to others.

And among such matters, Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (may God have mercy on him) was asked about a man in the mosque who carries a censer for some rulers and fumigates the mosque with aloeswood. He said, “He should leave the mosque, for one benefits from aloeswood only by its scent. This verges on the impermissible, for the amount of fragrance that lingers on his garment from the perfume may be intended, and someone might begrudge it. Who knows whether it is permitted or not?” And Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal was asked about someone who dropped a paper containing ḥadīths: May the finder copy from it and then return it? He said, “No, rather he should seek permission, then copy.” This, too, involves doubt whether its owner would be pleased or not. Thus, since it is in the realm of doubt, and the principle is prohibition, it is forbidden, and avoiding it is of the highest degree.

And among such matters is abstaining from adornment, fearing it may lead to what is beyond it, even though adornment is permissible in itself. Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal was asked about Sabbāṭī sandals. He said, “As for me, I do not use them, but if it is for mud, I hope it is permissible. But as for one who desires adornment, no.”

And among such matters: When ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) assumed the caliphate, he had a wife whom he loved, but he divorced her secretly, lest she intercede with him for something false and he grant it, seeking her pleasure. This is abandoning what is not wrong for fear of what is wrong—that is, fearing it might lead to it.

Most permissible things invite to forbidden matters. Even excessive eating and using perfume for a celibate person stirs desire, then desire invites thought, thought invites looking, and looking invites what is beyond it. Likewise, looking at the houses of the wealthy and their adornment is permissible in itself, but it stirs greed and invites seeking the same, leading to committing what is unlawful in acquiring it. Thus are all permissible things if not taken according to need, at the time of need, while guarding against their pitfalls through knowledge first, then through caution; rarely is their outcome free from danger. Similarly, whatever is taken out of desire rarely is free from danger. Hence, Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal disliked plastering walls, saying, “As for plastering the ground, it prevents dust, but plastering walls is adornment with no benefit.” He even disapproved of plastering and decorating mosques, citing what is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): He was asked to apply kohl to the mosque, and he said, “No, a shelter like the shelter of Moses.” Al-Dāraquṭnī transmitted it in al-Afrad from the ḥadīth of Abū al-Dardā’, saying it is rare. It refers to something like kohl used for coating, but the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) did not permit it. The early generations disliked thin garments, saying, “Whoever makes his garment thin makes his religion thin.” All this is out of fear that following desires in permissible matters may spread to other matters, for the forbidden and the permissible...

The soul desires them with a single craving, and when the soul becomes accustomed to the craving for indulgence, it becomes unrestrained. Therefore, the fear inherent in piety necessitates scrupulousness (wara') from all of this. Thus, any permissible (halal) matter that is free from such fear is the pure, wholesome halal, belonging to the third degree. This is everything the performance of which one does not fear will lead to sin whatsoever. As for the fourth degree, which is the scrupulousness of the truthful (al-siddiqin), the halal according to them is everything in the means of attaining which no sin has preceded, nor is it used as an aid to sin, nor is the immediate or ultimate purpose in partaking of it the fulfillment of a base desire. Rather, it is consumed for the sake of God Almighty—truly and sincerely—and for piety in worshipping Him, and to preserve life for His sake. These are the ones who consider everything that is not for God to be forbidden, in compliance with His saying, exalted is He: "Say, 'God'; then leave them to amuse themselves in their vain discourse.'" This is the rank of the monotheists who are stripped of their own selfish interests, devoted exclusively to God Almighty in intention. There is no doubt that one who is scrupulous about what leads to sin or is aided by sin, should also be scrupulous about what is connected to a cause of acquisition involving sin or something reprehensible.

From this is what is narrated concerning Yahya ibn Kathir: he drank medicine, and his wife said to him, "If only you would walk about the house a little so the medicine may take effect." He replied, "This is a walking I do not recognize, and I have been holding my soul to account for thirty years." It was as if no intention connected to religion was present for him in this walking, so he did not permit himself to proceed with it. And concerning Sari, may God have mercy on him, it is said he reached some herbs on a mountain and water flowing from it. He partook of the herbs and drank from the water and said to himself, "If I have ever eaten pure, wholesome halal, it is this day." Then a caller called out to him, "The strength that brought you to this place, from where is it?" So he turned back in regret. And from this is what is narrated concerning Dhu al-Nun al-Misri: he was hungry and imprisoned, so a righteous woman sent him food by the hand of the jailer, but he did not eat it. Then he excused himself, saying, "It came to me on a plate of oppression," meaning the power that delivered the food to me was not pure. This is the utmost limit in scrupulousness.

And from this is that Bishr, may God have mercy on him, would not drink water from rivers dug by rulers, for the river is the cause of the water's flow and its reaching him, even though the water is inherently permissible. Thus, it would be like benefiting from a river dug by the labors of workers who were given their wages from what is forbidden. For this reason, some abstained from permissible grapes from a permissible vineyard, saying to its owner, "You have spoiled it when you watered it from water flowing in a river dug by the oppressors." This is further removed from injustice than drinking the water itself, for it is an avoidance of the grape's dependence on that water. And some of them, when passing on the pilgrimage route, would not drink from the cisterns built by oppressors, even though the water is permissible, but it remained preserved by the cistern built with wealth that is forbidden, so it was as if benefiting from it.

Dhu al-Nun's abstention from taking food from the hand of the jailer is greater than all of this, for the hand of the jailer cannot be described as forbidden, unlike a usurped plate if carried upon it, but it reached him by a strength acquired through forbidden nourishment. For this reason, the Truthful One (al-Siddiq), may God be pleased with him, vomited the milk out of fear that the forbidden might have generated strength within it, even though he drank it in ignorance and it was not obligatory to expel it. But emptying the stomach of the foul is from the scrupulousness of the truthful.

And from this is being scrupulous about a permissible earning acquired by a tailor who sews in the mosque, for Ahmad, may God have mercy on him, disliked the tailor sitting in the mosque. He was asked about a spindle-maker who sits in a dome in the graveyards at a time when rain is feared, and he said, "It is only from the affairs of the Hereafter," and disliked him sitting there. And some extinguished a lamp lit by his servant from a people whose wealth he disliked, and he refrained from stoking an oven for bread when there remained in it an ember from disliked firewood. And some refrained from having the thong of his sandal repaired in the ruler's workshop. These are the subtleties of scrupulousness among the travelers on the path of the Hereafter.

The reality concerning it is that scrupulousness has a beginning, which is abstaining from what religious verdicts have declared forbidden—this is the scrupulousness of the upright. And it has an ultimate end, which is the scrupulousness of the truthful. That is abstaining from everything that is not for Him, which is taken with craving, or attained through something reprehensible, or is connected by its cause to something reprehensible. Between these two are degrees of precaution. Whenever a servant is more severe in imposing restrictions upon himself, his burden will be lighter on the Day of Resurrection, his crossing over the Bridge will be faster, and he will be further from having the scale of his evil deeds outweigh the scale of his good deeds. The stations in the Hereafter will vary according to the variation of these degrees in scrupulousness, just as the degrees of the Fire vary for the oppressors according to the variation in the foulness of the degrees of the forbidden.

When you know the reality of the matter, the choice is yours. If you wish, then increase in precaution. If you wish, then grant concessions. You take precaution for your soul, and you grant concessions against your soul. And peace.

The Second Chapter: On the Ranks of Doubtful Matters, Their Instigations, and Distinguishing Them from the Permissible and the Forbidden. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said...

The lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters which many people do not know. So whoever guards against the ambiguous matters has absolved his honor and his religion. And whoever falls into the ambiguous matters has fallen into the unlawful, like a shepherd grazing around a protected pasture—he is on the verge of entering it. (This hadith is agreed upon, from the narration of al-Nu‘man ibn Bashir.) This hadith is an explicit text affirming the three categories, and the problematic one among them is the intermediate category which many people do not know, namely, the ambiguous. It is therefore necessary to clarify it and remove the veil from it, for what many do not know, a few may know.

So we say: Absolute lawfulness is that which is free in its essence from the attributes necessitating prohibition, and is released from any causes to which prohibition or dislike might attach. An example is the water a person takes from rain before it falls onto anyone's property; it remains, at the moment of its collection and taking from the air, within his own ownership or on permissible land. Pure prohibition is that which contains a prohibited attribute about which there is no doubt, such as the intoxicating potency in wine or the impurity in urine, or which is acquired through a cause that is definitively forbidden, such as that acquired through oppression, usury, and the like. These are two clear extremes.

Attached to these two extremes is that whose ruling is confirmed, but which admits the possibility of change, though there is no cause indicating that possibility. For example, the game of land and sea is lawful. If one takes a gazelle, it is possible that a hunter had owned it and then it escaped from him. Likewise, a fish—it is possible that it slipped from the fisherman's hand or net after being caught. Such a possibility does not attach to rainwater snatched from the air, but it is analogous to rainwater. Guarding against this is a whisper of Satan. Let us call this category the scrupulosity of the obsessive, so that its like may be attached to it, because this is a mere delusion with no evidence for it. Indeed, if there were evidence for it—if it were definitive, such as finding a ring in a fish's ear, or probable, such as finding a wound on a gazelle that could be a brand (which could only be applied after capture) or could be an injury—this is the place for scrupulosity. But when evidence is absent from every angle, a probability devoid of evidence is like a probability of something non-existent in itself.

Of this kind is one who borrows a house, then the lender disappears, so he leaves and says, "Perhaps he died and the right passed to the heir." This is a whisper, for there is no definitive or doubtful cause indicating his death. For the ambiguous matter to be feared is that which arises from doubt, and doubt is an expression of two opposing beliefs arising from two causes. That which has no cause does not establish a conviction in the soul such that it equals the opposing conviction and becomes doubt. Therefore, we say: Whoever doubts whether he prayed three or four rak'ahs, he takes three as the basis, for the principle is the absence of increase. If a person were asked about a noon prayer he performed ten years ago—was it three or four?—he could not be certain it was four. If he is not certain, he may consider it could be three. This consideration is not doubt, for no cause is present that necessitates believing it was three. So understand the reality of doubt, lest delusion and baseless consideration be confused with it. This is attached to absolute lawfulness.

Attached to pure prohibition is that whose prohibition is confirmed, even if the possibility of a lawful factor occurring is conceivable, but no cause indicates it. Such as one who has food belonging to his relative who has no heir but him, and the relative disappears. He says, "Perhaps he died and ownership has transferred to me, so I may eat it." His proceeding to eat it is proceeding to pure prohibition, because it is a probability without foundation. This pattern should not be counted among the categories of the ambiguous.

Rather, by "the ambiguous" we mean that whose matter is confused for us, such that two opposing beliefs confront us concerning it, issuing from two causes that necessitate the two beliefs. The sources of ambiguity are five. The first source is doubt concerning the cause of permissibility and prohibition. This is either balanced between two possibilities, or one possibility outweighs the other. If the two possibilities are balanced, the ruling is for what was known before; it is upheld and not abandoned due to doubt. If one possibility outweighs the other because it issues from a considered indication, the ruling is for the outweighing one. This only becomes clear through examples and evidences.

So let us divide it into four categories. The first category is when the prohibition is known beforehand, then doubt occurs regarding the specific instance. This is an ambiguity that must be avoided, and proceeding to it is forbidden. An example is shooting at game and wounding it, then it falls into water and is found dead. One does not know whether it died from drowning or from the wound. This is unlawful, because the principle is prohibition unless it died by a specific means, and doubt has occurred regarding the means. Certainty is not abandoned for doubt, as is the case with ritual impurities, impurities, prayer units, and others. Upon this is based the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to 'Adi ibn Hatim: "Do not eat it, for perhaps something other than your dog killed it."

It is agreed upon in his narration that the Prophet, peace be upon him, when something was brought to him and it was ambiguous to him whether it was charity or a gift, would inquire about it until he knew which of the two it was. A hadith states: "When something was brought to him and it was ambiguous to him whether it was charity or a gift, he would ask about it." Al-Bukhari narrated this from the hadith of Abu Hurairah. It is also narrated that he, peace be upon him, stayed awake one night. One of his wives said to him, "You stayed awake, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Yes, I found a date and feared it might be from charity." A hadith states: "He stayed awake one night. One of his wives said to him, 'You stayed awake, O Messenger of God?' He said, 'Yes, I found a date and ate it, and I feared it might be from charity.'" Ahmad narrated this from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, with a sound chain. In another narration: "...and I feared it might be from charity." From this is what is narrated from some of them that he said: "We were on a journey with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and hunger befell us. We dismounted at a place with many lizards. While the cooking pots were boiling with them, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'A nation from the Children of Israel was transformed. I fear that these might be them.' So we overturned the pots." A hadith states: "We were on a journey with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and hunger befell us. We dismounted at a place with many lizards. While the cooking pots were boiling with them, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'A nation from the Children of Israel was transformed. I fear that these might be them.' So we overturned the pots." Ibn Hibban and Al-Bayhaqi narrated this from the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman and deemed it sound. Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah narrated a hadith of Thabit ibn Zayd similar to it with some differences. Al-Bukhari said: "The hadith of Thabit is more sound." Then God later made it clear that God did not transform a creation and then give it offspring. A hadith states: "God did not transform a creation and then give it offspring." Muslim narrated this from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud. His initial abstention was because the principle is the absence of permissibility, and there was doubt about the slaughter making it permissible. The second category is when permissibility is known, but there is doubt about prohibition. Here, the principle is permissibility, and the ruling is accordingly. For example, if two men married two women and a bird flew by, and one of them said, "If this is a crow, then my wife is divorced," and the other said, "If it is not a crow, then my wife is divorced," and the matter of the bird became ambiguous, then divorce is not decreed for either of them, nor are they required to avoid them. However, scrupulousness dictates avoiding them and divorcing them so that they become lawful for other husbands. Makhul was instructed to avoid in this issue, and Al-Sha'bi gave a fatwa to avoid in the case of two men who disputed, and one said to the other, "You are envious," and the other said, "I am envious of us? His wife is divorced thrice," and the other said, "Yes," and the matter became ambiguous. If this is intended for the avoidance of scrupulousness, it is correct. If it is intended for confirmed prohibition, there is no basis for it, for it is established concerning water, impurities, ritual states, and prayers that certainty is not to be abandoned due to doubt, and this is in its meaning. If you say: "What relevance is there between this and that?" Know that relevance is not required, for it is necessitated without it in some forms. For whenever one is certain of the purity of water then doubts its impurity, it is permissible for him to perform ablution with it, so how could it not be permissible for him to drink it? And if drinking is permitted, it is conceded that certainty is not removed by doubt. However, there is a subtle point here: the analogy for water is that one doubts whether he divorced his wife or not, and it is said the principle is that he did not divorce. The analogy for the issue of the bird is that the impurity of one of the two vessels is confirmed, but its specific identity is ambiguous, so it is not permissible to use either without independent reasoning, because it pits certainty of impurity against certainty of purity, thus nullifying the presumption of continuity. Likewise here, divorce has certainly occurred for one of the two wives, and the identity of the divorced wife is confused with the non-divorced one. We say: The companions of Al-Shafi'i differed concerning the two vessels on three opinions. Some said the presumption of continuity is applied without independent reasoning. Some said after the occurrence of certainty of impurity opposing certainty of purity, avoidance is obligatory and independent reasoning is of no avail. The moderates said independent reasoning is to be used, and this is the correct view. But its analogy is that a man has two wives and says, "If it is a crow, then Zaynab is divorced, and if it is not, then 'Amrah is divorced." Therefore, it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with them based on the presumption of continuity, nor is independent reasoning permissible since there is no indicator, and we prohibit them for him because if he were to have intercourse with them, he would be certainly transgressing into the unlawful. If he were to have intercourse with one of them and say, "I limit myself to this one," he would be arbitrarily specifying her without preference. Herein lies the difference in ruling for a single person or two persons, because prohibition concerning a single person is confirmed, unlike two persons, for each one doubts the prohibition concerning himself. If it is said: "If the vessel belonged to two persons, then independent reasoning should be unnecessary, and each one should perform ablution with his own vessel, for he was certain of its purity and now doubts it." We say: This is plausible in jurisprudence, but the preponderant opinion in my view is prohibition, even if the two persons are distinct here, just as if they were one, because the validity of ablution does not require ownership; rather, a person's ablution with water...

As for another person removing ritual impurity with one's own water, such as performing ablution with one's own water, the effect is not discernible due to the difference or sameness of ownership. This is unlike intercourse with another's wife, for it is unlawful, and because distinguishing marks have a role in matters of impurity, and independent reasoning is possible therein, unlike divorce. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the principle of continuity with a distinguishing mark to counter the strength of certainty of impurity opposing the certainty of purity. The chapters on continuity and preponderant considerations are among the subtleties and intricacies of jurisprudence, which we have exhaustively covered in books of jurisprudence. Our aim now is only to alert to their principles.

The third category is that the original state is prohibition, but something arises that necessitates its permissibility by a predominant assumption, so it is doubtful, and the predominant ruling is its permissibility. This is examined: if the predominance of the assumption is based on a cause considered valid in the Sacred Law, then what we choose is that it is permissible, and avoiding it is from scrupulous piety. An example is one who shoots at game, then it disappears, and later he finds it dead with no mark upon it except his arrow. However, it is possible that it died from a fall or another cause. If a mark of impact or another wound appears on it, it reverts to the first category. There is a difference of opinion in the saying of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, regarding this category. The chosen opinion is that it is lawful because the wound is an apparent cause and has been verified, and the original state is that nothing else has arisen upon it. Its arising is doubtful, so certainty is not abandoned for doubt.

If it is said: Indeed, Ibn 'Abbas said, "Eat what you have stunned, and leave what you have merely wounded." And 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, reported that a man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, with a hare and said, "I shot it, and I recognized my arrow in it." He said, "Did you stun it or merely wound it?" He said, "I merely wounded it." He said, "Verily, the night is a creation from the creations of God; none can measure its extent except the One who created it. Perhaps something assisted in its killing." (The narration from 'A'isha that a man came to the Prophet with a hare and said, "I shot it, I recognized my arrow in it," and he said, "Did you stun it or merely wound it?" He said, "I merely wounded it." He said, "Verily, the night is a creation from the creations of God; none can measure its extent except the One who created it. Perhaps something assisted in its killing something" — this is not from the hadith of 'A'isha. Rather, Musa ibn Abi 'A'isha narrated it from Abu Razin, who said: A man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, with game and said, "I shot it at night, and it eluded me. I found my arrow in it the next day and recognized my arrow." He said, "The night is a creation from the creations of God, immense. Perhaps something assisted you against it." Abu Dawud narrated it in the *Marasil*, and al-Bayhaqi said Abu Razin's name is Mas'ud, and the hadith is *mursal*, as al-Bukhari said.) And likewise, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said to 'Adi ibn Hatim regarding his trained dog, "Even if it eats, do not eat, for I fear it may have caught it for itself." (A hadith: He said to 'Adi regarding his trained dog, "Even if it eats, do not eat, for I fear it may have caught it for itself." Agreed upon from his narration.) The predominant case is that a trained dog does not have a bad nature and does not catch except for its owner, yet he prohibited it.

This is the precise understanding: that permissibility is only verified if the cause is completely verified, and the completeness of the cause is that it leads to death, safe from the arising of anything else upon it. If there is doubt therein, it is doubt in the completeness of the cause, to the point that it is ambiguous whether its death was upon permissibility or prohibition. Thus, this is not in the meaning of what is verified to have died upon permissibility at its moment, then doubt arises regarding what occurs to it afterward.

The answer is that the prohibition of Ibn 'Abbas and the prohibition of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, are understood as pertaining to scrupulous piety and precaution, evidenced by what is narrated in some versions: that he said, "Eat it, even if it disappears from you, as long as you do not find in it a mark other than your arrow." (A hadith: "Eat it, even if it disappears from you, as long as you do not find in it a mark of another's arrow." Agreed upon from the narration of 'Adi ibn Hatim.) This alerts to the meaning we mentioned: that if he finds another mark, then the two causes conflict due to conflicting assumptions. If he finds only his wound, the predominance of the assumption is achieved, and judgment is made based on it according to the principle of continuity, just as judgment is made based on continuity with a solitary report, presumptive analogy, presumptive general texts, and others.

As for the statement of one who says that its death upon permissibility at the moment is not verified, thus being doubt in the cause, it is not so. Rather, the cause is verified, for the wound is the cause of death. The arising of something else is doubted therein. The consensus indicates the soundness of this: that whoever wounds and it disappears, then is found dead, retaliation is obligatory upon the one who wounded it. Indeed, even if it does not disappear, it is possible that its death was due to an internal disturbance, as a human dies suddenly. Thus, retaliation should not be obligatory except by severing the neck or a fatal wound, because internal fatal ailments are not safe from, and because of them a healthy person dies suddenly, and none says this. Yet retaliation is built upon similarity. Likewise, the fetus of a properly slaughtered animal is lawful, though perhaps it died before the slaughter of the mother, not due to her slaughter, or the soul was not breathed into it. The compensation for the fetus is obligatory, though perhaps the soul was not breathed into it, or it had died before the injury due to another cause. But judgment is built upon apparent causes, for the other possibility, if not supported by an indication that indicates, [is not considered].

Upon this, it aligns with illusion and whisperings as we have mentioned, and so too does this matter. As for the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "I fear that he withheld it for himself," then for Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, there are two opinions regarding this scenario. What we choose is ruling it as prohibited, because the cause is contradictory: since the trained dog is like a tool, and the agent withholds for his principal, it becomes lawful; but if the trained one released itself and caught the game, it would not be lawful, because it is conceivable that it hunted for itself. Whenever it sets off at his signal and then eats, the initial setting off indicates that it is in the position of his tool and that it is acting in his agency and representation; and its eating later indicates that it withheld for itself, not for its master. Thus, the indicative cause is contradictory, so the probabilities conflict, and the original ruling is prohibition, which is maintained and not removed by doubt. It is as if a man appointed an agent to buy a slave-girl for him, and the agent bought a slave-girl for him but died before clarifying whether he bought her for himself or for his principal: it is lawful for the principal to have intercourse with her, because the agent had the capacity to purchase for himself and for his principal alike, and there is no preponderant evidence, and the original ruling is prohibition. This attaches to the first category, not the third.

The fourth category is when lawfulness is known, but it is overwhelmingly probable that a prohibited element has arisen due to a cause considered in overwhelming probability according to the Sharia. Then, the presumption of continuity is lifted, and prohibition is decreed, since it has become clear to us that the presumption of continuity is weak and retains no ruling in the face of overwhelming probability. An example is when one's diligent reasoning leads to the impurity of one of two vessels based on a specific sign that necessitates overwhelming probability, thus necessitating the prohibition of drinking from it, just as it necessitated preventing ablution with it. Likewise, if one says, "If Zayd kills 'Amr," or "If Zayd kills game alone by his killing," then "my wife is divorced," and he wounds it and it disappears from him, then he finds it dead, his wife becomes unlawful to him, because the apparent is that he alone killed it, as previously mentioned. And Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, has explicitly stated that whoever finds water in ponds that has changed, it is possible that its change is due to long standing or due to impurity, so he may use it; but if he saw a gazelle urinate in it, then found it changed, and it is possible that it is due to the urine or due to long standing, it is not permissible to use it, for the witnessed urination becomes an overwhelming indication of the probability of impurity. This is an example of what we have mentioned. This concerns overwhelming probability that relies on a sign related to the very essence of the thing. As for overwhelming probability not from the angle of a sign related to the very essence of the thing, the opinion of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, has differed regarding whether the original state of lawfulness is removed by it, as his opinion differed concerning performing ablution from the vessels of polytheists and habitual drunkards, praying in disturbed graves, and praying with street mud—meaning the amount exceeding what is impossible to avoid. The companions expressed it by saying: when the original state and the overwhelming probability conflict, which is to be considered? This applies to the lawfulness of drinking from the vessels of habitual drunkards and polytheists, because the impure is not lawful to drink. Therefore, since the source of impurity and lawfulness is one, hesitation in one necessitates hesitation in the other. What I choose is that the original state is to be considered, and that the sign, if it does not relate to the very essence of what is consumed, does not necessitate lifting the original state. The explanation and proof of this will come in the second source of doubt, which is the doubt of mixing.

Thus, from this, the ruling has become clear regarding something lawful in which there is doubt or probability of a prohibited element arising upon it, and the ruling regarding something prohibited in which there is doubt or probability of a lawful element arising upon it; and the distinction has become clear between a probability that relies on a sign in the very essence of the thing and one that does not rely on it. Everything we have ruled as lawful in these four categories is lawful in the first degree, but precaution is to abandon it. One who proceeds with it is not among the ranks of the God-fearing and the righteous, but among the ranks of the lenient, regarding whom it is not decreed in the legal verdict that they are sinful, disobedient, and deserving of punishment—except what we have attached to the rank of whisperings, for avoiding it is not from piety at all.

The second source of doubt is doubt originating from mixing, which is that the prohibited becomes mixed with the lawful, and the matter becomes confused and indistinguishable. The mixing is either with an uncountable number from both sides or from one side, or with a countable number. If it mixes with a countable number, then it is either a mixing by blending such that it cannot be distinguished by indication, like the mixing of liquids, or a mixing by ambiguity with distinguishability of the entities, like the mixing of slaves, houses, and horses. That which mixes with ambiguity is either something whose very essence is intended, like merchandise, or not intended, like currency. From this division emerge three categories.

The first category is when the very essence becomes ambiguous with a countable number, as if a dead animal is mixed with a properly slaughtered one, or with ten properly slaughtered ones; or a nursing woman is mixed with ten women; or one marries one of two sisters and then they become confused. This is a doubt that must be avoided by consensus, because there is no scope for diligent reasoning and signs in this. When they mix with a countable number, the whole becomes like a single entity, so it confronts...

In this lies the certainty of prohibition and permissibility, and there is no difference in this matter whether permissibility is established and then mixing with something prohibited occurs—as when a divorce is pronounced upon one of two wives in the issue of the bird—or mixing occurs before establishing permissibility—as when a nursing infant is mixed with an unrelated woman and one wishes to establish permissibility with one. This may pose difficulty in the onset of prohibition, such as divorcing one of two wives due to the preceding principle of continuity. We have previously indicated the manner of response, which is that the certainty of prohibition opposes the certainty of permissibility, so the weakness of continuity and the side of prohibition are predominant in the view of the Sacred Law; therefore, it is given preponderance. This applies when a limited permissible thing mixes with a limited prohibited thing. If a limited permissible thing mixes with an unlimited prohibited thing, it is not hidden that the obligation of avoidance is more appropriate. The second category is a limited prohibited thing mixing with an unlimited permissible thing, as when one nursing infant or ten nursing infants mix with the women of a large town; this does not necessitate avoiding marriage with the women of that town, rather one may marry whomever he wishes among them. This cannot be reasoned by the abundance of the permissible, for it would necessitate permitting marriage if one prohibited woman mixes with nine permissible women, and none holds this view. Rather, the reason is both predominance and need together, for whoever loses a nursing infant, a relative, or a prohibited relation through marriage or any other cause, cannot have the door of marriage closed upon him. Likewise, one who knows that worldly wealth is certainly mixed with something prohibited is not obliged to abandon buying and eating, for that is hardship, and there is no hardship in religion. This is known from the fact that when a shield was stolen in the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)—a hadith about a stolen shield in the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) cut off the hand of a thief for a shield worth three dirhams—and when one stole a cloak from the spoils—a hadith about one who stole a cloak from the spoils narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, and the name of the thief was Kurkara—no one refrained from buying shields and cloaks in the world. Likewise, with everything stolen, and it was known that among people are those who engage in usury with dirhams and dinars, yet the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and the people did not abandon dirhams and dinars entirely—a hadith: “Indeed among people are those who engage in usury with dirhams and dinars, and the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and the people did not abandon dirhams entirely” is well-known, and the hadith of Jabir will come after it with a narration that indicates this. In summary, the world is only free from the prohibited if all creation is protected from sins, which is impossible. If this condition is not required for the world, it is also not required for a town unless it occurs among a limited group. Rather, avoiding this is from the scrupulousness of the obsessive, if it is not transmitted from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) nor from any of the Companions, and fulfilling it is inconceivable in any religion or any era. If you say: every number is limited in the knowledge of God, so what is the limit of the limited? If a person wished to limit the people of a town, he could also do so if able. Know that defining such matters is not possible; rather, it is regulated by approximation. Thus we say: any number that, if gathered on one plain, would be difficult for the observer to count by mere sight, such as a thousand or two thousand, is unlimited; and what is easy, such as ten or twenty, is limited. Between the two extremes are intermediate similar cases that are attached to one of the extremes by estimation. Whatever doubt occurs therein, one should seek the fatwa of the heart, for sin is what pricks the hearts. In such a situation, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to Wabisa: “Seek the fatwa of your heart, even if they give you fatwas and give you fatwas and give you fatwas”—a hadith: “Seek the fatwa of your heart, even if they give you fatwas and give you fatwas and give you fatwas,” he said it to Wabisa as previously mentioned. Likewise, the four categories we mentioned in the first example have clear opposing extremes in negation and affirmation, and intermediate similar cases. The mufti gives a fatwa based on estimation, and the seeker must seek the fatwa of his heart. If something stirs in his chest, it is sin between him and God, and the fatwa of the mufti will not save him in the Hereafter, for he gives fatwa based on the apparent, and God takes charge of the hidden matters. The third category is when an unlimited prohibited thing mixes with an unlimited permissible thing, such as the ruling on wealth in our time. One who takes rulings from the outward forms may think that the ratio of the unlimited to the unlimited is like the ratio of the limited to the limited, and we have ruled there with prohibition, so let us rule here with it. What we choose is contrary to that, which is that this mixing does not prohibit consuming a specific thing that may be prohibited or permissible, unless that specific thing is accompanied by a sign indicating it is from the prohibited. If there is no sign in the specific thing indicating it is from the prohibited, then abandoning it is scrupulousness, and taking it is permissible; the eater does not become sinful by it. Among the signs is taking it from the hand of a tyrannical ruler, and so on.

This is among the signs that will be mentioned later, and it is indicated by textual evidence and rational analogy. As for the textual evidence, it is what is known from the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Rightly Guided Caliphs after him. For the prices of intoxicants and the dirhams of usury were in the hands of the *Dhimmis*, intermingled with wealth, and likewise the misappropriation of funds and the misappropriation of war booty. And from the time when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade usury, when he said, "The first usury I abolish is the usury of al-'Abbas." The hadith, "The first usury I abolish is the usury of al-'Abbas," was reported by Muslim from the narration of Jabir. People did not abandon usury altogether, just as they did not abandon drinking intoxicants and other sins. It is even narrated that one of the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be him, sold wine, so 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "May God curse so-and-so; he was the first to institute the sale of wine," for he had not understood that the prohibition of wine entails the prohibition of its price. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, so-and-so is being dragged in the Fire by a cloak he misappropriated." The hadith, "Indeed, so-and-so is in the Fire, being dragged by a cloak he misappropriated," was narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, and it is preceded by three hadiths. And a man was killed, so they searched his belongings and found in them beads from the beads of the Jews, not worth two dirhams, which he had misappropriated. The hadith, "A man was killed, so they searched his belongings and found in them a bead from the beads of the Jews, not worth two dirhams, which he had misappropriated," was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah from the narration of Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani. Likewise, the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, encountered oppressive rulers, and none of them refrained from buying and selling in the market due to the looting of the city—and it was looted by the followers of Yazid for three days. Whoever abstained from those funds was pointed to for his scrupulousness, while the majority did not abstain, given the intermingling and the abundance of looted wealth in the days of oppression. Whoever makes obligatory what the righteous predecessors did not make obligatory, and claims to have perceived an evil they did not perceive, is one afflicted with insinuating whispers and disordered intellect. If it were permissible to add to them in matters like this, it would be permissible to oppose them in issues that have no basis other than their consensus, such as their statement that the grandmother is like the mother in prohibition, and the son's son is like the son, and the hair and fat of the pig are like the meat whose prohibition is mentioned in the Qur'an, and that usury applies to things other than the six specified items. This is impossible, for they are more entitled to understand the Sacred Law than others. As for the rational analogy, it is that if this door were opened, the door to all transactions would be closed and the world would be ruined, for immorality predominates among people, and they become lax because of it regarding the conditions of the Sacred Law in contracts. This inevitably leads to intermingling. If it is said: You have transmitted that he, peace and blessings be upon him, abstained from the *dabb* (spiny-tailed lizard) and said, "I fear it may be from what God has transformed," and it is among intermingling that is not precisely defined. We say: This is interpreted as an act of abstention and scrupulousness, or we say the *dabb* has a strange form that perhaps indicates it is from the transformed creatures; this is an indication regarding the specific item itself. If it is said: This was known in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the time of the Companions due to usury, theft, looting, misappropriation of booty, and others, but these were the minority compared to the lawful. So what do you say about our time, when the unlawful has become the majority of what is in people's hands due to corrupt transactions, neglect of their conditions, the prevalence of usury, and the wealth of oppressive rulers? Whoever takes wealth upon which there is no specific, definitive mark of prohibition regarding it—is it unlawful or not? I say: That is not unlawful; rather, scrupulousness is in leaving it. And this scrupulousness is more important than scrupulousness when the unlawful is little. But the answer to this is that the statement of one who says, "Most wealth is unlawful in our time," is pure error. Its origin is negligence regarding the distinction between 'much' and 'most.' Most people, indeed most jurists, think that what is not rare is 'most,' and they imagine these are two mutually exclusive categories with no third between them. This is not so. Rather, the categories are three: little, which is rare; much; and most. An example is that the hermaphrodite among creation is rare. If the sick person is added to it, it becomes much. Likewise, travel, such that it is said sickness and travel are among the general excuses, and irregular bleeding is among the rare excuses. It is known that sickness is not rare, nor is it 'most' either; rather, it is 'much.' When a jurist is lenient and says sickness and travel are predominant and are a general excuse, he means by this that it is not rare. If he does not mean this, then it is an error. The correct view is that the resident is 'most,' and the traveler and the sick are 'much,' while the woman with irregular bleeding and the hermaphrodite are rare. When this is understood, we say: The statement that the unlawful is 'most' is false. For the basis of this claimant is either the abundance of oppressors and soldiers, or the abundance of usury and corrupt transactions, or the abundance of hands that have successively handled, from the beginning of Islam to our time, the origins of the wealth existing today. As for the first basis...

False, for the oppressor is many, yet he is not the majority. They are the military, since none oppresses save one possessing dominance and might. When compared to the entire world, they do not reach a tenth of a tenth. For every sultan, for instance, who gathers a hundred thousand soldiers, rules a province that encompasses a million and more. Perhaps a single town within his kingdom exceeds the total of his army. If the number of rulers were greater than the subjects, all would perish, since each subject would have to sustain ten of them, for example, while they live in luxury—this is inconceivable. Rather, the sustenance of one of them is collected from a thousand subjects or more. The same applies to thieves, for a large town contains but a few of them.

As for the second premise, the prevalence of usury and corrupt transactions, these too are many but not the majority. Most Muslims conduct their dealings according to the conditions of the Sacred Law, and their number is greater. Even if one were to count the transactions of a single individual dealing in usury or otherwise, the sound ones would outnumber the corrupt, unless one imagines a town specifically characterized by depravity, wickedness, and lack of religion, so that it might be thought his corrupt transactions are more—but such a case is rare. Even if it were common, it is not the majority. How could all his transactions be corrupt when he himself is not devoid of sound transactions that equal or exceed the corrupt? This is certain to one who reflects. This notion prevails in souls only because souls magnify corruption, deem it remote, and consider it immense, even if it is rare—so much so that one might think usury and drinking wine have spread as the forbidden has spread, imagining them to be the majority, which is an error. They are the minority, even if they are numerous.

As for the third premise, which is the most illusory, it is said: wealth is acquired only from minerals, plants, and animals. Plants and animals come into being through reproduction. If we consider a sheep, for example, which gives birth each year, the number of its origins since the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would be nearly five hundred. It is inevitable that usurpation or a corrupt transaction would affect one origin among those origins. How then could their origins remain free from invalid dealings until our time? Likewise, the seeds of grains and fruits require five hundred or a thousand origins, for instance, since the beginning of the era of the Sacred Law, and this cannot be lawful unless its origin and the origin of its origin are lawful back to the beginning of the era of prophethood. As for minerals, they are what can be obtained initially, and they are the least of wealth. Most of what is used from them are dirhams and dinars, which come only from the mint, which is in the hands of oppressors, just as the minerals are in their hands. They prevent people from them and compel the poor to extract them through arduous labor, then take them from them by usurpation. When one reflects on this, he knows that the survival of a single dinar, such that no invalid contract, oppression at the time of acquisition, nor at the time of minting in the mint, nor afterward in transactions of exchange and usury touches it, is remote, rare, or impossible. There would then remain nothing lawful except game, wild herbs in barren deserts and wastelands, and permissible firewood. Yet, whoever acquires it cannot eat it, so he must resort to purchasing grains and animals, which are obtained only through cultivation and reproduction, thus exchanging lawful for unlawful. This is the most deceptive of paths.

The answer is that this predominance did not arise from the abundance of the unlawful mixed with the lawful, so it departs from the pattern we are discussing and joins what we mentioned earlier—the conflict between the origin and the predominant. For the origin in these forms of wealth is their acceptance for transactions and the permissibility of mutual consent regarding them. A predominant cause has opposed it, removing it from suitability for them. This resembles the two opinions of al-Shafi‘i, may God be pleased with him, regarding the ruling on impurities. The correct view according to us is that prayer in the streets is permissible if no impurity is found there, for the soil of the streets is pure; that ablution from the vessels of polytheists is permissible; and that prayer in disturbed graves is permissible. This being established, we then analogize our case to it. This is indicated by the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, performing ablution from the water-skin of a polytheist, and ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, performing ablution from a Christian jar, even though they drink wine and eat pork, and they do not avoid what our law deems impure. How then could their vessels be safe from their hands? Rather, we say we know with certainty that they wore tanned furs, dyed garments, and tailored clothing. Whoever reflects on the conditions of tanners, fullers, and dyers knows that impurity is predominant among them, and purity in those garments is impossible or rare. Rather, we say we know...

They used to eat bread made from wheat and barley without washing it, even though it was trodden upon by cattle and animals that urinated and defecated on it, and rarely was it free from such impurities. They would ride mounts that sweated and did not wash their backs despite their frequent rolling in filth. Indeed, every animal emerges from its mother’s womb with unclean moistures upon it, which rain may or may not remove, yet they did not guard against these. They walked barefoot or with sandals on roads, prayed with them, sat on the ground, and walked through mud without necessity. However, they did not walk in urine or excrement, nor sit upon them, and they avoided such. How could streets be free from impurities given the abundance of dogs and their urine, and the multitude of animals and their droppings? It should not be imagined that eras or cities differed in this regard, to suppose that streets were washed in their time or guarded from animals—far from it! This is known to be impossible by custom without doubt. Thus, it indicates they only avoided visible impurity or a sign indicating actual filth, but did not consider predominant suspicion aroused by returning dirhams to the flow of circumstances. This is according to Imam al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, who holds that a small amount of water becomes impure without visible change, yet the Companions continuously entered bathhouses and performed ablution from basins containing small amounts of water, with various hands constantly dipped in them—a decisive point in this matter. Whenever the permissibility of ablution from a Christian’s jar is established, the permissibility of drinking from it is also established, and the ruling of permissibility aligns with that of impurity. If it is said: permissibility cannot be analogized to impurity because they were lenient in matters of purity and extremely cautious from suspicions of prohibition, how can it be analogized? We reply: if it is meant that they prayed with impurity, and prayer is a pillar of religion, then such suspicion is vile. Rather, we must believe they avoided every impurity that must be shunned, and only showed tolerance where it was not obligatory, and in their tolerance lies this scenario where the original and the predominant conflict. Thus, the predominant not based on a sign related to the specific matter under consideration is discarded. As for their scrupulousness in lawful matters, it was through piety—abandoning what is not blameworthy for fear of what is, because matters of wealth are perilous and the soul inclines to them if not restrained, whereas purity is not so. Indeed, a group among them abstained from purely lawful things fearing it might distract their hearts, and it is narrated that one of them avoided ablution with seawater, which is purely pure. This divergence does not undermine the purpose we agree upon: that we proceed in this evidence with the answer we presented in the two previous evidences. We do not concede their claim that the majority is unlawful, for wealth, though its sources are many, does not necessarily have unlawfulness in its origins. Rather, the wealth existing today is such that injustice has touched the origins of some, not all. Just as what is newly usurped today is less compared to what is not usurped or stolen, so is every wealth in every era and every origin: the usurped portion of worldly wealth and that taken through corruption in every time is less relative to the rest. We do not know which of the two categories this specific branch belongs to, so we do not concede that the predominant is prohibition. For just as the usurped increases through reproduction, so does the non-usurped increase through reproduction, making the branch of the majority inevitably greater in every era and time. Indeed, predominantly, usurped grains are seized for consumption, not for sowing; likewise, most usurped animals are eaten, not kept for reproduction. How then can it be said that the branches of unlawfulness are more numerous, when the origins of the lawful have always been more than the origins of the unlawful? Let the seeker of guidance understand from this the way to recognize the majority, for it is a slippery ground where most scholars err, let alone the common folk. This applies to offspring of animals and grains. As for minerals, they are open and unrestricted; whoever wishes may take them in the lands of the Turks and elsewhere, though rulers may take some from them, or inevitably take the lesser, not the majority. If a ruler seizes a mine and unjustly prevents people from it, then what a taker acquires from it is taken from the ruler for a fee. The correct view is that delegation is permissible in establishing possession over permissible things and hiring for them. Thus, one hired to draw water, when possessing the water, enters the ownership of the one for whom it is drawn and deserves the fee. Likewise, with the Nile. If we base on this, the gold itself is not prohibited unless its injustice is estimated by a deficiency in the work fee, which is little in comparison, and even then it does not necessitate prohibition of the gold itself, but rather the injustice remains as a debt of the fee. As for the mint, it is not...

The gold extracted from it comes from the Sultan's own gold reserves, which he has seized unjustly and through which he oppresses the people. Indeed, merchants bring them cast gold or debased coinage and hire them for the work of casting and minting. They then take back the equivalent weight of what they delivered to them, except for a small amount left as a wage for their labor. This is permissible. If it is stipulated that the dinars struck are from the Sultan's dinars, then relative to the merchants' wealth, it is undoubtedly less. Yes, the Sultan oppresses the workers of the mint by taking a tax from them, because he has singled them out for this from among all other people, so that wealth accrues to them under the Sultan's protection. What the Sultan takes is in exchange for his protection, and this falls under the category of oppression, though it is minor compared to what leaves the mint. Neither the mint workers nor the Sultan receive from the total output more than one part in a hundred, which is a tenth of a tenth. So how could it be the greater portion? These are misconceptions that have preemptively entered hearts through illusion, and a group whose religion has become diluted strives to embellish them, to the point that they have made piety seem ugly, blocked its gate, and deemed it repugnant to distinguish between one wealth and another. That is the very essence of innovation and misguidance.

If it is said: Suppose the dominance of the unlawful is assumed, and what is not limited has become mixed with what is not limited, what would you say concerning it if the tangible item possessed no specific distinguishing mark? We say what we hold: to leave it is an act of piety, and to take it is not unlawful, because the default ruling is permissibility, and it is not lifted except by a specific indicator, as with the mud of the streets and similar cases. Rather, I go further and say: If the unlawful were to cover the entire world until it was known with certainty that no lawful remains in the world, I would say: We recommence establishing the conditions from our time and pardon what has passed, and we say: Whatever exceeds its limit reverts to its opposite. Therefore, whenever the entirety becomes forbidden, the entirety becomes permissible. Its proof is that if this situation occurs, the possibilities are five:

First, it could be said: People should refrain from eating until they all perish.
Second, they restrict themselves to the measure of necessity and sustaining life, prolonging their days until death.
Third, it could be said: They take according to need as they wish—through theft, usurpation, and mutual consent—without distinction between one wealth and another, or one source and another.
Fourth, they follow the conditions of the Sacred Law and recommence its rules without restriction to the measure of need.
Fifth, they restrict themselves to the measure of need while adhering to the conditions of the Sacred Law in acquisition from those in possession.

As for the first, its invalidity is evident.
As for the second, it is absolutely invalid, because if people restrict themselves to sustaining life and prolong their time in weakness, death would become widespread among them, works and crafts would cease, and the world would be utterly ruined. In the ruin of the world lies the ruin of religion, for it is the cultivation ground for the Hereafter. The rulings of caliphate, judiciary, and governance—indeed, most rulings of jurisprudence—aim to preserve worldly interests so that religious interests may be accomplished thereby.

As for the third, which is restricting to the measure of need without exceeding it, while equating between one wealth and another through anger, theft, and mutual consent however it occurs, this removes the barrier of the Sacred Law between the corrupt and types of corruption. Thus, hands would stretch out in usurpation, theft, and various forms of oppression, and they cannot be deterred from it, for they would say: The possessor has no greater entitlement than us, for it is forbidden to him and to us. The possessor only has the measure of need. If he is in need, we are also in need. If what I have taken from what is rightfully mine exceeds need, then I have stolen it from one who has more than his need for that day. If the need of the day and the year is not observed, then what are we to observe, and how can it be regulated? This leads to the nullification of the governance of the Sacred Law and the incitement of the corrupt to corruption.

Thus, nothing remains except the fourth possibility, which is to say: Everyone who has possession of what is in his hand has the greatest right to it. It is not permissible to take it from him by theft or usurpation, but rather it is taken with his consent. Mutual consent is the way of the Sacred Law. Since it is only permissible through mutual consent, mutual consent also has a methodology in the Sacred Law upon which interests depend. If this is not considered, then the very principle of mutual consent is not specified and its details are nullified.

As for the fifth possibility, which is restricting to the measure of need while acquiring through the way of the Sacred Law from those in possession, this is what we see as befitting piety for one who wishes to tread the path of the Hereafter. However, there is no basis for making it obligatory upon all, nor for including it in a general legal verdict, because the hands of oppressors stretch to take what exceeds the measure of need from people's hands, as do the hands of thieves. Everyone who prevails seizes, and everyone who finds an opportunity steals, saying: He has no right except to the measure of need, and I am in need. Nothing would remain except that it becomes obligatory upon the Sultan to extract every excess beyond the measure of need from the hands of owners and distribute it fully to those in need, circulating wealth to all daily or yearly. This involves an excessive imposition and waste of wealth. As for the excessive imposition, it is that the Sultan is incapable of undertaking this given the multitude...

Creation? Nay, it is inconceivable altogether. As for wastefulness, it is that surplus beyond need from fruits, meats, and grains ought to be thrown into the sea or left to rot. For what God has created of fruits and grains exceeds the measure of people’s comfort and luxury, let alone the measure of their need. This would then lead to the abandonment of pilgrimage, alms‑giving, financial expiations, and every act of worship tied to sufficiency from others—if people were to possess only what meets their needs—and that is utterly repugnant. Indeed, I say: were a prophet to arise in such an age, it would be incumbent upon him to renew the order and establish in detail the means of property through mutual consent and other lawful channels, doing what he would do if he found all wealth lawful without distinction. By my saying “incumbent upon him,” I mean if the prophet is one sent for the welfare of creation in their religion and their worldly life, for well‑being is not achieved by reducing all people to the level of bare necessity and need. If he were not sent for welfare, this would not be obligatory. We allow that God may ordain a cause by which He destroys creation utterly, so that they lose their worldly life and go astray in their religion; for He leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills, and He gives death and gives life. But we suppose matters to proceed according to God’s established custom in sending prophets for the welfare of religion and the world. Why should I suppose this when what I suppose has already occurred? For God sent our Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—after an interval without messengers, and the law of Jesus—peace be upon him—had elapsed nearly six hundred years earlier. People were divided between those who denied him—from the Jews and idol‑worshippers—and those who affirmed him, while immorality had spread among them just as it has spread in our time now. Unbelievers were addressed with the branches of the law, and wealth was in the hands of both those who denied him and those who affirmed him. As for the deniers, they transacted without the law of Jesus—peace be upon him. As for the affirmers, they were lax in the very essence of affirmation, just as Muslims are lax now, even though the era of prophecy was closer. Thus all wealth, or most of it, or much of it, was unlawful—peace be upon him—yet he overlooked what had passed and did not investigate it, confirming owners in their possessions and establishing the law. What was established as unlawful in a previous law does not become lawful by the coming of a messenger, nor does it become lawful merely because the one holding unlawful wealth submits. For we do not take from the protected non‑Muslims in the poll‑tax what we know specifically to be the price of wine or usurious wealth; their wealth in that time was like our wealth today. The case of the Arabs was more severe due to the prevalence of plunder and raiding among them. Thus it becomes clear that the fourth probability is the one to be adopted in legal opinion, and the fifth probability is the path of scrupulousness—indeed, complete scrupulousness is to limit oneself in permissible things to the measure of need and to abandon worldly expansion entirely, and that is the path of the hereafter. But we are now speaking of jurisprudence tied to the welfare of creation, and the apparent legal opinion has its rule and method according to the demands of welfare, while the path of religion is one that only rare individuals can tread. If all of creation were to occupy themselves with it, order would collapse and the world would be ruined, for that is seeking a great kingdom in the hereafter. And if all creation were to occupy themselves with seeking the kingdom of this world and abandon lowly trades and base crafts, order would collapse, and with its collapse the kingdom would also perish. The craftsmen are only subjugated so that the kingdom may be orderly for kings; likewise, those who turn toward the world are subjugated so that the path of religion may remain safe for the people of religion—which is the kingdom of the hereafter. Were it not for that, even the religion of the people of religion would not be safe. The condition for the safety of their religion is that the majority turn away from their path and busy themselves with worldly affairs. That is a division decreed by the eternal will, alluded to in His saying—Exalted is He: “We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees that some may take others in service.” If it is said: There is no need to suppose universal prohibition so that nothing lawful remains, for that is not the case and is known; there is no doubt that some is unlawful, but whether that portion is the lesser or the greater is debatable. What you have mentioned—that it is the lesser in relation to the whole—is clear, but there must be a definitive proof for permitting it, not from unrestricted considerations of welfare. All the divisions you have mentioned are unrestricted considerations of welfare, so they require a specific precedent to be analogized from, so that the proof may be accepted by consensus—for some scholars do not accept unrestricted considerations of welfare. I say: If it is conceded that the unlawful is the lesser portion, then the era of the Messenger of God—peace and blessings be upon him—and the Companions suffices as proof, despite the existence of usury, theft, misappropriation, and plunder. And if an age is supposed in which the greater portion is unlawful, consumption is still lawful. Its proof is three matters: first, the division we have enumerated and from which we have invalidated…

Four, and we have established the fifth category, for that, when applied to situations where everything is prohibited, is even more applicable when the prohibition is the majority or the minority. As for the statement of one who says it is an unrestricted interest (maslahah mursalah): that is delusion. For that is only imagined by those who imagine it in matters of conjecture, while this is certain. Indeed, we do not doubt that the welfare of religion and the world is intended by the Sacred Law, and this is known by necessity, not by conjecture. Nor is there doubt that forcing all people to the level of necessity, need, or mere herbs and hunting would ruin the world first, and religion secondarily through the world. Therefore, what is not doubted does not need a foundational proof to testify for it; evidence is only sought for imagined conjectures related to specific individuals.

The second proof is to reason with a precise analogy (qiyas muharrar) referred back to a principle upon which jurists familiar with partial analogies agree, even if the particulars are considered insignificant by scholars in comparison to the universal matter we mentioned, such as the necessity of the Prophet—had he been sent in a time when prohibition became universal—so that ruling otherwise would have ruined the world. The precise partial analogy is that when a principle and a predominant indicator conflict in matters where specific signs are absent and which are not limited, judgment is given according to the principle, not the predominant indicator, by analogy to the mud in streets, the jar of a Christian, and the vessels of polytheists. This we have previously established through the actions of the Companions. Our statement "specific signs are absent" excludes vessels open to juristic reasoning, and our statement "not limited" excludes the confusion of carrion and a nursing animal with a properly slaughtered animal and a foreigner.

If it is said: The purity of water is certain and is the principle, but who concedes that the principle regarding wealth is permissibility? Rather, the principle is prohibition. We say: Matters are not prohibited due to a quality inherent in their essence; the prohibition of wine and swine is because they were created with a quality predisposing them to accept transactions by mutual consent, just as water was created predisposed for ablution. Doubt has arisen regarding the nullification of this predisposition in them, so there is no difference between the two matters. For they exit from accepting transactions by mutual consent due to the entry of injustice upon them, just as water exits from accepting ablution due to the entry of impurity upon it, and there is no difference between the two matters.

The second answer: Possession (al-yad) is an apparent indication signifying ownership, occupying the position of presumption of continuity (istishab) and stronger than it, as evidenced by the Sacred Law equating it thereto. For if someone claims a debt against another, the statement is his because the principle is the innocence of his responsibility—this is presumption of continuity. And if someone claims ownership of what is in his hand, the statement is also his, establishing possession as taking the place of presumption of continuity. Therefore, whatever is found in a person's hand, the principle is that it is his property unless indicated otherwise by a specific sign.

The third proof is that everything that indicates a genus which is not limited and does not indicate a specific instance is not considered, even if certain; thus, it is clear that if it indicates by way of conjecture, it is even less considered. Its explanation: What is known to be Zaid's property, his right prevents disposal of it without his permission. But if it is known that it has an owner in the world, yet despair arises of ascertaining him or his heir, then it is wealth reserved for the interests of the Muslims, and disposal of it is permitted by ruling of interest. If it indicates that it has an owner limited to ten or twenty, for example, disposal of it by ruling of interest is prohibited. Therefore, one who doubts whether it has an owner other than the possessor is no different from one who is absolutely certain it has an owner but does not know his identity; so disposal of it by interest should be permitted. And the interest is what we mentioned in the five categories, so this principle testifies for it. How could it not, when every lost property whose owner is missing is spent by the ruler on interests, and among the interests are the poor and others? If he spends it on a poor person, it becomes his property, and his disposal of it is effective, such that if a thief steals it from him, his hand is cut off. How could his disposal of another's property be effective? That is only due to our ruling that the interest requires the property to transfer to him and become lawful for him, so we rule according to the requirement of interest.

If it is said: That is specific to the ruler's disposal of it. We say: The ruler is not permitted to dispose of another's property without his permission; he has no cause except interest, which is that if left, it would be wasted, so it is oscillating between wasting it and spending it on something important, and spending it on something important is more beneficial than wasting, so it is given preference. The interest in what is doubted and its prohibition unknown is to rule in it by the indication of possession and leave it with the possessors, for seizing it based on doubt and obliging them to restrict themselves to necessity leads to the harm we mentioned. The aspects of interest differ, for the ruler sometimes sees the interest as building a bridge with that wealth, sometimes spending it on the soldiers of Islam, sometimes on the poor, and it revolves with the interest however it revolves. Likewise, legal verdicts in such matters revolve on interest. From this, it is concluded that people are not held accountable regarding specific properties based on conjectures that do not...

It relies on a specific indication within the dominion of entities, just as the ruler and the needy who take from him are not held accountable based on their knowledge that the property has an owner, since that knowledge is not attached to a specific, indicated owner. There is no difference between the specific owner and the specific properties in this meaning. This clarifies the doubt of intermingling, and nothing remains except to examine the mixing of liquids, dirhams, and merchandise in the possession of a single owner, which will be explained in the chapter detailing the method of extrication from injustices.

The third source of doubt is that it connects to the permissible cause with a sin, either in its concomitants, its consequences, its antecedents, or its substitute, and it is from those sins which do not necessitate the invalidation of the contract and nullification of the permissible cause. An example of sin in the concomitants: selling at the time of the call to prayer on Friday, slaughtering with a usurped knife, gathering firewood with a usurped axe, and selling upon the sale of another or bidding upon his bid. For every prohibition that pertains to contracts but does not indicate the invalidity of the contract, abstaining from all of that is scrupulousness, even if what is acquired through these methods is not ruled as forbidden. To name this type 'doubt' involves some leniency in terminology, because 'doubt' is mostly used to intend confusion and ignorance, and there is no confusion here; rather, the sin of slaughtering with another's knife is known, and the permissibility of the slaughtered animal is also known. However, 'doubt' can be derived from 'resemblance,' and partaking of what results from these matters is disliked, and dislike resembles prohibition. If by 'doubt' this is intended, then naming this 'doubt' has some basis; otherwise, it should be called 'dislike,' not 'doubt.' When the meaning is understood, there is no contention over names, for it is the custom of jurists to be lenient in terminology.

Then know that this dislike has three degrees: The first of them approaches the forbidden, and scrupulousness from it is important. The last ends in a kind of exaggeration that nearly joins the scrupulousness of the obsessive, and between them are intermediates leaning towards the two extremes. Thus, the dislike in hunting with a usurped dog is more severe than in slaughtering with a usurped knife or hunting with a usurped arrow, for the dog has choice, and there is disagreement over whether the yield belongs to the dog's owner or the hunter. Next to it is like sowing seed in usurped land, for the crop belongs to the owner of the seed, but there is some doubt in it. If we affirmed a right of detention for the landowner over the crop, it would be like unlawful price, but the more analogically sound view is that no right of detention is established, just as if one ground with a usurped mill or hunted with a usurped net, for the right of the net's owner in its utility does not attach to the game. Next is gathering firewood with a usurped axe, then slaughtering one's own animal with a usurped knife, for no one has gone so far as to prohibit the slaughtered animal. Next is selling at the time of the call to prayer, for its connection to the objective of the contract is weak, even though some have held the contract invalid, since it only involves being occupied with selling over another obligation incumbent upon him. If a sale were invalidated by such a reason, then the sale of everyone who owes a dirham of zakat, or a missed prayer whose obligation is immediate, or who has a small injustice of a daniq in his liability would be invalidated, for being occupied with selling prevents him from fulfilling obligations. For Friday prayer, the obligation only exists after the call, and this would lead to the invalidity of marriage for the children of oppressors and everyone who has a dirham in his liability, because he was occupied by his speech over the action obligatory upon him, except insofar as a specific prohibition for Friday has been transmitted, which may suggest to minds a specificity in it, making the dislike more severe. There is no harm in being cautious of it, but it can lead to obsession until one feels constrained from marrying the daughters of those who commit injustices and all dealings with them. It is narrated from someone that he bought something from a man, then heard that he had bought it on Friday, so he returned it, fearing it might be from what was bought at the time of the call. This is the ultimate exaggeration, for he rejected it based on mere suspicion. Such conjecture in estimating prohibitions or invalidators does not cease, be it Saturday or other days. Scrupulousness is good, and exaggeration in it is better, but up to a known limit, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The extremists are ruined" – the hadith "The extremists are ruined" was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and it was mentioned earlier in the principles of creed. So one must beware of such exaggerations, for even if they do not harm their practitioner, they may suggest to others that such a thing is important, then he fails at what is easier than it and abandons the foundation of scrupulousness. This is what most people in our time rely upon, for the path has been constricted for them, so they despair of upholding it and cast it away. Just as the obsessive in purification may become incapable of purification and abandon it, likewise some obsessive regarding the lawful – it occurs to their imaginations that all worldly wealth is forbidden, so they become lax and abandon discernment, which is the essence of misguidance.

As for the example of consequences: it is any transaction that leads in its course to sin, and the highest of it is selling grapes to a wine-maker and selling a slave to...

Known as corruption with youths and selling a sword to highway robbers, scholars have differed regarding the validity of such transactions and the permissibility of the price taken from them. The most analogically sound opinion is that it is valid, and what is taken is lawful, though the man is sinful for his contract, just as one sins by slaughtering with a stolen knife—the slaughtered animal is lawful, but he sins through the sin of aiding in disobedience, as this is not intrinsically tied to the contract itself. What is taken from this is strongly disliked, and abstaining from it is an important aspect of scrupulous piety, though it is not unlawful. Following this in rank is selling grapes to one who drinks wine but is not a vintner, and selling a sword to one who wages war and commits oppression, because the possibility of misuse is present. The early pious predecessors disliked selling swords during times of civil strife, fearing it might be purchased by an oppressor. This is a higher level of scrupulous piety than the first, and the dislike in it is lighter. Next is what is an exaggeration and nearly borders on obsessive scrupulosity, which is the saying of a group that it is not permissible to transact with farmers for plowing tools, because they use them to aid in cultivation and sell food to oppressors, and that cows, fields, and plowing tools should not be sold to them. This is the scrupulosity of obsession, as it leads to not selling food to a farmer because he gains strength from it for cultivation, and not drawing from public water for that purpose. This reaches the limit of extremism, which is prohibited. Everyone who turns toward something with the intention of good inevitably goes to excess unless restrained by verified knowledge. He may even advance to what becomes an innovation in religion, harming people after him, while he thinks he is occupied with good. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like my superiority over the lowest of my companions." The extremists are those who are feared to be among those about whom it was said, "Those whose efforts are lost in worldly life while they think they are doing well." In summary, a person should not occupy himself with the subtleties of scrupulous piety except in the presence of a proficient scholar, for if he goes beyond what is outlined and proceeds according to his own mind without hearing from scholars, what he corrupts is more than what he rectifies. It is narrated from Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, may God be pleased with him, that he burned his vineyard fearing that grapes would be sold to one who would make them into wine. I do not know any justification for this unless he knew a specific reason necessitating burning. If he burned his vineyard and palm trees, who among the Companions was of higher status than him? If this were permissible, it would be permissible to cut off the private parts for fear of fornication, and cut off the tongue for fear of lying, and so on to other forms of destruction. As for preliminary matters through which sin may enter, they have three levels: The highest level, in which dislike is severe, is what leaves its trace in what is consumed, such as eating from a sheep fed with usurped fodder or grazed in unlawful pasture, for that is a sin, as it was a cause for its sustenance, and perhaps what remains of its blood, flesh, and parts is from that fodder. This scrupulous piety is important, though not obligatory, and this is transmitted from a group of the early predecessors. Abu 'Abdullah al-Tusī al-Tarughandī had a sheep he would carry on his neck every day to the desert, grazing it while he prayed, and he would drink from its milk. He was negligent for a moment, and it took from the leaves of a vineyard on the edge of a garden, so he left it in the garden and did not deem it lawful to take it. If it is said: It is narrated from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar and 'Ubaydullah that they bought camels and sent them to the protected pasture, and their camels grazed until they became fat. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Did you graze them in the protected pasture?" They said, "Yes," so he shared with them. This indicates that he considered the meat produced from the fodder to belong to the owner of the fodder, so would this necessitate prohibition? We say: It is not so, for the fodder is consumed and the meat is a new creation, not the very substance of the fodder, so there is no legal partnership for the owner of the fodder. Rather, 'Umar compensated them for the value of the pasture and considered that like a share of the camels, taking the share through independent reasoning, just as Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas shared his wealth when he arrived from Kufa, and similarly he shared with Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, when he saw that all of that was not deserved by the worker and considered half of it sufficient for their right of work, estimating the half through independent reasoning. The middle level is what is transmitted from Bishr ibn al-Harith, that he refrained from water channeled in a river dug by oppressors, because the river delivers it to him and God was disobeyed in its digging. Another refrained from grapes of a vineyard irrigated with water flowing in a river dug unjustly, and this is higher and more profound in scrupulous piety. Another refrained from drinking from public works of rulers on the roads, and higher than that is Dhū al-Nūn's refraining from lawful food that reached him through the hand of a jailer, saying, "It came to me through the hand of an oppressor." The degrees of this level are innumerable. The third level, which is close to obsession and exaggeration, is to refrain from lawful things that reached one through a man who disobeyed God through fornication or slander, but it is not as if he disobeyed by consuming the unlawful.

For the nourishment derived from unlawful food, adultery, and slander does not produce a strength that aids in carrying burdens. Rather, abstaining from taking what is lawful when it comes through the hands of a disbeliever or one afflicted with whispers is contrary to consuming the unlawful, since disbelief is not connected to the carrying of food. This leads to not taking from the hand of one who has disobeyed God, even if by backbiting or lying, which is the height of extremism and excess. Therefore, one should adhere to what is known of the scrupulousness of Dhul-Nun and Bishr regarding sin in the means of conveyance, like a river, and the strength of the hand acquired from unlawful food. If one were to refrain from drinking from a cup because the potter who made it had once disobeyed God by striking or insulting a person, this would be a whisper. And if one were to abstain from the meat of a sheep driven by one who consumes unlawful food, this is even more remote than the hand of the jailer, because food is driven by the jailer's strength, while the sheep walks by itself, and the driver only prevents it from straying from the path. This is close to being a whisper. See how we have progressed in explaining what these matters lead to, and know that all of this is outside the legal verdicts of the scholars of the apparent meaning. For the jurist's verdict pertains primarily to the first degree that can be obligated upon the general public; if they all adhered to it, the world would not be ruined, unlike the scrupulousness of the God-fearing and the righteous. The verdict in this is what the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to Wabisa: "Consult your heart, even if they give you verdicts and give you verdicts and give you verdicts." And this is known from his saying, "Sin is that which wavers in the heart." The hadith "Sin is that which wavers in the heart" was mentioned earlier in the Book of Knowledge. Everything that causes unease in the seeker's chest from these causes—if he proceeds with it while feeling that unease in his heart, it will strike him and darken his heart according to the unease he feels. Indeed, even if he proceeds with something unlawful in God's knowledge while believing it lawful, it does not affect the hardness of his heart. But if he proceeds with what is lawful according to the verdicts of the scholars of the apparent meaning, yet he feels unease in his heart, that harms him. What we mentioned regarding the prohibition of exaggeration was intended to show that the pure, balanced heart is the one that feels no unease in such matters. If the heart of one afflicted with whispers deviates from balance and feels unease, and he proceeds despite what he feels in his heart, that harms him because he is held accountable for himself between him and God Almighty by the verdict of his own heart. Similarly, one afflicted with whispers regarding purification and prayer intention is burdened: if it dominates his heart that water did not reach all parts of his body in three washes due to the dominance of whispers, he must perform a fourth, and that becomes a ruling for him, even if he is mistaken in himself. Those are a people who were strict, so God was strict with them. Therefore, He was strict with the people of Moses, peace be upon him, when they were exhaustive in questioning about the cow. Had they initially taken the general term 'cow' and whatever the name applies to, it would have sufficed them. So do not neglect these subtleties we have reiterated by negation and affirmation, for whoever does not grasp the essence of the speech and does not comprehend its totality is likely to slip in understanding its objectives. As for sin in compensation, it also has degrees. The highest degree, in which dislike is severe, is when one buys something on credit and pays its price from usurped or unlawful wealth. Consider: if the seller delivers the food before receiving the price with a content heart, and one eats it before paying the price, it is lawful, and abstaining is not obligatory by consensus—I mean before paying the price—nor is it from emphasized scrupulousness. If he pays the price after eating from unlawful wealth, it is as if he did not pay the price at all, for he would still be bearing the injustice by leaving his liability pledged for the debt, and that does not become unlawful. If he pays the price from unlawful wealth and the seller absolves him while knowing it is unlawful, his liability is cleared, and nothing remains upon him except the injustice of his disposal of the unlawful money by giving it to the seller. If the seller absolves him assuming the price is lawful, absolution is not achieved because he absolves him of what he took as an absolution of collection, and that is not valid for fulfillment. This is the ruling for the buyer, eating from it, and the liability. If it is not delivered with a content heart but he takes it and eats it, it is unlawful whether he eats it before fulfilling the price from unlawful wealth or after, because what the verdict indicates is the establishment of the seller's right of retention until his ownership is confirmed by receiving cash, just as the buyer's ownership is confirmed. The right of retention is nullified either by absolution or fulfillment, and neither has occurred, but he ate his own property while being disobedient in doing so, like the disobedience of one who pledges food if he eats it without the pledgee's permission. There is a difference between this and eating another's food, but the root prohibition encompasses all of this if he takes possession before fulfilling the price, whether with the seller's content heart or not. As for if he fulfills the unlawful price first then takes possession, if the seller knows the price is unlawful and still delivers the sold item, his right of retention is voided, and the price remains for him.

In his liability, if what he took is not a price and does not render the consumption of the sold item unlawful due to the remaining price, then if he did not know it was unlawful and it was such that had he known, he would not have consented to it nor handed over the sold item, his right of detention is not invalidated by this deception, so consuming it is unlawful, with the prohibition of consuming it being like that of a pawn until he absolves him or pays from lawful means, or he himself consents to the unlawful and absolves, whereby his absolution is valid but his consent to the unlawful is not. This is the requirement of jurisprudence and the clarification of the ruling in the first degree of permissibility and prohibition. As for abstaining from it, it is from important piety, because when sin gains control over the means leading to something, the dislike intensifies therein as previously mentioned, and the strongest of connecting means is the price. Were it not for the unlawful price, God would not have been pleased with the seller delivering it to him, so his consent does not remove it from being disliked with intense dislike, but integrity is not broken by it, and the degree of God-consciousness and piety vanishes by it. If a ruler, for example, bought a garment or land on credit and received it with the seller's consent before fulfilling the price, and gave it as a gift or robe of honor to a jurist or other, while doubting whether he would pay its price from lawful or unlawful means, this is lighter since doubt occurred regarding the intrusion of sin into the price, and its lightness varies according to the abundance or scarcity of the unlawful in that ruler's wealth and what is most probable therein, some being more severe than others, and recourse therein is to what flashes in the heart. The middle rank is that the compensation not be usurped nor unlawful, but it facilitates sin, as if he gave as compensation for the price grapes, and the recipient is a wine-drinker, or a sword and he is a highwayman—this does not necessitate unlawfulness in a sale purchased on credit, but entails dislike less than the dislike in usurpation, and the degrees of this rank also vary according to the prevalence or rarity of sin over the recipient of the compensation. Whenever the compensation is unlawful, giving it is unlawful, even if its prohibition is probable but permitted based on presumption, then giving it is disliked, and upon this descends, in my view, the prohibition against the cupper's earnings and its dislike. The hadith prohibiting the cupper's earnings and its dislike: narrated by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari, and al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with two sound chains: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited the cupper's earnings." And in al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Juhaifah: "He prohibited the price of blood." And in Muslim from the hadith of Rafi' ibn Khadij: "The cupper's earnings are vile, for he, peace be upon him, prohibited it several times, then ordered that the draft camel be fed." Hadith: "He prohibited it several times, then ordered that the draft camel be fed," narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Muhayyisah that he sought the Prophet's permission, peace and blessings be upon him, for hiring a cupper, and he forbade him from it, and he kept asking and seeking permission until he said: "Feed it to your draft camel and give it to your slaves to eat." And in a narration by Ahmad, he rebuked him for his earnings and said: "Shall I not feed it to my orphans?" He said: "No." He said: "Shall I not give it in charity?" He said: "No." Then he permitted him to feed it to his draft camel. What first comes to mind that its cause is direct contact with impurity and filth is invalid, for it would necessarily apply to the tanner and the sweeper, and none says so, and if said, it cannot be applied to the butcher, for how can his earnings be disliked when it is an exchange for meat, and meat in itself is not disliked, and the butcher's contact with impurity is more than that of the cupper and phlebotomist, for the cupper takes blood with the cupping instrument and wipes it with cotton. But the cause is that in cupping and phlebotomy there is destruction of the animal's constitution and extraction of its blood, by which its life is sustained, and the original ruling therein is prohibition, and it is only permitted by necessity and the learning of need, and necessity is estimated by conjecture and diligence, and perhaps one thinks it beneficial while it is harmful, so it is unlawful before God Almighty, but it is judged permissible based on presumption and conjecture, and therefore the phlebotomist may not perform phlebotomy on a child, a slave, or an insane person except with the permission of their guardian and the statement of a physician. Were it not lawful in appearance, he, peace be upon him, would not have given the cupper's fee. Hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, gave the cupper's fee," agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Abbas. And were it not that it potentially entails prohibition, he would not have prohibited it, so reconciliation between his giving it and his prohibiting it is only possible by deducing this meaning, and this we should have mentioned among the indications attached to the cause, for it is closer to it. The lowest rank is the degree of the scrupulous, which is that a person swears not to wear from his mother's spinning, then she sells her spinning and buys a garment with it—there is no dislike in this, and piety regarding it is scrupulosity. And it is reported from al-Mughirah that he said regarding this incident: "It is not permissible," and he cited as evidence that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God cursed the Jews, for intoxicants were made unlawful for them, so they sold them and consumed their prices." The hadith of al-Mughirah that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, cursed the Jews when intoxicants were made unlawful for them, so they sold them: I did not find it exactly thus, and what is known is that it is in...

As for fats, in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Jabir: "May Allah fight the Jews! When Allah prohibited for them the fats of their (sacrificial animals), they rendered it (into oil), then sold it and consumed its price." This is an error, because the sale of intoxicants is invalid, as no benefit remains for intoxicants in the Sacred Law, and the price from an invalid sale is unlawful. This is not like that. Rather, the example of this is that a man owns a slave-girl who is his sister through milk kinship, then she is sold for a foreign slave-girl. No one is to show scruple from it. Comparing that to the sale of intoxicants is the utmost extravagance in this regard. We have already known all the degrees and the manner of gradation among them, even though the disparity of these degrees is not confined to three or four, nor to a specific number. But the purpose of enumeration is approximation and facilitation of understanding.

If it is said: It has been narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams, among which is one dirham that is unlawful, Allah will not accept his prayer as long as he is wearing it." The hadith, "Whoever buys a garment for ten dirhams..." the hadith has preceded in the chapter before it. Then Ibn 'Umar inserted his two fingers into his ears and said, "They have become deaf if I did not hear it from him." We say: That is understood to apply when one buys for ten specific dirhams, not as a debt obligation. When one buys on a debt obligation, we have ruled it unlawful in most scenarios, so let it be understood accordingly. Then, how many an ownership is threatened with the prevention of prayer's acceptance due to a sin that has entered its cause, even if that does not indicate the invalidity of the contract? Like one who purchases at the time of the call to prayer and other such.

The fourth point of contention is the disagreement in evidences. For that is like disagreement in the cause, because the cause is a cause for the ruling of permissibility and prohibition, and the evidence is a cause for knowing permissibility and prohibition. So it is the cause in terms of knowledge, and it is not established for the knowledge of another, so there is no benefit in its establishment in itself, even if its cause runs in the knowledge of Allah. It is either due to the conflict of legal evidences, or the conflict of indicative signs, or the conflict of similarities.

The first category: That legal evidences conflict, such as the conflict of two general texts from the Qur'an or the Sunnah, or the conflict of two analogies, or the conflict of an analogy and a general text. All of that produces doubt, and one reverts in it to the presumption of continuity or the known original state if there is no preponderance. If preponderance appears on the side of prohibition, it is obligatory to adopt it. If it appears on the side of permissibility, it is permissible to adopt it, but scrupulousness is to leave it. Avoiding points of disagreement is important in scrupulousness for the jurist and the follower. Even though the follower is permitted to act upon the fatwa given to him by the scholar he follows, whom he believes is the best scholar of his land, and he knows that by common report, just as one knows the best doctors of the land by common report and circumstantial evidence, even if he is not skilled in medicine. It is not for the questioner to pick from the schools the most accommodating one for him. Rather, it is upon him to research until he is predominantly of the opinion that it is the best, then he follows it, not opposing it at all. Yes, if his Imam gives him a fatwa on something, and his Imam has an opponent in it, then fleeing from disagreement to consensus is from emphasized scrupulousness. Likewise, the independent jurist, when evidences conflict for him and he preponderates the side of permissibility by intuition, conjecture, and presumption, then scrupulousness for him is avoidance. Indeed, the jurists would issue fatwas permitting things they would never themselves engage in, out of scrupulousness from them and caution from the doubt within them.

Let us also divide this into three levels. The first level is that in which the recommendation of scrupulous avoidance is emphasized. It is that in which the evidence of the opponent is strong and the aspect of preponderance of the other school over it is subtle. Among the important matters is scrupulous avoidance from the prey of a trained dog if it has eaten from it, even if the jurist issues a fatwa that it is lawful, because the preponderance in it is ambiguous. We have chosen that it is unlawful, and it is the more correct of the two sayings of Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him. Whenever a new saying of Al-Shafi'i is found agreeing with the school of Abu Hanifah, may Allah have mercy on him, or other Imams, scrupulousness in it is important, even if the jurist issues a fatwa with the other saying. From that is scrupulous avoidance from that over which the name of Allah was omitted, even if Al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, did not differ in its ruling, because the verse is clear in its obligation and the reports are recurrent concerning it. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to everyone who asked him about hunting, "If you release your trained dog and have mentioned the name of Allah over it, then eat." The hadith, "If you release your dog and mention the name of Allah, then eat," is agreed upon from the hadith of 'Adi ibn Hatim and from the hadith of Abu Tha'labah Al-Khushani. That has been transmitted repeatedly. The fame of slaughter with the Basmalah: The hadith on mentioning the name at slaughter is agreed upon from the hadith of Rafi' ibn Khadij: "What causes the blood to flow and the name of Allah is mentioned over it, then eat, but not the tooth and the claw." All of that strengthens the evidence for the condition. But since his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, is authentic: "The believer slaughters in the name of Allah, whether he mentions the name or not." The author said it is authentic. I say: It is not known with this wording, let alone being authentic. Abu Dawud in the Marasil has from the narration of Al-Salt, raised to the Prophet: "The slaughter of a Muslim is lawful, whether he mentions the name of Allah or not." And Al-Tabarani...

In Al-Awsat, Al-Daraqutni, Ibn 'Adi, and Al-Bayhaqi, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: A man said, "O Messenger of God, a man among us slaughters and forgets to mention the name of God." He said, "The name of God is upon every Muslim." Ibn 'Adi said it is *munkar*. Al-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi, from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Muslim suffices him his name. If he forgets to mention [God's name] when he slaughters, let him mention it and remember the name of God, then let him eat." In it is Muhammad ibn Sinan, whom the majority weakened. It is possible that this is general, necessitating diverting the verse and other reports from their apparent meanings. And it is possible that this is specified for the one who forgets, leaving the apparent meanings without interpretation. Carrying it upon people was possible as a facilitation for his excuse in omitting the *tasmiyah* due to forgetfulness. Since generalizing it and interpreting the verse was a closer possibility, we gave it preponderance, and we do not deny lifting the opposing probability. Abstinence from the likes of this is important and occurs in the first degree.

The second rank, which contends with the degree of *waswasah* (insinuating doubts), is that a person abstains from eating the fetus found in the belly of a slaughtered animal, and from the *dabb* (spiny-tailed lizard). It is authentically established in the *Sahih* collections of reports: the hadith of the fetus—"its slaughter is the slaughter of its mother." The hadith: "The slaughter of the fetus is the slaughter of its mother." The author said it is established with a soundness that admits no probability to its text and no weakness to its chain. He took this from Imam al-Haramayn, for he said likewise in *Al-Asalib*. The hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and Al-Hakim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said: "Its chain is sound," but it is not so. Al-Tabarani in *Al-Saghir* from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a good chain. And 'Abd al-Haqq said: "One does not argue with its chains." Its soundness admits no probability to its text and no weakness to its chain. Likewise, it is established that the *dabb* was eaten upon the table of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. The hadith of eating the *dabb* upon the table of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. The author said: "It is in the two *Sahihs*," and it is as he mentioned from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, and Khalid ibn al-Walid. That has been transmitted in the two *Sahihs*. I think Abu Hanifah did not reach these hadiths, and if they had reached him, he would have held by them if he were fair; and if no fair person is found regarding it, his opposition is an error not to be considered and does not produce doubt, as if he had not opposed. Knowing something by the report of a single narrator.

The third rank is that no disagreement in the matter is known at all, but the permissibility is known by the report of a single narrator. Then someone says, "People have differed regarding the report of a single narrator; among them are those who do not accept it, so I abstain." For even if the transmitters are upright, error is possible from them, and lying for a hidden purpose is possible from them, for an upright person may also lie, and misconception is possible from them, for something contrary to what the speaker says may reach their hearing or their understanding. This is an abstinence (*wara'*) the like of which has not been transmitted from the Companions regarding what they used to hear from an upright person whose report put their souls at ease. However, if a doubt arises due to a specific cause and particular indication regarding the narrator, then hesitation has an apparent justification, even if he is upright. The disagreement of one who disagrees regarding solitary reports (*akhbar al-ahad*) is not considered, and it is like the disagreement of Al-Nazzam regarding the principle of consensus and his saying it is not a proof. If such abstinence were permissible, it would be from abstinence that a person refrains from taking the inheritance of the grandfather (father's father) and says, "There is no mention in the Book of God except for sons," and affiliating the son's son with the son is by the consensus of the Companions, and they are not infallible, and error from them is possible, as Al-Nazzam opposed it. And this is folly and leads to abandoning what is known by the generalities of the Qur'an, for among the theologians are those who held that generalities have no specific formulations, and one only argues by what the Companions understood from them through contextual indicators and indications. All of that is *waswasah*. Thus, there is no side among the sides of doubts except that in it is extremism and excess. So let that be understood.

Whenever a matter from these matters is ambiguous, let him seek a fatwa from his heart therein, and let him leave the abstinence that causes him doubt for what does not cause him doubt. Let him leave the misgivings of hearts and the misgivings of chests. That differs according to individuals and occurrences. But he should guard his heart from the prompts of *waswasah* so that he only judges by the truth, so he does not harbor misgiving in the places of *waswasah*, nor is he devoid of misgiving in the places of dislike. How precious is such a heart! For that reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not refer everyone to the fatwa of his heart; rather, he said that to Wabisa due to what he knew of his state. The hadith: "He did not refer everyone to the fatwa of his heart; rather, he said that to Wabisa." The hadith of Wabisa has preceded. Al-Tabarani narrated from the hadith of Wathilah that he said that to Wathila also. In it is Al-'Ala' ibn Tha'labah, unknown.

The second category: The conflict of indications pointing to permissibility and prohibition. For a type of possession may be looted at a time, and the occurrence of its like from other than looting is rare. So he sees it, for example, in the hand of a man from the people of righteousness. His righteousness indicates it is lawful, and the type of possession indicates it is unlawful.

And likewise, if it is taken from other than what was plundered, considering it unlawful, then the two commands conflict. Similarly, if a just person informs that it is unlawful and another that it is lawful, or the testimonies of two corrupt persons conflict, or the statement of a child and an adult, then if a preponderance appears, judgment is given accordingly. But for the scrupulous, avoidance is required. If no preponderance appears, it is obligatory to refrain, and its details will come later in the chapter on recognition, investigation, and inquiry.

The third category: The conflict of resemblances in attributes upon which rulings are based. An example is when wealth is bequeathed for jurists. It is known that the proficient in jurisprudence is included, and that one who began learning a day or a month ago is not included. Between them are countless degrees where doubt occurs. The jurist gives a legal opinion according to presumption, and the scrupulous avoids. This is the most obscure source of ambiguity, for within it are scenarios where the jurist is necessarily perplexed, with no recourse, as the one described by an attribute may be in an intermediate degree between two opposing degrees, with no apparent inclination toward either.

Similarly, with charities directed to the needy: it is known that one who has nothing is needy, and one who has abundant wealth is rich. Between them lie ambiguous cases, such as one who has a house, furnishings, clothes, and books. The extent of his need does not prevent spending on him, but the surplus does prevent it. Need is not precisely limited but is grasped approximately. Consideration extends to the size of the house, its buildings, and its value due to its location in the city center, and whether a lesser house would suffice. Likewise, regarding the type of household furnishings, if they are of brass rather than pottery, and their number, and their value, and what is not needed daily but yearly, like winter tools, or what is needed only every few years—none of this has a defined limit.

The approach in this is as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Leave what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt." All this lies in the realm of doubt. If the jurist hesitates, there is no way but to refrain, and this is among the most important occasions for scrupulousness.

Likewise, what is obligatory to the extent of sufficiency—such as maintenance for relatives, clothing for wives, and sufficient provision for jurists and scholars from the public treasury—has two extremes: one known to be insufficient, the other excessive. Between them are ambiguous matters that vary by person and circumstance. The One aware of needs is God Almighty; humans cannot ascertain their limits. Less than a Makkan pound per day is insufficient for a large man, and more than three pounds is excessive. What lies between has no definite limit. Let the scrupulous abandon what causes him doubt.

This applies to every ruling tied to a cause known through Arabic expression, for the Arabs and other linguistic communities did not define the contents of language with precise limits that clearly distinguish opposites, like the word "six," which does not admit what is less or more among numbers. Other linguistic terms of calculation and estimation are not like that. There is no term in the Book of God or the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) except that doubt may enter into the intermediate cases of its requirements, oscillating between opposing extremes. Thus, the need for this discipline is great in bequests and endowments—for example, upon Sufis—regarding what is valid and who falls under the implication of this term. This is among the ambiguities, and likewise are all other terms. We will point to the implication of the term "Sufi" in particular to illustrate how to handle terms, for there is no hope of exhausting them.

These are confusions arising from conflicting indicators pulling toward two opposing sides, and all are ambiguities that must be avoided if the side of permissibility is not preponderated by evidence that outweighs presumption or by upholding the principle of his saying (peace be upon him), "Leave what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt," and by other evidences previously mentioned. These are the sources of ambiguities, some more severe than others. If various ambiguities converge upon one thing, the matter becomes graver—such as taking disputed food in exchange for grapes sold by a wine-seller after the call to prayer on Friday, when the seller has mixed his wealth with unlawful earnings, though not the majority, making it ambiguous. The accumulation of ambiguities may lead to severity in venturing into them.

These are levels whose way of recognition we have known, but human capability cannot enumerate them. What is clear from this explanation is to be adopted; what is obscure should be avoided. For sin is the uneasiness of the heart. Where we have decreed consulting the heart, we mean where the jurist permits; but where he forbids, abstention is obligatory. Yet, not every heart is to be relied upon, for there is the obsessive heart that shuns everything, and the greedy, lax heart that is content with everything. These two hearts are not considered; consideration is only for the heart of the guided, vigilant scholar, observing the subtleties of circumstances—it is the criterion by which matters are tested.

The hidden realities of matters and what esteems this heart among hearts—whoever lacks trust in his own heart, let him seek illumination from the heart of this quality and present his condition to it. It is related in the Psalms that God Almighty revealed to David, peace be upon him: "Say to the Children of Israel: I do not look at your prayers nor your fasts, but I look at one who doubts something and abandons it for My sake. That is the one I look upon, support with My aid, and boast of before My angels."

The Third Chapter: On Inquiry, Questioning, Bold Acceptance, and Negligence, and Their Appropriate Contexts. Know that for anyone who offers you food or a gift, or from whom you wish to purchase or receive something, it is not for you to investigate, question, and say, "This is from what I cannot verify as lawful, so I will not take it," by probing into it. Nor is it for you to neglect inquiry and take everything whose prohibition you are not certain of. Rather, questioning is obligatory at times, forbidden at times, recommended at times, and disliked at times. Thus, it necessitates detailed explanation. The decisive statement on this is that the appropriate context for questioning is situations of doubt. The origin and source of doubt relates either to the wealth itself or to the owner of the wealth.

The First Source: The Conditions of the Owner. In relation to your knowledge, he has three conditions: either he is unknown, doubted, or known with a type of presumption based on indication. The first condition: that he is unknown. The unknown is one with whom there is no indication pointing to his corruption and injustice, such as the attire of soldiers, nor any indication pointing to his righteousness, like the garments of people of Sufism, trade, knowledge, and other such markers. If you enter a village you do not know and see a man about whose condition you know nothing, and upon him is no marker attributing him to people of righteousness or people of corruption, then he is unknown. If you enter a town as a stranger and enter a market, finding a man who is a baker, butcher, or other, with no indication pointing to him being suspicious or treacherous, nor any indication negating it, then he is unknown, and his condition is not known. We do not say he is doubted, because doubt is an expression of two opposing beliefs with two opposing causes. Most jurists do not perceive the difference between what is not known and what is doubted. You have learned from what preceded that scrupulousness is abandoning what is not known. Yusuf ibn Asbat said, "For thirty years, whenever something stirred in my heart, I abandoned it." A group spoke about the most difficult deeds and said it is scrupulousness. Hassan ibn Abi Sinan said to them, "Nothing is easier for me than scrupulousness: when something stirs in my chest, I abandon it." This is the condition of scrupulousness. But we mention now the ruling of the apparent. We say the ruling of this condition is that if the unknown offers you food or brings you a gift, or you wish to purchase something from his shop, questioning is not obligatory for you. Rather, his hand and his being a Muslim are two sufficient indications for boldly accepting it. It is not for you to say, "Corruption and injustice are prevalent among people," for this is whispering and bad assumption about this specific Muslim, and indeed some assumptions are sinful. This Muslim, by his Islam, deserves that you do not assume ill of him. If you assume ill of him specifically because you saw corruption from others, then you have wronged him and sinned against him immediately, without doubt. If you took the wealth, its being unlawful would be doubted. Evidence for this is that we know the Companions, may God be pleased with them, during their expeditions and travels, would alight in villages and not reject the villages, and enter towns without cautioning against the markets, while unlawful things also existed in their time. Nothing is transmitted from them about questioning except in case of suspicion. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not ask about everything brought to him, but he asked upon his first arrival in Medina about what was brought to him: is it charity or a gift? The hadith of his questioning upon his first arrival in Medina about what was brought to him—charity or a gift—is narrated by Ahmad and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, from the hadith of Salman: that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he arrived in Medina, Salman brought him food, and he asked him about it: charity or a gift? The hadith preceded in the chapter before it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, because the indication of the situation points to it—the entry of the Emigrants into Medina while they were poor, so it was presumed that what was brought to them was by way of charity. Then, the giver's Islam and his hand do not indicate that it is not charity. He was invited to feasts and would accept without asking whether it was charity or not. The hadith "He was invited to feasts and would accept without asking whether it was charity or not" is well-known and famous. From that, in the two Sahih collections, from the hadith of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari regarding the action of Abu Shu'ayb preparing food for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the invitation of the fifth of five, since custom dictated that hospitality is not given as charity. For that reason, Umm Sulaym invited him—the hadith of her invitation: agreed upon from the hadith of Anas—and the tailor invited him. The hadith of Anas: that a tailor invited the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and presented to him food containing squash—agreed upon as in.

The narration reported by Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, is that food containing squash was brought to him, and a Persian man invited him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Me and 'A'ishah?" The man said, "No." He said, "Then no." Later, he answered him and went, he and 'A'ishah walking together. Then clarified butter was presented to them... The narration of the Persian man inviting him, and him saying "Me and 'A'ishah?" is reported by Muslim from Anas, and the questioning was not transmitted in any of that. And Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, asked his servant about his earnings when he was unsettled about his affair. And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, asked the one who gave him milk from the charity camels when he was unsettled and was pleased with its taste, and it was not as he was accustomed to each time. And these are the causes for suspicion.

And anyone who finds hospitality with an unknown man is not sinful by accepting it without investigation. Rather, even if he sees in his house adornment and much wealth, it is not for him to say, "Lawful wealth is scarce, and this is abundant, so from where could this be gathered from lawful means?" Indeed, this very person may have inherited wealth or earned it, so he himself deserves a good opinion. And I add to this and say: It is not for him to ask him. Rather, if he is scrupulous, then he should not let anything enter his stomach except what he knows its source—that is good—so let him graciously abstain. And if he has no choice but to eat it, then let him eat without asking, for questioning is harm, a breach of privacy, and causing alienation, and it is undoubtedly forbidden. If you say, "Perhaps he is not harmed," I say, "Perhaps he is harmed." So you are asking out of caution from a 'perhaps'. If you are content, then perhaps his wealth is lawful. And the sin to be feared in harming a Muslim is not less than the sin in eating the doubtful and the unlawful. And what is predominant among people is feeling alienated by investigation.

And it is not permissible for him to ask others from a source where he knows about it, because the harm in that is greater. And if he asks from a source where he does not know, then in that is a bad opinion, a breach of privacy, and in it is spying, and in it is clinging to backbiting, even if that is not explicit. And all of that is prohibited in one verse. God Almighty said: "Avoid much suspicion, for indeed some suspicion is sin. And do not spy, nor backbite one another." And how many an ignorant ascetic alienates hearts in investigation and speaks harsh, harmful words! Satan only beautifies that for him seeking fame for eating the lawful. If his motive were purely religious, his fear for a Muslim's heart to be harmed would be stronger than his fear for his stomach to enter what he does not know. And he is not held accountable for what he does not know, as long as there is no sign necessitating avoidance. So let it be known that the path of scrupulousness is abstention without spying. And when there is no choice but to eat, then the scrupulous course is to eat and hold a good opinion. This is the customary practice of the Companions, may God be pleased with them. Whoever increases beyond them in scrupulousness is astray, an innovator, and not a follower. No one will reach the measure of one of them, nor half of it, even if he spent all that is on earth. How could it be otherwise, when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, ate the food of Barirah? It was said, "It is charity." He said, "It is charity for her, and a gift for us." The narration of him eating the food of Barirah, and it being said it is charity, and he said, "It is charity for her, and a gift for us," is agreed upon from the narration of Anas. And he did not ask about the one upon whom charity was given, so he was unknown to him, and he did not refrain.

The second scenario is that it be doubted due to an indication that produced suspicion. So let us mention the form of suspicion, then its ruling. As for appearance: that he be upon the appearance of the Turks, the Bedouins, and those known for oppression and highway robbery, and that he have a long mustache, and that the hair be parted on his head according to the custom of the people of corruption. As for clothing: the robe and the cap, and the attire of the people of oppression and corruption from the soldiers and others. As for action and speech: it is that he is seen proceeding toward what is not permissible, for that indicates he is also lax regarding wealth and takes what is not lawful. These are the places of suspicion.

So if he wishes to buy something from such a person, or accept a gift from him, or accept his invitation to hospitality, and he is a stranger unknown to him, and nothing has appeared from him except these signs, it is plausible to say that possession indicates ownership, and these indications are weak, so proceeding is permissible, and abstention is from scrupulousness. And it is plausible to say that possession is a weak indication, and it has been met with a similar indication, so it produced suspicion, so rushing in is not permissible. And this is what we choose and give a legal opinion with, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Leave what makes you doubtful for what does not make you doubtful." The narration "Leave what makes you doubtful" preceded in the two chapters before it, so its apparent meaning is a command, even though it may bear the meaning of recommendation, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Sin is what wavers in the hearts." The narration "Sin is what wavers in the hearts" preceded in the Book of Knowledge. And this has an effect on the heart that cannot be denied. And because the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked, "Is it charity or a gift?" And Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, asked his servant, and 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, asked. And all of that was in a place of suspicion, and interpreting it as scrupulousness is possible, but not...

It cannot be imposed except by my legal analogy, and analogy does not testify to the permissibility of this. For the evidence of possession and Islam is contradicted by these other indicators, which give rise to doubt. When they are in opposition, permissibility has no basis. However, the ruling of possession and the principle of continuity are not abandoned due to a doubt that lacks a supporting sign. For example, if we find water altered and it is possible the change is due to long standing, but then we see a gazelle urinate in it, and it is possible the change is from that, we abandon the principle of continuity. This case is similar. Yet, there is a gradation among these indicators. For instance, long mustaches, wearing a military coat, and the bearing of soldiers indicate wrongful seizure of wealth. As for speech and action contrary to the Sacred Law, if they pertain to wrongful seizure of wealth, they are also clear evidence, such as hearing him command seizure and oppression or conclude a usurious contract. However, if one sees him insult another in anger or let his gaze follow a woman passing by, this evidence is weak. For how many a person is scrupulous in seeking wealth, acquiring only the lawful, yet cannot control himself when passion or anger surges. One must be alert to this gradation. This cannot be defined by a precise limit. The servant should, in such matters, consult his heart. I say: If one observes this from a stranger, it has one ruling. If one observes it from someone known for scrupulousness in purity, prayer, and reciting the Qur'an, it has another ruling. When the indicators pertaining to wealth conflict and cancel each other out, the man returns to being like a stranger, as neither indicator specifically relates to wealth. For how many are scrupulous regarding wealth but not in other matters, and how many are diligent in prayer, ablution, and recitation yet eat from wherever they find. The ruling in such situations is what the heart inclines to, for this is a matter between the servant and God. It is not far-fetched that it be connected to a hidden cause known only to Him, the Lord of Lords. It is the ruling of the heart's unease. Then, one must be alert to another subtle point: this indicator should be such that it indicates most of his wealth is unlawful—such as being a soldier, a sultan's agent, a professional mourner, or a singer. If it indicates a small amount of unlawful wealth in his possessions, inquiry is not obligatory; rather, inquiry would be from scrupulousness. The third case is when the situation is known through a kind of experience and familiarity such that it induces a presumption of the wealth's lawfulness or prohibition. For example, knowing a man's apparent righteousness, religiosity, and uprightness, while allowing that his inward state may differ. Here, inquiry is neither obligatory nor permissible, as with a stranger. The preferable course is to proceed, and proceeding here is further from suspicion than proceeding with the food of a stranger, for that is far from scrupulousness, even if not unlawful. As for eating the food of the righteous, it was the practice of the prophets and the saints. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Eat only the food of the God-fearing, and let only the God-fearing eat your food." This hadith, "Eat only the food of the God-fearing, and let only the God-fearing eat your food," was mentioned earlier regarding zakah. However, if one knows through experience that he is a soldier, a singer, or a tax collector, and one no longer needs to infer it from his bearing, appearance, and clothes, then inquiry is undoubtedly obligatory, as in a situation of doubt—indeed, more so. The second source is when doubt is based on the source of the wealth, not the state of its owner. This is when lawful and unlawful are mixed, such as when loads of wrongfully seized food are thrown into a market and the people of the market buy them. It is not obligatory for one buying in that town and that market to inquire about what he buys, unless it becomes apparent that most of what is in their possession is unlawful. At that point, inquiry becomes obligatory. If it is not the majority, investigation is from scrupulousness and is not obligatory. A large market has the same ruling as a town. The proof that inquiry and investigation are not obligatory when unlawful wealth is not predominant is that the Companions (may God be pleased with them) did not refrain from buying from markets where there were usurious coins, misappropriated booty, and other things. They did not inquire in every transaction; inquiry is only reported from a few of them rarely, in specific situations of doubt regarding that particular individual. Similarly, they would take booty from the disbelievers who had fought the Muslims, and they might take their wealth, though it was possible that among that booty was something taken from Muslims, which it is not permissible to take for free by consensus—rather, it must be returned to its owner according to Imam al-Shafi'i (may God have mercy on him), and its owner is more entitled to its price according to Imam Abu Hanifah (may God have mercy on him). Yet, investigation into this was never reported. 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) wrote to Azerbaijan: "You are in lands where carrion is slaughtered, so distinguish the slaughtered from the dead." He permitted and commanded inquiry here, but he did not command inquiry about the coins that were their prices, because most of their coins were not the prices of the skins, even though they too were sold, and most of the skins were likewise. Similarly, Ibn Mas'ud (may God be pleased with him) said, "You are in..."

In lands where most butchers are Magians, examine what is slaughtered to distinguish the lawful from carrion, giving particular attention to the more prevalent cases requiring inquiry. The intent of this chapter only becomes clear by presenting scenarios and hypothetical questions that frequently arise in daily transactions.

Let us suppose the case of a specific individual whose wealth is mixed with unlawful gains—such as one who sells food from a shop built on usurped property or with stolen wealth, or a judge, governor, official, or jurist who derives income from an oppressive ruler but also possesses inherited wealth, farmland, or trade, or a merchant who engages in valid transactions but also takes interest. If the majority of his wealth is unlawful, it is not permissible to eat his hospitality, accept his gifts, or receive his charity without investigation. If what is taken is found to be from a lawful source, then it is allowed; otherwise, it must be abandoned.

If the unlawful portion is smaller and what is taken is ambiguous, this falls into an area of consideration, as it occupies a rank between two rulings. We have already ruled that if a lawful slaughter is mixed with ten instances of carrion, for example, avoiding all is obligatory. This resembles that situation in one respect, because a single person’s wealth is limited, especially if it is not vast like that of a ruler. It differs in another respect, because the presence of carrion is known with certainty at the moment, whereas the unlawful wealth that has mixed with his holdings may have already left his possession and not be present at the time.

If the wealth is small and it is known definitively that the unlawful portion is present at the moment, this is identical to the case of mixing with carrion, even if the wealth is abundant. But if the wealth is large and it is possible the unlawful portion is not present at the moment, this is lighter than the former. It resembles, in one aspect, mixing with what is not limited—as in markets and towns—but it is more severe due to its attachment to a specific person. There is no doubt that hastily consuming from him is far from piety, but the consideration lies in whether it constitutes immorality that contradicts uprightness. This is also ambiguous from the standpoint of transmitted reports, due to conflicting evidences.

From the standpoint of transmission, it is also ambiguous because what is reported from the Companions regarding abstention in such cases, and similarly from the Followers, can be interpreted as an act of piety, and no explicit text of prohibition is found. What is reported of partaking—such as Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, eating the food of Mu‘awiyah, for example—if it is assumed that some of what he possessed was unlawful, that too could be interpreted as his partaking only after investigation and ascertaining that what he ate specifically was from a permissible source. Thus, actions in this matter provide weak evidence, and the positions of later scholars differ widely.

Some even said, “If a ruler gave me something, I would take it,” extending permissibility even when the majority is unlawful, as long as the specific item taken is not known and could possibly be lawful. They argued by citing how some early scholars accepted gifts from rulers, as will come in the chapter on clarifying the wealth of rulers. However, if the unlawful portion is the smaller part and it is possible it is not present at the moment, then eating is not unlawful. But if its presence at the moment is certain, as in the case of lawful slaughter mixed with carrion, this is something I do not know what to say about—it is among the ambiguous matters that perplex the jurist, because it oscillates between resembling a limited mixture and an unlimited one.

If a nursing infant is mixed with a village of ten women, avoidance is obligatory; but if it is in a town of ten thousand, it is not obligatory—and between these there are various numbers. If asked about it, I would not know what to say. Scholars have hesitated over questions clearer than this: Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God have mercy on him, was asked about a man who shot game that fell into another’s property—does the game belong to the shooter or to the landowner? He said, “I do not know,” and when pressed repeatedly, he said, “I do not know.” Much of this we have narrated from the early generations in the Book of Knowledge. So let the jurist abandon hope of reaching a definitive ruling in all scenarios.

Ibn al-Mubarak asked his companion from Basra about dealing with people who deal with rulers. He said, “If they deal only with the ruler, do not deal with them; but if they deal with the ruler and others, then deal with them.” This indicates leniency regarding the smaller portion, and possibly leniency regarding the larger portion as well. In summary, it is not reported that the Companions completely boycotted dealing with butchers, bakers, or merchants due to a single invalid contract or a one-time transaction with a ruler, estimating that afterward it would be permissible. The issue is inherently problematic.

If it is said: It is reported from ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, that he permitted it, saying, “Take what the ruler gives you, for he gives you from the lawful, and what he takes from the lawful is more than the unlawful.” And Ibn Mas‘ud, may God be pleased with him, was asked about this. The questioner said, “I have a neighbor whom I know only as wicked—he invites us, or we need to borrow from him.” He replied, “If he invites you, accept; if you need, borrow from him, for you have the benefit and he bears the sin.” Salman gave a similar ruling. ‘Ali justified it by the majority being lawful, and Ibn Mas‘ud, may God be pleased with him, indicated by allusion that the sin is upon him because he knows, and you have the benefit.

You do not know him. It is narrated that a man said to Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, "I have a neighbor who consumes usury, yet he invites us to his food. Shall we go to him?" He replied, "Yes." Many differing narrations are reported from Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, on this matter. Al-Shafi'i and Malik, may God be pleased with them, accepted gifts from caliphs and sultans, knowing that their wealth was mixed with what is unlawful. We say: As for what is narrated from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, his renowned scrupulousness indicates the contrary, for he would refrain from the treasury's wealth to the point of selling his sword, and he would possess only one shirt at a time, having no other to wear while washing it. I do not deny that his explicit permission indicates permissibility, and his action is susceptible to being interpreted as scrupulousness. But even if it is authentic, the wealth of the ruler has a different ruling, for due to its abundance, it nearly becomes akin to what is uncountable. This will be clarified later. Similarly, the action of Al-Shafi'i and Malik, may God be pleased with them, pertains to the wealth of the ruler, and its ruling will come later. Our discussion concerns ordinary people whose wealth is nearly countable. As for the statement of Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, it is said that it was transmitted by Khawat al-Taymi, who had weak memory. The well-known position from him indicates avoiding ambiguities, for he said, "Let none of you say, 'I fear and I hope,' for the lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters. So abandon what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt." And he said, "Avoid doubtful matters, for in them is sin." If it is said: Why do you say that when the majority is unlawful, it is not permissible to take it, even though what is taken bears no specific mark indicating its prohibition? Possession is a mark of ownership, such that if someone stole the wealth of such a man, his hand would be cut off. The majority [being unlawful] only induces a general suspicion not attached to a specific item, so let it be like the predominant assumption regarding street mud or the predominant assumption regarding mixing with what is uncountable when the majority is unlawful. It is not permissible to use as proof the general statement of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "Abandon what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt," because it is specified to certain situations by consensus—namely, when doubt arises from a specific mark in the property itself, as evidenced by the mixing of a small amount with what is uncountable. That causes doubt, yet you have ruled that it is not prohibited. The answer is that possession is a weak indication, like the presumption of continuity, and it only has effect when free from a strong counter-indication. When we ascertain the mixing, ascertain that the unlawful element mixed is present, the wealth is not free from it, and ascertain that the majority is unlawful—and this regarding a specific individual whose wealth is nearly countable—then the obligation to disregard the implication of possession becomes clear, even if the statement of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "Abandon what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt," does not apply to it. There remains no basis for it, for it cannot be applied to the mixing of a small amount with lawful, uncountable wealth, since that existed in his time and he did not abandon it. However this is interpreted, this falls within its meaning. To interpret it as mere recommendation diverts it from its apparent meaning without analogy, for prohibiting this is not far from the analogy of specific marks and the presumption of continuity. Abundance has an effect in confirming suspicion, as does being countable, and they have combined. Thus, Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, said, "Do not exert judgment regarding vessels except when the pure is the majority," requiring the combination of the presumption of continuity, exertion of judgment based on a specific mark, and the strength of abundance. Whoever says, "Take any vessel you wish," without exertion of judgment, relying solely on the presumption of continuity, would also permit drinking from it. This would necessitate permitting it here based solely on the mark of possession, but this does not apply to urine confused with water, for there is no presumption of continuity there, nor do we extend it to carrion confused with properly slaughtered meat, for there is no presumption of continuity regarding carrion. Possession does not indicate that it is not carrion, but it does indicate ownership of permissible food. Here, there are four considerations: the presumption of continuity, the small or large amount in the mixture, the mixture being limited or extensive, and a specific mark on the item itself upon which judgment is exerted. Whoever overlooks the totality of these four may err, likening some issues to what they do not resemble. From what we have mentioned, it is established that a mixture in the possession of a single person either has the unlawful as the majority or the minority. Each of these is either known with certainty or assumed based on a mark or conjecture. The question is obligatory in two situations: when the unlawful is the majority with certainty or assumption—as if one sees a Turk of unknown status, whose entire wealth is possibly from spoils of war—and when the minority is known with certainty, which is the place of caution, and one nearly follows the path of most of the early generations and the necessities of circumstances in leaning toward concession. As for the three remaining categories, the question is fundamentally obligatory. The issue: If one is present at the food of a person, knowing that unlawful wealth from usury or another source entered his possession, but one does not know whether it remains now, it is disliked to eat, but investigation is not obligatory. Investigation in this is from scrupulousness. Even if one knows that something of it remains but does not know...

If the amount is less or more, he may take the lesser, though it was previously stated that the command regarding the lesser is problematic. This is similar to the issue when the administrator of charities, endowments, or bequests has two funds, one of which he is entitled to and the second he is not, because it is not characterized by that attribute. Is he permitted to take what the endowment's founder entrusts to him? If that attribute is apparent and known to the administrator, and the administrator is evidently just, he may take it without inquiry, for it is presumed of the administrator that he would not disburse to him except from the funds he is entitled to. But if the attribute is hidden, and the administrator is known to mix funds and is careless in his actions, then inquiry is obligatory, for here there is no possession or presumption of continuity to rely upon. This is analogous to the Prophet's (peace be upon him) inquiry about charity and gifts when he was uncertain about them, for possession does not specify a gift as distinct from charity, nor does presumption of continuity. Nothing saves from doubt except inquiry. For where we dispense with inquiry in cases of uncertainty, we do so based on the sign of possession and Islam. For instance, if one did not know a man was Muslim and wished to take meat from his slaughtered animal, but suspected he might be a Zoroastrian, it would not be permissible for him unless he knew he was Muslim, for possession indicates nothing regarding carrion, nor does appearance indicate Islam, unless most inhabitants of the town are Muslim. Then one may presume that one without signs of disbelief is a Muslim, even if error is possible. One must not confuse situations where possession and circumstance testify with those where they do not.

A question: May one buy a house in a town knowing it contains usurped properties? This is permissible because that mixing is not limited. However, inquiry is a precaution and an act of scrupulousness. But if, for example, on a street of ten houses, one is usurped or an endowment, purchase is not permissible unless distinguished, and investigation is obligatory.

If one enters a town containing hostels endowed specifically for adherents of various schools of thought, and he follows one of those schools, he may not reside in any he wishes and consume from its endowment without inquiry, for this is a case of limited mixing. Distinction is necessary, and it is not permissible to proceed with ambiguity, for the hostels and schools in a town are necessarily limited.

A question: Where we consider inquiry an act of scrupulousness, one is not to question the owner of food or wealth if he fears his anger. We only made inquiry obligatory when it is certain most of his wealth is unlawful. In that case, one need not fear the anger of such a person, for harming the wrongdoer beyond that is obligatory, and such a person generally does not become angry at being questioned. Indeed, if one takes from the hand of his agent, servant, student, or some family member under his care, he may question whenever doubtful, for they do not become angry at his questioning, and because he must ask to teach them the way of lawful gain. For this reason, Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with him) questioned his servant, and 'Umar questioned the one who gave him drink from the charity camels, and Abu Hurayrah (may God be pleased with him) was also questioned when he brought a large sum of money, and it was said, "Woe to you! Is all of this pure in origin?" because he was astonished at its amount, and he was under his care, especially since he was gentle in the form of the question. Similarly, 'Ali (may God be pleased with him) said, "Nothing is more beloved to God Almighty than a just and gentle ruler, and nothing more hated by Him than his injustice and rashness."

A question: Al-Harith al-Muhasibi (may God have mercy on him) said: If one has a friend or brother whose anger he does not fear if questioned, he should still not question him for the sake of scrupulousness, because perhaps what was concealed from him may become apparent, thus causing him to breach the veil of privacy, leading to enmity. What he mentioned is good, for if questioning is from scrupulousness, not obligation, then scrupulousness in such matters—avoiding breaching privacy and stirring enmity—is more important. He added to this, saying: Even if something about him causes doubt, he should not question him but assume he feeds him from the pure and avoids the impure. If his heart is not at ease with him, he should guard himself tactfully without breaching his privacy by questioning. He said, "For I have not seen any of the scholars do this." This from him, along with his renowned asceticism, indicates leniency when a small amount of unlawful wealth is mixed. But that is in cases of suspicion, not certainty, for the term 'doubt' indicates suspicion by its very implication and does not necessitate certainty. Let these subtleties be observed regarding inquiry.

A question: Perhaps someone will say: What benefit is there in questioning one whose wealth is partly unlawful? One who considers unlawful wealth permissible might lie. If you trust his honesty, then trust his piety regarding what is lawful. I say: Whenever you know a person's wealth is mixed with the unlawful, and he has a desire for you to attend his hospitality or accept his gift, confidence in his statement is not achieved, so there is no benefit in questioning him. Therefore, one should inquire from others. Likewise, if he is a seller eager to sell for profit, then...

Confidence is attained through his statement that it is lawful, and there is no benefit in questioning him; rather, one questions someone else. One questions the possessor only if he is not under suspicion, just as the trustee responsible for property that is handed over asks from which source it came, and just as the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, inquired about a gift and charity, for that does not harm or cast suspicion upon the speaker. Likewise, if he is suspected of not knowing the way of lawful earning, he is not suspected in his statement if he informs of a sound method. Similarly, one questions his servant and attendant to know the way of his acquisition; here questioning is beneficial. If the owner of the property is under suspicion, then let him ask someone else. If a single upright person informs him, he accepts it; and if a corrupt person informs him, and he knows from accompanying circumstances that he does not lie where he has no interest in the matter, it is permissible to accept it, because this is a matter between him and God Almighty, and what is sought is peace of mind. Confidence may sometimes arise from the statement of a corrupt person that does not arise from the statement of an upright person. Not everyone who is corrupt lies, nor does everyone in whom apparent uprightness is seen speak truthfully. Testimony is tied to apparent uprightness out of necessity for judgment, for inner states are not known. Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, accepted the testimony of a corrupt person. How many a person you know, and you know that he may plunge into sins, yet when he informs you of something, you trust him? Likewise, if a discerning child, whom you know to be careful, informs you, confidence may be attained through his statement, so it becomes permissible to rely on it. As for if an unknown person, about whose condition one knows nothing at all, informs, this is among those from whose hand we permitted eating, because his hand is an apparent indication of his ownership, and it might be said his Islam is an apparent indication of his truthfulness—but this is subject to consideration. His statement is not devoid of some effect on the heart, such that if a group of them gathered, it would yield strong presumption, yet the effect of a single one is extremely weak. So let him look to the degree of its effect on the heart, for the one who gives the ruling is the heart in such a situation, and the heart has attentions to subtle indications that the scope of speech cannot encompass. Let him reflect upon it. What indicates the obligation of paying attention to it is what is narrated from 'Uqbah ibn al-Harith: he came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I married a woman, then a black maidservant came and claimed that she had suckled us, but she is lying." He said, "Leave her." He said, "But she is black, which diminishes her status." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "How can you [marry her] when she has claimed that she suckled you both? There is no good for you in her; leave her." The hadith of 'Uqbah: "I married a woman, then a black maidservant came to us and claimed that she had suckled us, but she is lying," narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn al-Harith. In another wording: "How can you, when it has been said?" Whenever the falsehood of the unknown person is not known, and no sign of an interest for him in it appears, it inevitably has an impact on the heart. Therefore, the matter of caution is emphasized. If the heart is at peace with it, caution becomes an obligatory necessity. The issue of where questioning is obligatory: if the statements of two upright persons conflict, they cancel each other out, and likewise the statements of two corrupt persons. It is permissible that the statement of one of the two upright persons or one of the two corrupt persons is given preference in his heart. It is permissible to prefer one side due to greater number or due to specialization in knowledge and awareness; this is something whose depiction branches out. An issue: if specific goods were looted, and one found goods of that type in a person's possession and wished to buy them, and it was possible that they were not from the looted goods—if that person was known to him for righteousness, purchase is permissible, and leaving it would be from piety. If the man was unknown, nothing known about him, if that type of goods is abundant apart from the looted ones, he may buy. If that good is not found in that region except rarely, and it became abundant due to looting, then there is no proof of lawfulness except possession, and a specific mark from the shape and type of the good opposes it—abstaining from buying it is from important piety, but obligation in it is subject to consideration, for the marks are conflicting. I am not able to rule in it with a ruling except to refer it to the heart of the seeker to see what is stronger in his soul. If the stronger is that it is looted, he must leave it; otherwise, it is lawful for him to buy. Most of these occurrences are ambiguous; they are among the ambiguous matters that many people do not know. Whoever avoids them has safeguarded his honor and religion; whoever plunges into them has circled the protected area and risked himself. An issue: if someone said, "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about milk presented to him, and it was mentioned that it was from a sheep, so he asked about the sheep from where it was, and it was mentioned to him, and he remained silent from further questioning." The hadith, "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about milk presented to him," preceded in the fifth chapter of the Etiquettes of Earning and Livelihood. Is questioning about the origin of wealth obligatory or not? And if obligatory, about one origin or two or three? What is the regulation therein? I say: There is no regulation or estimation therein; rather, one looks to the suspicion that necessitates questioning, whether obligatorily or out of piety, and there is no limit to questioning.

Except where the doubt necessitating it ceases, and that varies according to circumstances. If the suspicion arises from the owner not knowing the lawful means of earning, then if he says, "I bought it," the doubt ceases with a single question. But if he says, "From my sheep," doubt arises concerning the sheep. Then if he says, "I bought it," it ceases. If the doubt stems from oppression—such as what is in the hands of the Arabs, where usurped property multiplies in their possession—then the doubt does not cease by his saying, "It is from my sheep," nor by his saying, "The sheep gave birth to it from my sheep." If he traces it to inheritance from his father, and his father's condition is unknown, the inquiry ceases. If it is known that all his father's wealth is unlawful, then the prohibition is evident. If it is known that most of it is unlawful, then due to frequent multiplication, the length of time, and the channel of inheritance reaching him, it does not change its ruling. So reflect on these meanings.

A question was asked concerning a group of residents in a Sufi hospice, and in the hand of their servant who brings them food is an endowment for that dwelling, and another endowment for another purpose besides these. He mixes all and spends on these and those. Is his food lawful, unlawful, or doubtful? I said: This requires consideration of seven principles.

The first principle: The food he brings them is mostly purchased by tacit transaction, and what we have chosen is the validity of tacit transaction, especially in foodstuffs and trivial items. In this, there is only the doubt of disagreement.

The second principle: Consider whether the servant buys it with specifically unlawful wealth or on credit. If he buys it with specifically unlawful wealth, it is unlawful. If it is not known, the prevalent case is that he buys on credit, and it is permissible to act upon the prevalent. This does not give rise to prohibition, but a remote possibility of doubt—that he buys with specifically unlawful wealth.

The third principle: From whom does he buy? If he buys from one whose wealth is mostly unlawful, it is not permissible. If it is less, there is consideration as preceded. If it is not known, it is permissible for him to take it, assuming he buys from one whose wealth is lawful or from one whose condition the buyer does not know with certainty, like an unknown person. As preceded, it is permissible to buy from the unknown, for that is the prevalent. This does not give rise to prohibition, but a possibility of doubt.

The fourth principle: Does he buy it for himself or for the group? The administrator and servant are like deputies; he may buy for them and for himself, but that is by intention or explicit statement. When purchase occurs by tacit transaction, explicit statement does not occur, and the prevalent is that he does not intend at the time of tacit transaction. The butcher, baker, and those he deals with rely on him and intend the sale from him, not from those not present. Thus, it falls from his responsibility and enters his ownership. This principle contains neither prohibition nor doubt, but establishes that they eat from the servant's ownership.

The fifth principle: The servant presents the food to them; it cannot be considered hospitality or a gift without compensation, for he would not be content with that. Rather, he presents it relying on his compensation from the endowment. It is an exchange, but not a sale nor a loan, for if he were to demand the price from them, that would be unlikely, and the circumstantial evidence does not indicate it. Thus, it resembles a principle applicable to this situation: a gift conditional upon recompense—meaning a gift without explicit words from a person whose circumstantial evidence indicates he hopes for recompense, and that is valid, and the recompense is obligatory. Here, the servant only hopes to receive recompense for what he presented in the form of their right from the endowment, to settle his debt with the baker, butcher, and grocer. This contains no doubt, for explicit words are not required for a gift nor for presenting food, even while expecting recompense. No heed is given to the saying of those who do not validate a gift in expectation of recompense.

The sixth principle: There is disagreement concerning the obligatory recompense. Some say it is the least amount of property; some say the value; some say what satisfies the giver, so that he may not be satisfied even with multiples of the value. The correct view is that it follows his satisfaction. If he is not satisfied, it is returned to him. Here, the servant is satisfied with what he takes from the residents' right on the endowment. If they have a right equivalent to what they ate, the matter is complete. If it is deficient and the servant is satisfied with it, it is also valid. If it is known that the servant would not be satisfied were it not for the other endowment in his hand, which he takes by the strength of these residents, then it is as if he is satisfied in the recompense with an amount partly lawful and partly unlawful, and the unlawful did not enter the hands of the residents. This is like a defect affecting the price, and we have previously mentioned its ruling: when it necessitates prohibition and when it necessitates doubt. This does not necessitate prohibition as we have detailed, so the gift does not become unlawful because the giver attains something unlawful by means of the gift.

The seventh principle: He settles the debt of the baker, butcher, and grocer from the income of the endowers. If he fulfills what he took from their right with the value of what he fed them, the matter is sound. If it falls short, and the butcher and baker are satisfied with any price, whether unlawful or lawful, then this is a defect that has affected it.

Regarding the price of food as well, one should consider what we previously mentioned about purchasing on credit and then paying the price from unlawful sources. This applies when it is known that he paid it from unlawful means. If it is equally possible that it was from unlawful or lawful sources, then the matter is ambiguous. It follows from this that consuming such food is not unlawful, but it is consumption of something dubious, and it is far from being cautious in piety. For when such foundational cases multiply and the possibility applies to each one, the likelihood of it being unlawful becomes stronger in the soul due to its frequency, just as when a report's chain of transmission is long, the possibility of falsehood or error in it becomes stronger than when its chain is short. This is the ruling for this incident, which is among legal verdicts. We have only presented it so that one may know how to derive rulings for intricate, ambiguous incidents and how they are referred back to foundational principles, for that is something most jurists are incapable of.

The Fourth Chapter: On How the Repentant Person Deals with Financial Wrongs

Know that whoever repents while possessing mixed wealth has two duties: one in distinguishing the unlawful and extracting it, and another regarding the disposal of what is extracted. Let us examine these two.

The First Examination: On the Method of Distinguishing and Extracting

Know that for everyone who repents while possessing something unlawful that is specifically known, such as usurped property or a trust, his matter is easy: he must distinguish the unlawful. If it is ambiguous and mixed, it is either in wealth consisting of fungible items like grains, currency, or oils, or in distinct items like slaves, houses, or garments.

If it is among fungibles or is pervasive in the whole—such as one who earned wealth through trade, knowing he lied in some transactions involving profit and was truthful in others, or from usurping oil and mixing it with his own oil, or doing likewise with grains or dirhams and dinars—then it is either of known quantity or unknown quantity.

If it is of known quantity—for example, knowing that half of his total wealth is unlawful—he must distinguish that half. If it is uncertain, he has two paths: one is to act based on certainty, the other on predominant assumption. Both have been stated by scholars regarding uncertainty in the number of prayer cycles. However, in prayer, we only permit acting on certainty, because the principle is the liability of the moral obligation, which is presumed to continue and is not altered except by strong evidence, and there are no reliable indicators for the number of cycles. Here, however, one cannot say the principle is that what is in his hand is unlawful; rather, it is ambiguous, so he is permitted to act on predominant assumption through diligent reasoning. But caution in piety lies in acting on certainty.

If he desires caution, the method of careful investigation and diligent reasoning is to retain only the amount he is certain is lawful. If he wishes to act on assumption, the method is, for example, if he possesses wealth from trade that was partly corrupt, he is certain that half is lawful and, say, a third is unlawful, leaving a sixth about which he doubts; he judges it by predominant assumption. This is the method of careful investigation in all wealth: he sets aside the amount certain from both sides—lawful and unlawful—and for the amount in doubt, if his assumption leans toward prohibition, he extracts it; if lawful predominates, he may keep it, though caution dictates extracting it. If he doubts, he may keep it, but caution dictates extracting it. This caution is more emphasized because it has become doubtful, and keeping it is permissible relying on it being in his possession, so lawfulness is more predominant, though it has become weak after the certainty of unlawful mixing.

It may be argued that the principle is prohibition, and he should only take what he predominantly assumes is lawful, with neither side having priority over the other. At present, no preference is clear to me, and it is among ambiguous matters.

If it is said: Suppose he acts on certainty, but what he extracts is not known to be the very unlawful item; perhaps the unlawful remains in his possession. How can he proceed with that? If this were permissible, one could say if a dead animal is mixed with nine properly slaughtered animals, making ten, he may discard any one and take the rest, considering it lawful. But it may be said: Perhaps the dead animal is among what he retained. Indeed, if he discarded nine and kept one, it would not be lawful due to the possibility it is the unlawful.

We say: This comparison would be valid were it not that wealth becomes lawful by extracting the equivalent due to the possibility of exchange, whereas a dead animal does not admit exchange. Let us unveil this difficulty by hypothesizing a specific dirham confused with another dirham: a person has two dirhams, one unlawful, its identity confused. Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God be pleased with him, was asked about such a case and said: "He should abandon all until it becomes clear." He had pawned some vessels; when he paid the debt, the pledgee brought him two vessels and said: "I do not know which is yours." So he left them both. The pledgee then said: "This one is yours; I was only testing you." He paid his debt and did not take the pledge. This is caution, but we say it is not obligatory.

Let us hypothesize the issue with a dirham whose specific owner is present. We say: If he returns one of the two dirhams to him and he accepts it, knowing the true situation, the other dirham becomes lawful for him, because it must be that...

What is nullified in God's knowledge is what is taken, for the intended purpose is achieved; and if it is otherwise, then each has attained a dirham in the other's possession. The precaution is to conduct the transaction verbally; if they do not, offset and exchange occur through mere delivery. If the one robbed has lost a dirham in the robber's hand, and it is difficult to recover its specific form, yet he is entitled to compensation, then when he takes it, liability is discharged by mere receipt. This is clear on his side, for the one owed compensation owns it upon mere receipt without words. The difficulty on the other side is that it did not enter his ownership. We say: because if he has received his own dirham, he has also lost a dirham in the other's hand, and it is impossible to recover it; it is as if absent, so this substitutes for it in God's knowledge if the matter is so. This exchange occurs in God's knowledge just as offset occurs if two men each destroy a dirham belonging to the other. Indeed, in our specific case, if each threw what was in his hand into the sea or burned it, he would have destroyed it and would bear no responsibility to the other through offset. Likewise, if not destroyed, holding this view is preferable than resorting to the position that one who takes a dirham unlawfully and mixes it into a thousand thousand dirhams of another renders all wealth prohibited to him, with no permissible disposal—this doctrine leads to that, so consider the remoteness herein. In what we have mentioned, there is only abandoning words, and delivery is sale; whoever does not deem it sale does so where possibility intrudes, for action weakens its indication, and where speech is possible. Here, this giving and receiving for exchange is decisive, and sale is impossible because the sold item is neither pointed to nor known specifically, and it may be what cannot be sold partially, like mixing a pound of flour with a thousand pounds of another's flour, or similarly syrup, dates, and anything whose part is not sold for part. If said: "You permitted delivering the amount of his right in such a case and deemed it sale," we say: we do not deem it sale, but say it is substitute for what was lost in his hand, so he owns it as one owed for destroyed dates owns when taking their like. This is if the owner consents; if he does not consent and harms him, saying: "I will take nothing but the very form of my property," then if it is indistinguishable, I leave it and do not gift it, and I render your property void to you. I say: the judge must act on his behalf in receiving until the man's property becomes pure, for this is pure obstinacy and hardship, and the Law did not intend it. If unable to reach the judge and not finding him, let him appoint a pious man to receive for him; if unable, he undertakes himself and sets aside with intent to give to him a dirham, and that becomes specified for him, and the remainder becomes pure for him. This is clearer and more necessary in mixing liquids. If said: "He should be allowed to take and the right transfers to his liability, so what need to extract first then dispose the remainder?" We say: some say he may take as long as the amount of the unlawful remains, and he may not take all; if he took all, it would not be permissible. Others say he may not take unless he extracts the amount of the unlawful through repentance and intent of substitution. Others say the taker in disposal may take from it, but he may not give; if he gives, he disobeys, not the taker from him. None permitted taking all, because if the owner appears, he may take his right from this whole, as he may say: "Perhaps what is spent to me is the very form of my right." By specification and extracting another's right and distinguishing it, this possibility is removed. This property is weighted by this possibility over other, and what is closer to the right is given precedence, as like is given precedence over value, and specific form over like. Likewise, what possibly returns the like is given precedence over what possibly returns value, and what possibly returns the specific form is given precedence over what possibly returns the like. If this one were allowed to say that, then the owner of the other dirham would be allowed to take both dirhams and dispose them, saying: "I will fulfill your right from another place," since mixing is from both sides, and neither's property is more deserving to be considered lost than the other's, unless looking to the lesser and considering it lost therein, or looking to who mixed and deeming his act destructive of another's right—both are very remote. This is clear in fungibles, for they become substitutes in destructions without contract. But if a house is confused with houses or a slave with slaves, there is no way to reconciliation and mutual consent. If he refuses to take except the very form of his right and cannot, and the other wishes to obstruct all his property, if values are equal, the way is for the judge to sell all houses and distribute the price proportionally; if unequal, he takes from the one seeking sale the value of the houses' selves and gives to the refusing one the amount of the lesser's value, and holds the difference amount until...

The clarification or rectification is necessary because it is problematic. If no judge is available, then the one who seeks absolution and has the entirety in his possession may undertake it himself. This is the proper course of action, and all other possibilities are weak and not our chosen opinion. What preceded contains an indication of the reason, and this is clear regarding wheat, less so regarding currency, and most obscure regarding merchandise, since one portion does not substitute for another; thus, sale becomes necessary. Issues are outlined to complete the clarification.

This is the foundational principle: A case where one inherits alongside others, and the ruler had usurped an estate from their deceased. If the ruler restores a specific plot, it belongs to all the heirs collectively. If he restores half of the estate, which is the measure of his own right, the heirs share it with him. For the half that is his is not distinguished so that one could say, "This is the restored portion, and the remainder is the usurped portion." Nor does it become distinguished by the ruler's intention and his aim to confine the usurpation to the shares of the others.

A case: If wealth taken from an oppressive ruler comes into one's possession, then he repents, and the wealth is real property from which he derived benefit, he must calculate a fair rental for the duration of that period. Likewise, for any usurped property that yields benefit or from which increase accrues, his repentance is not valid until he pays the rent for the usurped property. The same applies to every increase derived from it. Estimating the rent for slaves, garments, vessels, and similar items not customarily rented is difficult and can only be apprehended through diligent effort and estimation. All such valuations occur through diligent effort. The path of scrupulousness is to take the maximum estimate.

Any profit he gained from the usurped wealth through contracts he concluded on credit, paying the price from it, is his property. However, there is an element of ambiguity since its price was unlawful, as its ruling preceded. If it was with the actual items of that wealth, the contracts were invalid. It has been said they become valid by the ratification of the one from whom it was usurped, for the sake of public interest, making the one from whom it was usurped more entitled to it. The analogical reasoning is that those contracts are annulled, the price is recovered, and the counter-values are returned. If he is unable due to its abundance, these are unlawful assets that came into his possession. For the one from whom it was usurped is the amount of his principal capital, and the surplus is unlawful and must be paid out to be given in charity. It is not lawful for the usurper nor for the one from whom it was usurped; rather, the ruling wisdom applies to every unlawful thing that comes into one's possession.

A case: One who inherits wealth and does not know from where his deceased acquired it—whether from lawful or unlawful means—and there is no indication, it is lawful by consensus of the scholars. If he knows it contains unlawful wealth but is uncertain of its amount, he extracts the amount of the unlawful portion through careful investigation. If he does not know that, but knows his deceased used to undertake work for rulers and it is possible he took nothing in his work, or he did take but nothing of it remained in his possession due to the long period, this is an ambiguity from which it is good to be scrupulously cautious, but it is not obligatory.

If he knows that some of his wealth was from injustice, he is obliged to extract that amount through diligent effort. Some scholars said he is not obliged, and the sin is upon the deceased. They argued with what was narrated: A man among those who undertook work for a ruler died, and a Companion said, "Now his wealth has become pure for his heir." This is weak because the Companion's name was not mentioned, and perhaps it came from one who was lenient, for there were among the Companions those who were lenient, but we do not mention him out of respect for companionship. How can a man's death make lawful what is known with certainty to be unlawful and intermixed? From where is this taken? Indeed, if it is not known with certainty, one may say he is not held accountable for what he does not know, so it becomes pure for an heir who does not know with certainty that it contains unlawful wealth.

The second consideration is regarding the disbursement. When he extracts the unlawful wealth, it has three states: Either it has a specific owner, so it must be disbursed to him or his heir. If he is absent, one waits for his presence or arranges delivery to him. If it had increase and benefit, its profits are gathered until his presence. Or, it belongs to an unspecified owner, and despair has set in of identifying him, and it is not known if he died leaving an heir or not. This cannot be returned to the owner and is held in trust until the matter becomes clear regarding it. Sometimes return is impossible due to the multitude of owners, like misappropriated booty. After the combatants have dispersed, how can they be gathered? And if one could, how would one distribute a single dinar, for example, among a thousand or two thousand? This should be given in charity.

Or, if it is from wealth of the public treasury and funds designated for the general welfare of the Muslims, it is disbursed to bridges, mosques, hospices, facilities on the route to Mecca, and similar matters from which benefit is shared by every Muslim who passes by them, so that it becomes general for the Muslims.

The ruling of the first category is without ambiguity. As for charity and building bridges, a judge should undertake it, and the wealth is delivered to him if a pious judge is found. If the judge is one who considers unlawful things lawful, then by delivering it to him one becomes liable. If he initiates with what does not make him liable, how then would a liability already established upon him be dropped by this? Rather, a pious scholar from the people of the locality should be appointed as arbitrator, for arbitration is preferable to acting alone. If that fails, then let him undertake it himself, for the objective is the disbursement. As for the specific person disbursing, we merely seek it.

There are subtle expenditures in matters of benefit, so one should not abandon the fundamental act of spending due to an inability to perform a more preferable expenditure when capable of it. If it is asked: What is the proof for the permissibility of giving charity with what is unlawful, and how can one give charity with what one does not own? For a group has held that this is not permissible because it is unlawful. It is narrated from al-Fudayl that two dirhams came into his possession, and when he learned they were from an improper source, he threw them among the stones and said, "I will only give charity with what is pure, and I am not satisfied for others with what I would not be satisfied with for myself."

We say: Yes, that position has a basis and is plausible. However, we have chosen the opposing view due to the Prophetic report, the precedent of the Companions, and analogical reasoning.

As for the Prophetic report: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded giving charity with the roasted sheep that was presented to him, even though it was spoken to him that it was unlawful, for he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Feed it to the captives." This is a report where the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded giving charity with the roasted sheep presented before him, and it was spoken to him that it was unlawful, for he said, "Feed it to the captives." Ahmad narrated it from a report of a man from the Ansar who said: "We went out with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, to a funeral. When we returned, we met the shepherd of a woman from Quraysh who said, 'So-and-so invites you and those with you to a meal.'" In the report, he said, "I find the meat of a sheep taken without the permission of its owners." And in it, he said, "Feed it to the captives." Its chain is sound.

And when the verse was revealed: "Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated in the nearest land..." the polytheists denied it and said to the Companions, "Do you not see what your companion says? He claims the Romans will be victorious." Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, wagered with them by the permission of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. When God confirmed his truthfulness and Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, came with what he had wagered with them, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "This is unlawful gain, so give it in charity." And the believers rejoiced at the victory of God. The prohibition of gambling had been revealed after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had given him permission to wager with the disbelievers. This report of Abu Bakr's wager with the polytheists by his permission, peace and blessings be upon him, when the verse "Alif Lam Mim. The Romans have been defeated..." was revealed, and in it he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "This is unlawful gain, so give it in charity," was reported by al-Bayhaqi in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* from a report of Ibn 'Abbas. It does not contain that it was by his permission, peace and blessings be upon him. The report is in al-Tirmidhi, who graded it good, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, without the statement "This is unlawful gain, so give it in charity."

As for the precedent: Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, purchased a slave girl but could not find her owner to pay him the price. He searched for him extensively but could not find him, so he gave the price in charity and said, "O God, this is on his behalf if he is pleased; otherwise, the reward is for me." Al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, was asked about the repentance of one who embezzles from war booty and what is taken from him after the army has dispersed. He said, "He should give it in charity." It is narrated that a man was tempted by his soul and embezzled one hundred dinars from the spoils. Then he came to the commander to return it to him, but he refused to accept it and said to him, "The people have dispersed." He came to Mu'awiyah, and he refused to accept it. He came to some ascetics who said, "Give one-fifth of it to Mu'awiyah and give the remainder in charity." Mu'awiyah's statement reached him, and he was regretful that this had not occurred to him. Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Harith al-Muhasibi, and a group of the pious have held this view.

As for analogical reasoning: It is said that this wealth is suspended between being wasted and being spent for good, since despair of finding its owner has occurred. By necessity, it is known that spending it for good is preferable to throwing it into the sea. For if we throw it into the sea, we have deprived ourselves and the owner of it, and no benefit is obtained from it. If we throw it into the hand of a poor person who supplicates for its owner, the owner obtains the blessing of his supplication, the poor person's need is met, and the owner attains reward without his choice in the giving of charity. This should not be denied, for in the authentic report, the sower and the planter have a reward for everything that people, birds, and beasts take from their fruits and crops. The report on the reward of the sower and planter for everything that people and birds take is reported by al-Bukhari from a report of Anas: "There is no Muslim who plants a plant or sows a crop, and a human, bird, or beast eats from it, except that it is charity for him." And that is without his choice.

As for the statement of the one who says, "We only give charity with what is pure," that is when we seek reward for ourselves. But here we seek deliverance from the wrong, not reward. We were suspended between wasting and giving charity, and we gave preference to the side of charity over the side of wasting. The statement of the one who says, "We are not satisfied for others with what we would not be satisfied with for ourselves," is likewise. But it is unlawful for us due to our lack of need for it, while for the poor person it is lawful, since the legal proof has made it lawful for him. When benefit necessitates making it lawful, making it lawful becomes obligatory. And if it becomes lawful, then we are satisfied for him with what is lawful.

We say that he may give charity upon himself and his dependents if he is poor. As for his dependents and family, it is not hidden, for poverty is not negated from them by their being from his dependents and family; rather, they are the most deserving of those upon whom charity is given. As for himself, he may...

He may take from it according to his need because he is also poor, and if he were to give it in charity to a poor person, that would be permissible. Likewise, if he himself is the poor person. Let us also outline issues in explaining this principle: Issue: If wealth from the hand of a ruler falls into his possession. Some say it should be returned to the ruler, for he knows best what he has undertaken, and he will entrust it to whom he entrusts, and that is better than giving it in charity. Al-Muhasibi preferred this, saying: How can he give it in charity when perhaps it has a specific owner? If that were permissible, it would be permissible to steal from the ruler and give it in charity. Others say he should give it in charity if he knows the ruler will not return it to its owner, because that is aiding the oppressor and multiplying the means of his oppression. Returning it to him is squandering the right of the owner. The preferred view is that if he knows from the ruler’s habit that he does not return it to its owner, then he should give it in charity on behalf of its owner. That is better for the owner, if there is a specific owner, than returning it to the ruler, because perhaps it has no specific owner and is the right of the Muslims. Returning it to the ruler is squandering. If it has a specific owner, returning it to the ruler is squandering and aiding the oppressive ruler, and forfeiting the blessing of the poor person’s supplication for the owner. This is clear. If it falls into his possession from an inheritance and he has not transgressed by taking it from the ruler, then it resembles a lost property whose owner is despaired of knowing. He may not dispose of it by giving charity on behalf of the owner, but he may take ownership of it. Then, even if he is wealthy in that he acquired it from a permissible means, which is picking up lost property, here the wealth did not come from a permissible means, which affects the prohibition of taking ownership but does not affect the prohibition of giving charity. Issue: If wealth with no owner comes into his possession and we permit him to take according to his need due to his poverty, then regarding the measure of his need there is consideration, which we mentioned in the Book of the Secrets of Zakat. Some have said he may take sufficiency for a year for himself and his dependents, and if he is able to purchase an estate or engage in trade to earn for his family, he should do so. This is what Al-Muhasibi chose, but he said: The best is to give all in charity if he finds in himself the strength of reliance and awaits the grace of God Almighty in lawful provision. If he is not able, then he may purchase an estate or take capital to live decently from it. Each day he finds lawful provision, he refrains from it that day. When it is exhausted, he returns to it. If he finds specific lawful provision, he gives in charity the equivalent of what he previously spent, and that is a loan in his view. Then he eats bread and leaves meat if he is strong enough; otherwise, he eats meat without indulgence or extravagance. What he mentioned has no addition, but making what he spent a loan in his view is subject to consideration. There is no doubt that scrupulousness is to consider it a loan, so when he finds lawful provision he gives its equivalent in charity. However, since this is not obligatory upon the poor person to whom it is given, it is not far-fetched that it is not obligatory upon him either if he takes it due to his poverty, especially if it came into his possession from an inheritance and he was not transgressing by usurping and earning it, such that the matter becomes grave for him. Issue: If he has lawful, unlawful, or doubtful wealth in his possession, and the whole does not exceed his need, if he has dependents, he should reserve the lawful for himself because the proof is more compelling for himself than for his servant and dependents. As for adult children, he guards them from the unlawful if it does not lead them to what is worse than it. If it leads, then he feeds them according to need. In summary, what he avoids for others is to be avoided for himself and more so, because he consumes with knowledge, and dependents may be excused if they do not know, since they did not undertake the matter themselves. So let him begin with the lawful for himself, then for those he supports. If he is conflicted regarding his own right between what is for his food and clothing and other expenses such as the barber’s fee, dyer’s fee, fuller’s fee, porter’s fee, depilation with quicklime, oil, house maintenance, caring for the mount, fueling the oven, firewood price, and lamp oil, he should reserve the lawful for his food and clothing. For what pertains to his body and is indispensable is more deserving of being pure. If the matter revolves between sustenance and clothing, it may be said he reserves sustenance for the lawful because it mixes with his flesh and blood, and any flesh that grows from the unlawful, the Fire is more deserving of it. As for clothing, its benefit is covering his nakedness, repelling heat and cold, and shielding his skin from gazes. This is the most apparent to me. Al-Harith al-Muhasibi said: Clothing takes precedence because it remains on him for a period, while food does not remain, due to what is narrated: God does not accept the prayer of one who wears a garment bought with ten dirhams, among which is a dirham that is unlawful. Hadith: The prayer of one who wears a garment bought with ten dirhams, among which is a dirham that is unlawful, is not accepted. Reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, and it has preceded. This is plausible, but similar to this has come regarding one in whose belly is unlawful and whose flesh grew from the unlawful. Hadith: The body that grew from the unlawful has preceded. So caring that flesh and bone grow from the lawful is more deserving. For that reason, the Truthful One, may God be pleased with him, vomited what he drank out of ignorance until...

No flesh grows from it that remains and endures. If it is asked: Since all is directed toward its purposes, what difference is there between oneself and another, between one direction and another, and what perceives this distinction? We say: This is known through what has been narrated: Rafi‘ ibn Khadij, may God have mercy on him, died and left behind a watering camel and a cupping slave. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about this, and he forbade the earnings of the cupper. He was asked repeatedly, and he prohibited it. It was said, “But he has orphans.” So he said, “Feed them with the watering camel.” The hadith: Rafi‘ ibn Khadij died and left a watering camel and a cupping slave—the hadith includes “Feed them with the watering camel.” Ahmad and al-Tabarani transmitted it from the narration of ‘Ubayyah ibn Rifa‘ah ibn Khadij that his grandfather, when he died, left a slave-girl, a watering camel, and a cupping slave—the hadith. The intended “grandfather” is not Rafi‘ ibn Khadij, for he lived until the year seventy-four. It is possible that the intended is his highest grandfather, which is Khadij, but I have not seen mention of him among the Companions. In a narration of al-Tabarani from ‘Ubayyah ibn Rifa‘ah from his father, he said, “My father died.” In another narration from him from ‘Ubayyah, he said, “Rifa‘ah died during the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him”—the hadith is inconsistent. This indicates the distinction between what he himself eats or what his animal eats. Once the way of distinction is opened, apply to it the detailed classification we mentioned.

Issue: Regarding unlawful wealth in one’s possession—if he gives it in charity to the poor, it is permissible for them, and he may be expansive with it. But if he spends it on himself, let him restrict it as much as possible. And what he spends on his dependents, let him be moderate, taking a middle course between expansiveness and restriction. Thus the matter falls into three levels: If he spends on a guest who comes to him who is poor, let him be expansive with him. If the guest is wealthy, he should not feed him unless he is in a wilderness or arrives at night and finds nothing, for at that time he is poor. If the poor person who comes as a guest is pious and, were he to know, would abstain from it, then let him present the food and inform him, combining the duty of hospitality with avoiding deception. It is not fitting to honor one’s brother with what he dislikes, nor should one rely on the fact that he does not know, thinking it will not harm him. For when the unlawful enters the stomach, it affects the hardness of the heart, even if its owner is unaware. That is why Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, may God be pleased with them, vomited, for they had drunk in ignorance. And this—even if we issue a fatwa that it is lawful for the poor, we permit it due to the ruling of need for it, just as pork and wine are permitted in necessity—it does not join the category of pure, good things.

Issue: If the unlawful or doubtful matter is in the hands of one’s parents, let him refrain from eating with them. If they become displeased, he should not comply with them in pure unlawfulness; rather, he should forbid them, for there is no obedience to any creature in disobedience to God Almighty. If it is doubtful and his abstention is out of scrupulousness, this is countered by the fact that scrupulousness seeks their pleasure—indeed, it is obligatory. So let him be gentle in abstaining. If he is unable, then let him comply and minimize eating by taking small morsels, chewing long, and not being expansive, for that is transgression. Brother and sister are close to this, for their right is also emphasized. Likewise, if his mother clothes him in a garment of doubtful origin and she would be displeased by its rejection, let him accept and wear it in her presence, and remove it in her absence. Let him strive not to pray in it except when she is present, then pray in it the prayer of one compelled. When reasons for scrupulousness conflict, one should examine these subtleties. It is narrated from Bishr, may God have mercy on him, that his mother handed him a fresh date and said, “By my right over you, eat it.” He disliked it but ate, then went up to a room. His mother followed him and saw him vomiting. He did that because he wanted to combine her pleasure with preserving his stomach. It was said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: Bishr was asked whether there is obedience to parents in doubtful matters, and he said no. Ahmad said, “This is strict.” He was told: Muhammad ibn Muqatil al-‘Abadani was asked about it and said, “Be dutiful to your parents.” So what do you say? He said to the questioner, “I prefer you excuse me, for you have heard what they said.” Then he said, “How good it is to show them kindness.”

Issue: One who possesses purely unlawful wealth—no Hajj is incumbent upon him, nor is a financial expiation obligatory, for he is bankrupt. Zakat is not obligatory either, for the meaning of zakat is the obligation to give a quarter of a tenth, for example, while he is obliged to give all of it, either as restitution to the owner if he knows him, or as disbursement to the poor if he does not know the owner. But if it is wealth of doubtful status, possibly lawful, if he does not remove it from his possession, Hajj becomes obligatory, because its being lawful is possible, and Hajj is not waived except by poverty, and his poverty is not confirmed. God Almighty has said, “And pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed to God by all who can afford a way to it.” If he is obliged to give in charity what exceeds his needs where he strongly suspects its prohibition, then zakat is more deserving of being obligatory. If an expiation becomes obligatory, let him combine fasting and freeing a slave to achieve certainty of release. Some have said fasting is obligatory without feeding, since he has no known affluence. Al-Muhasibi said feeding suffices. What we choose is that every doubtful matter we rule must be avoided and we oblige him to remove it from his possession due to the probability of unlawfulness.

The predominant view regarding what we have mentioned is that combining fasting and feeding is obligatory. As for fasting, it is because he is legally deemed insolvent. As for feeding, it is because charity with all of it has become obligatory for him. It is plausible that it may belong to him, thus the obligation from the perspective of expiation becomes a matter for one in whose possession is illicit wealth, which he retains out of necessity, yet desires to perform a voluntary Hajj. If he is traveling on foot, there is no harm for him, for he will consume this wealth in non-worship, and consuming it in worship is more appropriate. If he is incapable of walking and requires additional means for a mount, it is not permissible to take for such a need on the journey, just as it is not permissible to purchase the mount in the city. If he anticipates the ability to obtain lawful means should he remain, such that he can dispense with the remainder of the illicit wealth, then remaining in anticipation of that is preferable to performing Hajj on foot with illicit wealth. The matter of one who sets out for an obligatory Hajj with wealth of dubious origin: let him strive that his sustenance be from pure sources. If he is unable until the time of release from ritual consecration, then if he is unable, let him strive on the day of Arafah that his standing before God and his supplication at the time of his meal not be with illicit food and illicit clothing. Let him strive that there be nothing illicit in his stomach nor on his back. For although we permit this out of necessity, it is a kind of exigency, and what we have associated with pure things—if he is unable, then let him persist in his heart with fear and grief for what he is compelled to partake of that is not pure, so perhaps He will look upon him with an eye of mercy and pardon him due to his sorrow, fear, and aversion. A question was posed to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God have mercy on him, and a man said to him, "My father died and left wealth, and he used to engage in transactions with those whose dealings are disliked." He said, "Set aside from his wealth the equivalent of what he gained." He said to him, "He is owed debts and owes debts." He said, "Pay and collect." He said, "Do you see that?" He said, "Would you leave it held back because of his debt?" What he mentioned is correct, and it indicates that he held the view of scrupulously removing the amount of the illicit, as he said, "He removes the amount of the gain." And he held that the actual properties of his wealth are his possession in exchange for what he expended in invalid transactions, by way of set-off and counterbalance, however numerous the transactions and difficult the restitution. He relied in settling his debt on its certainty, so it is not abandoned due to doubt. The Fifth Chapter: On the stipends and grants of rulers, what is permissible and what is forbidden therefrom. Know that whoever takes wealth from a ruler must necessarily consider three matters: the source from which it entered the ruler's possession, the quality by which he deserves to take it, and the amount he takes—whether he deserves it when considered in light of his own condition and the condition of his partners in entitlement. The first consideration is regarding the sources of the ruler's income. All that is permissible for the ruler besides the living and what is shared by the subjects is of two categories: taken from non-Muslims, which is spoils taken by force, and *fay'* (booty without fighting), which is obtained from their wealth in his possession without combat, and the jizyah (poll tax), and wealth from truce agreements, which is taken by conditions and covenants. The second category is taken from Muslims, and nothing is permissible therefrom except two categories: inheritances and other lost properties for which no owner is specified, and endowments that have no trustee. As for alms, they are not found in this age. All else, such as the land tax imposed on Muslims, confiscations, and various forms of bribery, are all forbidden. If a stipend, grant, or robe of honor is written for a jurist or another on a basis, it does not escape eight situations. For it is written for him either on the jizyah, or on inheritances, or on endowments, or on the personal property of the ruler, or on property he purchased, or on an agent of the Muslim land tax, or on a merchant among the traders, or on the treasury. The first is the jizyah: four-fifths of it are for public interests and one-fifth for specified purposes. What is written from that fifth for those purposes or from the four-fifths for what contains a public interest, and wherein caution is observed in the amount, is permissible, provided that the jizyah is only imposed in a legally prescribed manner, with no increase over a dinar or over four dinars, for that too is within the scope of scholarly discretion, and the ruler may do what is within that scope; and provided that the *dhimmi* from whom the jizyah is taken earns from a source not known to be forbidden, so he is not an oppressive ruler's agent, nor a seller of wine, nor a child, nor a woman, for there is no jizyah upon them. These are matters to be observed in the manner of imposing the jizyah, its amount, the description of the one to whom it is disbursed, and the amount disbursed. Careful consideration of all that is necessary. The second: inheritances and lost properties. They are for public interests. The consideration is whether what he left was all illicit wealth, or most of it, or little of it—its ruling has preceded. If it was not illicit, then consideration remains regarding the quality of the one to whom it is disbursed, that there be a public interest in disbursing to him, then regarding the amount disbursed. The third: endowments. Similarly, consideration proceeds in them as it proceeds in inheritance, with additional considerations.

A command, which is a condition of the appointed times, so that what is taken conforms to it in all its conditions. The fourth is what the ruler revives, and this does not require a condition, for he may give from his property to whomever he wishes, any amount he wishes. The consideration lies in that the prevalent case is that he revived it by compelling workers or by paying their wages from unlawful sources. For revival is achieved by digging canals and rivers, building walls, and leveling the land, and the ruler does not undertake it personally. If they were compelled to the action, the ruler does not own it, and it is unlawful. If they were hired, then their wages were paid from unlawful sources, this gives rise to suspicion, which we have alerted to concerning the attachment of honor to compensations. The fifth is what the ruler purchases on credit, whether land, garments of honor, a horse, or other, it is his property and he may dispose of it, but he will pay its price from unlawful sources, and that necessitates prohibition at times and suspicion at others, and its details have preceded. The sixth is that it be written upon a tax collector of the Muslims or one who gathers their wealth through division and confiscation, which is the unlawful, usurious gain in which there is no suspicion, and it is the most prevalent of incomes in this era, except for what is upon the lands of Iraq, for they are an endowment according to Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, for the welfare of the Muslims. The seventh is what is written upon a merchant who deals with the ruler. If he deals with no one else, his wealth is like the wealth of the ruler's treasury. If he deals with others more than with the rulers, what he gives is a loan to the ruler and he will take its equivalent from the treasury, so deficiency enters into the compensation, and the ruling on unlawful price has preceded. The eighth is what is written upon the treasury or upon an agent with whom lawful and unlawful wealth accumulates. If it is not known that the ruler has any income except from the unlawful, it is pure usury. If it is known with certainty that the treasury comprises lawful and unlawful wealth, and it is likely that what is delivered to him specifically is from the lawful, a likelihood close to certainty that settles in the heart, and it is likely that it is from the unlawful—which is the more prevalent because most of the wealth of rulers in these times is unlawful, and the lawful in their hands is nonexistent or rare—then people have differed regarding this. Some said: "Everything I am not certain is unlawful, I may take." Others said: "It is not permissible to take anything unless it is verified to be lawful, so no suspicion is permissible at all." Both are extremes, and the moderate position is what we have previously mentioned, which is the ruling that if the prevalent is unlawful, it is prohibited, and if the prevalent is lawful but contains certain unlawful, it is a place of our hesitation, as preceded. Those who permitted taking the wealth of rulers when it contains unlawful and lawful, as long as it is not verified that the specific item taken is unlawful, argued with what is reported from a group of the Companions that they encountered the days of oppressive rulers and took wealth from them: Abu Hurairah, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, Zayd ibn Thabit, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Jarir ibn 'Abdullah, Jabir, Anas ibn Malik, and al-Miswar ibn Makhramah. Thus, Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurairah took from Marwan and Yazid ibn 'Abd al-Malik; Ibn 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas took from al-Hajjaj; and many of the Successors took from them, such as al-Sha'bi, Ibrahim, al-Hasan, and Ibn Abi Layla. Al-Shafi'i took from Harun al-Rashid a thousand dinars at once; Malik took abundant wealth from the caliphs. And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "Take what the ruler gives you, for he only gives you from the lawful, and what he takes from the lawful is more." Those who refrained from taking the gifts from them did so out of scrupulousness, fearing for their religion that they might be burdened with what is not lawful. Do you not see the statement of Abu Dharr to al-Ahnaf ibn Qays: "Take the gift as long as it is a bestowal, but when it becomes the price of your religion, then leave it." And Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, said: "When we are given, we accept, and when we are denied, we do not ask." And from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib that Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, when Mu'awiyah gave to him, he remained silent, and when he denied him, he spoke against him. And from al-Sha'bi from Masruq: "The gift will continue with the people of the gift until it enters them into the Fire," meaning it leads them to the unlawful, not that it is in itself unlawful. And it is reported from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, that al-Mukhtar used to send him wealth, and he would accept it, then say: "I do not ask anyone, nor do I reject what God has provided me." And a she-camel was gifted to him, and he accepted it, and it was called "the she-camel of al-Mukhtar." But this is contradicted by what is reported that Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, did not reject anyone's gift except the gift of al-Mukhtar, and the chain of narration for his rejection is more established. And from Nafi' that he said: "Ibn Ma'mar sent to Ibn 'Umar sixty thousand, and he distributed it among the people. Then a beggar came to him, so he borrowed for him from some of those he had given to and gave to the beggar." And when al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, may God be pleased with them, came to Mu'awiyah, may God be pleased with him, he said: "I will reward you with a reward I have not given to anyone before you among the Arabs, nor will I give it to anyone after you among the Arabs." He said: So he gave him four hundred thousand dirhams, and he took them. And from Habib ibn Abi Thabit, he said:

I have indeed seen the chosen reward for Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas, and they accepted it. When asked what it was, they said: "Wealth and clothing."

From Al-Zubayr ibn 'Adi, who said: Salman said: "If you have a friend who is an official or a merchant dealing in usury, and he invites you to a meal or the like, or gives you something, then accept it. For the benefit is for you, and the sin is upon him." If this is established regarding the one dealing in usury, then the oppressor is in a similar meaning.

From Ja'far, from his father, that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, peace be upon them, used to accept the gifts of Mu'awiyah.

And Hakim ibn Jubayr said: "We passed by Sa'id ibn Jubayr when he had been made an official over the lower Euphrates. He sent to the tax collectors: 'Feed us from what you have.' So they sent food, and he ate, and we ate with him."

And Al-'Ala' ibn Zuhayr al-Azdi said: "Ibrahim Abi came to him while he was an official over Hulwan, and he rewarded him, and he accepted." And Ibrahim said: "There is no harm in the gifts of officials, for officials have expenses and provision, and both the impure and pure wealth enters his treasury. So what he gives you is from the pure portion of his wealth."

Thus, all of these individuals accepted the gifts of oppressive rulers, yet all of them condemned those who obeyed them in disobedience to God Almighty.

This faction claims that what is transmitted regarding the refusal of a group of the early generations does not indicate prohibition, but rather indicates piety and scrupulousness, like the Rightly Guided Caliphs, Abu Dharr, and other ascetics. For they refrained from what is absolutely permissible out of asceticism, and from permissible things they feared might lead to something blameworthy out of scrupulousness and God-consciousness. Therefore, the action of these [who accepted] indicates permissibility, and the refusal of those does not indicate prohibition.

What is transmitted from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab—that he left his stipend in the public treasury until it accumulated to over thirty thousand—and what is transmitted from Al-Hasan—his saying, "I do not perform ablution with the water of a money-changer, even if the prayer time becomes constrained, because I do not know the origin of his wealth"—all of that is scrupulousness, not to be denied. Following them in this is better than following them in leniency, but following them in leniency is also not prohibited.

These are the arguments of those who permit taking the wealth of an oppressive ruler.

The response is that what is transmitted regarding these individuals accepting is limited and few in comparison to what is transmitted regarding their rejection and disapproval. Even if the possibility of scrupulousness can be applied to their refusal, then three possibilities of varying degrees—according to their varying levels of scrupulousness—can be applied to the acceptance of those who accepted.

For scrupulousness regarding rulers has four degrees:

The first degree is to not take anything from their wealth at all, as the scrupulous among them did, and as the Rightly Guided Caliphs used to do. So much so that Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, accounted for all he had taken from the public treasury, and it amounted to six thousand dirhams, so he repaid it to the treasury. And so much so that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, was distributing the wealth of the treasury one day when his daughter entered and took a dirham from the wealth. 'Umar rose to pursue her until her cloak fell from one of her shoulders, and the girl entered her family's house crying, having put the dirham in her mouth. 'Umar inserted his finger and extracted it from her mouth, threw it back onto the pile, and said: "O people, neither 'Umar nor the family of 'Umar have any right except what the Muslims, near and far, have." And Abu Musa al-Ash'ari swept the treasury and found a dirham. He passed by one of 'Umar's sons, may God be pleased with him, and gave it to him. 'Umar saw it in the boy's hand and asked him about it. He said: "Abu Musa gave it to me." He said: "O Abu Musa, was there no house in Medina more insignificant to you than the house of 'Umar? You wanted that there would remain no one from the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, except that we would be sought for injustice?" And he returned the dirham to the treasury. This, despite the wealth being permissible, but he feared he was not entitled to that amount, so he sought purity for his religion and restricted himself to the minimum, in compliance with his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt." (The hadith "Leave that which makes you doubt..." has preceded in the first chapter on the Permissible and the Prohibited.) And his saying: "And whoever abandons it has sought purity for his honor and his religion." (The hadith "Whoever abandons it has sought purity for his religion and his honor" is agreed upon, from the hadith of al-Nu'man ibn Bashir, and its beginning has preceded in the start of the second chapter on the Permissible and the Prohibited.) And due to what he heard from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding the severe warnings concerning the wealth of rulers, until he said, peace and blessings be upon him, when he sent 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit to collect charity: "Fear God, O Abu al-Walid. Do not come on the Day of Resurrection with a camel you carry on your neck, bellowing, or a cow, lowing, or a sheep, bleating." He said: "O Messenger of God, is it so?" He said: "Yes, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, except whom God has mercy upon." He said: "Then, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I will never work for anything again." (The hadith: It was said to 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit when he was sent to collect charity: "Fear God, O Abu al-Walid, do not come on the Day of Resurrection with a camel you carry on your neck..." Al-Shafi'i transmitted it in the Musnad from the hadith of Tawus, as a mursal narration. And Abu Ya'la in al-Mu'jam from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, abbreviated, that he said it to Sa'd.)

The chain of transmission is sound from Ibn 'Ubada. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I do not fear that you will associate partners with Allah after me, but I fear that you will compete with one another [for worldly gain]." This hadith, "I do not fear that you will associate partners with Allah after me, but I fear that you will compete with one another," is agreed upon as authentic from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir. The fear was specifically regarding competition for wealth. For this reason, 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said in a lengthy narration where he mentioned the treasury's wealth: "I do not find myself in relation to it except like a guardian of an orphan's wealth: if I am in need, I take a reasonable portion, and if I am not, I abstain." It is also narrated that a son of Tawus forged a letter in his father's name to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, who then gave him three hundred dinars. Tawus sold one of his own estates and sent three hundred dinars from its price back to 'Umar. This was despite the fact that the ruler was not like 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz. This represents the highest degree of scrupulous piety.

The second degree is for a person to take from the ruler's wealth, but only when he knows that what he takes is from a lawful source. The ruler's hand possessing other unlawful wealth does not harm him. This is the understanding upon which most, if not all, of the narrations are based, particularly those concerning the leading Companions and the pious among them, such as Ibn 'Umar. He was among the most extreme in scrupulous piety, so how could he be liberal with the ruler's wealth when he was among the most severe in condemning them and their wealth? They gathered around Ibn 'Amir during his illness, and he expressed fear for his soul due to his governorship and being held accountable by Allah for it. They said to him, "We hope good for you; you dug wells, provided water for pilgrims, did such and such," while Ibn 'Umar remained silent. He was asked, "What do you say, O Ibn 'Umar?" He replied, "I say that if the earning is pure and the spending is virtuous, then [it is accepted]. But you will be returned [to Allah] and you will see." In another narration, he said, "The impure does not expiate the impure. You governed Basra, and I do not think you acquired anything from it except evil." Ibn 'Amir said to him, "Will you not supplicate for me?" Ibn 'Umar replied, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'Allah does not accept prayer without purification, nor charity from misappropriated gains.'" This hadith, "Allah does not accept prayer without purification, nor charity from misappropriated gains," was reported by Muslim from Ibn 'Umar. "And you governed Basra." This was his statement regarding what Ibn 'Amir had spent on good deeds. It is narrated from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said during the days of al-Hajjaj, "I have not eaten my fill of food since the House [the Ka'bah? Or his home? The context suggests a calamity] was plundered until this day of mine." It is narrated from 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that he had sealed barley meal in a container from which he would drink. He was asked, "Do you do this in Iraq despite the abundance of food?" He replied, "I do not seal it due to miserliness, but I dislike that something not from it be put into it, and I dislike that anything impure enter my stomach." This was their customary practice. Nothing pleased Ibn 'Umar but that he would dispose of it. Nafi' asked him for thirty thousand, and he said, "I fear they may be the dirhams of Ibn 'Amir," though he was the one asking. He said, "Go, you are free." Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "There is none among us whom the world did not incline towards, except Ibn 'Umar." From this, it becomes clear that one should not suspect him, or those of his standing, of taking wealth they knew was unlawful.

The third degree is to take what one receives from the ruler in order to give it in charity to the poor or distribute it to those deserving. This is the ruling in Islamic law regarding wealth whose specific owner is not known. If the ruler, were one not to take it from him, would not distribute it but would use it to aid in oppression, then we might say that taking it from him and distributing it is better than leaving it in his hand. Some scholars held this view, and its reasoning will come later. This is the understanding upon which the practice of most of them is based. Therefore, Ibn al-Mubarak said, "Those who take gifts today and use Ibn 'Umar and 'A'ishah as proof are not following their example, for Ibn 'Umar distributed what he took until he had to borrow sixty thousand in the very gathering after distributing it, and 'A'ishah did likewise. Jabir ibn Zayd had wealth come to him, so he gave it in charity and said, 'I considered that taking it from them and giving it in charity is more beloved to me than leaving it in their hands.'" Similarly, al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, did with what he accepted from Harun al-Rashid; he distributed it to those near him until he did not keep a single grain for himself.

The fourth degree is when one is not certain it is lawful, and he does not distribute it but keeps it, yet he takes from a ruler most of whose wealth is lawful. This was the state of the caliphs during the time of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, and the Followers after the Rightly Guided Caliphs. Most of their wealth was not unlawful. This is indicated by the reasoning of 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, when he said, "For what he takes from the lawful is more." This is what a group of scholars permitted, relying on the preponderance [of lawful wealth]. We only hesitate in this matter regarding common people. The wealth of the ruler is more akin to being beyond precise accounting, so it is not far-fetched that a scholar's independent reasoning could lead to permitting the taking of what is not known to be unlawful, relying on what is most probable. We only forbid it when the majority is unlawful. If you understand these degrees, you will realize that the stipends from oppressive rulers...

In our time, this does not follow the same course, and it differs from it in two decisive aspects. The first is that the wealth of rulers in our era is entirely, or mostly, unlawful. How could it be otherwise, when lawful wealth consists of alms, *fay'*, and spoils of war? These have no existence, and nothing from them enters the ruler's possession. Nothing remains but the poll-tax, and it is taken through types of injustice that make its collection unlawful. For they transgress the legal limits regarding what is taken, from whom it is taken, and fulfilling its stipulated conditions. Then, if you compare that to what flows to them from the land-tax imposed upon Muslims, from confiscations, bribes, and various forms of injustice, it does not reach a tenth of a tenth of its portion.

The second aspect is that the unjust rulers of the early era, due to their proximity to the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, were conscious of their injustice, eager to win the hearts of the Companions and the Successors, and keen for them to accept their gifts and rewards. They would send to them without being asked and without humiliation; rather, they would consider it a favor for them to accept and would rejoice in it. And they (the scholars) would take from them and distribute it, and they would not obey the rulers in their desires, nor frequent their gatherings, nor amass great collections, nor desire their permanence. Rather, they would pray against them, speak freely about them, and denounce their wrongdoings to them. Thus, there was no fear that they would be afflicted in their religion to the extent they were afflicted in their worldly affairs, and they were not seized by any distress.

As for now, the souls of the rulers do not permit giving a gift except to those from whom they hope to gain service, to increase their own prestige through them, to seek their aid for their own purposes, to adorn themselves by their frequenting their gatherings, and to oblige them to persist in supplication, praise, commendation, and flattery in their presence and absence. If the recipient did not humble himself firstly by asking, secondly by frequent attendance in service, thirdly by praise and supplication, fourthly by assisting him in his purposes when aid is sought, fifthly by increasing his assembly in his council and retinue, sixthly by showing love, allegiance, and support for him against his enemies, and seventhly by concealing his injustice, his vile acts, and the faults of his deeds—he would not be granted a single dirham, even if he possessed the merit of al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, for example.

Therefore, it is not permissible to take from them in this time what is known to be lawful, because it leads to these implications, so how about what is known to be unlawful or is doubtful? Whoever dares to take from their wealth and likens himself to the Companions and the Successors has indeed compared angels to blacksmiths. For in taking wealth from them, there is a need to associate with them, to show them regard, to serve their agents, to endure humiliation from them, to praise them, and to frequent their gates—and all of that is disobedience, as we will clarify in the chapter following this.

Thus, from what has preceded, the sources of their wealth and what is lawful and unlawful from it have become clear. If one could imagine a person taking from it what is lawful, to the extent of his due, while sitting in his home and it is brought to him—without needing to seek out an agent and serve him, nor to praise and commend them, nor to assist them—then taking would not be unlawful, but it would be disliked for certain reasons which we will point out in the chapter following this second consideration of this chapter, concerning the amount taken and the manner of taking.

Let us assume the wealth is from public welfare funds, such as four-fifths of the *fay'* and inheritances. As for other than that, whose rightful claimant is specified—if it is from an endowment, alms, one-fifth of the *fay'*, or one-fifth of spoils of war, or if it is from the ruler's own property which he developed or purchased—then he may give what he wishes to whom he wishes. The consideration is only regarding lost property and public welfare funds. It is not permissible to disburse them except to one in whom there is a general benefit or who is in need of it and incapable of earning. As for the rich person in whom there is no benefit, it is not permissible to disburse any wealth from the public treasury to him—this is the correct view, even though scholars have differed regarding it. And in the statement of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, there is an indication that every Muslim has a right in the public treasury by virtue of being a Muslim who strengthens the collective body of Islam. But despite this, he did not distribute the wealth to all Muslims generally, but only to specific individuals with certain qualities.

If this is established, then everyone who undertakes a responsibility by which a benefit extending to the Muslims is accomplished—and if he were to engage in earning, what he is engaged in would be neglected—has a right in the public treasury to sufficiency. This includes all scholars—I mean the sciences related to the welfare of the religion, such as the knowledge of jurisprudence, Hadith, exegesis, and recitation—so that it includes teachers, muezzins, and students of these sciences as well, for if they are not provided for, they cannot pursue their studies. It also includes the workers, meaning those upon whose works the welfare of the world depends, and they are the paid soldiers who guard the kingdom with swords against hostile people, rebels, and the enemies of Islam. And it includes the scribes and accountants.

And the agents, and all who are needed in organizing the bureau of the treasury—I mean the officials over lawful wealth, not over the unlawful—for this wealth is for public interests. The public interest pertains either to religion or to the world: through the scholars, religion is safeguarded; through the soldiers, the world is safeguarded. Religion and sovereignty are twins; neither can do without the other. As for the physician, even though his knowledge is not linked to a religious matter, it is linked to bodily health, and religion follows it. Thus, it is permissible for him, and for those like him in the sciences needed for the welfare of bodies or the welfare of the lands, to receive a stipend from these funds so that they may devote themselves to treating Muslims—I mean those who treat without charge. Need is not a condition for these; rather, it is permissible to give to them even if they are wealthy, for the Rightly Guided Caliphs used to give to the Emigrants and the Helpers, and they were not known to be in need. Nor is it measured by a fixed amount; rather, it is according to the discretion of the Imam. He may expand and enrich, or he may limit to sufficiency, as the situation and the abundance of wealth dictate. Indeed, al-Hasan, peace be upon him, took from Mu'awiyah in one installment four hundred thousand dirhams. And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to give to a group twelve thousand dirhams in cash per year. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, recorded in this register for a group ten thousand, and for a group six thousand, and so on. Thus, this is the wealth of these people, and it is distributed among them until nothing remains of it. If he singles out one of them with a large amount, there is no harm. Likewise, the ruler may single out from this wealth those with special merits by granting robes of honor and rewards, for that was done in earlier times. However, one should consider in it the public interest. Whenever a scholar or a brave person is singled out with a gift, it serves as an incentive for people and an encouragement to engage and emulate him. This is the benefit of robes of honor, gifts, and types of special grants, and all of that is tied to the discretion of the ruler.

As for the consideration regarding oppressive rulers, it concerns two matters. First, the oppressive ruler must refrain from his authority; he is either deposed or must be deposed, so how is it permissible to take from his hand when, in truth, he is not a legitimate ruler? Second, he does not distribute his wealth to all those entitled, so how is it permissible for individuals to take? Is it permissible for them to take according to their shares, or is it not permissible at all, or is it permissible for each to take what is given? As for the first: what we hold is that taking what is rightfully due is not prohibited, because the oppressive, ignorant ruler, as long as strength supports him and his removal is difficult, and replacing him would lead to unbearable turmoil, must be left in place, and obedience to him is obligatory, just as obedience to commanders is obligatory. For there has come a hadith commanding obedience to commanders, reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas: "Hear and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave whose head is like a raisin is appointed over you." And by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Upon you is obedience in your ease and your hardship," the hadith. And by him from the narration of Abu Dharr: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, enjoined me to hear and obey, even if to a slave with amputated limbs." And the prohibition from withdrawing support is a hadith reported by the two Shaykhs from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "Whoever separates from the community by a handspan and dies, dies a death of ignorance." And by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever withdraws from obedience and separates from the community and dies, dies a death of ignorance." And by him from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever withdraws his hand from obedience will meet God on the Day of Resurrection without any proof." There are commands and prohibitions. What we hold is that the caliphate is established for those who undertake it from the Abbasids, may God be pleased with them, and that authority is effective for the rulers in the regions of the lands and those who pledge allegiance to the Caliph. We have mentioned in the book "al-Mustazhiri," derived from the book "Kashf al-Asrar wa Hatk al-Astar" by Judge Abu al-Tayyib, in refuting the various groups of the Rawafid from the Batiniyyah, what points to the aspect of public interest in it. The concise statement is that we observe the qualities and conditions in rulers, aspiring to the advantages of public interests. If we were to judge the invalidity of authorities now, public interests would be utterly nullified. How can the principal be lost in seeking profit? Rather, authority now follows only strength: whoever is pledged allegiance by the possessor of strength is the Caliph, and whoever monopolizes strength while being obedient to the Caliph in the fundamental matters of the sermon and coinage is a ruler with effective judgment and jurisdiction in the regions of the earth—an authority with effective rulings. The verification of this we have mentioned in the rulings of the imamate from the book "al-Iqtisad fi al-I'tiqad," so we do not elaborate on it now.

As for the other issue, which is: if the ruler does not distribute the grant to every entitled person, is it permissible for an individual to take from him? This is something in which the scholars have differed, on four levels. Some went to extremes and said every...

What he takes, all Muslims are partners in it, and he does not know whether his share of it is a daniq or a grain, so he should leave it all. Some said he may take only the amount sufficient for his day's sustenance, for this amount he is entitled to due to his need upon the Muslims. Others said he may take sustenance for a year, for taking sufficiency each day is difficult, and he has a right in this wealth, so how can he abandon it? Others said, and yet others said, that he takes what is given, and the wronged are those who remain. This is the analogy, for the wealth is not shared among the Muslims like spoils among the conquerors, nor like an inheritance among the heirs, for that became their property. This, if its division was not agreed upon until these people died, distribution to their heirs by the rule of inheritance would not be obligatory. Rather, this right is not specified; it only becomes specified by taking possession. Indeed, it is like alms. Whenever the poor are given their share of alms, it becomes their property, and the injustice of the giver does not prevent the other categories from being denied their right—this is if not all the wealth is directed to him, but rather from the wealth, what if directed to him by way of preference and favoritism while including others, it would be permissible for him to take it. Favoritism is permissible in giving, except for Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, referred to him, saying, "I only prefer them before God, and the world is but a provision." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, showed favoritism in his time, giving 'A'isha twelve thousand, Zaynab ten thousand, Juwayriyah six thousand, and likewise Safiyyah. And 'Umar granted 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both, a special grant, and 'Uthman also granted from the Sawad five gardens, and 'Uthman preferred 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both, with them, and he accepted that from him and did not disapprove. All of that is permissible in the realm of ijtihad, and it is among the matters of ijtihad about which I say that every mujtahid is correct. These are every issue for which there is no explicit text regarding it, nor regarding an issue close to it that would be in its meaning by a clear analogy, like this issue and the issue of the punishment for drinking, for they lashed forty and eighty, and all are Sunnah and right, and each one of Abu Bakr and 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, is correct by the consensus of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, for the less preferred did not return anything to the more preferred in the time of 'Umar that he had taken in the time of Abu Bakr, nor did the more preferred refuse to accept preference in the time of 'Umar, and all the Companions participated in that and believed that each of the two opinions was true. So let this category be taken as a principle for disagreements in which every mujtahid is correct. As for every issue where a mujtahid deviates due to an oversight or poor judgment, and there is an explicit text or clear analogy, and it is of such strength that it overturns the ruling of the mujtahid, we do not say in it that each one is correct; rather, the correct one is he who hits upon the text or what is in the meaning of the text. It may be concluded from all this that whoever from the people of distinction, described with a quality related to the interests of religion or the world, takes from the ruler a robe of honor or a stipend from estates or the jizyah, does not become a sinner merely by taking it. He only becomes a sinner by serving them, assisting them, entering upon them, praising and flattering them, and other such necessities, for wealth is usually not obtained except through them, as we will explain in the sixth chapter concerning what is permissible from mixing with oppressive rulers and what is forbidden, and the ruling on frequenting their gatherings, entering upon them, and honoring them. Know that you have three states with oppressive rulers and officials: The first state, which is the worst, is that you enter upon them. The second, which is lesser, is that they enter upon you. The third, which is the safest, is that you seclude yourself from them, so you do not see them and they do not see you. As for the first state, which is entering upon them, it is greatly blameworthy in the Shari'ah, and there are severe warnings and strictures that have come in reports and traditions, so we will transmit them so you may know the blame of the Shari'ah for it. Then we will address what is forbidden, what is permissible, and what is disliked according to what the legal verdict requires based on the apparent knowledge. As for the reports: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, described the oppressive rulers, he said, "Whoever opposes them is saved, whoever isolates himself from them is safe or nearly safe, and whoever falls into their worldly affairs is among them." A hadith: "Whoever opposes them is saved, whoever isolates himself from them is safe or nearly safe, and whoever falls into their worldly affairs is among them." Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain. And he said, "Whoever mixes with them is ruined." That is because whoever isolates himself from them is safe from their trial, but he is not safe from a punishment that befalls them collectively if it descends upon them due to his abandoning opposition and contention. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "There will be after me rulers who lie and oppress. Whoever confirms them in their lies and assists them in their oppression is not from me, and I am not from him, and he will not come to the Hawd (Pool)." A hadith: "There will be after me rulers who lie and oppress. Whoever confirms them in their lies and assists them in their oppression is not from me, and I am not from him, and he will not come to the Hawd." Al-Nasa'i and al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and declared it sound, and al-Hakim from the hadith of Ka'b ibn 'Ujrah. And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that...

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The most detestable of reciters to Allah the Exalted are those who frequent the rulers."

A narration from Abu Hurairah: "The most detestable of reciters to Allah the Mighty and Majestic are those who come to the rulers." It is mentioned in knowledge and in reports: "The best of rulers are those who come to the scholars, and the worst of scholars are those who come to the rulers." And in the report: "The scholars are the trustees of the messengers over the servants of Allah, as long as they do not mingle with the sultan. If they do that, then they have betrayed the messengers, so beware of them and avoid them."

A narration from Anas: "The scholars are the trustees of the messengers over the servants of Allah, as long as they do not mingle with the sultan." The narration was reported by Al-'Uqayli in "Ad-Du'afa'" in the biography of Hafs al-Abri, and he said: "His narration is not preserved." It is mentioned in knowledge, narrated by Anas (may Allah be pleased with him).

As for the narrations: Hudhayfah said: "Beware of the positions of trials." It was said: "And what are they?" He said: "The gates of the rulers. One of you enters upon a ruler and affirms him in falsehood and says what is not in him."

And Abu Dharr said to Salamah: "O Salamah, do not frequent the gates of the sultans, for you will not attain anything of their world except that they take from your religion what is better than it."

And Sufyan said: "In Hell there is a valley inhabited only by reciters who visit kings."

And Al-Awza'i said: "There is nothing more detestable to Allah than a scholar who visits a ruler."

And Sumnun said: "What is most vile for a scholar is that he is sought at his gathering and is not found, so he is asked about and it is said: 'He is with the ruler.' And I used to hear it said: 'If you see a scholar loving the world, then be suspicious of him regarding your religion,' until I experienced that, for whenever I entered upon this sultan, I would account myself after leaving and find upon it degradation, despite what I confront them with of harshness and opposition to their desires."

And 'Ubadah ibn As-Samit said: "The love of the ascetic reciter for the rulers is hypocrisy, and his love for the wealthy is ostentation."

And Abu Dharr said: "Whoever increases the multitude of a people is from them," meaning whoever increases the multitude of the oppressors.

And Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "Indeed, a man may enter upon a sultan with his religion and leave without his religion." It was said to him: "Why?" He said: "Because he pleases him by angering Allah."

And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz appointed a man, and it was said: "He was an agent for Al-Hajjaj," so he dismissed him. The man said: "I only worked for him a little." He said to him: "Your companionship of him for a day or part of a day is enough for you as an ill omen and evil."

And Al-Fudayl said: "A man does not increase in closeness to one in authority except that he increases in distance from Allah."

And Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab used to trade in oil and say: "Indeed, in this is sufficiency from these sultans."

And Wahb said: "Those who enter upon kings are more harmful to the community than the gamblers."

And Muhammad ibn Salamah said: "Flies on filth are better than a reciter at the gate of these people."

And when Az-Zuhri mingled with the sultan, a brother of his in religion wrote to him: "May Allah grant us and you, Abu Bakr, safety from trials. You have become in a state for which one who knows you should supplicate to Allah for you and have mercy on you. You have become a great elder, weighed down by the favors of Allah for what He has given you understanding of from His Book and taught you from the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). And it is not like that that Allah took the covenant from the scholars. Allah the Exalted said: 'To make it clear to the people and not conceal it.' And know that the easiest of what you have committed and the lightest of what you have borne is that you have comforted the loneliness of the oppressor and facilitated the path of transgression by your proximity to one who has not fulfilled a right nor abandoned falsehood. When they brought you close, they took you as an axis around which the millstone of their injustice turns, a bridge over which they cross to their calamity, a ladder upon which they ascend to their misguidance. Through you they cast doubt upon the scholars and with you they hunt the hearts of the ignorant. How little they have built compared to what they have destroyed for you, and how much they have taken from you in what they have corrupted of your religion. What assures you that you are not among those about whom Allah the Exalted said: 'But there came after them successors who neglected prayer...'? And you are dealing with One who is not ignorant and keeping account of you is One who is not heedless. So cure your religion, for sickness has entered it, and prepare your provision, for a distant journey has drawn near. And nothing is hidden from Allah in the earth or in the heaven. And peace."

These reports and narrations indicate what is in mingling with sultans of trials and types of corruption. But we detail that with a juristic distinction, differentiating therein the prohibited from the disliked and the permissible. So we say: The one who enters upon the sultan exposes himself to disobeying Allah the Exalted, either by his action, his silence, his speech, or his belief. He does not escape one of these matters.

As for the action: Entering upon them in most cases is to usurped dwellings, and traversing them and entering them without the permission of the owner is forbidden. Let not the saying of the one who says that this is among what people are lenient about, like a date or a crumb of bread, deceive you. That is true regarding what is not usurped. As for the usurped, then no, because if it is said that every light sitting that does not diminish the property is in the realm of leniency, and likewise passing through, this would apply to every individual and thus also to the collective, and usurpation would then be complete...

The act of all together is only tolerated when done individually, for if the owner knew of it, he might not dislike it. However, if it becomes a means to total consumption through sharing, the ruling of prohibition extends to all. It is not permissible to take a man's property as a path, relying on the fact that each passerby merely takes a step that does not diminish the property, because the collective results in loss of property. This is like a light blow in teaching that is permitted, but on condition of being alone. If a group gathers with blows that cause death, retribution is due on all, even though each blow individually would not necessitate retribution. If the oppressor is in a place not usurped, like barren land, but under a tent or canopy from his wealth, it is forbidden, and entering it is not permissible because it is benefiting from and seeking shade with the forbidden. If all that is lawful, then entering is not sinful merely as entry, nor by saying "Peace be upon you." But if one prostrates, bows, or stands similarly in greeting and serving him, he honors the oppressor due to his authority, which is an instrument of his oppression. Humility before an oppressor is a sin; indeed, one who humbles before a rich person not for oppression but for his wealth alone, without another reason requiring humility, loses a third of his faith. How then if he humbles before an oppressor? Only mere greeting is permitted; as for kissing the hand and bowing in service, it is sinful except in fear, or before a just leader, a scholar, or one deserving it for a religious reason. Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, may God be pleased with him, kissed the hand of 'Ali, may God honor his face, when he met him in Syria, and it was not disapproved. Some predecessors even refrained from returning their greeting in reply and turning away from them in disdain, considering that among the merits of nearness to God. As for silence in not replying, there is consideration because it is obligatory and should not be waived due to oppression. If the entrant leaves all that and confines himself to greeting, he is not free from sitting on their carpet. If most of their wealth is unlawful, it is not permissible to sit on their furnishings—this from the aspect of action. As for silence, it is that he will see in their gathering silk furnishings, silver vessels, and silk worn by them and their servants, which is unlawful. Whoever sees an evil and remains silent about it is a partner in that evil. He will hear from their speech what is obscenity, falsehood, insult, and harm, and silence on all that is forbidden. He will see them wearing unlawful clothes, eating unlawful food, and all in their hands is unlawful, and silence on that is not permissible. He must enjoin good and forbid evil with his tongue if unable by action. If you say he fears for himself, he is excused in silence—this is true—but he is better off not exposing himself to commit what is only permitted with excuse. If he did not enter and witness, the obligation of commanding right would not be directed at him so as to be waived due to excuse. At this, I say: whoever knows corruption in a place and knows he cannot remove it, it is not permissible for him to attend so that it occurs before him while he watches and remains silent; rather, he should avoid witnessing it. As for speech, it is to supplicate for the oppressor, praise him, or affirm him in what he says of falsehood by explicit word, nodding, showing delight in his face, or displaying love, allegiance, longing to meet him, and eagerness for his long life and permanence. For he mostly does not confine himself to greeting but speaks, and his speech does not exceed these categories. As for supplicating for him, it is not lawful except to say, "May God rectify you," or "May God guide you to good deeds," or "May God lengthen your life in His obedience," or what follows this course. But supplication for protection, long permanence, and bestowing favor while addressing as "master" or similar is not permissible. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever supplicates for an oppressor to remain has loved that God be disobeyed in His earth." If it exceeds supplication to praise, he will mention what is not in him, thus being a liar, hypocrite, and honorer of an oppressor—these are three sins. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God becomes angry when the corrupt is praised." In another report: "Whoever honors a corrupt person has aided in demolishing Islam." If it exceeds that to affirming him in what he says, declaring him righteous, and praising what he does, he sins by affirmation and assistance, for declaring righteous and praising is assistance to sin and incitement to desire for it, just as denial, blame, and censure deter from it and weaken its motives. Assisting in sin is a sin, even with half a word. Sufyan al-Thawri, may God be pleased with him, was asked about an oppressor who appeared...

If one is perishing in a desert, should he be given a drink of water? He said: No, leave him until he dies, for that is an assistance to him. Another said: He should be given to drink until his soul returns to him, then one should turn away from him. If it goes beyond that to showing love and longing for his meeting and wishing for his prolonged stay, then if he is lying, he sins with the sin of falsehood and hypocrisy; and if he is truthful, he sins by loving the continued existence of an oppressor, for his duty is to hate him for the sake of God and detest him. For hatred for the sake of God is obligatory, and one who loves sin or is pleased with it is a sinner. Whoever loves an oppressor, if he loves him for his oppression, he sins due to that love; and if he loves him for another reason, he sins from the perspective that he did not hate him, when it was incumbent upon him to hate him. If good and evil are combined in a single person, it is obligatory to love him for that good and hate him for that evil. The manner of combining hatred and love will come later in the Book of Brotherhood and Those Who Love One Another for the Sake of God.

If one is safe from all of that—and how far-fetched that is—he is not safe from a corruption that enters his heart. For he looks at the oppressor's expansion in worldly favor and comes to disdain the favors of God upon himself, and he transgresses the prohibition of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, where he said: "O company of emigrants, do not enter upon the people of the world, for it causes displeasure with one's provision." A narration: "O company of emigrants, do not enter upon the people of the world, for it causes displeasure with one's provision." Al-Hakim transmitted it from the narration of Abdullah ibn al-Shikhkhir: "Minimize entering upon the wealthy, for it is more likely that you will not disdain the favors of God Almighty." And he said its chain is sound. This is along with what it contains of others following his example in entering, and of increasing the multitude of the oppressors by his own person, and of beautifying them if he is one by whom they are adorned. All of that is either disliked or prohibited.

Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib was summoned to pledge allegiance to al-Walid and Sulayman, the sons of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. He said: "I will not pledge to two while night and day differ, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited two pledges." A narration: "Ibn al-Musayyib was summoned to pledge allegiance to al-Walid and Sulayman, the sons of Abd al-Malik. He said: 'I will not pledge to two while night and day differ, for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited two pledges.'" Abu Nu'aym transmitted it in *al-Hilyah* with a sound chain from the narration of Yahya ibn Sa'id. So they said: "Enter from one door and exit from the other door." He said: "No, by God, no one will be kindled by me." So he was whipped one hundred lashes and clothed in sackcloth.

It is not permissible to enter upon them except for two excuses. One is that there is from their side a matter of obligation, not a matter of honor, and he knows that if he refuses, harm will come to him or the obedience of the subjects will be corrupted for them and the affair of governance will be disturbed for them. He must respond, not in obedience to them, but in consideration of the welfare of the creation so that authority does not become disturbed. The second is that he enters upon them to repel an injustice from a Muslim other than himself or from himself, either by way of commanding good and forbidding evil or by way of seeking redress. That is a concession, on the condition that he does not lie, does not flatter, and does not neglect an admonition for which he expects acceptance. This is the ruling regarding entering.

The second situation is that the oppressive ruler enters upon you as a visitor. The reply to the greeting is necessary. As for standing and honoring him, it is not prohibited to reciprocate his honoring, for by honoring knowledge and religion he is deserving of praise, just as by oppression he is deserving of being shunned. Honoring is with honoring, and the reply is with the greeting. But it is preferable not to stand if he is with him in private, to thereby show him the majesty of the religion and the baseness of oppression, and to show his anger for the religion and his turning away from one who has turned away from God, so God Almighty has turned away from him. If the one entering upon him is in a gathering, then observing the dignity of those in authority among the subjects is important, so there is no harm in standing with this intention, provided he knows that it will not breed corruption among the subjects and he will not incur harm from his anger. But leaving off honoring by standing is preferable.

Then it is incumbent upon him, after the meeting has occurred, to admonish him. If he is committing something whose prohibition he does not know, and he expects that he will leave it if he knows, then let him inform him. That is obligatory. As for mentioning the prohibition of what he knows is prohibited, such as extravagance and oppression, there is no benefit in it. Rather, he must warn him regarding the sins he is committing, whenever he thinks the warning will affect him. And he must guide him to the way of benefit if he knows a way in accordance with the Sacred Law by which the aim of the oppressor is achieved without sin, to thereby deter him from attaining his aim through oppression. Thus, it is incumbent upon him to inform in the place of his ignorance, to warn regarding what he is emboldened to do, and to guide him to what he is heedless of, which would suffice him from oppression. These are three matters that obligate him if he expects his words to have an effect. That is also obligatory upon everyone who happens to enter upon a ruler, with an excuse or without an excuse.

And from Muhammad ibn Salih, he said: I was with Hammad ibn Salamah, and there was nothing in the house except a mat, and he was sitting on it, and a Qur'an from which he was reciting, and a bag containing his knowledge, and a vessel for purification from which he performed ablution. Then, while...

I was with him when there was a knock at the door, and it was Muhammad ibn Sulayman. He gave him permission to enter, so he came in and sat before him. Then he said to him, "What is the matter with me that when I see you, I am filled with awe of you?" Hammād said, "Because the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'If a scholar intends by his knowledge the Face of God, everything will stand in awe of him; but if he intends to hoard treasures with it, he will stand in awe of everything.'" This is a narration from Hammād ibn Salamah, raised to the Prophet: "If he intends by his knowledge the Face of God, everything will stand in awe of him; and if he intends to hoard treasures with it, he will stand in awe of everything." This is problematic. And Abū al-Shaykh Ibn Ḥibbān narrated in the Book of Reward, from the ḥadīth of Wāthilah ibn al-Asqaʿ: "Whoever fears God, God will make everything fear him; and whoever does not fear God, God will make him fear everything." Al-ʿUqaylī has something similar in *Al-Ḍuʿafāʾ* from the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah, and both are rejected.

Then he presented to him forty thousand dirhams and said, "Take them and use them as aid." He said, "Return them to the one you wronged with them." He said, "By God, I only gave you from what I inherited." He said, "I have no need for them, so take them and distribute them." He said, "Even if I were just in distributing them, I fear that some who are not granted a share would say he was not just in his distribution, and thus I would sin. So keep them away from me."

The third situation is that he secludes himself from them, so he does not see them and they do not see him. This is obligatory, for there is no safety except in it. He must believe in their hatred due to their injustice, not love their continued existence, not praise them, not inquire about their conditions, not draw near to those connected to them, and not grieve over what is lost due to parting from them. That is if their affair comes to his mind; but if he is heedless of them, it is better. And if their luxury comes to his mind, let him remember what Ḥātim al-Aṣamm said: "Between me and the kings is only one day. As for yesterday, they do not find its pleasure, and tomorrow, both I and they are in apprehension. It is only today, and what can be in a day?" And what Abū al-Dardāʾ said when he said: "The people of wealth eat and we eat, drink and we drink, wear and we wear, and they have surplus wealth they look upon, and we look upon it with them, but they bear its account and we are free from it."

And whoever's knowledge encompasses the injustice of an oppressor and the disobedience of a sinner, he should lower that person's rank in his heart. This is obligatory upon him, for whoever commits what is disliked, that undoubtedly lowers his rank in the heart. And disobedience must be disliked, for one is either heedless of it, pleased with it, or dislikes it. There is no heedlessness with knowledge, and no justification for pleasure, so dislike is necessary. Let the transgression of everyone against God's right be like his transgression against your right. If you say, "Dislike is not subject to choice, so how can it be obligatory?" We say: It is not so, for a lover necessarily dislikes, by natural disposition, what is disliked by his beloved and is contrary to him. For whoever does not dislike disobedience to God does not love God, and only one who does not know God does not love Him. And knowledge is obligatory, and love for God is obligatory. When he loves Him, he dislikes what He dislikes and loves what He loves. The verification of this will come in the Book of Love and Contentment.

If you say, "The scholars of the early generations used to enter upon the rulers," I say: Yes, learn the manner of entering from them, then enter. As it is related that Hishām ibn ʿAbd al-Malik came to perform pilgrimage to Mecca. When he entered it, he said, "Bring me a man from the Companions." It was said, "O Commander of the Faithful, they have passed away." He said, "From the Successors." So Ṭāwūs al-Yamānī was brought. When he entered upon him, he removed his sandals at the edge of his carpet, did not greet him with "Commander of the Faithful," but said, "Peace be upon you, O Hishām," and did not use his kunya. He sat opposite him and said, "How are you, O Hishām?" Hishām became extremely angry, to the point of intending to kill him. It was said to him, "You are in the sanctuary of God and the sanctuary of His Messenger, and that is not possible." He said, "O Ṭāwūs, what made you do what you did?" He said, "And what did I do?" His anger and rage increased. He said, "You removed your sandals at the edge of my carpet, did not kiss my hand, did not greet me as Commander of the Faithful, did not use my kunya, sat opposite me without my permission, and said, 'How are you, O Hishām?'" He said, "As for what I did in removing my sandals at the edge of your carpet, I remove them before the Lord of Might five times a day, and He does not punish me nor become angry with me. As for your saying I did not kiss your hand, I heard the Commander of the Faithful ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, may God be pleased with him, say: 'It is not permissible for a man to kiss the hand of anyone except his wife out of desire or his child out of mercy.' As for your saying I did not greet you as Commander of the Faithful, not all people are pleased with your rule, so I disliked to lie. As for your saying I did not use your kunya, God Almighty named His prophets and allies, saying, 'O Yahyā, O ʿĪsā,' and used the kunya of His enemies, saying, 'May the hands of Abū Lahab perish.' As for your saying I sat opposite you, I heard the Commander of the Faithful ʿAlī, may God be pleased with him, say: 'If you wish to look at a man from the people of the Fire, look at a man sitting with people standing around him.'" Hishām said to him, "Admonish me." He said, "I heard from the Commander of the Faithful ʿAlī, may God be pleased with him, say: 'In Hell there are snakes like water-skins and scorpions like mules.'"

Every ruler who does not act justly with his subjects will be stung (by the consequences). Then he stood up and fled. And from Sufyan al-Thawri, may God be pleased with him, who said: I was brought before Abu Ja'far al-Mansur at Mina. He said to me: 'Present your need to us.' I said to him: 'Fear God, for you have filled the earth with injustice and tyranny.' He lowered his head, then raised it and said: 'Present your need to us.' I said: 'You have only been placed in this position by the swords of the Emigrants and the Helpers, and their children are dying of hunger. So fear God and deliver their rights to them.' He lowered his head, then raised it and said: 'Present your need to us.' I said: 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, performed the pilgrimage. He said to his treasurer: "How much did you spend?" He said: "A few tens of dirhams." And I see here wealth that camels cannot bear to carry.' And he left. Thus they would enter upon the rulers when they were compelled, and they would risk their lives to exact vengeance for God against their injustice. And Ibn Abi Shamila entered upon Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. He said to him: 'Speak.' He said to him: 'People will not be saved on the Day of Resurrection from its agonies, its bitterness, and witnessing perdition therein, except one who pleases God by displeasing his own self.' Abd al-Malik wept and said: 'I will make this statement a model before my eyes as long as I live.' And why did Uthman ibn Affan, may God be pleased with him, appoint Abdullah ibn Amir? The Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came to him, but Abu Dharr was delayed, and he was a friend to him. So he reproached him. Abu Dharr said: 'I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: "When a man assumes authority, God distances Himself from him."' (The narration of Abu Dharr: 'When a man assumes authority, God Almighty distances Himself from him'—I have not found a source for it.) And Malik ibn Dinar entered upon the governor of Basra and said: 'O Governor, I read in some of the Books that God Almighty says: "What is more foolish than a ruler, and what is more ignorant than one who disobeys Me, and who is more honored than one who seeks honor through Me? O evil shepherd, fat and healthy sheep were entrusted to you; you ate the meat and wore the wool, and left them as rattling bones."' The governor of Basra said to him: 'Do you know what emboldens you against us and keeps us from harming you?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Lack of desire for what we possess and refraining from seizing what is in our hands.' And Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was standing with Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. Sulayman heard the sound of thunder and was alarmed, placing his chest against the front of his saddle. Umar said to him: 'This is the sound of His mercy; how then when you hear the sound of His punishment?' Then Sulayman looked at the people and said: 'How numerous the people are!' Umar said: 'They are your adversaries, O Commander of the Faithful.' Sulayman said to him: 'May God burden you with them.' And it is related that Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik arrived in Medina while intending to go to Mecca. He sent for Abu Hazim and summoned him. When he entered upon him, Sulayman said: 'O Abu Hazim, why do we dislike death?' He said: 'Because you have ruined your Hereafter and built up your worldly life, so you dislike moving from prosperity to ruin.' He said: 'O Abu Hazim, how is the arrival before God?' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, as for the doer of good, he is like an absent one returning to his family; and as for the evildoer, he is like a runaway slave returning to his master.' Sulayman wept and said: 'If only I knew what I have with God.' Abu Hazim said: 'Measure yourself against the Book of God Almighty where He says: "Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss, and indeed, the wicked will be in a Blazing Fire."' He said: 'Then where is the mercy of God?' He said: 'It is near to the doers of good.' Then Sulayman said: 'O Abu Hazim, which of God's servants is most noble?' He said: 'The people of righteousness and piety.' He said: 'Which deed is best?' He said: 'Fulfilling the obligations while avoiding the prohibitions.' He said: 'Which speech is most worthy of being heard?' He said: 'Speaking the truth before one whom you fear and from whom you hope.' He said: 'Which believer is most prudent?' He said: 'A man who acts in obedience to God and calls people to it.' He said: 'Which believer is most ruined?' He said: 'A man who steps into the desire of his brother while being unjust, thus selling his Hereafter for the worldly life of another.' Sulayman said: 'What do you say concerning our situation?' He said: 'Will you excuse me?' He said: 'You must, for it is counsel you will give to me.' He said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, your forefathers subdued the people by the sword and seized this dominion by force, without consultation from the Muslims nor their consent, until they killed a great multitude among them. They have departed. If only you knew what they said and what was said to them.' A man among his companions said to him: 'How evil is what you have said!' Abu Hazim said: 'God has taken a covenant from the scholars that they shall make it clear to the people and not conceal it.' He said: 'How can we rectify this corruption?' He said: 'That you take it from its proper source and place it in its rightful place.' Sulayman said: 'And who is capable of that?' He said: 'One who seeks Paradise and fears the Fire.' Sulayman said: 'Pray for me.' Abu Hazim said: 'O God, if Sulayman is Your ally, then facilitate for him the good of this world and the Hereafter; and if he is Your enemy, then take him by the forelock to what You love and are pleased with.' Sulayman said: 'Counsel me.' He said: 'I counsel you, and I will be brief: Magnify your Lord and hold Him pure, that He should not see you where He has forbidden you, nor find you absent where He has commanded you.' And Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz said to Abu Hazim: 'Admonish me.' He said: 'Lie down, then place death at your head, then look to what you love.'

If there is a quality you wish to possess at that Hour, take hold of it now. And whatever you would dislike to be within you at that Hour, abandon it now, for perhaps that Hour is near.

A Bedouin entered upon Sulayman ibn ‘Abd al-Malik, who said, "Speak, O Bedouin." He replied, "O Commander of the Faithful, I will address you with words, so bear with them even if you dislike them, for behind them lies what you will love if you accept them." Sulayman said, "O Bedouin, we are generous in our forbearance even towards one from whom we hope for no sincere counsel and whose deceit we do not feel safe from; how then [would we be] towards one whose deceit we feel safe from and from whom we hope for sincere counsel?" The Bedouin said, "O Commander of the Faithful, you have been surrounded by men who made poor choices for themselves, purchasing their worldly life with their religion and your pleasure with the displeasure of their Lord. They fear you for the sake of God, but they do not fear God concerning you. They have made peace with this world at the cost of war in the Hereafter. Therefore, do not entrust them with what God has entrusted to you, for they have spared no effort in squandering the trust and in causing ruin and oppression to the community. You will be questioned for what they have perpetrated, but they will not be questioned for what you have perpetrated. So do not set right their worldly affairs by corrupting your Hereafter, for the greatest loser among people is he who sells his own Hereafter for the worldly life of another." Sulayman said to him, "O Bedouin, you have indeed unsheathed your tongue, and it is the sharpest of your two swords." He replied, "Yes, O Commander of the Faithful, but it is for you, not against you."

It is related that Abu Bakrah entered upon Mu‘awiyah and said, "Fear God, O Mu‘awiyah, and know that every day passes away from you and every night comes upon you. You increase only in distance from this world and in nearness to the Hereafter. A pursuer is on your trail who will not miss you, and a marker has been set up for you which you will not pass. How quickly you will reach the marker, and how soon the pursuer will catch up with you! And I—what we are in is transient, and to what we are heading we will remain forever. If it is good, then good; and if it is evil, then evil."

Thus was the entry of the people of knowledge upon the rulers—I mean the scholars of the Hereafter. As for the scholars of this world, they enter to draw near to their hearts, directing them to concessions and deriving for them, through subtle stratagems, ways of latitude that conform to their desires. Even if they speak with words like those we have mentioned in the context of admonition, their aim is not reform but rather gaining status and acceptance with them. In this are two deceptions by which the foolish are deluded. The first is that they show that their purpose in entering upon them is to reform them through admonition, and perhaps they even deceive themselves with this, while the motive for them is a hidden craving for fame and acquiring recognition with them. The sign of sincerity in seeking reform is that if someone else from among his peers in knowledge were to undertake that admonition, and it found acceptance and the effect of reform became apparent, he should rejoice in it and thank God for relieving him of this important matter—like one who was obliged to treat a lost patient and someone else undertook his treatment; his joy would be immense. If, however, he finds in his heart a preference for his own words over the words of another, he is deluded. The second is that he claims, "I intend to intercede for a Muslim to repel an injustice." This too is a place of delusion, and its criterion is what was mentioned previously.

When the manner of entering upon them becomes clear, let us outline questions concerning the incidental circumstances of mixing with rulers and handling their wealth.

Question: If the ruler sends you wealth to distribute among the poor, if it is from a specific, known source of his, it is not permissible to take it. If it is not, but its ruling is that he wishes to give it in charity to the needy, as preceded, then you may take it and undertake the distribution, and you are not disobeying by taking it. However, some scholars refrained from it. At this point, one considers what is preferable. We say: The preferable course is to take it if you are safe from three perils.

The first peril is that the ruler might assume, because of your taking it, that his wealth is pure, and that were it not pure you would not stretch your hand to it nor include it in your responsibility. If this is the case, then do not take it, for that is a danger. The good of your handling the distribution does not outweigh the audacity you gain towards acquiring the unlawful.

The second peril is that others among the scholars and the ignorant might look at you and believe it is lawful, and thus follow your example in taking it and cite it as proof of its permissibility, yet they do not distribute it. This is greater than the first, for a group cites the taking by al-Shafi‘i, may God be pleased with him, as proof of the permissibility of taking, while they neglect his distribution and his taking with the intention of distribution. The one who follows and imitates him must be extremely cautious of this, for his action could be a cause for leading many creatures astray.

Wahb ibn Munabbih related that a man was brought before a king in the presence of people to be coerced into eating pork, but he did not eat. Then meat from sheep was brought to him and he was coerced with the sword, but he still did not eat. He was asked about that, and he said, "The people have believed I was ordered to eat pork. If I emerge safely having eaten, they will not know what I ate, and thus they would be led astray."

Wahb ibn Munabbih and Tawus entered upon Muhammad ibn Yusuf, the brother of al-Hajjaj, who was a governor. It was a cold morning in an exposed council. He said to his servant, "Bring that cloak."

And he cast it upon Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, meaning Tawus, who was seated upon a chair. He cast it upon him, and he did not cease moving his shoulders until he cast the cloak from himself. Muhammad ibn Yusuf became angry and said, "Wahb, you were rich enough that you could have avoided angering him if you had taken the cloak and given it in charity." He said, "Yes, were it not that those after me would say, 'Tawus took it,' and would not do with it what I would do with it, then I would have done so."

The second peril is that your heart may be stirred to love him for singling you out and arousing you with what he sends to you. If it is thus, then do not accept it; it is the killing poison and the hidden malady—I mean that which makes the oppressors beloved to you. For whom you love, you will inevitably be eager for and show partiality towards. 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said, "Souls are created to love those who are good to them." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "O God, do not grant a wicked person a favor over me, lest my heart love him." The hadith, "O God, do not grant a wicked person a favor over me, lest my heart love him," was reported by Ibn Mardawayh in his Tafsir from the narration of Kathir ibn 'Atiyyah from an unnamed man. Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Mu'adh, and Abu Musa al-Madini in his book *Tadhyi' al-'Umr wa al-Ayyam* as a mursal report, and all its chains are weak. The Prophet, peace be upon him, indicated that the heart can hardly refrain from that.

It is narrated that some ruler sent to Malik ibn Dinar ten thousand dirhams, and he gave them all away. Muhammad ibn Wasil came to him and said, "What have you done with what this creature gave you?" He said, "Ask my companions." They said, "He gave it all away." He said, "I adjure you by God, is your heart now more inclined to love him than before he sent to you?" He said, "Yes, indeed now." He said, "I only feared this," and he spoke truthfully. For if he loves him, he loves his continuance, dislikes his removal, his disgrace, and his death, and loves the expansion of his authority and the increase of his wealth—all of that is love for the causes of oppression, and it is blameworthy.

Salman and Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with them, said, "Whoever is pleased with a matter, even if he is absent from it, is like one who witnessed it." God Almighty said, "And do not incline toward those who do wrong." It is said: Do not be pleased with their deeds. If you are in such strength that their ropes do not increase by that, then there is no harm in taking. It is narrated from some ascetics of Basra that he would take wealth and distribute it. He was asked, "Do you not fear that you will love them?" He said, "If a man took my hand and led me into Paradise, then disobeyed his Lord, my heart would not love him, for what made him take my hand is the very thing for which I would hate him, out of gratitude to Him for making him subservient."

By this, it becomes clear that taking wealth from them now, even if that wealth itself is from a lawful source, is dangerous and blameworthy because it is not free from these perils.

If someone says, "If it is permissible to take his wealth and distribute it, is it permissible to steal his wealth, or to conceal his deposit, deny it, and distribute it among the people?" We say: That is not permissible, for perhaps it has a specific owner, and he intends to return it to him. This is not like when he sends it to you, for a rational person does not suppose that he would give in charity what he knows has an owner. His handing it over indicates that he does not know its owner. If he is one for whom such a case is ambiguous, it is not permissible to accept the money from him until that is known.

Moreover, how could he steal it? It is possible that its ownership was acquired by purchase on credit, for possession is an indication of ownership. This is not permissible. Rather, if he found a lost item and it became apparent that its owner was a soldier, and it was possible it was his by purchase on credit or otherwise, it is obligatory to return it to him. Therefore, it is not permissible to steal their wealth, neither from them nor from one with whom it is deposited, and it is not permissible to deny their deposit. The prescribed punishment is due upon the thief of their wealth, unless the thief claims it is not their property; then the punishment is dropped by the claim.

Dealing with them in transactions is forbidden, because most of what they have is unlawful, so what is taken in exchange is unlawful. If he pays the price from a place he knows is lawful, then the consideration remains regarding what is delivered to them. If he knows they will disobey God with it, such as selling silk to them when he knows they will wear it, that is forbidden, like selling grapes to a wine-maker. The disagreement is only concerning the validity. If it is possible, and it is possible that their women wear it, it is a disliked ambiguity. This applies to wealth whose very essence involves disobedience, and in its meaning is selling a horse to them, especially at a time when they ride to fight Muslims or collect their wealth, for that is aiding them with his horse, and it is prohibited.

As for selling dirhams and dinars to them, and what is similar that is not inherently disobeyed with, but is used as a means, it is disliked because of the assistance it gives them in oppression, for they use wealth, mounts, and all other means to aid their oppression. This dislike applies to giving gifts to them and working for them without wage, even in teaching them and their children rhetoric, composition, and arithmetic. As for teaching the Qur'an, it is not disliked except from the perspective of taking a wage, for that is forbidden unless from a source known to be lawful. Even if he appointed himself as an agent for them to purchase for them in the markets without fee or wage.

It is reprehensible in terms of assisting [in sin], and if one purchases for them something knowing they intend to use it for disobedience—such as a slave boy and silk brocade for a throne and garments, and a horse for riding to commit oppression and killing—then that is forbidden. Whenever the intent of disobedience by the purchaser becomes apparent, prohibition is incurred; and whenever it is not apparent but is possible according to the judgment of the situation and its indication towards it, reprehensibility is incurred.

Regarding marketplaces built with unlawful wealth: trading in them is forbidden, and it is not permissible to reside in them. If a merchant resides there and earns through a lawful means, his earnings are not unlawful, but he is sinful for his residence. People may purchase from them, but if they find another marketplace, it is preferable to purchase from it, for that is assisting their residence and increasing the rent of their shops. Likewise, dealing in a market on which they pay no land tax is more beloved than dealing in a market on which they do pay a land tax.

Some people have gone to extremes, even avoiding dealings with farmers and landowners on whose land a land tax is levied, fearing that what they take from them might be spent on the tax, thus resulting in assistance. This is excessive strictness in religion and a hardship upon Muslims, for the land tax has become widespread on lands, and people cannot do without benefiting from the land. There is no sense in prohibiting it, and if this were permitted, it would be forbidden for the owner to cultivate the land so as not to demand its tax, a matter which would become prolonged and lead to blocking the means of livelihood.

Dealing with their judges, officials, and servants is forbidden, like dealing with them, indeed more severe. As for the judges, it is because they take from their wealth that which is plainly unlawful, they amass much, and they tempt the people by their appearance, for they are in the guise of scholars and mix with them, taking from their wealth. Human nature is disposed to imitate and follow those of status and dignity, so they are the cause of the people's inclination towards them. As for the servants and retinue, most of their wealth is from plain usurpation, and no wealth from public funds, inheritance, or poll tax comes into their hands, nor any lawful avenue, such that the suspicion is weakened by the mixing of lawful wealth with their wealth. Tawus said, "I do not bear witness before them, even if I am certain, for I fear their transgression against the one on whose behalf I testified."

In summary, the subjects become corrupt due to the corruption of the kings, and the kings become corrupt due to the corruption of the scholars. Were it not for the evil judges and evil scholars, the corruption of the kings would be less, out of fear of their censure. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "This community will remain under the hand and protection of Allah as long as its reciters do not flatter their rulers." The hadith: "This community will remain under the hand and protection of Allah as long as its reciters do not flatter their rulers" was reported by Abu 'Amr al-Dani in *Kitab al-Fitan* from the narration of al-Hasan as *mursal*, and al-Daylami reported it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of 'Ali and Ibn 'Umar with the wording: "as long as its righteous do not honor its wicked, and its good do not appease its evil," but their chains are weak. The reciters are mentioned because they were the scholars, and their knowledge was of the Qur'an and its meanings understood through the Sunnah; what is beyond that of sciences are innovations after them.

Sufyan said, "Do not associate with the ruler, nor with one who associates with him." And the owner of the pen, the owner of the inkwell, the owner of the paper, and the owner of the blotter are partners with one another—and he spoke truthfully. For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cursed ten involved in wine, up to the presser and the one for whom it is pressed. The hadith: "The Prophet (peace be upon Allah and His family) cursed ten involved in wine, up to the presser and the one for whom it is pressed" was reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Anas. Al-Tirmidhi said it is a *gharib* hadith.

And Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "The consumer of usury, the one who pays it, its two witnesses, and its scribe are cursed by the tongue of Muhammad (peace be upon him)." The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "The consumer of usury, the one who pays it, its witness, and its scribe are cursed by the tongue of Muhammad (peace be upon him)" was reported by Muslim and the compilers of the *Sunan*, and the wording is from al-Nasa'i without "its witness." Abu Dawud has: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cursed the consumer of usury, the one who pays it, its witness, and its scribe." Al-Tirmidhi authenticated it, and Ibn Majah has "its two witnesses." Similarly, Jabir and 'Umar reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The hadith of Jabir: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cursed the consumer of usury, the one who pays it, its scribe, and its two witnesses; he said they are alike" was reported by Muslim from his narration. As for the hadith of 'Umar, al-Tirmidhi alluded to it by saying, "And in the chapter..." And Ibn Majah has from his narration: "The last verse revealed was the verse of usury, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died without explaining it, so avoid usury and doubt." It is from the narration of Ibn al-Musayyib from him, and the majority hold that he did not hear from him.

Ibn Sirin said, "Do not carry a letter for the ruler until you know what is in it." Sufyan (may Allah have mercy on him) refrained from handing the inkwell to the caliph of his time before him, saying, "Until I know what you will write with it." All those around them from their servants and followers are oppressors like them; it is obligatory to hate them all for the sake of Allah. It is narrated from 'Uthman ibn Zaidah that he asked him...

A soldier asked, "Where is the road?" He remained silent and feigned deafness, fearing that the man might be heading toward oppression, and thus by guiding him to the road he would become an accomplice. Such extreme caution was not reported from the early righteous concerning the sinful among merchants, weavers, cuppers, bathhouse attendants, goldsmiths, dyers, and craftsmen—despite the prevalence of lying and immorality among them—nor concerning the unbelievers among the protected people. This applies specifically to the oppressors who devour the wealth of orphans and the poor, and who persistently harm Muslims, those who have collaborated to erase the traces and symbols of the Sacred Law. This is because sin is divided into that which is confined and that which transgresses. Immorality is confined and does not transgress; likewise, unbelief is an offense against the right of God Almighty, and His account is with God. As for the sin of rulers through oppression, which is transgressive, their affair is grave for that reason, and according to the extent of the oppression and the generality of the transgression, they increase in loathsomeness before God. Therefore, avoiding them must increase, and caution in dealing with them must be heightened. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "It will be said to the policeman, 'Drop your whip and enter the Fire.'" This hadith is reported by Abu Ya'la from the narration of Anas with a weak chain. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Among the signs of the Hour are men with whips like the tails of cattle." This hadith is reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, from the narration of Abu Umamah: "There will be at the end of time men with whips as if they were the tails of cattle." And in Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Soon, if your life is prolonged, you will see people in whose hands are like the tails of cattle." And in another narration of his: "Two categories of the people of Hell I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle..." This is their ruling. Whoever among them is known for that is known, and whoever is not known, his sign is the qaba' (a type of garment), long mustaches, and all the well-known appearances. So whoever is seen with that appearance, avoiding him becomes obligatory, and this is not considered bad suspicion, because he has brought it upon himself by adopting their dress. Similarity in dress indicates similarity in heart. None dresses like the insane except one who is insane, and none resembles the immoral except an immoral person. Yes, an immoral person may be confused with the righteous, but a righteous person has no business resembling the people of corruption, for that increases their numbers. The saying of God Almighty, "Those whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves..." was revealed concerning a group of Muslims who used to increase the gathering of the polytheists through mixing. It has been narrated that God Almighty revealed to Joshua son of Nun, "I will destroy from your people forty thousand of their best and sixty thousand of their worst." He said, "What about the best?" He said, "They do not become angry for My anger," for they used to eat and drink with them. From this it becomes clear that anger against some oppressors for the sake of God is obligatory. Ibn Mas'ud reported from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that God cursed the scholars of the Children of Israel when they mingled with the oppressors in their livelihoods. This hadith is reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "When the Children of Israel fell into sins, their scholars forbade them, but they did not desist, so they sat with them in their gatherings, ate with them, and drank with them. So God struck the hearts of some of them against others and cursed them on the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary." Al-Tirmidhi's wording, and he said it is hasan gharib. Regarding places built by oppressors, such as bridges, ribats, mosques, and drinking fountains, one must be cautious and consider. As for a bridge, crossing it is permissible out of necessity, and scrupulousness is to avoid it if possible. If an alternative route is found, scrupulousness becomes emphasized. We only permit crossing even if an alternative is found because if the specific owner is not known, its ruling is that it is reserved for good deeds, and this is good. But if it is known that the bricks and stones were taken from a known house, cemetery, or specific mosque, then crossing it is not permissible at all except in a necessity that would permit taking something similar from another's property. Then he must seek permission from the owner whom he knows. As for a mosque, if it is built on usurped land or with wood usurped from another mosque or specific property, then entering it is not permissible at all, not even for the Friday prayer. Rather, if the imam stands therein, let him pray behind the imam while standing outside the mosque, for prayer on usurped land invalidates the obligation but is valid with respect to following. Therefore, we permit the follower to follow one who prayed on usurped land, even though the one standing there sinned by standing in usurpation. If it is from property whose owner is not known, then scrupulousness is to turn to another mosque if found. If no other is found, he should not abandon the Friday prayer and congregation there, because it is possible that it is from the property of the one who built it, even if unlikely, and if it is not his...

There is no specific owner, so it is for the benefit of the Muslims. And whatever is in the Great Mosque built for a tyrannical ruler, there is no excuse for one who prays in it given the spaciousness of the mosque—I mean in terms of scrupulous piety. It was said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: "What is your proof for refraining from going out to pray in congregation while we are in the military camp?" He said: "My proof is that al-Hasan and Ibrahim al-Taymi feared that al-Hajjaj would tempt them, and I fear that I may be tempted as well." As for perfume and plastering, they do not prevent entry because they are not utilized in the prayer; rather, they are adornment, and it is preferable not to look at them. As for the mats they have spread, if they have a specific owner, it is forbidden to sit on them; otherwise, after they have been dedicated for general benefit, it is permissible to spread them, but scrupulous piety is to avoid them, for they are a place of doubt. As for the water dispensary, its ruling is what we have mentioned, and it is not against scrupulous piety to perform ablution and drink from it and enter it if one fears missing the prayer, so he performs ablution, and likewise the facilities on the route to Mecca. As for the hospices and schools, if the land itself is usurped or the bricks are taken from a specific place that can be returned to its rightful owner, then there is no concession to enter it. If the owner is ambiguous, it has been dedicated for a charitable purpose, and scrupulous piety is to avoid it, but entering it does not necessitate sinfulness. These buildings, if they are dedicated from the servants of rulers, the matter is more severe, for they have no authority to divert lost wealth to beneficial purposes, and because the unlawful predominates their wealth, for they have no right to take the wealth of public interests; only the governors and those in authority may do so. The issue of usurped land: if it is made into a public road, it is not permissible to tread upon it at all; if it has no specific owner, it is permissible, and scrupulous piety is to avoid it if possible. If the road is permissible and there is an arcade above it, passing through is permissible, and sitting under the arcade in a manner that does not require the roof—as occurs in the street for business—is permissible. If one benefits from the roof to ward off the heat of the sun or rain or other, it is unlawful, for the roof is only intended for that. Similarly, the ruling for one who enters a mosque or a donated land with a roof or enclosure that is usurped: merely passing through does not constitute benefiting from the walls and roof unless there is a benefit from the walls and roof for heat or cold, screening from sight or other; that is unlawful because it is benefiting from the unlawful. If sitting on usurped property is not forbidden due to mere contact, but for the benefit, and the land is intended for settling upon and the roof for seeking shade, there is no difference between them. Chapter Seven: On miscellaneous issues frequently needed, and questions were asked about them in legal opinions. A question was asked about a servant of the Sufis who goes to the market and collects food or money and buys food with it: who is permitted to eat from it, and is it specific to the Sufis or not? As for the Sufis, there is no doubt concerning their right if they eat it. As for others, it is permissible for them if they eat it with the servant's consent, but it is not free from doubt. As for permissibility, it is because what is given to the servant of the Sufis is given due to the Sufis, and he may feed those other than the dependents, for it is far-fetched to say it has not left the ownership of the giver, nor does the servant have authority to purchase with it and dispose of it, for that leads to saying that informal giving is insufficient, which is weak; moreover, it is not upheld in charities and gifts. It is far-fetched to say ownership transfers to the present Sufis who are at the time of his request in the Sufi lodge, for there is no disagreement that he may feed from it those who come after them, and if they all die or one of them dies, his share need not be given to his heir, and it cannot be said it has occurred for the purpose of Sufism without a specific recipient, for transferring ownership to a purpose does not authorize individuals to dispose of it, for those included are not limited but include those born until the Day of Resurrection; only the governors dispose of it, and the servant may not appoint himself as deputy for the purpose. There is no alternative but to say it is his ownership, and he feeds the Sufis in fulfillment of the condition of Sufism and chivalry, for if he prevents them from it, they prevent him from presenting himself in the capacity of undertaking their care until his endowment ceases, as it ceases from one whose dependents have died. A question was asked about wealth bequeathed for the Sufis: to whom may it be given? I said: Sufism is an inward matter that is not known, and it is not possible to regulate the ruling by its reality, but by outward matters that people of custom rely upon in applying the name Sufi. The general criterion is that everyone who, by his quality, if he stays in a Sufi lodge, his staying there and mixing with them is not objectionable to them, then he is included among them. The details are that five qualities are observed in him: righteousness, poverty, the dress of the Sufis, that he is not occupied with a trade, and that he associates with them by way of dwelling in the lodge. Then some of these qualities necessitate...

Its disappearance is the disappearance of the name, and some of it is compensated for by another part. Thus, transgression prevents entitlement, because the term "Sufi" generally denotes a man from among the people of righteousness with a specific characteristic. Therefore, one whose transgression becomes apparent, even if he is in their guise, does not deserve what has been bequeathed for the Sufis. We do not consider minor sins in this. As for a craft and engagement in earning a livelihood, it prevents this entitlement. Thus, the landowner, the laborer, the merchant, the craftsman in his shop or home, and the hired worker who serves for a wage—all these do not deserve what has been bequeathed for the Sufis, and this is not compensated for by the guise and association. As for book-copying and tailoring, and what is similar to them from that which is fitting for Sufis to practice, if one practices them not in a shop nor in a manner of earning and craft, then that does not prevent entitlement. And that is compensated for by dwelling with them along with the remaining qualities. As for the capability for a craft without direct practice, it does not prevent. As for preaching and teaching, they do not contradict the name of Sufism if the rest of the traits are present, such as the guise, dwelling, and poverty, for it is not contradictory to say "a reciting Sufi," "a preaching Sufi," or "a learned or teaching Sufi," but it is contradictory to say "a merchant Sufi" or "a laborer Sufi." As for poverty, if it disappears due to excessive wealth by which the man is ascribed to apparent affluence, then it is not permissible for him to take the bequest for Sufis. If he has wealth but his income does not cover his expenditure, his right is not invalidated. Likewise, if he has wealth falling short of the obligation of Zakat, even if he has no expenditure. These are matters for which there is no proof except customary practices. As for mixing with them and dwelling with them, it has an effect. But one who does not mix with them, yet is in his home or in a mosque in their guise and adorned with their character, is a partner in their share. It is as if abandoning mixing is compensated for by adhering to the guise. If he is not in their guise but the rest of the qualities are found in him, he does not deserve unless he is dwelling with them in the hospice, so the ruling concerning them extends to him by way of affiliation. Thus, mixing and the guise each substitute for the other. As for the jurist who is not in their guise, this is his ruling: if he is outside, he is not considered a Sufi; but if he is dwelling with them and the rest of the qualities are found, it is not far that the ruling concerning them extends to him by affiliation. As for wearing the patched cloak from the hand of a shaykh from among their shaykhs, that is not stipulated for entitlement, and its absence does not harm him with the presence of the mentioned conditions. As for the married person who alternates between the hospice and the home, he does not thereby leave their collective. Regarding an endowment made for a Sufi hospice and its residents, the matter in it is broader than what was bequeathed for them, because the meaning of the endowment is spending for their benefits. Thus, it is permissible for a non-Sufi to eat with them with their consent at their table once or twice, for the matter of food is based on tolerance, to the extent that it is permissible to take it individually from shared spoils. And it is permissible for the storyteller to eat with them in their invitation from that endowment, and that is from the benefits of their livelihood. What was bequeathed for the Sufis may not be spent on the storytellers of the Sufis, unlike the endowment. Likewise, for those they bring in from among the laborers, merchants, judges, and jurists—who have an interest in winning their hearts—it is permissible for them to eat with their consent, for the endower only endows believing in it according to the customary practices of the Sufis, so it is judged by custom. But this is not perpetual; thus, it is not permissible for one who is not a Sufi to dwell with them perpetually and eat, even if they consent, for they have no right to change the condition of the endower by sharing with other than their kind. As for the jurist, if he is in their guise and character, he may stay with them, and his being a jurist does not contradict his being a Sufi. Ignorance is not a condition for Sufism according to those who know Sufism, and no attention is paid to the delusions of some fools who say that knowledge is a veil, for ignorance is the veil. We have mentioned the interpretation of this statement in the Book of Knowledge, and that the veil is the blameworthy knowledge, not the praiseworthy, and we have mentioned the praiseworthy and the blameworthy and explained them. As for the jurist who is not in their guise and character, they may prevent him from staying with them. If they consent to his staying, then it is permissible for him to eat with them by way of affiliation. Thus, the absence of the guise is compensated for by dwelling, but with the consent of the people of the guise. These are matters attested to by customary practices, and in them are opposing matters whose extremes in negation and affirmation are not hidden, and their middles are ambiguous. So whoever is cautious in matters of ambiguity has safeguarded his religion, as we have indicated in the chapters on doubts. Regarding the question asked about the difference between bribery and a gift, given that each of them proceeds from consent and is not devoid of purpose, yet one is forbidden and the other not, I said: The giver of wealth does not give it except for a purpose. But the purpose is either deferred, like reward, or immediate. The immediate is either wealth, or an action and assistance for a specific aim, or drawing closer to the heart of the recipient by seeking his love, either for love itself or for...

To attain through affection an objective beyond it, the resulting categories are five. The first is where the aim is reward in the Hereafter. This may be because the recipient is needy, knowledgeable, affiliated by religious lineage, or righteous and devout in himself. What the recipient knows is given due to his need, it is not permissible for him to accept if he is not needy. What he knows is given due to the nobility of his lineage, it is not permissible for him if he knows his claim to lineage is false. What is given for his knowledge, it is not permissible for him to accept unless he is in knowledge as the giver believes. If it is imagined to him that he possesses perfection in knowledge, such that it prompts giving to draw near, and he is not perfect, it is not permissible for him. What is given for his religiosity and righteousness, it is not permissible for him to accept if he is inwardly corrupt with a corruption that, were the giver aware, he would not give. Rarely is the righteous such that if his inward state were unveiled, hearts would remain inclined to him. It is only God’s beautiful covering that endears creation to creation. The scrupulous would appoint in purchasing someone who did not know he was their agent, so they would not be lenient in the sale for fear that it might be consumption through religion, for that is perilous. Piety is hidden, unlike knowledge, lineage, and poverty, so one should avoid accepting based on religion as much as possible.

The second category is what is intended in the immediate for a specific aim, like a poor person presenting to a rich person hoping for a robe. This is a gift conditional on reward; its ruling is not hidden. It is only permissible upon fulfilling the hoped-for reward and when the conditions of contracts are met. The third is when the intent is assistance with a specific action, like one in need of the ruler presenting to the ruler’s agent, his inner circle, or one who has standing with him. This is a gift conditional on a reward known by contextual indication. Let one examine that action which is the reward: if it is forbidden, like striving to enact an unlawful provision or wronging a person or other, accepting is forbidden. If it is obligatory, like repelling a specific wrong incumbent on every capable person or a specific testimony, then what he takes is forbidden, and it is the bribe about which there is no doubt in its prohibition. If it is permissible, neither obligatory nor forbidden, and involves effort such that if known, hiring for it would be allowed, then what he takes is lawful with that aim, and it runs the course of a stipulated reward, like saying, “Deliver this petition to so-and-so or to the ruler, and you have a dinar,” and it requires effort and estimable work. Or if he said, “Suggest to so-and-so to assist me in such aim or bestow upon me such favor,” and fulfilling his aim required lengthy speech, that is a fee, like what an agent takes for litigation before the judge; it is not forbidden if he does not strive for the forbidden. But if the aim is achieved with a word involving no effort, yet that word from one of influence or that action from one of influence is beneficial, like saying to the doorkeeper, “Do not close the ruler’s door against him,” or merely placing a petition before the ruler, this is forbidden because it is compensation for influence, and the law has not established its permissibility; rather, what indicates its prohibition is established, as will come regarding gifts to rulers. If compensation is not allowed for relinquishing pre-emption, returning due to defect, branches entering the king’s whim, and a host of intangible rights despite being intended, how can it be taken for influence? Close to this is the physician taking compensation for a single word by which he alerts to a remedy he uniquely knows, like one who uniquely knows a plant that cures hemorrhoids or other, and he does not mention it except for compensation. If his act of utterance is not estimable, like a sesame seed, it is not permissible to take compensation for it nor for his knowledge, for his knowledge does not transfer to another; rather, another attains the like of his knowledge while he remains knowing it. Below this is the skilled craftsman, like the polisher who removes the bend in a sword or mirror with one precise stroke due to his excellent knowledge of the flaw’s location and his skill in hitting it, for he may increase the value of the sword or mirror greatly with one stroke. This I see no harm in taking a wage for, because such crafts a man exerts himself to learn to earn by them and lighten for himself abundant work.

The fourth category is what is intended for affection and attracting it from the recipient, not for a specific aim, but seeking companionship, strengthening fellowship, and endearing hearts. That is intended by the wise and recommended in the law. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Exchange gifts, and you will love one another.” The hadith “Exchange gifts, and you will love one another” was reported by al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, though Ibn ‘Adi deemed it weak. In sum, a person generally does not intend the love of another for the sake of love itself, but for a benefit in his love. However, if that benefit is not specified and no specific aim prompting him in the present or future is conceived in himself, it is called a gift, and accepting it is permissible.

The fifth is to seek drawing near to his heart and attaining his affection, not for his affection itself.

Nor is it for the pleasure of his company merely as companionship, but rather to attain through his influence objectives whose category is limited, even if their specific instances are not, and were it not for his influence and prestige, he would not be guided to him. If his influence is due to knowledge or lineage, the matter is less severe, though accepting it is disliked, for it resembles bribery, though it appears as a gift. If his influence stems from an authority he holds, such as judgeship, an administrative post, stewardship of charity, tax collection, or other governmental duties—even the administration of endowments, for example—and were it not for that authority, he would not be gifted, then this is bribery presented in the guise of a gift, since the immediate intent is to seek closeness and gain affection. However, the matter is confined to its category, for what can be attained through signs is not hidden. A sign that affection is not truly sought is that if another were appointed in his place, the wealth would be given to that other. This is something on which they agree that dislike is severe, and they differ on whether it is forbidden, as its meaning is ambiguous, oscillating between a permissible gift and bribery offered in exchange for influence for a specific purpose. When analogical resemblance conflicts and is supported by reports and traditions, the more supported one is inclined toward. Reports have indicated the severity of the matter in this regard. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "A time will come upon people when they will deem bribery lawful through gifts, and killing through admonition—the innocent is killed to admonish the general public." (A hadith: "A time will come upon people when they will deem bribery lawful through gifts, and killing through admonition—the innocent is killed to admonish the general public"—I have not found a source for it.) Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, was asked about bribery, and he said: "A man fulfills a need, and then a gift is given to him." Perhaps he meant fulfilling a need with a word that involves no effort or as a voluntary act without intent for compensation, so it is not permissible to take anything afterward as a form of recompense. Masruq interceded in a matter, and the one for whom he interceded gifted him a slave girl, so he became angry and returned it, saying: "Had I known what was in your heart, I would not have spoken for your need, nor will I speak for what remains of it." Tawus was asked about gifts from rulers, and he said: "Bribery." Umar, may God be pleased with him, took the profit from the capital investment that his two sons took from the public treasury and said: "You were given only because of your relation to me," knowing they were given due to the influence of authority. The wife of Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah sent perfume to the queen of the Romans, who reciprocated with jewels. Umar, may God be pleased with him, took them, sold them, gave her the price of her perfume, and returned the remainder to the Muslim treasury. Jabir and Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with them, said: "Gifts from rulers are misappropriation." When Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz rejected a gift, it was said to him: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to accept gifts." He replied: "That was a gift for him, but for us it is bribery." (A hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to accept gifts"—narrated by Bukhari from Aisha, meaning it was given to honor his prophethood, not his authority, whereas we are given due to authority.) Greater than all this is what Abu Hamid al-Sa'idi reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sent a governor to collect the alms of the Azd tribe. When he came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, he withheld some of what he had and said: "This is for you, and this is a gift for me." The Prophet, upon him be peace, said: "Why did you not sit in your father's and mother's house until your gift came to you, if you are truthful?" Then he said: "Why is it that I appoint one of you, and he says: 'This is for you, and this is a gift for me'? Should he not have sat in his mother's house to be gifted? By the One in whose hand is my soul, none of you takes anything unjustly but will come to God carrying it. Let not any of you come on the Day of Resurrection with a camel bellowing, a cow lowing, or a sheep bleating." Then he raised his hands until I saw the whiteness of his armpits and said: "O God, have I conveyed?" (The hadith of Abu Hamid al-Sa'idi that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sent a governor to the alms of the Azd tribe, and when he came, he said: "What is for you and this is a gift for me"—agreed upon.) Given these established strictures, the judge and the governor should imagine himself in his mother's and father's house: whatever he would be given after dismissal while in his mother's house, he may accept during his tenure; and whatever he knows is given due to his authority, taking it is forbidden. As for what is ambiguous regarding gifts from his friends—whether they would give them if he were dismissed—it is doubtful, so he should avoid it. Here ends the Book of the Lawful and the Forbidden, with praise to God, His help, and His gracious facilitation, and God knows best.
