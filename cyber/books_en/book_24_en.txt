Book of the Afflictions of the Tongue
Which is the Fourth Book of the Quarter of the Destructive Matters from the Revival of the Religious Sciences
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, who perfected the creation of man and made him upright, inspired him with the light of faith, thereby adorning and beautifying him, taught him eloquence, thereby advancing and preferring him, poured upon his heart the treasuries of knowledge, thereby completing him, then cast over him a veil from His mercy and let it flow, then supplied him with a tongue by which he translates what the heart contains and comprehends, unveils from him the veil He cast, released his speech with truth, and articulated with gratitude for what He bestowed and granted him—of knowledge he acquired and speech He made easy. And I bear witness that there is no god but God alone, without partner, and that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger whom He honored and exalted, and His prophet whom He sent with a Book He revealed, and made his excellence supreme and clarified his paths. May God bless him and his family and his companions and those before him, as God is magnified in His exaltation and praise.

Now then: The tongue is among God's great blessings and the subtle wonders of His creation, for it is small in size yet immense in its obedience and its sin. Indeed, unbelief and faith are only made clear through the testimony of the tongue, and these are the ultimate ends of obedience and disobedience. Moreover, there is nothing existent or non-existent, Creator or created, imagined or known, conjectured or fancied, but that the tongue encompasses it and addresses it with affirmation or negation. For everything that knowledge apprehends, the tongue expresses, whether truthfully or falsely, and there is nothing that knowledge does not apprehend. This is a characteristic not found in other limbs, for the eye only reaches colors and forms, the ears only reach sounds, the hand only reaches bodies, and likewise all other limbs. But the tongue has a vast arena; it has no restraint and its scope has no limit or end. It has wide scope for good and a long train for evil. Whoever loosens the rein of his tongue and neglects it, giving it free rein, Satan will lead it into every arena and drive it to the brink of a crumbling precipice until he forces it to perdition. People will only be cast into the Fire on their faces due to the harvest of their tongues, and none is saved from the tongue's evil except he who bridles it with the bit of the Sacred Law, not letting it loose except in what benefits him in this world and the next, and restraining it from all whose harm he fears in the immediate and the future. Knowing when the tongue's loosening is praiseworthy or blameworthy is obscure and rare, and acting according to its requirement is heavy and difficult for one who knows it. The most disobedient of man's limbs is the tongue, for there is no toil in letting it loose and no effort in moving it. Yet people are negligent in guarding against its afflictions and perils, and in being wary of its snares and traps. Indeed, it is Satan's greatest instrument in leading man astray. By God's success and His good management, we shall detail the categories of the tongue's afflictions and mention them one by one with their definitions, causes, and perils. We shall show the way to guard against them and cite what has been reported of traditions and narrations in censuring them. We shall first mention the virtue of silence, then follow it with the affliction of speaking about what does not concern one, then the affliction of superfluous speech, then the affliction of delving into falsehood, then the affliction of disputation and argumentation; then the affliction of quarrelsomeness, then the affliction of affectation in speech through pretentious eloquence, contriving rhyme and fluency, and artificiality therein, and other such habits of those who claim oratory; then the affliction of obscenity, insult, and foul language; then the affliction of cursing, whether an animal, inanimate object, or person; then the affliction of singing poetry—we have already mentioned in the Book of Listening what is forbidden and permissible of singing, so we will not repeat it—then the affliction of jesting; then the affliction of mockery and derision; then the affliction of divulging secrets; then the affliction of false promises; then the affliction of lying in speech and oaths; then an explanation of the contradiction in lying; then the affliction of backbiting; then the affliction of tale-bearing; then the affliction of the double-tongued who goes between two adversaries speaking to each in a way that pleases him; then the affliction of praise; then the affliction of negligence regarding the subtle errors in the import of speech, especially concerning God and His attributes and what relates to the fundamentals of religion; then the affliction of asking common folk about the attributes of God Almighty and about the letters—are they eternal or originated? This is the last of the afflictions and what pertains to them, totaling twenty afflictions. We ask God for good success by His grace and generosity.

**Explanation of the Tongue's Great Danger and the Virtue of Silence**

Know that the danger of the tongue is great, and there is no salvation from its danger except through silence. Therefore, the Sacred Law praised silence and urged it, saying, "Whoever remains silent is saved," and he, peace be upon him, said, "Silence is wisdom, but few are its practitioners," meaning protection and resolve. 'Abdullah ibn Sufyan reported from his father: I said, "O Messenger of God, tell me about Islam with something I will not ask anyone after you." He said, "Say, 'I believe in God,' then be steadfast." I said, "What should I guard against?" He pointed with his hand to his tongue. And 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said: I asked, "O Messenger of God, what is salvation?" He said, "Restrain your tongue, let your house suffice you, and weep over your sin." And Sahl ibn Sa'd al-Sa'idi reported: The Messenger of God said, "Whoever guarantees for me what is between his jaws and his legs, I guarantee Paradise for him." And he said, "Whoever guards against the evil of his *qabqab*, his *dhabdhab*, and his *laqlaq*, has guarded against all evil." The *qabqab* is the belly, the *dhabdhab* is the private part, and the *laqlaq* is the tongue. These three appetites are what destroy most of creation. Therefore, we have occupied ourselves with mentioning the afflictions of the tongue after finishing the mention of the afflictions of the two appetites of the belly and the private part. The Messenger of God was asked about what most admits people into Paradise, and he said, "God-consciousness and good character." And he was asked about what most admits people into the Fire, and he said, "The two hollows: the mouth and the private part." It is possible that by the mouth is meant the afflictions of the tongue because it is its place, and it is possible that it means the belly because it is its passage. Mu'adh ibn Jabal said: I asked, "O Messenger of God, will we be held accountable for what we say?" He said, "May your mother be bereft of you, O son of Jabal! Are people cast into the Fire on their faces except due to the harvest of their tongues?" And 'Abdullah al-Thaqafi said: I said, "O Messenger of God, tell me something to hold fast to." He said, "Say, 'My Lord is God,' then be steadfast." I said, "O Messenger of God, what is the most fearful thing you fear for me?" He took hold of his tongue and said, "This." It is reported that Mu'adh said, "O Messenger of God, which deeds are best?" The Messenger of God stuck out his tongue and then placed his finger upon it. And Anas ibn Malik reported: He said, "A servant's faith does not become upright until his heart becomes upright, and his heart does not become upright until his tongue becomes upright. And no man will enter Paradise whose neighbor is not safe from his evils." And he said, "Whoever is pleased to be safe, let him adhere to silence." And from Sa'id ibn Jubayr, raised to the Prophet, that he said, "When the son of Adam wakes in the morning, all the limbs admonish the tongue, saying, 'Fear God concerning us, for if you are upright, we are upright, and if you are crooked, we are crooked.'" It is reported that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab saw Abu Bakr al-Siddiq pulling his tongue with his hand and said to him, "What are you doing, O Successor of the Messenger of God?" He said, "This has brought me to perilous places. Indeed, the Messenger of God said, 'There is no part of the body but that it complains to God about the tongue, alone.'" And from Ibn Mas'ud that he was on al-Safa making the *talbiyah* and saying, "O tongue, speak good and gain, and be silent about evil and be safe, before you regret." He was asked, "O Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, is this something you say or something you heard?" He said, "No, rather I heard the Messenger of God say, 'Most of the son of Adam's sins are from his tongue.'" And Ibn 'Umar reported: The Messenger of God said, "Whoever restrains his tongue, God will conceal his faults. Whoever controls his anger, God will protect him from His punishment. And whoever makes excuse to God, God will accept his excuse." It is reported that Mu'adh ibn Jabal said, "O Messenger of God, counsel me." He said, "Worship God as if you see Him, and count yourself among the dead. And if you wish, I will tell you what is more controlling for you than all this," and he pointed with his hand to his tongue. And from Safwan ibn Sulaym: The Messenger of God said, "Shall I not inform you of the easiest worship and the lightest on the body? Silence and good character."

Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent." Al-Hasan related: "It was mentioned to us that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'May God have mercy on a servant who speaks and gains, or remains silent and remains safe.'" It was said to Jesus, upon him be peace, "Direct us to a deed by which we may enter Paradise." He said, "Do not speak at all." They said, "We are not capable of that." He said, "Then do not speak except with good." And Solomon, son of David, upon them be peace, said, "If speech is of silver, then silence is of gold." Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib reported: A Bedouin came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, "Direct me to a deed that will admit me to Paradise." He said, "Feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, enjoin good and forbid evil. If you are unable, then restrain your tongue except from good." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Guard your tongue except from good, for by that you overcome Satan." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, God is at the tongue of every speaker; so let a person who knows what he says be mindful of God." And he, peace be upon him, said, "When you see a believer silent and dignified, draw near to him, for he is imbued with wisdom." Ibn Mas'ud reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "People are of three types: the gainer, the safe, and the haggard. The gainer is he who remembers God Almighty; the safe is the silent one; and the haggard is he who indulges in falsehood." And he, peace be upon him, said, "The tongue of the believer is behind his heart; when he wishes to speak of something, he reflects on it with his heart, then utters it with his tongue. The tongue of the hypocrite is ahead of his heart; when he intends something, he utters it with his tongue and does not reflect on it with his heart." Jesus, upon him be peace, said, "Worship has ten parts: nine of them are in silence, and one part is in fleeing from people." And our Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever increases his speech increases his slips; whoever increases his slips increases his sins; and whoever increases his sins, the Fire is more deserving of him."

Narrations: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, would place a pebble in his mouth to restrain himself from speech. He would point to his tongue and say, "This is what has led me into perilous situations." Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "By God, besides whom there is no deity, nothing is more in need of prolonged imprisonment than the tongue." Tawus said, "My tongue is a lion; if I unleash it, it will devour me." Wahb ibn Munabbih said, "In the wisdom of the House of David: It is incumbent upon the intelligent person to be aware of his time, guard his tongue, and attend to his own affairs." Al-Hasan said, "He who does not guard his tongue has not understood his religion." Al-Awza'i said, "Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, may God have mercy on him, wrote to us: 'To proceed: Verily, he who frequently remembers death is content with little from this world, and he who counts his speech as part of his deeds speaks little except in what concerns him.'" Some said, "Silence gathers for a man two virtues: safety in his religion and understanding from his companion." Muhammad ibn Wasil said to Malik ibn Dinar, "O Abu Yahya, guarding the tongue is harder for people than guarding dinars and dirhams." Yunus ibn Ubaid said, "I have never seen anyone whose tongue is under his control except that I saw the soundness of that in all his other deeds." Al-Hasan said, "Some people were speaking in the presence of Mu'awiyah, may God have mercy on him, while al-Ahnaf ibn Qais remained silent. He said to him, 'What is the matter, O Abu Bahr, that you do not speak?' He replied, 'I fear God if I lie, and I fear you if I tell the truth.'" Abu Bakr ibn Ayyash said, "Four kings gathered: the King of India, the King of China, Khosrow, and Caesar. One of them said, 'I regret what I have said, but I do not regret what I have not said.' Another said, 'When I utter a word, it masters me and I do not master it; when I do not utter it, I master it and it does not master me.' The third said, 'I marvel at the speaker: if his words return upon him, they harm him; if they do not return, they do not benefit him.' The fourth said, 'I am more capable of retracting what I have not said than of retracting what I have said.'" It is said that al-Mansur ibn al-Mu'tazz did not speak a single word after the night prayer for forty years. It is said that Rabi' ibn Khuthaym did not speak a worldly word for twenty years. When morning came, he would place an inkwell, paper, and a pen before him, and he would write down everything he said, then hold himself to account in the evening.

If you ask: What is the cause of this great virtue in silence? Know that its cause is the multitude of the tongue's afflictions—such as error, lying, backbiting, tale-bearing, ostentation, hypocrisy, obscenity, argumentation, self-praise, delving into falsehood, disputation, idle talk, distortion, exaggeration, diminishment, harming people, and exposing private faults. These are many afflictions, yet they flow easily to the tongue, are not burdensome upon it, and have a sweetness in the heart, with incitements from both natural disposition and Satan. One who plunges into them seldom has the power to restrain the tongue, so he releases it with what he desires and fails to curb it from what he dislikes, for that is among the subtleties of knowledge—as will be detailed later. Thus, in plunging there is peril, and in silence there is safety; for that reason its virtue is magnified. This is in addition to what silence contains of gathering one's focus, maintaining dignity, freeing oneself for reflection, remembrance, and worship, and attaining safety from the consequences of speech in this world and its reckoning in the Hereafter. For God Almighty has said, "Not a word does he utter but there is a ready observer beside him."

One matter indicates the merit of adhering to silence: speech is of four categories. One category is pure harm, another is pure benefit, a third combines harm and benefit, and a fourth entails neither harm nor benefit.

As for that which is pure harm, one must remain silent about it, and likewise that in which there is harm and a benefit that does not outweigh the harm.

As for that which contains neither benefit nor harm, it is superfluous, and occupying oneself with it is a waste of time, which is the very essence of loss. Thus, nothing remains but the fourth category. Indeed, three-quarters of speech have been discarded, leaving only a quarter. This quarter is perilous, for it intermingles with what contains sin—such as the subtleties of ostentation, affectation, backbiting, and self-praise, along with superfluous speech—in a mixture so concealed that its perception is difficult, thereby placing a person in jeopardy. Whoever comprehends the subtleties of the tongue's afflictions—as we shall mention—knows with certainty that what he (peace be upon him) stated is the decisive word, where he said, "Whoever remains silent is saved." By God, he was indeed given the jewels of wisdom and the comprehensive words. None but the elite among scholars know the oceans of meaning beneath each of his words. In what we shall mention of the afflictions and the difficulty of guarding against them, you will come to know the reality of this, if God Almighty wills. We shall now enumerate the afflictions of the tongue, beginning with the lightest and gradually ascending to the graver ones, postponing the discussion of backbiting, tale-bearing, and lying, for their examination is more extensive; they are twenty afflictions. Know this, and you will be rightly guided by the help of God Almighty.

The First Affliction

Discourse on What Does Not Concern You

Know that the best of your states is to guard your utterances from all the faults we have mentioned—backbiting, tale-bearing, lying, ostentation, quarreling, and the like—and to speak only in what is permissible, wherein there is no harm to you or to any Muslim whatsoever. However, if you speak of that which you have no need and no necessity for, then you are squandering your time with it, you will be held accountable for the deeds of your tongue, and you are exchanging what is better for what is inferior. For if you were to devote the time spent in speech to reflection, perhaps there would open to you, through the breezes of God’s mercy during reflection, something whose benefit is immense. And if you were to glorify God—exalted is He—and remember Him and praise Him, it would be better for you. How many a word builds a palace in Paradise? Whoever is able to take a treasure from treasures but takes in its place a worthless pebble from which he gains no benefit is a clear loser. This is an example of one who abandons the remembrance of God—exalted is He—and occupies himself with a permissible matter that does not concern him; for even if he does not sin, he has lost, since he has missed the great profit of remembering God—exalted is He. Indeed, the believer’s silence is only for reflection, contemplation, and taking lesson, and his speech is only for remembrance—so the Prophet, peace be upon him, said. Rather, the capital of a servant is his moments; whenever he spends them on what does not concern him and does not store up reward for the Hereafter with them, he has wasted his capital. For this reason the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “Part of a person’s good Islam is his leaving what does not concern him.” Indeed, something stronger than this has been reported: Anas said, “A youth from among us was martyred on the day of Uhud, and we found on his belly a stone tied from hunger. His mother wiped the dust from his face and said, ‘Congratulations on Paradise, my son.’ The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, ‘And what makes you know? Perhaps he used to speak of what did not concern him and withhold what did not harm him?’” In another narration: The Prophet, peace be upon him, missed Ka‘b and asked about him. They said, “He is ill.” So he went out walking until he came to him. When he entered upon him, he said, “Receive glad tidings, O Ka‘b.” His mother said, “Congratulations on Paradise, O Ka‘b.” The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “Who is this one who presumes against God?” He said, “She is my mother, O Messenger of God.” He said, “And what makes you know, O mother of Ka‘b? Perhaps Ka‘b said what did not concern him or withheld what did not benefit him.” Its meaning is that Paradise is prepared only for one who is not called to account; and whoever speaks of what does not concern him will be held accountable for it. Even if his speech is not unlawful, Paradise is not prepared alongside the scrutiny of the account, for that is a kind of punishment.

And from Muhammad ibn Ka’b, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, the first to enter through this gate will be a man from the people of Paradise." Then Abdullah ibn Salam entered, so some people from the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, came to him and informed him of that, and they said, "Tell us of the most reliable deed in yourself that you hope in." He said, "I am weak, and the most reliable thing I hope in with God is a sound heart and abandoning what does not concern me."

And Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Shall I not teach you of a deed light upon the body yet heavy on the Scale?" I said, "Yes, O Messenger of God." He said, "It is silence, good character, and abandoning what does not concern you."

And Mujahid said: I heard Ibn Abbas say, "Five things are more beloved to me than fine, tethered steeds: Do not speak of what does not concern you, for it is superfluous and I do not deem you safe from sin. And do not speak of what concerns you until you find its proper place, for many a speaker concerning a matter that concerns him has placed it in other than its place and thus erred. And do not argue with a forbearing person nor a fool, for the forbearing will shun you and the fool will harm you. And remember your brother in his absence as you would love him to remember you. And hold him innocent of what you would love to be held innocent of. And treat your brother as you would love to be treated. And work the work of a man who knows he will be recompensed for good and held accountable for disrespect."

And it was said to Luqman the Wise, "What is your wisdom?" He said, "I do not ask about what I have been spared, nor do I burden myself with what does not concern me."

And Murrah al-‘Ijli said, "A matter I have been seeking for twenty years, I have not attained it, yet I will not abandon seeking it." They said, "And what is it?" He said, "Silence regarding what does not concern me."

And Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Do not involve yourself in what does not concern you, and keep apart. And beware of your friend among the people except the trustworthy one, and there is no trustworthy one except he who fears God Almighty. And do not accompany the wicked, lest you learn from his wickedness, nor disclose your secret to him. And consult in your affairs those who fear God Almighty."

The definition of superfluous speech is that which concerns matters where, were you to remain silent, you would incur no sin nor suffer harm in your state or wealth. An example is when you sit with people and recount to them your journeys, what you saw therein of mountains and rivers, the events that befell you, the foods and garments you admired, and what you marveled at concerning the elders of the lands and their affairs. These are matters for which, if you were silent, you would incur no sin nor suffer harm. And even if you strive to the utmost in your effort so that your account contains neither excess nor deficiency, nor self-praise through boasting of witnessing grand events, nor backbiting any person, nor disparaging anything created by God Almighty—despite all this, you are still wasting your time. And how can one be safe from the faults we have mentioned? Among them is that you ask another about what does not concern you; by asking, you waste your own time and have also compelled your companion, through the answer, to waste his. This is if the matter inquired about is one to which a fault may attach, and most questions contain faults. For instance, you ask another about his worship, saying to him, "Are you fasting?" If he says yes, he has made his worship apparent, and ostentation may enter him; if it does not enter, his worship falls from the register of secrecy, and worship in secret is superior to worship in public by degrees. If he says no, he is lying. If he remains silent, he holds you in contempt and you are offended by him. If he resorts to a stratagem to evade the answer, he is reduced to effort and toil therein. Thus, by your question, you have exposed him either to ostentation, or to lying, or to contempt, or to toil in devising an evasion. Likewise is your asking about his other acts of worship, and likewise your asking about sins and about everything he conceals and is ashamed of. And your asking about what another is speaking of, so you say to him, "What are you saying? What are you about?" Likewise, you see a person on the road and say, "From where?" Perhaps a hindrance prevents him from mentioning it; if he mentions it, he is offended and ashamed, and if he does not speak truthfully, he falls into falsehood and you are the cause of it. Likewise, you ask about an issue you have no need of, and the one questioned may not find it easy to say, "I do not know," so he answers without insight.

I do not intend to speak of what does not concern these categories, for this leads to sin or harm.  
An example of what does not concern one is what has been related: Luqman the Wise entered upon David, peace be upon him, while he was weaving a coat of mail—and he had never seen it before that day. He began to marvel at what he saw and wished to ask about it, but his wisdom restrained him, so he held himself back and did not ask. When David finished, he stood up, put it on, and said, “How excellent a garment for war!” Luqman then said, “Silence is wisdom, yet few practice it”—meaning that knowledge was attained without asking, so asking became unnecessary. It is said that he frequented him for a year, wanting to learn it without inquiry. Such questions and their like, if they cause no harm but breach a veil and entangle one in hypocrisy and falsehood, are among what does not concern one, and abandoning them is part of the beauty of Islam. This is its definition.

As for its inciting cause, it is the eagerness to know that which one has no need of, or conversing for the sake of affection, or passing time with tales of states that contain no benefit.

The remedy for all this is to know that death lies before him, and that he will be questioned for every word, and that his breaths are his capital. His tongue is a net with which he can capture the maidens of Paradise; neglecting and squandering this is a manifest loss. This is the remedy from the perspective of knowledge. As for the remedy from the perspective of action, it is seclusion, or to place a pebble in his mouth and compel himself to remain silent regarding some of what concerns him, until the tongue becomes accustomed to abandoning what does not concern it. Restraining the tongue in this matter is exceedingly difficult for one who is not in seclusion.

The Second Affliction

Superfluous Speech

This too is blameworthy, and it encompasses delving into what does not concern one and exceeding in what does concern one beyond the measure of necessity. For one who is concerned with a matter can mention it with concise speech, yet he can also amplify it, affirm it, and repeat it. Whenever his purpose is conveyed with a single word, then using two words makes the second one superfluous—that is, an excess beyond need—and this too is blameworthy for the reason previously mentioned, even if there is no sin or harm in it. 'Ata ibn Abi Rabah said: "Those before you used to dislike superfluous speech, and they considered all speech superfluous except the Book of Allah the Exalted, the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), or enjoining good and forbidding evil, or speaking of your need in your essential livelihood. Do you not know that over you are noble guardians, scribes at the right and the left, recording? Not a word does he utter but there is with him a watcher, ready. Is one of you not ashamed when his scroll, which he dictated by the forenoon, is unfurled and most of what is in it pertains neither to his religion nor his worldly affairs?" And some of the Companions said: "A man may speak to me with words for which a reply is more desirable to me than cold water to the thirsty, yet I withhold my reply for fear it may be superfluous." And Mutarrif said: "Let the majesty of Allah be magnified in your hearts, so that you do not mention Him in contexts like when one of you says to a dog or a donkey, 'May Allah disgrace it,' and the like."

Know that superfluous speech is boundless, while what is essential is confined within the Book of God Almighty. God, Exalted and Majestic, says: "There is no good in much of their secret talk, except for one who enjoins charity, kindness, or reconciliation among people." And He says: "Blessed is he who withholds the excess of his tongue and spends the excess of his wealth." Observe how people have reversed this matter: they withhold the excess of wealth but unleash the excess of speech. It is reported from Mutarrif ibn ‘Abdullah, from his father, who said: I came to the Messenger of God with a group from Banu ‘Amir, and they said: "You are our father, you are our master, you are the most excellent among us in merit, you are the most generous to us in bounty, you are the gleaming basin," and so on. He said: "Say what you must, but do not let Satan seduce you"—indicating that when the tongue elaborates in praise, even truthfully, one fears Satan may seduce him into unnecessary excess.

Ibn Mas‘ud said: "I warn you against superfluous speech; a person’s speech should suffice for his need." Mujahid said: "Indeed, speech is recorded—so much so that if a man silences his son by saying, ‘I will buy you such-and-such,’ it is written as a lie." Al-Hasan said: "O son of Adam, a scroll has been spread for you, and two noble angels are entrusted to record your deeds. So do as you wish, whether much or little." It is related that Solomon, peace be upon him, sent some of his jinn and a group to observe and report what was said. They informed him that a man passed through the market, raised his head to the sky, looked at the people, and shook his head. Solomon asked him about it, and he replied: "I marveled at the angels above people’s heads—how swiftly they write!—and at those below them—how swiftly they dictate!" Ibrahim al-Taymi said: "When a believer intends to speak, he reflects; if it is beneficial, he speaks; otherwise, he restrains. But the wicked speaks impulsively." Al-Hasan said: "Whoever speaks much lies much; whoever possesses much wealth commits many sins; and whoever has a bad character tortures himself." ‘Amr ibn Dinar said: "A man spoke excessively in the presence of the Prophet, and he said to him: ‘How many barriers are before your tongue?’ He replied: ‘My lips and my teeth.’ He said: ‘Did you not have something to restrain your speech?’" In another narration, he said this regarding a man who praised him and became unrestrained in speech, then added: "No one is given anything worse than an excess in his tongue." ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, may God have mercy on him, said: "Fear of ostentation prevents me from much speech." A sage said: "If a man is in a gathering and is pleased with speaking, let him be silent; and if he is silent and pleased with silence, let him speak." Yazid ibn Abi Habib said: "A trial for a scholar is that speech becomes dearer to him than listening; if he finds someone to suffice him, then in listening there is safety, while in speech there is embellishment, increase, and decrease." Ibn ‘Umar said: "The most deserving thing a man purifies is his tongue." Abu al-Darda’ saw a sharp-tongued woman and said: "If she were mute, it would be better for her." Ibrahim said: "Two things destroy people: excess wealth and excess speech." This is the condemnation of superfluous and excessive speech, its cause, and its remedy, as previously discussed regarding idle talk.

The Third Affliction

Delving into falsehood

This discourse concerns sins such as recounting the affairs of women, gatherings of wine-drinking, the stations of the dissolute, the luxuries of the wealthy, the tyranny of kings and their blameworthy customs and disliked conditions, for all of that is among what it is not permissible to delve into, and it is forbidden. As for speech concerning what is of no concern, or more than what is of concern, it is an abandonment of what is most excellent, and there is no prohibition in it. Yet, he who frequently speaks of what is of no concern is not safe from delving into falsehood. Most people gather for the spectacle of conversation, and their speech does not go beyond jesting at people's honor or delving into falsehood. The types of falsehood cannot be enumerated due to their multitude and variety; therefore, there is no deliverance from them except by restricting oneself to what is of concern from the important matters of religion and worldly life. Within this category fall words by which a person is destroyed while he belittles them. Indeed, Bilal ibn al-Harith reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, a man may utter a word from the pleasure of God, not thinking it will reach as far as it does, and God writes for him His pleasure until the Day of Resurrection because of it. And verily, a man may utter a word from the wrath of God, not thinking it will reach as far as it does, and God writes against him His wrath until the Day of Resurrection." And 'Alqamah used to say, "How many words has the hadith of Bilal ibn al-Harith prevented me from speaking!" And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, a man may utter a word to make his companions laugh, and because of it he will plummet farther than the Pleiades." And Abu Hurayrah said, "Verily, a man may utter a word to which he pays no heed, yet God raises him to the highest Paradise because of it." And he, peace be upon him, said, "The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who most delves into falsehood." This is alluded to in His saying, exalted is He, "And we used to plunge [in falsehood] with those who plunged," and His saying, "Then do not sit with them until they plunge into some other discourse; for indeed, then you would be like them." And Salman said, "The greatest of people in sins on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who most speaks in disobedience to God." And Ibn Sirin said, "A man from the Ansar would pass by a gathering of theirs and say to them, 'Perform ablution, for some of what you say is worse than idle talk.'" This is delving into falsehood, and it lies beyond what will come of backbiting, tale-bearing, obscenity, and others. Rather, it is delving into the mention of forbidden things that have already occurred, or contemplating how to attain them without a religious need to mention them. Also included in it is delving into recounting heretical innovations and corrupt doctrines, and recounting what occurred of fighting among the Companions in a manner that suggests disparagement of some of them. All of that is falsehood, and delving into it is delving into falsehood. We ask God for goodly assistance through His gentleness and generosity.

The Fourth Affliction: Contentiousness and Disputation

This is prohibited, as He said: "Do not argue with your brother, do not jest with him, and do not make him a promise you will break." And upon him be peace said: "Abandon argumentation, for its wisdom is not understood and its trial is not safe." And He said: "Whoever abandons argumentation while being in the right, a house is built for him in the highest part of Paradise; and whoever abandons argumentation while being in the wrong, a house is built for him in the outskirts of Paradise." From Umm Salamah, may God be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of God said: "The first thing my Lord enjoined upon me and forbade me from, after the worship of idols and drinking wine, was quarreling with men." And He also said: "No people stray after God has guided them except that they are given disputation." And He also said: "A servant does not attain the reality of faith until he abandons argumentation, even if he is in the right." And He also said: "Six traits, whoever possesses them reaches the reality of faith: fasting in summer, striking the enemies of God with the sword, hastening to prayer on a gloomy day, patience in calamities, performing ablution thoroughly despite disliking it, and abandoning argumentation while being truthful." Al-Zubayr said to his son: Do not dispute with people using the Qur'an, for you cannot overcome them; rather, adhere to the Sunnah. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, mercy of God upon him, said: Whoever makes his religion a target for disputes changes positions frequently. Muslim ibn Yasar said: Beware of argumentation, for it is the hour of the scholar's ignorance, and at that time Satan seeks his slip. It was said: No people stray after God has guided them except through disputation. Malik ibn Anas, mercy of God upon him, said: This disputation is not from religion in any way. He also said: Argumentation hardens hearts and bequeaths grudges. Luqman said to his son: O my son, do not dispute with the scholars, lest they despise you. Bilal ibn Sa'd said: If you see a man obstinate, argumentative, and impressed with his own opinion, his loss is complete. Sufyan said: If I differed with my brother over a pomegranate, and he said it is sweet and I said it is sour, he would take me to the ruler. He also said: Befriend whomever you wish, then anger him with argumentation, and he will surely hurl at you a calamity that prevents you from living. Ibn Abi Layla said: I do not argue with my companion, for I would either call him a liar or anger him. Abu al-Darda' said: It is enough sin for you that you are constantly argumentative. And He said: "Two rak'ahs suffice you from every quarrel." Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: Do not seek knowledge for three reasons, nor abandon it for three. Do not seek it to argue with it, nor to boast with it, nor to show off with it. And do not abandon it out of shyness from seeking it, nor out of disdain for it, nor out of contentment with ignorance of it. Jesus, upon him be peace, said: Whoever increases in lying, his beauty departs; whoever quarrels with men, his chivalry falls; whoever increases in worry, his body sickens; and whoever has bad character, he torments himself. It was said to Maymun ibn Mihran: Why do you not leave your brother due to dislike? He said: Because I do not share his company nor argue with him. What has been reported condemning argumentation and disputation is too numerous to count.

The essence of argumentation is to object to another's speech by exposing a flaw in it, whether in wording, meaning, or the speaker's intent. Abandoning argumentation means refraining from censure and objection. Therefore, whenever you hear speech, if it is true, affirm it; and if it is false or a lie, yet unrelated to religious matters, remain silent about it.

Criticizing another's speech may sometimes target their wording by exposing flaws in grammar, language, Arabic usage, or composition and arrangement due to poor ordering. This can stem from a lack of knowledge or from the tongue's excess. In any case, there is no justification for revealing such faults.

As for the meaning: it is to say, "It is not as you claim," and he has erred in it from such and such an aspect.

As for in his intention, it is like saying: "This speech is true, but your intention from it is not the truth; rather, you in it are one with an ulterior motive," and what is similar to it. This category, if it occurs in a scholarly matter, may be specifically named 'disputation,' and it is also blameworthy. Rather, the obligation is to remain silent or to ask in a manner seeking benefit, not on the basis of obstinacy and rejection, or to be gentle in explanation, not in a manner of fault-finding.

As for argumentation, it is an expression of intending to silence another, to incapacitate them, and to diminish them by finding fault in their speech and attributing to them deficiency and ignorance therein. The sign of this is that having the truth pointed out from another quarter is detestable to the arguer; he loves to be the one who exposes the error, so that he may thereby demonstrate the excellence of himself and the deficiency of his companion. There is no salvation from this except by remaining silent about everything for which one would not incur sin by remaining silent.

The impetus for this is the desire to elevate oneself by displaying knowledge and merit, and to assail others by exposing their shortcomings. These are two hidden, powerful lusts of the soul. As for displaying merit: it stems from self-praise, which arises from the servant's inherent tendency toward the arrogance of claiming superiority and pride—attributes of divine lordship. As for disparaging another: it stems from the predatory nature, for it demands that one rend, shatter, strike, and harm others. These are two blameworthy, destructive traits, and their strength lies in contention and disputation. He who persists in contention and disputation strengthens these destructive traits. This exceeds mere dislike; rather, it is a sin whenever harm befalls another. Contention never parts from causing harm, provoking anger, and compelling the opponent to return and defend his speech by whatever means possible—truth or falsehood—and to disparage the speaker with every conceivable criticism. Thus, strife erupts between the contenders, just as snarling erupts between two dogs, each intending to bite his companion in the most injurious and silencing manner.

As for its remedy: it lies in breaking the pride that incites one to display his own merit, and the predatory anger that incites one to belittle others—as will come in the Book of the Condemnation of Pride and Vanity and the Book of the Condemnation of Anger—for the remedy for every ailment is the removal of its cause. The cause of quarreling and disputation is what we have mentioned. Then, persistence in it makes it a habitual nature until it becomes entrenched in the soul and patience from it becomes difficult.

It is related that Abu Hanifah, mercy of God upon him, said to Dawud al-Ta'i: "Why have you chosen seclusion?" He said: "To struggle against my soul by abandoning disputation." He said: "Attend the gatherings and listen to what is said, but do not speak." He said: "I did so, and I have never seen a struggle more severe upon me than that." And it is as he said, for whoever hears error from another while he is capable of exposing it, patience at that time becomes extremely difficult for him. For this reason, the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever abandons quarreling while he is in the right, God will build for him a house in the highest part of Paradise," due to the severity of that upon the soul. And this most often overcomes in matters of schools of thought and beliefs. For quarreling is a natural disposition; so when one thinks there is reward for it, his eagerness for it intensifies, and his natural disposition and the religious law cooperate upon it. And that is pure error. Rather, it is incumbent upon a person to restrain his tongue regarding the people of the *qiblah*. And if he sees an innovator, he should be gentle in advising him in private, not by way of disputation. For disputation makes it seem to him that it is a trick of his to confuse, and that it is a craft which the disputants of his own school are capable of the like of, if they wished. Thus, the innovation becomes fixed in his heart through argument and is confirmed. So when he knows that advice is of no benefit, he should occupy himself with his own soul and leave him. And the Prophet ﷺ said: "May God have mercy on him who restrains his tongue regarding the people of the *qiblah*, except with the best he is capable of." And Hisham ibn 'Urwah said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, would repeat this saying of his seven times." And whoever becomes accustomed to disputation for a period and people praise him and he finds for himself because of it honor and acceptance, these destructive traits become strong in him, and he is unable to withdraw from them when the authority of anger, pride, ostentation, love of status, and taking pride in merit combine upon him. Each one of these attributes is difficult to struggle against, so how about all of them combined?

The Fifth Affliction: Contentious Dispute

It is also reprehensible and lies beyond argumentation and contention. Contention is to assail another's speech by exposing flaws in it, with no purpose other than belittling the other person and displaying one's own cleverness. Argumentation, however, pertains to presenting and establishing doctrines. Disputation is obstinacy in speech aimed at securing some intended wealth or right, which may arise initially or as an objection. Contention occurs only as an objection to preceding speech. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The most detestable of men to God is the quarrelsome disputant." Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever argues in a dispute without knowledge remains under God's displeasure until he desists." Some have said: Beware of disputation, for it eradicates religion. It is said: No God-fearing person has ever engaged in disputation concerning religion. Ibn Qutaybah said: Bishr ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Bakrah passed by me and said, "What keeps you sitting here?" I replied, "A dispute between me and my cousin." He said, "Your father has a claim upon me, and I wish to repay you for it. By God, I have never seen anything that extinguishes religion more, diminishes manliness more, wastes pleasure more, and preoccupies the heart more than disputation." So I rose to leave, and my opponent said to me, "What is the matter with you?" I said, "I will not dispute with you." He said, "You have realized that the truth is on my side." I said, "No, but I honor myself above this." He said, "Then I will not demand from you anything that is rightfully yours."

If you ask: "When a person has a right, they must inevitably engage in dispute to claim or protect it, whenever an oppressor wrongs them. So how is its ruling, and why is disputation condemned?" Then know that this condemnation applies to one who disputes based on falsehood and without knowledge; such as a judge who, before ascertaining on which side the truth lies, takes on representation in a dispute from whichever side, thus disputing without knowledge. It also applies to one who seeks their right but does not confine themselves to the extent of necessity; rather, they display obstinacy in disputation with the aim of domination or causing harm. And it applies to one who mixes into the dispute hurtful words not needed to support the argument and manifest the truth. And it applies to one driven to dispute purely by stubbornness to overpower and break the opponent, even though they may consider that amount of money trivial. Among people are those who explicitly state: "My only aim is to oppose him and break his honor, and if I take this money from him, I might throw it into a well and care not." This intent of obstinacy, disputation, and contentiousness is highly blameworthy.

As for the wronged person who supports their case through the lawful means, without obstinacy, excess, or undue contentiousness beyond necessity, and without intent of stubbornness or harm, their action is not unlawful. However, the preferable course is to abandon it when a way is found, for restraining the tongue in dispute within the bounds of moderation is difficult. Dispute breeds resentment in the heart and stirs up anger. When anger is stirred, the matter of contention is forgotten, and enmity remains between the disputants, to the point that each rejoices at the other's misfortune and grieves at their joy, and the tongue is unleashed against their honor. Thus, whoever initiates dispute exposes themselves to these dangers, and says what disturbs their own heart, so much so that even in their prayer they become preoccupied with arguing against their opponent, and the matter does not remain within the limits of obligation. Therefore, dispute is the origin of every evil, as are quarreling and argumentation. Hence, its door should not be opened except out of necessity. And in necessity, one should guard the tongue and heart from the consequences of dispute, though that is extremely difficult. Whoever confines themselves to the obligatory in their dispute is safe from sin, and their disputation is not condemned. However, if they could do without the dispute in that which they dispute about, because they have what suffices them, then they are abandoning the preferable course but are not sinful.

Indeed, the least that one misses out on in dispute, quarreling, and argumentation is pleasant speech and the reward mentioned for it; for the lowest degree of pleasant speech is cheerfulness, and no harshness in speech is greater than criticism and objection, whose essence is either declaring ignorance or accusing of falsehood. For whoever argues, quarrels, or disputes with another has deemed them ignorant or called them a liar, thereby missing out on pleasant speech. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "You can attain Paradise through pleasant speech and feeding others." And Allah the Exalted said: "And speak to people good words." And Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said: "Whoever from Allah's creation greets you with peace, return the greeting to them, even if they are a Zoroastrian, for Allah the Exalted says: 'When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or return it.'" And Ibn Abbas also said: "If Pharaoh said something good to me, I would return it to him." And Anas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "In Paradise there are rooms whose outside can be seen from inside and inside from outside, which Allah the Exalted has prepared for those who feed others and soften their speech." And it is narrated that Jesus (peace be upon him) passed by a pig and said: "Pass in peace." It was said: "O Spirit of Allah, do you say this to a pig?" He said: "I dislike accustoming my tongue to evil." And our Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "A good word is charity." And he said: "Guard yourselves against the Fire, even with half a date; if you cannot find that, then with a good word." And Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "Righteousness is something easy: a cheerful face and soft speech." And some wise men said: "Gentle speech washes away grudges hidden in the limbs." And some wise men said: "Any speech that does not anger your Lord, except that you please your companion with it, then do not be stingy with it toward him, for perhaps He will compensate you for it with the reward of the virtuous." All this is regarding the virtue of good speech, and its opposite is dispute, quarreling, argumentation, and contentiousness, for it is forced, alienating speech that hurts the heart, spoils life, stirs anger, and breeds resentment in the chest. We ask Allah for good success by His grace and generosity.

The Sixth Affliction

Affectation in speech through pretentious eloquence and forced rhyme.

Eloquence and artificial embellishment in it through similes, introductions, and what has become customary among those who feign eloquence and claim oratory.

All of this falls under reprehensible affectation and detested artificiality, concerning which the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "I and the God-fearing of my community are free from artificiality." And he said, peace be upon him: "Indeed, the most hateful of you to me and the farthest from me in the assembly are the verbose, the pretentiously learned, and those who are bombastic in speech." And Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The worst of my community are those who are nurtured in luxury, who eat various foods, wear various garments, and are bombastic in speech." And he said, peace be upon him: "Verily, the extremists are destroyed—three times." Extremism here means delving excessively and being exhaustive. And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "The flashy ornaments of speech are among the flashy ornaments of Satan." And 'Umar ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas came to his father Sa'd asking for a need, but he spoke before stating his need with some speech. So Sa'd said to him: "You have never been farther from your need than you are today! I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: 'There will come upon people a time when they will pick through speech with their tongues as a cow picks through fodder with its tongue.'" It was as if he disapproved of the amorous prelude and the artificial, contrived introduction he prefaced his speech with. This too is among the afflictions of the tongue, and it includes every contrived rhyme, as well as ostentatious eloquence that exceeds customary bounds, and likewise the artificial use of rhyme in conversations. "When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, ruled regarding the compensation for a fetus, one of the offender's people said: 'How do we give blood-money for one who did not drink, nor eat, nor cry out, nor wail, and whose likeness is void?' So he said: 'Is this rhyming like the rhyming of the Bedouins?'" And he disapproved of that because the trace of affectation and artificiality was evident in it. Rather, one should limit everything to its purpose: the purpose of speech is to convey the intended meaning, and anything beyond that is reprehensible affectation. Excluded from this is the beautification of words in sermons and reminders, without being obscure or far-fetched, for their purpose is to stir hearts, attract them, restrain them, and expand them. Thus, elegance of expression has an effect in this and is appropriate for it. As for conversations that occur to fulfill needs, rhyme, bombast, and preoccupation with them are not fitting; they are from reprehensible artificiality. Nothing prompts it except ostentation, displaying eloquence, and distinguishing oneself with skill—all of which are reprehensible, disliked by the Sacred Law, and warned against.

The Seventh Affliction

Obscenity, insult, and foulness of speech

It is reprehensible and forbidden, and its source is wickedness and baseness. God Almighty said, "Beware of obscenity, for God does not love obscenity or those who are obscene." The Messenger of God forbade cursing the slain polytheists of Badr, saying, "Do not curse these, for nothing of what you say reaches them, and you harm the living. Indeed, vulgarity is baseness." He said, "The believer is not one who reviles, nor one who curses, nor one who is foul-mouthed, nor one who is vulgar." He said, "Paradise is forbidden to every foul-mouthed person to enter." He said, "Four will harm the people of Hell in Hell, despite the torment they themselves suffer, running between scalding water and blazing fire, calling out in woe and ruin: a man from whose mouth flows pus and blood. It is said to him, 'What is wrong with the distant one who has harmed us despite our own torment?' He replies, 'The distant one used to listen to every foul, vile word and relish it as one relishes obscenity.'" He said to Aisha, "O Aisha, if obscenity were a man, he would be an evil man." He said, "Vulgarity and explicit speech are two branches of hypocrisy." It is possible that explicit speech here refers to matters of religion and the attributes of God Almighty, for presenting such matters in a general manner to the ears of common people is preferable to excessive elaboration in explaining them; for from extreme explicitness in this may arise doubts and whisperings. If presented generally, hearts hasten to acceptance and are not disturbed. However, mentioning it coupled with vulgarity suggests that what is intended is openly declaring what a person would be ashamed to express, for in such matters, turning a blind eye and overlooking is better than exposure and explicit speech. He said, "God does not love the foul-mouthed, the obscene, the one who shouts in the markets." Jabir ibn Samura said: I was sitting with the Prophet, and my father was before me. He said, "Obscenity and being obscene have nothing to do with Islam, and the best of people in Islam are those with the best character." Ibrahim ibn Maysara said: It is said that the foul-mouthed, obscene person will be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a dog or inside a dog. Al-Ahnaf ibn Qais said: Shall I not inform you of the worst ailment? The vulgar tongue and the base character.

This is the condemnation of obscenity. As for its definition and essence, it is the explicit expression of disgraceful matters, most of which pertains to words of sexual intercourse and what relates to it. For people of corruption use explicit, indecent expressions for it, while the righteous avoid them, indeed they use euphemisms for them. They allude to them through symbols, mentioning what approximates and relates to them. Ibn Abbas said: "Verily, God is Modest, Generous; He pardons and uses euphemisms." He used euphemisms like 'touching' for intercourse, so 'contact,' 'touch,' 'entering,' and 'companionship' are euphemisms for intercourse and are not indecent. There are, however, indecent expressions whose mention is deemed disgraceful, and most of them are used in insults and reproach. These expressions vary in obscenity, some being more obscene than others. This may differ according to local custom; their beginnings are disliked and their ends are forbidden, with degrees in between where judgment may vary. This is not specific to intercourse; rather, using euphemisms for relieving oneself, like for urination and defecation, is more appropriate than the explicit terms for excretion and filth and the like. For this too is among what is concealed, and everything concealed is a cause for modesty, so its explicit terms should not be mentioned, as that is obscenity. Likewise, it is commendable in custom to use euphemisms for women; one should not say, "Your wife said such," but rather, "It was said in the chamber," or "from behind the screen," or "the mother of the children said." Subtlety in these words is praiseworthy, and explicitness in them leads to obscenity. Similarly, for one who has defects that cause shame, they should not be expressed with their explicit terms, like leprosy, alopecia, or hemorrhoids. Rather, one should say, "the ailment he complains of," and what is similar. Explicit mention of that falls under obscenity, and all of this is among the afflictions of the tongue.

Ala ibn Harun said: Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was cautious in his speech. A boil appeared under his armpit, so we went to him to ask and see what he would say. We asked, "From where did it emerge?" He replied, "From the inner part of the hand." The motive for obscenity is either the intent to harm or the habit acquired from keeping company with the corrupt and people of wickedness and baseness, whose custom is reviling. A Bedouin said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "Counsel me." He said, "Upon you is the fear of God. If a man reproaches you for something he knows is in you, do not reproach him for something in him, lest its harm be upon him and its reward be for you. And do not revile anything." He said, "I did not revile anything after that." And Iyad ibn Himar said: I said, "O Messenger of God, a man from my people reviles me, and he is beneath me. Is there any blame upon me if I retaliate against him?" He said, "The two who revile each other are two devils, braying and bellowing at each other." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Reviling a believer is transgression, and fighting him is disbelief." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Regarding the two who revile each other, what they say is upon the one who began, until the wronged one transgresses." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Cursed is he who reviles his parents." In another narration: "Among the greatest major sins is that a man reviles his parents." They said, "O Messenger of God, how does a man revile his parents?" He said, "He reviles a man's father, so the other reviles his father."

The Eighth Affliction: Cursing

Whether directed at an animal, an inanimate object, or a human being, all such [cursing] is blameworthy. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "A believer is not one who frequently curses." And he said, peace be upon him, "Do not curse one another by invoking God's curse, His wrath, or Hellfire." Hudhayfah said, "Never has a people taken to mutual cursing except that the decree [of punishment] became due upon them." And 'Imran ibn Husayn said: While the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was on one of his journeys, a woman from the Ansar was on her she-camel, and she became impatient with it and cursed it. He, peace be upon him, said, "Take what is upon her and set her loose, for she is accursed." He said: It is as if I can still see that she-camel walking among the people with no one approaching her. And Abu al-Darda' said, "No one curses the earth except that it says, 'May God curse the most disobedient to God.'" And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, heard Abu Bakr cursing one of his servants. He turned to him and said, "O Abu Bakr, truthful ones and frequent cursers? No, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!"—twice or thrice. So Abu Bakr freed his servants that day and came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said, "I will not do it again." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, those who frequently curse will not be intercessors nor witnesses on the Day of Resurrection." And Anas said: A man was traveling with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, on a camel and he cursed his camel. He, peace be upon him, said, "O servant of God, do not travel with us on an accursed mount," and he said this as a rebuke to him.

Cursing is an expression of expulsion and banishment by God, the Exalted. This is not permissible except for one characterized by a quality that distances him from God, the Mighty and Majestic, namely disbelief and oppression, such as saying, "The curse of God be upon the oppressors and the disbelievers." One should adhere in this to the wording of the Sacred Law, for in cursing there is danger, because it is a judgment upon God, the Mighty and Majestic, that He has banished the one cursed, and that is part of the Unseen which none knows except God, the Exalted, and His Messenger, peace be upon him, if God has informed him of it.

The attributes warranting curse are three: disbelief, innovation, and transgression. For each of these, there are three degrees.

The first type: cursing by general description, such as saying, "May God's curse be upon the disbelievers, the innovators, and the wicked."

The second type: Cursing with specific attributes more particular than it, such as saying, "May God's curse be upon the Jews, the Christians, and the Magians," or upon the Qadariyyah, the Khawarij, and the Rawafid, or upon the fornicators, the oppressors, and the usurers. All of that is permissible. However, in cursing the attributes of innovators there is peril, because the recognition of innovation is ambiguous and no transmitted wording has been reported. Therefore, the common people should be restrained from it, for that invites opposition with its like and stirs up strife among people and corruption.

The third type: Cursing a specific individual. This carries risk, such as saying, "May God curse Zayd," when he is a disbeliever, a transgressor, or an innovator. The detailed ruling is that for any person whose curse is established by the Sacred Law, it is permissible to curse them, such as saying, "May God curse Pharaoh," or "May God curse Abu Jahl," because it is established that these individuals died upon disbelief, and this is known legally. However, regarding a specific individual in our own time, such as saying, "May God curse Zayd," if he is, for example, a Jew, this is risky, for he may possibly embrace Islam and die beloved to God. How then can one judge him to be cursed? If you were to say: He is cursed for being a disbeliever in the present state, just as one says for a Muslim, "May God have mercy on him," for being a Muslim in the present state, even though it is conceivable he might apostatize? Then know that the meaning of our saying, "May God have mercy on him," is: May God keep him firm upon Islam, which is the cause of mercy, and upon obedience. It is not possible to say: May God keep the disbeliever firm upon that which is the cause of the curse, for this is a supplication for disbelief, and is in itself disbelief. Rather, what is permissible is to say: May God curse him if he dies upon disbelief, and may God not curse him if he dies upon Islam. That is part of the unseen which is not known. An absolute statement wavers between the two possibilities, so it is risky, and there is no risk in refraining from the curse. Once you understand this concerning the disbeliever, it applies all the more to Zayd the transgressor or Zayd the innovator. Therefore, cursing specific individuals is risky because individuals' states may change, except for those about whom the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, gave specific knowledge. For it is permissible to know who will die upon disbelief, and for this reason he specified certain people for cursing, as he would say in his supplication against Quraysh, "O God, deal with Abu Jahl ibn Hisham and 'Utbah ibn Rabi'ah," and he mentioned a group who were killed upon disbelief. However, regarding one whose final outcome was not known, he would curse him but was then prohibited from it, as it is related: He used to curse those who killed the companions at Bi'r Ma'unah in his *qunut* for a month, then the verse was revealed: "Not for you is the decision whether He should forgive them or punish them, for indeed they are wrongdoers." This means they might possibly embrace Islam, so how can you know they are cursed? Likewise, for one whose death upon disbelief becomes clear to us, it is permissible to curse him and to censure him, provided it does not cause harm to a Muslim. If it would cause harm, it is not permissible, as is related that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, asked Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, about a grave he passed by while heading to Ta'if. He said, "This is the grave of a man who was insolent towards God and His Messenger," and it was Sa'id ibn al-'As. His son, 'Amr ibn Sa'id, became angry and said, "O Messenger of God, this is the grave of a man who was more generous with food and more valiant in striking heads than Abu Quhafah." Abu Bakr said, "Does he speak to me with such words, O Messenger of God?" He, peace be upon him, said, "Leave Abu Bakr alone." He then turned to Abu Bakr and said, "O Abu Bakr, when you mention the disbelievers, speak in general terms, for if you specify, the sons become angry for their fathers." So the people refrained from that. And Nu'ayman drank wine and was punished several times in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Some of the Companions said, "May God curse him, how often he is brought!" He, peace be upon him, said, "Do not be an aid to Satan against your brother." In another narration: "Do not say this, for he loves God and His Messenger." So he forbade him from that. This indicates that cursing a specific transgressor is not permissible. In summary, there is risk in cursing specific persons, so it should be avoided. There is no risk in remaining silent about cursing Iblis, for example, let alone others.

If it is asked: Is it permissible to curse Yazid because he killed al-Husayn or ordered his killing? We say: This has not been established at all, so it is not permissible to say that he killed him or ordered it without proof, let alone to curse him, because it is not permissible to attribute a major sin to a Muslim without verification. Indeed, it is permissible to say that Ibn Muljam killed 'Ali and that Abu Lu'lu'ah killed 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, for that has been established through widespread transmission. Thus, it is not permissible to accuse a Muslim of immorality or disbelief without verification. He (peace be upon him) said, "No man should accuse another of disbelief or immorality if it rebounds upon him, unless his companion is indeed such." And he (peace be upon him) said, "No man bears witness against another with disbelief except that one of them bears it: if he was a disbeliever, then it is as he said; but if he was not a disbeliever, then he has disbelieved by declaring him a disbeliever." This means to declare him a disbeliever while knowing he is a Muslim. If he presumed he was a disbeliever due to innovation or otherwise, he was mistaken, not a disbeliever. And Mu'adh said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to me, "I forbid you from insulting a Muslim or disobeying a just ruler, and interfering with the dead is more severe." Masruq said: I entered upon 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, and she said, "What has so-and-so done? May God curse him!" I said, "He has died." She said, "May God have mercy on him." I said, "How is this?" She said, "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, 'Do not insult the dead, for they have gone to what they have sent forth.'" And he (peace be upon him) said, "Do not insult the dead, for you thereby hurt the living." And he (peace be upon him) said, "O people, preserve me regarding my companions, my brothers, and my in-laws, and do not insult them. O people, when a person dies, mention the good about him."

If it is asked: Is it permissible to say, "May God curse the killer of al-Husayn," or "May God curse the one who ordered his killing"? We say: The correct position is to say, "May God curse the killer of al-Husayn if he died before repentance," because it is possible that he died after repentance. For indeed, Wahshi, the killer of Hamzah, the uncle of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), killed him while he was an unbeliever, then he repented from both unbelief and the killing, and it is not permissible to curse him. Killing is a major sin, but it does not reach the rank of unbelief. Therefore, if the statement is not qualified by repentance and is left absolute, there is a risk in it, whereas there is no risk in remaining silent; thus, silence is preferable.

We have presented this due to people's negligence regarding cursing and freely uttering it with the tongue. The believer is not one who curses, so it is not fitting to let the tongue loose with a curse except upon one who has died in disbelief, or upon categories known by their attributes rather than specific individuals. Occupying oneself with the remembrance of God is more worthy, and if that is not possible, then in silence there is safety.

Maki ibn Ibrahim said: We were with Ibn 'Awn when they mentioned Bilal ibn Abi Burdah, and they began to curse him and speak ill of him, while Ibn 'Awn remained silent. They said, "O Ibn 'Awn, you only mention him because of what he did to you." He replied, "There are only two phrases that will emerge from my record on the Day of Resurrection: 'There is no god but God' and 'May God curse so-and-so.' I would rather 'There is no god but God' emerge from my record than 'May God curse so-and-so' emerge from it." And a man said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "Counsel me." He said, "I counsel you not to be one who curses." Ibn 'Umar said: "The most detestable of people to God is every slanderer and curser." Some said: "Cursing a believer is equivalent to killing him." And Hammad ibn Zaid said after narrating this, "If I were to say it is raised [to the Prophet], I would not mind." And from Abu Qatadah, he said: He used to say, "Whoever curses a believer, it is as if he has killed him." And that has been transmitted as a hadith raised to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him.

And akin to cursing is praying for harm upon a person, even praying against an oppressor, such as one saying, for instance, "May God not grant health to his body, nor may God preserve him," and what follows in that vein, for that is blameworthy. And in the tradition: "Indeed, the oppressed one prays against the oppressor until he is recompensed, then there remains for the oppressor a surplus from him on the Day of Resurrection."

The Ninth Affliction: Singing and Poetry

We have already discussed in the Book of Listening what is forbidden and what is permissible regarding singing, so we shall not repeat it. As for poetry, it is speech whose good is good and whose foul is foul, except that exclusive devotion to it is blameworthy. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "It would be better for one of you to have his belly filled with pus until it consumes him than to have it filled with poetry." And it is related from Masruq that when he was asked about a line of poetry, he disliked it. When questioned about that, he said, "I dislike that poetry be found in my record." And when one of them was asked about something of poetry, he said, "Replace this with remembrance, for the remembrance of God is better than poetry." In summary, the recitation and composition of poetry is not forbidden, provided it does not contain objectionable speech. He, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, in some poetry there is wisdom." However, the aim of poetry is typically praise, censure, and amorous description, and falsehood may enter into it. Yet the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded Hassan ibn Thabit al-Ansari to satirize the disbelievers and to be expansive in praise, for even if it contains falsehood, it does not attain the prohibition of falsehood, as the poet said:

Were there naught in his hand but his own soul, he would give it freely. Let him then fear God, for he will be questioned.

For this is an expression describing the utmost limit of generosity; if its subject is not generous, he is a liar, and if he is generous, then the hyperbole is a craft of poetry, not intended to be taken as a literal belief in its depiction. Verses were recited in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and if one were to examine them, similar instances would be found, yet he did not forbid it. Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was mending his sandal while I sat spinning. I looked at him and saw his forehead perspiring, and his sweat giving rise to light. She said: I was awestruck. He looked at me and said, "What has made you awestruck?" I said: O Messenger of God, I looked at you and saw your forehead perspiring and your sweat giving rise to light. If Abu Kabir al-Hudhali saw you, he would know you are most deserving of his poetry. He said, "And what does Abu Kabir al-Hudhali say, O Aisha?" I said: He says these two verses:

And purified from every impurity of menstruation, and the corruption of a nursing mother, and a chronic disease. And when you gaze upon the radiance of his countenance, it flashes like the flash of a radiant, smiling rain-cloud.

He placed what was in his hand and came to me, kissing between my eyes and saying, "May God reward you with goodness, O A'ishah. I have never been as delighted by anything as I am delighted by you." And when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, distributed the spoils on the day of Hunayn, he ordered four she-camels for al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas, who then proceeded to complain in a poem of his, ending with:

Nor was there one who hastens, nor one who restrains,  
Who dominate a gathering in their prime.  
And you are not less than either of them,  
Nor does one whom you lower today ever rise.

He (peace be upon him) said, "Cut out his tongue." So Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may God be pleased with him) took him away until he had selected a hundred camels, then returned while he was among the people. He (peace be upon him) said to him, "Do you speak in poetry?" He began to apologize to him, saying, "May my father and mother be your ransom, I indeed feel poetry creeping upon my tongue like the creeping of ants, then it stings me as ants sting, and I find no escape from speaking poetry." He (peace be upon him) smiled and said, "The Arabs will not abandon poetry until the camels abandon their groaning."

The Tenth Affliction: Frivolity

Its essence is blameworthy and prohibited, except for a small amount that is exempted. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Do not argue with your brother and do not jest with him." If you say: Argumentation involves harm because it entails contradicting or making a fool of one's brother or friend, whereas jesting is playful and involves cheerfulness and a light heart, so why is it prohibited? Know that what is prohibited is its excess or its constant practice. As for constant practice, it is because it involves preoccupation with play and frivolity. Play is permissible, but persistence in it is blameworthy. As for its excess, it leads to excessive laughter, and excessive laughter deadens the heart, sometimes breeds resentment, and diminishes dignity and reverence. That which is free from these matters is not blameworthy, as is reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said, "I do jest, but I speak only the truth." However, one like him is capable of jesting while speaking only the truth, whereas others, when they open the door to jesting, aim to make people laugh by any means. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "A man may utter a word to make his companions laugh, by which he plunges into Hell farther than the distance to the Pleiades." And 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said: "He who laughs much loses his dignity; he who jests is taken lightly; he who does something often becomes known for it; he who speaks much errs much; he who errs much loses his modesty; he who loses his modesty loses his piety; and he who loses his piety, his heart dies." Because laughter indicates heedlessness of the Hereafter, he (peace be upon him) said, "If you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little." A man said to his brother, "O my brother, have you been informed that you are destined for the Fire?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Have you been informed that you will emerge from it?" He said, "No." He said, "Then why do you laugh?" It is said that he was never seen laughing until he died. Yusuf ibn Asbat said: "Al-Hasan went thirty years without laughing." It is said that 'Ata' al-Sulami went forty years without laughing. Wahb ibn al-Ward looked at people laughing on Eid al-Fitr and said, "If these people have been forgiven, then this is not the behavior of the grateful; and if they have not been forgiven, then this is not the behavior of the fearful." 'Abdullah ibn Abi Ya'la used to say, "Do you laugh while perhaps your shrouds have already been taken from the washerman?" Ibn 'Abbas said, "Whoever commits a sin while laughing will enter Hellfire weeping." Muhammad ibn Wasil said, "If you see a man weeping in Paradise, would you not be astonished at his weeping?" It was said, "Yes." He said, "Then is not the one who laughs in this world, not knowing what will become of him, more astonishing than that?" These are the harms of laughter. What is blameworthy is to be consumed by laughter, and what is praiseworthy is the smile in which the teeth are revealed but no sound is heard. Such was the laughter of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). Al-Qasim, the freedman of Mu'awiyah, said: "A Bedouin approached the Prophet (peace be upon him) on a stubborn she-camel. He greeted him, but whenever he drew near to ask him something, the camel would bolt, causing the companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) to laugh at him. He did this repeatedly until it threw him and killed him. It was said, 'O Messenger of God, the Bedouin has been thrown by his she-camel and has perished.' He said, 'Yes, and your mouths are filled with his blood.'" As for jesting leading to loss of dignity, 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said, "He who jests is taken lightly." Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: "My mother said to me, 'O my son, do not jest with boys, lest you become cheap in their eyes.'" Sa'id ibn al-'As said to his son, "O my son, do not jest with a nobleman, lest he bear a grudge against you, nor with a lowly person, lest he become bold with you." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz (may God have mercy on him) said: "Fear God and beware of jesting, for it breeds resentment and leads to foulness. Speak of the Quran and keep company with it; if it becomes heavy for you, then speak good words from the speech of men." 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said, "Do you know why jesting is called *mizah*?" They said, "No." He said, "Because it removes (*yuzihu*) its companion from the truth." It is said: "Everything has seeds, and the seeds of enmity are jesting." And it is said: "Jesting strips away inhibition and severs friendships."

If you say: "Jesting has been reported from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his Companions, so how can it be prohibited?" I say: If you are capable of what the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his Companions were capable of—which is to jest without saying anything but the truth, without hurting a heart, without excess in it, and limiting it to rare occasions—then there is no blame upon you in it. However, it is a grave error for a person to take jesting as a regular practice, to persist in it and be excessive in it, and then to cling to the action of the Messenger (peace be upon him). He is like one who spends his day among the Abyssinians, watching them and their dancing, and clings to the fact that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) permitted 'A'ishah to watch the dancing of the Abyssinians on a day of Eid. This is a mistake, for among the minor sins are those that become major through persistence, and among the permissible matters are those that become minor sins through persistence. One should not be heedless of this.

Yes, Abu Hurayrah reported that they said: "O Messenger of God, you jest with us." He said: "Indeed, even if I jest with you, I say nothing but the truth." 'Ata' said: A man asked Ibn 'Abbas: "Did the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) jest?" He said: "Yes." He said: "What was his jesting like?" He said: "His jesting was that he (peace be upon him) gave one of his wives a wide garment one day and said: 'Why don't you wear it, give praise, and let its train flow like the train of a bride?'"

Anas said: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) was the most playful of people with his wives." It is reported that he smiled often. Al-Hasan said: An old woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he said to her: "No old woman will enter Paradise." She wept, so he said: "You will not be an old woman on that day. God Almighty said: 'Indeed, We have produced them in a [new] production, and made them virgins.'"

Zayd ibn Aslam said: A woman called Umm Ayman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: "Your husband invites you." He said: "Who is he? Is he the one with whiteness in his eye?" She said: "By God, there is no whiteness in his eye!" He said: "Rather, there is whiteness in his eye." She said: "No, by God!" He said (peace be upon him): "There is no one except that there is whiteness in his eye," meaning the white surrounding the pupil.

Another woman came and said: "O Messenger of God, carry me on a camel." He said: "Rather, we will carry you on the son of a camel." She said: "What shall I do with it? It cannot carry me." He said (peace be upon him): "There is no camel except that it is the son of a camel." Thus he would jest with it.

Anas said: Abu Talhah had a son called Abu 'Umayr, and the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) would come to them and say: "O Abu 'Umayr, what has the *nughayr* done?" The *nughayr* was a sparrow chick he played with.

'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her) said: "I went out with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) on the expedition to Badr. He said: 'Come, let me race you.' So I tightened my garment around my waist, then we drew a line, stood on it, and raced. He outran me and said: 'This is in place of Dhu al-Majaz.' That was because one day he came while we were at Dhu al-Majaz and I was a young girl; my father had sent me with something. He said: 'Give it to me.' I refused and ran, and he ran after me but did not catch me." She also said: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) raced me and I outran him. Then when I had gained weight, he raced me and outran me, and said: 'This is for that.'"

She also said (may God be pleased with her): "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was with me and Sawdah bint Zam'ah. I made *harirah* (a type of dish) and brought it. I said to Sawdah: 'Eat.' She said: 'I do not like it.' I said: 'By God, you will eat it or I will smear it on your face.' She said: 'I will not taste it.' So I took something from the dish with my hand and smeared it on her face, while the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was sitting between me and her. The Messenger of God lowered his knee for her so she could retaliate against me. So she took something from the dish and wiped my face with it, and the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) laughed."

It is reported that al-Dahhak ibn Sufyan al-Kalabi was an ugly, unattractive man. When he pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he said: "I have two wives more beautiful than this *humayra'* (a reddish one, referring to 'A'ishah)—this was before the verse of the veil was revealed—shall I not give one of them to you so you may marry her?" 'A'ishah was sitting and listening. She said: "Is she more beautiful, or are you?" He said: "Rather, I am more beautiful and noble than her." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) laughed at her question to him because he was ugly.

'Alqamah reported from Abu Salamah that he (peace be upon him) would stick out his tongue to al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (peace be upon them), and the child would see his tongue and be delighted by it. 'Uyaynah ibn Badr al-Fazari said to him: "By God, I have a son who has married and his face has become pale, and I have never kissed him!" He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy."

Most of these playful interactions are reported with women and children, and this from him (peace be upon him) was a treatment for the weakness of their hearts, without inclination to frivolity. He (peace be upon him) once said to Suhayb, who had an eye inflammation while eating dates: "Do you eat dates while you have an eye inflammation?" He said: "I am eating with the other side, O Messenger of God." So he (peace be upon him) smiled. A narrator said: "Until I saw his molars."

It is reported that Khawwat ibn Jubayr al-Ansari was sitting with some women from Banu Ka'b on the road to Mecca when the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) appeared to him and said: "O Abu 'Abd Allah, what are you doing with the women?" He said: "They are braiding the forelock of a camel for me that is prone to stray." He said: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) went about his need, then returned and said: 'O Abu 'Abd Allah, has that straying camel not stopped yet?'" He said: "I fell silent and was embarrassed. After that, I would flee from him whenever I saw him out of shyness from him, until I came to Medina. After I came to Medina," he said, "he saw me praying in the mosque one day, so he sat by me. I prolonged the prayer, so he said: 'Do not prolong it, for I am waiting for you.' When I finished the prayer, he said: 'O Abu 'Abd Allah, has that straying camel not stopped yet?'" He said: "I fell silent and was embarrassed. He stood up, and after that I would flee from him until one day he caught up with me while he was on a donkey, having placed both his legs on one side. He said: 'O Abu 'Abd Allah, has that straying camel not stopped yet?' I said: 'By the One who sent you with the truth, it has not strayed since I became Muslim.' He said: 'God is greatest, God is greatest. O God, guide Abu 'Abd Allah.'" He said: "So his Islam became good and God guided him."

Nu'ayman al-Ansari was a man given to jesting. He would drink wine in Medina and be brought to the Prophet (peace be upon him), who would strike him with his sandal and order his Companions to strike him with their sandals. When he did this frequently, a man from the Companions said to him: "May God curse you." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Do not do that, for he loves God and His Messenger." No envoys or merchandise would enter Medina but that he would buy from it, then come to the

The Eleventh Affliction

Mockery and Derision

This is forbidden whenever it causes harm, as God Almighty has said: "O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them." The meaning of ridicule is contempt, belittlement, and drawing attention to faults and deficiencies in a manner that provokes laughter. This may occur through imitation in action and speech, or through gesture and indication. If it is done in the presence of the one being mocked, it is not termed backbiting, though it carries its meaning. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "I imitated a person, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to me: 'By God, I would not like that I imitated a person and had such-and-such.'" Ibn 'Abbas said concerning God's saying: "Woe to us! What is with this book that leaves nothing small or great but that it has enumerated it?" that the small thing is smiling in mockery of a believer, and the great thing is guffawing in doing so. This indicates that laughing at people is among the sins and major wrongdoings. It is related from 'Abdullah ibn Zam'ah that he said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, while he was delivering a sermon, admonishing them concerning their laughing at breaking wind, and he said: "Why does one of you laugh at what he does?" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, those who mock people—a gate of Paradise is opened for one of them, and it is said: 'Come, come.' So he comes with his distress and grief, but when he reaches it, it is closed upon him. Then another gate is opened for him, and it is said: 'Come, come.' So he comes with his distress and grief, but when he reaches it, it is closed upon him. And it continues like this until, indeed, a gate is opened for the man and he is told: 'Come, come,' but he does not come to it." Mu'adh ibn Jabal said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever reproaches his brother for a sin from which he has repented will not die until he commits it." All of this returns to holding others in contempt and laughing at them, belittling and demeaning them. Upon this is based His saying: "Perhaps they may be better than them"—meaning, do not hold him in contempt and deem him insignificant, for perhaps he is better than you.

This is only prohibited for one who is harmed by it. As for one who makes himself an object of mockery and perhaps even delights in being ridiculed, then mockery in his case falls under the category of jest—and what is blameworthy and praiseworthy therein has already preceded. What is forbidden is belittlement that harms the mocked person, due to what it contains of degradation and contempt. This occurs sometimes by laughing at his speech when he stumbles and fails to articulate, or at his actions when they are disordered, such as laughing at his handwriting or his craft, or at his appearance and form if he is short or deficient due to some defect. Laughter at all of that falls under the prohibited mockery.

The Twelfth Affliction

Disclosing Secrets

It is prohibited due to the harm it causes and the disregard for the rights of acquaintances and friends. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "When a man relates a discourse and then turns away, it is a trust." And he said generally, "Discourse among you is a trust." Al-Hasan said, "Verily, it is from betrayal that you relate the secret of your brother." It is narrated that Mu'awiyah, may God be pleased with him, confided a discourse to Al-Walid ibn 'Utbah, who then said to his father, "O father, the Commander of the Faithful confided a discourse to me, and I do not think he would conceal from you what he has disclosed to another?" He said, "Then do not relate it to me, for whoever conceals his secret, the choice remains his; but whoever divulges it, the choice is taken from him." He said, "I replied, 'O father, does this indeed come between a man and his son?'" He said, "No, by God, my son, but I love that you not habituate your tongue to discourses of secrecy." He said, "I then went to Mu'awiyah and informed him, and he said, 'O Walid, your father has emancipated you from the bondage of error, for divulging a secret is betrayal.'"

It is forbidden if it causes harm, and base if it does not cause harm. We have already discussed what pertains to keeping secrets in the Book of the Etiquette of Companionship, which suffices without repetition.

The Thirteenth Affliction

The False Promise

For the tongue is quick to promise, yet the soul may not grant fulfillment, thus the promise becomes a breach. This is among the signs of hypocrisy. God Almighty has said, "O you who believe, fulfill your contracts." And the Prophet ﷺ said, "A promise is a gift," and "Fulfilling a promise is like a debt, or better." And "al-wa'y" means the promise. God Almighty praised His prophet Ishmael, peace be upon him, in His Noble Book, saying, "He was true to his promise." It is said that he promised a man at a certain place, but that man did not return to him; rather, he forgot. So Ishmael remained waiting for him for twenty-two days. And when the time of death came to Abdullah ibn Umar, he said, "A man from Quraysh proposed to my daughter, and I had given him something akin to a promise. By God, I will not meet God with a third of hypocrisy! I call you to witness that I have married my daughter to him." And from Abdullah ibn Abi al-Khansa, who said, "I pledged allegiance to the Prophet ﷺ before his mission, and I owed him something remaining. I promised him to bring it to him in that very place, but I forgot that day and the next. I came to him on the third day, and he was in his place. He said, 'O young man, you have caused me hardship; I have been here waiting for you for three days.'" And it was said to Ibrahim, "A man promises another man an appointment but does not come." He said, "He should wait for him until the time of the prayer that is due arrives." And the Messenger of God ﷺ, when he promised something, would say, "Perhaps." And Ibn Mas'ud would not make a promise except that he would say, "If God wills," and that is the most proper.

Then, if one understands along with that the firmness in promise, fulfillment is necessary unless it becomes impossible. If at the time of the promise one is resolved not to fulfill it, this is hypocrisy. Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Three traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite, even if he fasts, prays, and claims to be Muslim: when he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks it, and when entrusted he betrays." And Abdullah ibn Amr, may God be pleased with them both, reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Four traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite, and whoever possesses one of them possesses a trait of hypocrisy until he abandons it: when he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks it, when he makes a covenant he betrays it, and when he disputes he acts immorally." This applies to the resolve to break a promise or to abandon fulfillment without excuse. As for one who resolves to fulfill it, but an excuse prevents him from fulfillment, he is not a hypocrite, even if what occurs resembles the form of hypocrisy. Yet one should also beware of the form of hypocrisy as one is wary of its reality, and one should not consider oneself excused without a compelling necessity. It has been narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had promised Abu al-Haytham ibn al-Tayyihan a servant; then three captives were brought, and he gave two away, leaving one. Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, came to him requesting a servant, saying, "Do you not see the mark of the millstone on my hand?" He remembered his promise to Abu al-Haytham and kept saying, "What about my promise to Abu al-Haytham?" So he gave him preference over Fatimah—due to his prior promise to him—even though she was turning the millstone with her weak hand. And indeed, the Prophet, peace be upon him, was sitting distributing the spoils of Hawazin at Hunayn when a man stood before him and said, "I have a promise from you, O Messenger of God." He said, "You speak truthfully, so judge as you wish." The man said, "I judge for eighty sheep and their shepherd." He said, "They are yours," and said, "You have judged modestly." And for his companion Moses, peace be upon him, the one who showed him the bones of Joseph, she was more judicious and more generous in her judgment than you when Moses, peace be upon him, judged for her. She said, "My judgment is that you restore me as a young woman and I enter Paradise with you." It is said that people considered what he had judged as meager until it became a proverb, and it was said: "More miserly than the owner of the eighty and the shepherd." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "It is not breaking a promise when a man promises another while intending to fulfill it." And in another wording, "If a man promises his brother while intending to fulfill it but is unable, there is no sin upon him."

The Fourteenth Affliction

Falsehood in Speech and Oaths

It is among the foulest sins and most disgraceful faults. Isma'il ibn Wasit said: I heard Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, deliver a sermon after the death of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood among us in this very place a year ago—then he wept and said, "Beware of lying, for it accompanies wickedness, and both are in the Fire." Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Verily, lying is a gate among the gates of hypocrisy." Al-Hasan said: It used to be said that hypocrisy consists of the disparity between the secret and the public, between word and deed, between entry and exit, and the foundation upon which hypocrisy is built is lying. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A great betrayal is that you relate to your brother a matter in which he believes you, while you are lying to him therein." Ibn Mas'ud said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A servant persists in lying and pursues falsehood until he is recorded with God as a liar." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by two men bargaining over a sheep and swearing oaths; one of them was saying, "By God, I will not reduce it for you by such and such," and the other was saying, "By God, I will not increase for you beyond such and such," regarding the sheep which one of them had already purchased. He said, "One of them has incurred sin and the expiation." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Lying diminishes provision." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Merchants are the wicked." It was said, "O Messenger of God, has God not made trade lawful?" He said, "Yes, but they swear oaths and thus sin, and they speak and thus lie." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three types of people God will not speak to on the Day of Resurrection nor look upon: he who reminds others of his favor, he who sells his merchandise by false oaths, and he who lets his garment drag." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "No one swears an oath by God involving something like the wing of a mosquito except that it leaves a black spot on his heart until the Day of Resurrection." Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three are loved by God: a man who is with a company and offers his neck until he is killed or God grants him and his companions victory; a man who has a bad neighbor who harms him, yet he bears his harm patiently until death or departure separates them; and a man who is with people on a journey or an expedition and they travel long into the night until they are eager to touch the ground, so they dismount. He withdraws to pray until he awakens his companions for departure. And three are detested by God: the merchant or seller who swears oaths profusely, the poor man who is arrogant, and the miser who reminds others of his favors." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Woe to him who speaks and lies to make people laugh; woe to him, woe to him." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "I saw in a dream as if a man came to me and said to me, 'Get up,' so I got up with him. Then I saw two men, one standing and the other sitting. In the hand of the standing one was an iron hook which he thrust into the mouth of the sitting one and pulled until it reached his collarbone, then he pulled it to the other side and stretched it. When he stretched it, the other returned as he was. I said to the one who had me stand, 'What is this?' He said, 'This is a liar being punished in his grave until the Day of Resurrection.'" From 'Abdullah ibn Jurad, who said: I asked the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, can a believer commit adultery?" He said, "That can happen." I said, "O Prophet of God, can a believer lie?" He said, "No." Then he, peace and blessings be upon him, followed it with the saying of God Almighty, "Only those who do not believe in the signs of God invent falsehood." Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, supplicating and saying in his supplication, "O God, purify my heart from hypocrisy, my private parts from adultery, and my tongue from lying." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three God will not speak to, nor look upon, nor purify, and for them is a painful punishment: an old man who commits adultery, a ruler who lies, and a poor man who is arrogant." 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came to our house when I was a small child, and I went off to play. My mother said, "O 'Abdullah, come here so I may give you something." He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "What did you intend to give him?" She said, "Dates." He said, "Had you not done so, a lie would have been recorded against you." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "If God were to bestow upon me wealth equal to the number of these pebbles, I would distribute it among you, and you would not find me miserly, nor a liar, nor a coward." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said while reclining, "Shall I not inform you of the greatest of the major sins? Associating partners with God and disobedience to parents." Then he sat up and said, "And indeed, false testimony." Ibn 'Umar said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Verily, a servant tells a lie, and an angel distances himself from him by a mile due to the foulness of what he has brought forth." Anas said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Guarantee me six things, and I will guarantee you Paradise." They said, "What are they?" He said, "When one of you speaks, let him not lie; when he promises, let him not break it; when he is entrusted, let him not betray; lower your gazes, guard your private parts, and restrain your hands." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Verily, Satan has kohl, a lick, and a sniff: as for his lick, it is lying; as for his sniff, it is anger; and as for his kohl, it is sleep." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, delivered a sermon one day and said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood among us...

As I stand before you now, he said, "Be good to my companions, then to those who follow them, then falsehood will become widespread until a man will swear an oath without being asked to swear, and will bear witness without being asked to bear witness." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever narrates a saying from me while believing it to be false is one of the liars." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever swears a false oath to wrongfully seize the property of a Muslim will meet God, Mighty and Majestic, while He is angry with him." And it is narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he rejected the testimony of a man for a single lie he told. And he, peace be upon him, said, "Every trait can be imprinted upon or folded into a Muslim except treachery and lying." And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "No trait was more abhorrent to the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, than lying. Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would become aware of a lie from one of his companions, and it would not depart from his heart until he knew that the man had sincerely repented to God, Mighty and Majestic, for it." And Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, which of Your servants has the best deeds for You?" He said: "He whose tongue does not lie, whose heart does not commit indecency, and whose private parts do not fornicate." And Luqman said to his son: "O my son, beware of lying, for it is sweet like a morsel, but soon its companion will find it bitter." And he, peace be upon him, said in praise of truthfulness: "Four traits, if they are in you, will not harm you whatever you miss of this world: truthfulness in speech, safeguarding the trust, good character, and chastity in food." And Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said in a sermon after the death of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, stood among us last year as I stand now" — then he wept — and said, "Hold fast to truthfulness, for it is with righteousness and both are in Paradise." And Mu'adh said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to me, 'I enjoin upon you to fear God, speak truthfully, fulfill the trust, honor the covenant, offer the greeting of peace, and lower your wing (in humility).'"

As for the narrations: ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: “The greatest sin in the sight of God is the lying tongue, and the worst regret is the regret of the Day of Resurrection.” And ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, God’s mercy upon him, said: “I have not told a lie since I tightened my waist-wrapper.” And ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: “The most beloved of you to us, before we see you, is the one with the best name. When we see you, the most beloved to us is the one with the best character. And when we test you, the most beloved to us is the one most truthful in speech and greatest in trustworthiness.” And from Maymūn ibn Abī Shabīb, he said: “I sat down to write a book, and I came upon a letter which, if I wrote it, would adorn the book, but I would have lied. So I resolved to leave it, and a call came from the side of the house: ‘God will keep firm those who believe with the firm word in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.’” And al-Sha‘bī said: “I do not know which of the two has a deeper pit in the Fire: the liar or the miser?” And Ibn al-Sammāk said: “I do not think I am rewarded for abandoning lying, for I only abandon it out of self-respect.” And it was said to Khālid ibn Ṣubayḥ: “Is a man called a liar for a single lie?” He said: “Yes.” And Mālik ibn Dīnār said: “I read in some of the scriptures: ‘There is no speaker but that his speech is presented against his deeds. If he was truthful, he is confirmed, and if he was a liar, his lips are clipped with shears of fire; whenever they are clipped, they grow back.’” And Mālik ibn Dīnār said: “Truthfulness and falsehood wrestle in the heart until one of them expels its companion.” And ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz spoke to al-Walīd ibn ‘Abd al-Malik about something, and he said to him: “You have lied.” So ‘Umar said: “By God, I have not lied since I learned that lying disgraces its possessor.”

Clarification of What is Permitted in Lying

Know that lying is not forbidden in and of itself, but rather because of the harm it contains for the one addressed or for others. For the least of its degrees is that the informant believes something contrary to what it actually is, thus being ignorant, and harm to others may be attached to it. Yet sometimes ignorance contains benefit and interest, so lying achieves that ignorance and thus is permitted in it, and it may even be obligatory.

Maimun ibn Mahran said: Lying in certain situations is better than truthfulness. Consider if a man were pursuing another with a sword to kill him, and the pursued entered a house and came to you, and the pursuer asked, "Have you seen so-and-so?" What would you say? Would you not say, "I have not seen him"? And in this, you would be truthful. Such lying is obligatory.

We say: Speech is a means to objectives. Whenever a praiseworthy objective can be attained through both truthfulness and lying, then lying regarding it is forbidden. But if it can only be attained through lying and not through truthfulness, then lying regarding it is permissible if achieving that objective is permissible, and it becomes obligatory if the objective itself is obligatory—just as protecting a Muslim's life is obligatory. Thus, whenever truthfulness would lead to the shedding of a Muslim's blood who is hiding from a tyrant, lying in that case is obligatory. And whenever the objective of warfare or reconciling between people cannot be achieved, or the heart of the wronged party cannot be won over, except through a lie, then lying is permissible. However, one should guard against it as much as possible, because if one opens the door of lying for oneself, it is feared that it may lead to what is unnecessary and exceed the limits of necessity. Therefore, lying is fundamentally forbidden except out of necessity.

What indicates the permissibility [of lying in specific cases] is what was narrated from Umm Kulthum, who said: "I never heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, permit any form of lying except in three: a man who speaks a word intending reconciliation, a man who speaks a word in war, and a man speaking to his wife or a wife speaking to her husband." She also said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "He is not a liar who reconciles between two people by saying something good or conveying something good." Asma bint Yazid said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Every lie is recorded against the son of Adam, except for a man who lies between two Muslims to reconcile them." It was narrated from Abu Kamil, who said: Words were exchanged between two companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, until they cut off ties. I met one of them and said, "What is between you and so-and-so? I heard him praising you well." Then I met the other and said the same to him until they reconciled. Then I said [to myself], "I have ruined myself, yet I reconciled these two!" I informed the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, "O Abu Kahil, reconcile between people"—meaning even if it involves lying. Ata ibn Yasar said: A man asked the Prophet, peace be upon him, "May I lie to my family?" He said, "There is no good in lying." The man said, "I repeat it and say it to her." He said, "There is no blame upon you."

It is narrated that Ibn Abi ‘Adhra al-Du’ali, who lived during the caliphate of ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him), used to divorce the women he married. Because of this, a story spread among the people about him that he disliked. When he became aware of it, he took ‘Abdullah ibn al-Arqam by the hand and brought him to his home. Then he said to his wife, “I adjure you by God, do you hate me?” She said, “Do not adjure me.” He said, “But I adjure you by God.” She said, “Yes.” Then he said to Ibn al-Arqam, “Do you hear?” Then they both went until they came to ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him), and he said, “You are spreading the report that I wrong women and divorce them. Ask Ibn al-Arqam.” So he asked him, and he informed him. Then he sent for the wife of Ibn Abi ‘Adhra, and she came with her aunt. He said, “Are you the one who told your husband that you hate him?” She said, “I am the first to repent and return to the command of God Almighty. He adjured me, and I felt constrained not to lie. Shall I lie, O Commander of the Faithful?” He said, “Yes, lie. For if one of you does not love one of us, do not tell him so. Indeed, the least of households is built upon love, but people associate with one another through Islam and noble lineage.”

Nawwas ibn Sam'an al-Kilabi reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Why do I see you plunging into falsehood as moths plunge into fire? Every lie is recorded against the son of Adam without exception, except when a man lies in war, for war is deception; or when there is enmity between two men and he reconciles them; or when he tells his wife something to please her." Thawban said: All lying is sinful except what benefits a Muslim or wards off harm from him. And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: When I narrate to you from the Prophet, peace be upon him, I would rather fall from the sky than lie about him; but when I speak to you concerning matters between us, then war is deception.

These three instances contain explicit exceptions, and others share their meaning when linked to a valid purpose for oneself or another. As for one's wealth: it is like when a tyrant seizes it and questions him about his property—he may deny it; or when a ruler takes it and interrogates him about a sin committed between him and God Most High—he may deny that, saying: "I did not commit adultery nor steal." And He said, "Whoever commits any of these abominations, let him conceal himself with the veil of God." This is because exposing a sin is another sin. Thus, a man may protect his blood, his wealth taken unjustly, and his honor with his tongue, even if he is lying.

As for the deception of others: it is when one is asked about the secret of his brother, so he may deny it; and to reconcile between two parties; and to reconcile between co-wives among his wives by showing each that she is more beloved to him, even if his wife does not comply except with a promise he cannot fulfill, so he promises her in the moment to soothe her heart; or to apologize to a person whose heart is not appeased except by denying a fault and showing extra affection—there is no harm in that. However, the limit therein is that lying is reprehensible, and if truth were spoken in these situations, a reprehensible consequence would arise from it. Therefore, one should weigh one against the other and measure with the scale of justice. If he knows that the harm resulting from truth is more severe in the Sacred Law than lying, then lying is permissible for him. But if that objective is lesser than the purpose of truth, then truth is obligatory. Sometimes the two matters are equally balanced, causing hesitation; at that point, leaning toward truth is preferable because lying is only permitted out of necessity or an important need. If there is doubt about the importance of the need, the default is prohibition, so one reverts to it. Due to the obscurity in discerning the ranks of intentions, a person should guard against lying as much as possible. Likewise, whenever there is a need for him, it is recommended that he abandon his desires and forsake lying. However, if it pertains to the interest of another, then negligence is not permissible regarding the right of another and causing harm to him. Most people’s lying is for their own interests, then for increasing wealth and status, and for matters whose loss is not harmful—to the extent that a woman may narrate about her husband what she boasts of and lies for the sake of vexing co-wives, and that is forbidden. Asma’ reported: I heard a woman ask the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saying, “I have a co-wife, and I exaggerate to my husband about what he has not done to harm her thereby; is there anything upon me for that?” He, peace be upon him, said, “The one who pretends to have what he has not been given is like one who wears two garments of falsehood.” And he, peace be upon him, said, “Whoever claims to have been given what he was not given, or says ‘to me’ when it is not for him, or is given what he was not given, he is like one who wears two garments of falsehood on the Day of Resurrection.” Included in this is the scholar’s intention regarding what he does not verify, and his narration of a hadith he has not confirmed, since his aim is to show his own merit; thus, he is too proud to say, “I do not know,” and this is forbidden. Similar to women are children, for if a child is not inclined to school except by a false promise, threat, or intimidation, that is permissible. Indeed, we have reported in narrations that this is recorded as a lie, but the permissible lie may also be recorded and accounted for, and one is required to rectify his intention therein, then he is forgiven, because it was only permitted with the intention of reform, and great delusion may creep into it. For the motivator may be his own interest and desire, which he can do without, while he outwardly excuses himself with reform; hence it is recorded. Whoever commits a lie has fallen into the risk of independent reasoning to know whether the objective for which he lied is more important in the Sacred Law than truth or not? That is very obscure, and prudence is to abandon it unless it becomes obligatory such that it is not permissible to abandon it, as if it leads to bloodshed or the commission of a sin however it may be.

Some have thought that it is permissible to fabricate hadiths regarding the virtues of deeds and in emphasizing the severity of sins, claiming that the intention behind it is sound—but this is pure error, for he, peace be upon him, said, “Whoever lies about me intentionally, let him take his seat in the Fire.” This is not undertaken except out of necessity, and there is no necessity since truth offers an alternative to lying, for what has come in the verses and reports suffices without others. The statement of one who says, “That has become repetitive to ears and its impact has diminished, while what is new has a greater impact,” is folly, for this is not among the objectives that counter the reprehensibility of lying about the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and about God Almighty, and opening its door leads to matters that confuse the Sacred Law, so its evil outweighs any good in it. Lying about the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, is among the major sins that nothing can counter. We ask God for pardon for us and for all Muslims.

Clarification of Caution from Lying Through Ambiguity

It has been transmitted from the predecessors that in ambiguity there is an alternative to lying. Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, “Is there not in ambiguity what suffices men from lying?” That has been reported from Ibn Abbas and others. They only meant that if a person is compelled to lie, but if there is no need or necessity, then neither ambiguity nor explicit statement is permissible, though ambiguity is lighter. An example of ambiguity is what is reported that Mutarrif entered upon Ziyad, who delayed him, so he excused himself with illness and said, “I have not raised my side since I left the commander except what God raised me.” And Ibrahim said, “If something is conveyed to you about a man and you dislike to lie, say, ‘God Almighty knows what I said of that from anything.’” So his saying “what” is a particle of negation to the listener, but ambiguity to him. Mu’adh ibn Jabal was an agent for Umar, may God be pleased with him, and when he returned, his wife said to him, “What have you brought from what agents bring to their families?” He had not brought her anything. He said, “There was a supervisor with me.” She said, “You were trusted with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and with Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him. Did Umar send a supervisor with you?” And she spread that among her women and complained to Umar. When that reached him, he summoned Mu’adh and said, “Did I send a supervisor with you?” He said, “I found nothing to apologize to her with except that.” Umar, may God be pleased with him, laughed and gave him something, saying, “Please her with it.” The meaning of his saying “supervisor” means an overseer, and he intended by it God Almighty. Al-Nakha’i would not say to his daughter, “I will buy you sugar,” but would say, “What if I bought you sugar?” For perhaps it would not be possible for him. And Ibrahim, if someone he disliked to go out to sought him while he was at home, would say to the maidservant, “Tell him, ‘Seek him in the mosque,’ and do not say, ‘He is not here,’ lest it be a lie.” And Al-Sha’bi, if someone he disliked sought him at home, would draw a circle and say to the maidservant, “Place the finger in it and say, ‘Not here.’” All of this is in a situation of need, but in other than a situation of need, it is not permissible, because this implies lying even if the wording is not a lie, and it is generally disliked. As reported by Abdullah ibn Utbah: I entered with my father upon Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, mercy of God upon him, and I came out with a garment. People began saying, “Did the commander of the faithful give this to you?” I would say, “May God reward the commander of the faithful with good.” My father said to me, “O my son, fear lying and what resembles it,” forbidding him from that because it confirms them in a false assumption for the purpose of boasting, and this is a vain purpose with no benefit.

Excellent are permissible equivocations for a light purpose, such as gladdening another's heart through jest, like his saying ﷺ, "An old woman shall not enter Paradise," and his saying to another, "That which is in your husband's eye is whiteness," and to another, "We will mount you on a camel's colt," and the like. As for explicit falsehood, as Nu'man al-Ansari did with 'Uthman in the story of the blind man when he told him he was Nu'ayman, and as people are accustomed to doing in jesting with fools by deceiving them that a woman desires to marry you—if it contains harm leading to the hurting of a heart, then it is forbidden. If it is merely for his amusement, then its doer is not described as depraved, but that diminishes from the degree of his faith. He ﷺ said, "A person's faith is not complete until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself, and until he avoids falsehood in his jesting." As for his saying, peace be upon him, "Indeed, a man may speak a word to make people laugh by it, and he will plummet into the Fire farther than the Pleiades," he intended by it that which contains backbiting a Muslim or hurting a heart, not mere jesting.

Among the lies that do not necessitate sinfulness is that which customarily serves exaggeration, such as saying, "I sought such-and-such a thing so many times," or "I told you such a thing a hundred times." For the speaker does not intend to convey the exact number of times, but rather to emphasize the exaggeration. However, if he only sought it once, he is lying. And if he sought it numerous times, though not reaching a hundred, but the number is not commonly matched in abundance, he does not sin. Between these two are degrees wherein one who freely speaks with exaggeration exposes himself to the danger of lying.

Among matters in which lying is customary and treated lightly is when it is said, "Here is all the food," and one responds, "I have no appetite for it." This is prohibited and forbidden, even if there is no proper purpose behind it. Mujahid reported: Asma bint 'Umays said, "I was with 'Aisha on the night she was prepared and brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and with me were other women. She said, 'By Allah, we found nothing with him to offer as hospitality except a cup of milk.' He drank from it and then offered it to 'Aisha. She said, 'The young woman felt shy.' I said, 'Do not refuse the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him); take from it.' She said, 'So she took it shyly and drank from it.' Then he said, 'Offer it to your companions.' I said, 'We have no appetite for it.' He said, 'Do not combine hunger and lying.' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, if one of us says about something she desires, "I have no appetite for it," is that considered lying?' He said, 'Indeed, lying is recorded as a lie, until even a small lie is recorded as such.'"

Indeed, the people of scrupulous piety used to guard against indulging in such lies.

Al-Layth ibn Sa'd said: The eyes of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab would discharge rheum until it reached beyond his eyes. He was told, "Why do you not wipe your eyes?" He replied, "And where then would be the physician's instruction, 'Do not wipe your eyes,' so that I may say, 'I will not do it'?" This is the vigilance of the scrupulous. Whoever abandons it, his tongue slips into falsehood at the moment of his choosing, and he lies without realizing it.

From Khawwat al-Taymi, who said: The sister of al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym came to visit one of his sons. She leaned over him and said, "How are you, my son?" Al-Rabi' sat up and said, "Did you nurse him?" She said, "No." He said, "What harm would it have been if you had said, 'O my nephew,' and spoken truthfully?"

It is a common habit for one to say, "God knows," regarding what he does not know. Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Among the gravest sins in the sight of God is that a servant says, 'God knows,' concerning what he does not know." And perhaps one lies in narrating a dream, and the sin in that is great, for He said, "Among the gravest falsehoods is that a man claims to a father other than his own, or that he claims his eyes saw in a dream what they did not see, or that he says about something what is not." And He said, "Whoever lies about a dream will be tasked on the Day of Resurrection with tying together two barley grains, and he will never be able to tie them."

The Fifteenth Affliction: Backbiting

The discussion on this topic is extensive, so let us first mention the condemnation of backbiting and the legal proofs that have been transmitted concerning it. God the Exalted has explicitly condemned it in His Book, likening its perpetrator to one who eats carrion. He, Glorified and He, said: "And do not backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would detest it." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Everything of a Muslim is inviolable to another Muslim: his blood, his wealth, and his honor." Backbiting pertains to honor, and God has conjoined it with wealth and blood. And Abu Barzah said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not be rude to one another, do not turn your backs on one another, and do not backbite one another. Be, O servants of God, brothers."

From Jabir and Abu Sa'id, they said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Beware of backbiting, for backbiting is more severe than fornication. A man may fornicate and repent, and God the Exalted will accept his repentance. But the one who backbites will not be forgiven until the one he backbit forgives him." And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "On the night I was taken on the Night Journey, I passed by people who were scratching their faces with their fingernails. I said, 'O Gabriel, who are these?' He said, 'These are those who backbite people and attack their honor.'"

And Sulaym ibn Jabir said: I came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "Teach me something good that I may benefit from." He said: "Do not belittle any good deed, even if it is pouring water from your bucket into the vessel of one who seeks water. Meet your brother with a cheerful face, and if he turns away, do not backbite him." And Al-Bara' said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, addressed us in a sermon so loudly that the young women in their houses could hear him, saying: "O assembly of those who have believed with their tongues but whose hearts have not believed! Do not backbite the Muslims and do not seek out their faults. For whoever seeks out the fault of his brother, God will seek out his fault; and whoever has his fault sought out by God, He will expose him even in the inner sanctum of his house."

It is said that God revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "Whoever dies repentant from backbiting will be the last to enter Paradise, and whoever dies persisting in it will be the first to enter the Fire." And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded the people to fast a day, saying, "Let no one break his fast until I give him permission." The people fasted until evening. Then a man would come and say, "O Messenger of God, I have remained fasting, so permit me to break my fast," and he would permit him. Man after man came until a man came and said, "O Messenger of God, two girls from your family have remained fasting, and they are too shy to come to you, so permit them to break their fast!" The Prophet, peace be upon him, turned away from him. He repeated his request, and he turned away. He repeated it again, and he said: "They have not fasted. How can it be a fast for one who spends his day eating the flesh of people? Go and command them, if they have fasted, to induce vomiting." He returned to them and informed them, and they both vomited. Each one of them vomited a clot of blood. He returned to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and informed him. He said: "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, had they remained in that state, the Fire would have consumed them." In another narration: When he turned away from him, he came later and said, "O Messenger of God, by God, they have died or nearly died." He, peace be upon him, said: "Bring them to me." They were brought, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, called for a bowl and said to one of them, "Vomit." She vomited pus, blood, and putrid matter until she filled the bowl. He said to the other, "Vomit," and she did likewise. He said: "These two fasted from what God had made lawful for them and broke their fast on what God had forbidden to them. One of them sat with the other and they began to eat the flesh of people."

And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, addressed us in a sermon and mentioned usury, emphasizing its gravity. He said: "A dirham a man acquires from usury is a greater sin with God than thirty-six acts of fornication. And the worst form of usury is violating the honor of a Muslim." And Jabir said: We were with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, on a journey when he came upon two graves whose occupants were being punished. He said: "They are being punished, and not for a major sin. As for one of them, he used to backbite people. As for the other, he did not protect himself from his urine." He called for a fresh palm branch or two, broke them, and then ordered that each piece be planted on a grave. He said: "Their punishment will be lightened as long as these remain fresh—or until they dry out."

When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, stoned Ma'iz for fornication, a man said to his companion: "This one is being crushed like a dog is crushed." The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed by them while they were with him, and they passed by a carcass. He said: "Eat from it." They said: "O Messenger of God, shall we eat from a carcass?" He said: "What you have taken from your brother is more foul than this."

The Companions, may God be pleased with them, would meet one another with cheerful faces and would not engage in backbiting when it was prevalent. They considered this among the best deeds and considered its opposite the habit of the hypocrites. Abu Hurairah said: "Whoever eats the flesh of his brother in this world will have his own flesh brought near to him in the Hereafter, and it will be said to him: 'Eat it dead as you ate it alive.' So he will eat it, and it will burn and scorch him." This is also reported as a *marfu'* narration (attributed to the Prophet).

It is reported that two men were sitting by one of the doors of the mosque when a man who was effeminate passed by them, but he had abandoned that. They said: "Something of it still remains in him." The prayer was called, and they entered and prayed with the people. What they had said troubled their consciences, so they went to 'Ata' and asked him. He ordered them to renew their ablution and prayer, and ordered them to make up the fast if they had been fasting.

From Mujahid, he said concerning "Woe to every slanderer, backbiter": "The slanderer (*humazah*) is the one who reviles people, and the backbiter (*lumazah*) is the one who eats the flesh of people." And Qatadah said: "The punishment of the grave was mentioned to us as consisting of three thirds: a third from backbiting, a third from tale-bearing, and a third from urine." Al-Hasan said: "By God, backbiting destroys the religion of a believing man faster than a disease consumes the body." Some of them said: "We found the early generations, and they did not consider worship to be in fasting and prayer alone, but in restraining oneself from violating people's honor." Ibn 'Abbas said: "If you wish to mention the faults of your companion, mention your own faults." Abu Hurairah said: "One of you sees the speck in his brother's eye but does not see the beam in his own eye." Al-Hasan used to say: "O son of Adam, you will not attain the reality of faith until you do not backbite people for a fault that is in yourself, and until you begin by rectifying that fault and correct it. If you do that, your concern will be with your own soul. The most beloved of servants to God is one who is like this."

Malik ibn Dinar said: "Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by with his disciples by the carcass of a dog. The disciples said: 'How foul is the smell of this dog!' He, peace be upon him, said: 'How white are its teeth!'" It is as if he, peace be upon him, saw a man backbiting another and said to him: "Beware of backbiting, for it is the relish of the dogs of the people." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Adhere to the remembrance of God the Exalted, for it is a cure; and beware

Know that the definition of backbiting is to mention your brother in a manner he would dislike if it reached him, whether you mention a deficiency in his body, his lineage, his character, his actions, his speech, his religion, or his worldly affairs—even concerning his clothing, his home, or his mount.

As for the body: such as mentioning cross-eyes, a squint, baldness, shortness, tallness, blackness, yellowness, and all that can be conceived to be described in a manner that is disliked, however it may be. As for lineage: it is by saying his father is a Nabatean or an Indian, or a transgressor, or base, or a cobbler, or a garbage collector, or something of what is disliked, however it may be. As for character: it is by saying he is of bad character, miserly, arrogant, ostentatious, quick to anger, cowardly, feeble-hearted, reckless, and what runs in its course. As for his actions pertaining to religion: such as saying he is a thief, or a liar, or a drinker of intoxicants, or a betrayer, or an oppressor, or negligent in prayer or zakah, or he does not perform bowing and prostration well, or he does not guard against impurities, or he is not dutiful to his parents, or he does not place zakah in its rightful place, or he does not distribute it well, or he does not guard his fasting from obscenity, backbiting, and encroaching upon people's honor. As for his actions pertaining to worldly life: such as saying he is lacking in manners, negligent towards people, or he does not acknowledge any right of others over himself, or he claims rights for himself over people, or that he is excessive in speech, excessive in eating, drowsy, sleeping at times other than for sleep, and sitting where he does not belong. As for his clothing: such as saying his sleeves are wide, his tail is long, and his garments are dirty.

Some people said: There is no backbiting in matters of religion, because whatever God, exalted is He, has censured, it is permissible to mention and censure others for those sins. This is evidenced by what has been narrated: that a woman was mentioned to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) for her abundant prayer and fasting, but she would harm her neighbors with her tongue. He said, "She is in the Fire." And another woman was mentioned in his presence as being miserly, and he said, "Then what good are they?" This reasoning is flawed, for they mentioned that out of their need to learn the rulings by asking, and their aim was not to belittle, nor is there a need for it outside the council of the Messenger (peace be upon him). The proof for this is the consensus of the community that whoever mentions another with what he dislikes is guilty of backbiting, for he has entered into what the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) defined as the limit of backbiting.

All of this, even if what is said is true, constitutes backbiting, making one disobedient to his Lord and consuming the flesh of his brother. This is evidenced by what has been narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Do you know what backbiting is?" They said, "God and His Messenger know best." He said, "Mentioning your brother with what he dislikes." It was said, "What if what I say is actually in my brother?" He said, "If what you say is in him, you have backbitten him. And if it is not in him, you have slandered him." And Mu'adh ibn Jabal said: A man was mentioned before the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and they said, "How weak he is!" He (peace be upon him) said, "You have backbitten your brother." They said, "O Messenger of God, we said what is in him." He said, "If you said what is not in him, you would have slandered him." And from Hudhayfah, from 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her): A woman was mentioned before the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and she said, "She is short." He (peace be upon him) said, "You have backbitten her." Al-Hasan said: Mentioning others is of three types: backbiting, slander, and false accusation, and all are in the Book of God, Mighty and Majestic. Backbiting is to say what is in him. Slander is to say what is not in him. False accusation is to say what has reached you. Ibn Sirin mentioned a man and said, "That black man," then said, "I seek God's forgiveness, I see that I have backbitten him." And Ibn Sirin mentioned Ibrahim al-Nakha'i and placed his hand over his eye, not saying "the one-eyed." And 'A'ishah said: Let none of you backbite another, for I once said to a woman while I was with the Prophet (peace be upon him), 'Indeed, this one has a long train [on her garment],' and he said to me, 'Spit it out, spit it out,' so I spat out a morsel of flesh.

**Clarification that Backbiting is Not Restricted to the Tongue**

Know that speaking with the tongue is forbidden only because it conveys to another the deficiency of your brother and makes known what he dislikes. Therefore, allusion is like explicit statement, and action in it is like speech. Gesturing, winking, nudging, writing, movement, and everything that conveys the intended meaning is included in backbiting and is forbidden. Among this is the statement of 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her): A woman entered upon us, and when she turned away, I gestured with my hand that she was short. He (peace be upon him) said, "You have backbitten her." Among this is imitation, walking with a limp or as someone walks; it is backbiting, indeed it is more severe than backbiting because it is greater in depiction and conveying meaning. When the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) saw 'A'ishah imitating a woman, he said, "It would not please me that I imitated a person, even if I had such-and-such." Similarly, backbiting by writing, for the pen is one of the two tongues. Mentioning a specific person and ridiculing his speech in a book is backbiting, unless it is accompanied by some of the excusing necessities requiring his mention—as will be explained later. As for saying, "Some people said such-and-such," that is not backbiting. Backbiting is rather referring to a specific person, whether living or dead. Among backbiting is saying, "Some of those who passed by us today," or "Some of those we saw," if the listener understands from it a specific person, because the prohibition is in conveying it to him, not in the means of conveyance. If he does not understand the specific individual, it is permissible. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him), when he disliked something from a person, would say, "What is the matter with people who do such-and-such?" Thus, he would not specify. And your saying, "Some of those who arrived from the journey," or "Some of those who claim knowledge," if there is an indication with it that conveys the specific person, then it is backbiting.

The most vile form of backbiting is the backbiting of hypocritical reciters. For they convey the intended meaning in the guise of pious people, to display their own abstinence from backbiting while making the meaning understood. In their ignorance, they do not realize they have combined two abominations: backbiting and hypocrisy. This is like when a person is mentioned in their presence, and they say: "Praise be to God who has not afflicted us with frequenting rulers and degrading ourselves in pursuit of worldly gain," or they say: "We seek refuge in God from lack of shame; we ask God to protect us from it." Their only aim is to make understood the fault of the other person by mentioning it in the form of a supplication. Likewise, he may preface praise for the one he intends to backbite, saying: "How excellent is the state of so-and-so! He never fell short in acts of worship, but a lassitude has befallen him and he has been afflicted with what afflicts us all: a lack of patience." He mentions himself, and his aim within that is to censure another and to praise himself by resembling the righteous through censuring himself. Thus he becomes a backbiter, a hypocrite, and one who praises himself, combining three abominations, while in his ignorance he thinks he is among the righteous who abstain from backbiting. For this reason, Satan plays with the ignorant when they engage in worship without knowledge, for he follows them, nullifies their deeds with his schemes, laughs at them, and mocks them.

Among such things is that a person's fault is mentioned, and some of those present do not pay attention to it, so he says: "Glory be to God! How astonishing is this!" so that they listen to him and learn what is being said. Thus he mentions God Almighty and uses the Name as a tool to achieve his vile purpose, and he swears by God—glory be to Him—by mentioning Him out of ignorance and delusion. And similarly he says: "It saddened me what befell our friend of being belittled; we ask God to relieve his soul." Thus he is a liar in his claim of grief and in displaying supplication for him. Rather, if he intended supplication, he would have concealed it in his privacy following his prayer; and if he were grieved by it, he would also be grieved by revealing what the other dislikes. And similarly he says: "That poor soul has been afflicted with a great calamity; may God accept our repentance and his." In all of this, he displays supplication, while God is aware of the vileness of his conscience and his hidden aim. In his ignorance, he does not know that he has exposed himself to a wrath greater than what the ignorant expose themselves to when they are open about it.

Among these is listening to backbiting under the guise of astonishment, for he only shows astonishment to increase the backbiter's zeal in backbiting, so he plunges into it, as if he extracts the backbiting from him by this method, saying: "Amazing! I did not know he was like that! I only knew him until now for good; I thought of him other than this. May God protect us from his tribulation." For all of that is corroboration of the backbiter, and corroborating backbiting is itself backbiting; indeed, the silent one is a partner of the backbiter. He (peace be upon him) said: "The listener is one of the two backbiters." It has been narrated from Abu Bakr and Umar (may God be pleased with them) that one of them said to his companion: "So-and-so is indeed a heavy sleeper." Then they sought some condiment from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) to eat bread with, and he said: "You have already had your condiment!" They said: "We do not know of it?" He said: "Yes indeed, you have eaten of the flesh of your brother." So see how he grouped them together, when the speaker was one and the other was a listener. And he said to the two men, one of whom said, "I would crush the man as a dog is crushed": "Gnaw from this carcass," thus grouping them together. Therefore, the listener does not escape the sin of backbiting unless he rejects it with his tongue or with his heart if he fears. If he was able to stand up or cut off the speech with other words and did not do so, he is liable. If he says with his tongue, "Be silent," while his heart desires it, that is hypocrisy, and it does not remove him from the sin unless he detests it with his heart. It is not sufficient in that to gesture with the hand meaning "be silent," or to gesture with his eyebrow and forehead, for that is belittling the one mentioned. Rather, he should magnify the matter and defend him explicitly. He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever finds a believer being humiliated in his presence and does not support him while he is able to support him, God will humiliate him on the Day of Resurrection before all creation." And Abu al-Darda' said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever defends the honor of his brother in his absence, it is a right upon God to defend his honor on the Day of Resurrection." And he also said: "Whoever defends the honor of his brother in his absence, it is a right upon God to free him from the Fire." Many reports have come concerning supporting a Muslim in backbiting and the virtue of that; we have cited them in the Book of the Etiquette of Companionship and the Rights of Muslims, so we will not prolong by repeating them.

                       Explanation of the Motivating Causes for Backbiting

Know that the motives for backbiting are many, but they are encompassed by eleven causes: eight of them are common among the general populace, and three are specific to the people of religion and the elect.

As for the eight [causes], the first is to vent rancor. This occurs when a cause for anger arises against someone, for when one's anger is stirred, it seeks relief by mentioning the other's faults, and the tongue naturally rushes to do so unless restrained by religious inhibition. Sometimes rancor is suppressed during anger, causing the anger to fester inwardly and turn into settled malice, which becomes a constant motive for recalling faults. Thus, malice and anger are among the great instigators of backbiting.

The second is conforming with peers and indulging companions by assisting them in speech, for when they amuse themselves by mentioning people's faults, one fears that if he were to rebuke them or break up the gathering, they would find him burdensome and turn away from him. Thus he assists them, considering this good companionship and believing it to be courtesy in fellowship. Moreover, his companions may become angry, and he then feels compelled to share in their anger to demonstrate partnership in ease and hardship, thereby plunging with them into mentioning defects and shortcomings.

Third: That one perceives from a person that he intends to approach him and speak ill of him at length, or tarnish his standing before a respected figure, or testify against him with a testimony, so he preempts him before his own standing is tarnished and he is disparaged, thereby nullifying the impact of his testimony. Or he begins by mentioning something true about him so that he may later lie about him, and his lie becomes credible due to the initial truth. He then calls upon witnesses and says, "It is not my habit to lie, for I informed you of such-and-such about his conditions, and it was as I said."

The fourth is when one attributes something to another, intending to absolve oneself of it, yet mentions what he himself did—when it would have been proper to exonerate himself without mentioning the deed, so as not to ascribe it to another—or he mentions another as having been a partner in the act, thereby paving the way to excuse his own action.

The fifth is the desire for affectation and ostentation, which is to elevate oneself by disparaging others, saying: "So-and-so is ignorant, his understanding is feeble, and his speech is weak." His aim is to establish within that the superiority of himself and to show them that he is more knowledgeable than him, or to caution lest another be honored like his honor, and thus he finds fault in him for that reason.

The sixth is envy, which is that one may envy a person whom people praise, love, and honor. He then desires the removal of that blessing from him, but finds no way to achieve this except by disparaging him. Thus, he wishes to diminish his standing in the eyes of people so that they cease honoring and praising him, for it weighs heavily upon him to hear the speech of people, their praise of him, and their honoring him. This is the very essence of envy, and it is distinct from anger and rancor. For the latter two necessitate some offense from the one who is the object of anger, whereas envy can occur even towards a benevolent friend and a compatible companion.

The seventh is playfulness, frivolity, jesting, and whiling away time in laughter, whereby one mentions the faults of others in a manner that makes people laugh by way of imitation, and its origin is arrogance and self-admiration.

The eighth is mockery and derision out of contempt for him, for this may occur in his presence and may also occur in his absence, and its origin is arrogance and belittling the one being ridiculed.

As for the three causes that pertain to the elect, they are the most obscure and subtle, for they are evils that Satan has concealed within the display of good deeds; and in them there is good, but the youth of Satan lies in their evil.

The first is that one is moved by religious zeal to express astonishment at the denial of wrong and error in religion, saying, "How astonishing is what I have seen from so-and-so!" For he may be truthful in this, and his astonishment may be at the wrong, yet his rightful course was to be astonished without mentioning the name. Thus, Satan makes it easy for him to mention the name while expressing his astonishment, and so he becomes a backbiter and sinful without realizing it. From this is a man's saying: "I was astonished at so-and-so—how can he love his slave-girl when she is ugly? How can he sit before so-and-so when he is ignorant?"

The second is mercy, which is that one is grieved on account of the affliction that has befallen another, saying: "Poor so-and-so, his affair has grieved me and what has afflicted him." He may be truthful in his claim of grief, but the grief distracts him from being cautious against mentioning the name, so he mentions it and thereby becomes a backbiter. Thus, his grief and mercy, though good in themselves, and likewise his astonishment, are led by Satan into evil without his awareness. For showing mercy and feeling grief are possible without mentioning the name, but Satan incites him to mention the name to nullify thereby the reward of his grief and mercy.

The third is anger for the sake of God Almighty, for one may become angry at an evil committed by a person when he sees or hears it, and thus manifest his anger and mention his name. Yet the obligation is to manifest anger toward him by enjoining good and forbidding evil, and not to manifest it toward others, or to conceal his name and not mention it in a negative manner. These three matters are such that their discernment is obscure even to the scholars, let alone the common folk, for they imagine that astonishment, mercy, and anger, when they are for the sake of God Almighty, constitute an excuse for mentioning the name, and this is an error. Rather, what is permitted regarding backbiting are specific necessities in which there is no avoiding mentioning the name—as will be mentioned later. It is narrated from ‘Āmir ibn Wāthilah: A man passed by a group of people during the lifetime of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and greeted them, and they returned the greeting. When he had passed them, a man among them said, “Indeed, I hate this man for the sake of God Almighty.” The people of the gathering said, “How evil is what you have said! By God, we shall inform him.” Then they said, “O so-and-so”—to one of them—“rise, overtake him, and inform him of what was said.” Their messenger overtook him and informed him. So the man came to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and related to him what was said, asking him to supplicate for him. He called him and asked him, and he said, “I did say that.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Why do you hate him?” He replied, “I am his neighbor and I am well acquainted with him. By God, I have never seen him pray any prayer except this obligatory one.” He said, “Then ask him, O Messenger of God, whether he has ever seen me delay it beyond its time, or perform ablution poorly for it, or the bowing or prostration in it?” He asked him, and he said no. He said, “By God, I have never seen him fast any month except this month which the righteous and the wicked fast.” He said, “Then ask him, O Messenger of God, whether he has ever seen me break a fast in it or diminish any of its right?” He asked him about it, and he said no. He said, “By God, I have never seen him give to a beggar or a poor person, nor have I seen him spend anything from his wealth in the path of God except this zakah which the righteous and the wicked pay.” He said, “Then ask him, O Messenger of God, whether he has ever seen me diminish it or haggle with its claimant who asks for it?” He asked him, and he said no. Then he (peace be upon him) said to the man, “Rise, for perhaps he is better than you.”

Explanation of the Remedy That Restrains the Tongue from Backbiting

Know that all moral defects are treated only with the ointment of knowledge and action, and the treatment of every ailment is by counteracting its cause. So let us investigate its cause. The treatment for restraining the tongue from backbiting is on two levels: one in general, and the other in detail. As for in general: it is to know that one exposes himself to the displeasure of God Almighty by his backbiting through these reports we have narrated, and to know that it nullifies his good deeds on the Day of Resurrection, for they transfer his good deeds on the Day of Resurrection to the one he backbit in exchange for the honor he violated. If he has no good deeds, then the bad deeds of his adversary are transferred to him. Moreover, he exposes himself to the wrath of God Almighty and is likened in His sight to one who eats carrion. Indeed, a servant enters the Fire because the scale of his bad deeds outweighs the scale of his good deeds, and perhaps a single bad deed from the one he backbit is transferred to him, thereby causing the preponderance and causing him to enter the Fire. The least of the degrees is that it diminishes from the reward of his deeds, and that is after disputation, demand, questioning, answering, and reckoning. He (peace be upon him) said, “Fire in dry wood is not faster than backbiting in consuming the good deeds of a servant.” And it is narrated that a man said to al-Hasan, “It has reached me that you backbite me.” He said, “Your standing with me has not reached such that I would give you authority over my good deeds.” So if the servant is secure in what has come in the reports concerning backbiting, he will not give free rein to his tongue in it out of fear of that. It also benefits him to reflect upon himself, for if he finds a defect in himself, he should busy himself with his own defect and remember his saying (peace be upon him): “Blessed is he who is preoccupied with his own defect from the defects of people.” Whenever he finds a defect, he should be ashamed to leave off blaming himself and blame another. Rather, he should realize that the inability of another to free himself from that defect is like his own inability—if it is a defect related to his action and choice. If it is a natural matter, then the blame is upon the Creator, for whoever blames a creation has blamed its Maker. A man said to a sage, “O ugly-faced one.” He said, “The creation of my face was not up to me, so that I might beautify it.” And if he finds no defect in himself, let him thank God Almighty and not soil himself with the greatest of defects, for disparaging people and eating the flesh of the dead are among the greatest defects. Indeed, if he were just, he would know that his assumption about himself that he is free from every defect is ignorance of himself, and that is among the greatest defects. It benefits him to know that the pain of another due to his backbiting is like his own pain when another backbites him. So if he is not pleased for himself to be backbitten, then he should not be pleased for another what he does not please for himself. These are general remedies.

As for the detailed explanation, it is that one should examine the motive that incites him to backbiting, for the treatment of an ailment lies in severing its cause, and we have previously mentioned the causes.

As for anger, it is treated by what will come in the Book of the Afflictions of Anger, which is that one should say: If I carry out my anger upon him, perhaps God, exalted is He, will carry out His anger upon me due to backbiting, since He forbade me from it, yet I dared to defy His prohibition and belittled His warning. He, exalted is He, has said, "Indeed, Hell has a gate through which none shall enter except he who quenches his wrath by disobeying God, exalted is He." And He, exalted is He, said, "He who guards his tongue from his Lord and does not quench his wrath..." And He, exalted is He, said, "He who swallows his anger while capable of enacting it, God, exalted is He, will call him on the Day of Resurrection before all creation and let him choose whichever of the houris he wishes." And in some of the books revealed to some of the prophets: O son of Adam, remember Me when you are angry, that I may remember you when I am angry, and thus I do not annihilate you among those I annihilate.

As for seeking approval, it is by knowing that God, exalted is He, becomes angry with you when you seek His displeasure in order to please the created beings. How then can you be content for yourself to honor others and belittle your Master, abandoning His pleasure for theirs, unless your anger is for God, exalted is He? Yet that does not necessitate mentioning the object of anger with evil; rather, you should also be angry for God with your companions if they mention Him with evil, for they have disobeyed your Lord with the foulest of sins, which is backbiting.

As for purifying the soul by attributing treachery to another when mentioning them is unnecessary, treat this by recognizing that exposing oneself to the Creator's wrath is more severe than exposing oneself to the wrath of the created, and you, through backbiting, are certainly exposing yourself to God's anger, while you do not know whether you will escape the anger of people or not! Thus you save yourself in this world by assumption, yet you are destroyed in the Hereafter, you truly lose your good deeds, and you incur the blame of God, exalted is He, immediately, while you await the repelling of people's blame on credit. This is the height of ignorance and abandonment.

As for your excuse, such as saying, "If I consume the unlawful, so-and-so consumes it," or "If I accept the ruler's wealth, so-and-so accepts it," this is ignorance, for you are excusing yourself by following one whom it is not permissible to follow, for whoever opposes the command of God, exalted is He, is not to be followed, whoever it may be. Even if another entered the Fire while you had the ability not to enter it, you would not agree with him, and if you did agree, your intellect would be foolish. In what you have mentioned is backbiting, and an added sin you have attached to what you excused, and you have recorded, along with combining two sins, your ignorance and stupidity. You are like a sheep that sees a goat perish itself from a mountain's edge, so it too perishes itself. If it had a tongue to speak an excuse and cried out with an excuse, saying, "The goat is wiser than I, and it has destroyed itself, so I am doing likewise," you would laugh at its ignorance, and your state is like its state, yet you do not marvel or laugh at yourself.

As for your intention of boasting and self-purification by increasing virtue through disparaging others, you should know that by what you have mentioned of him, you have nullified your virtue before God, while your virtue in the estimation of people is precarious. Perhaps their estimation of you will diminish when they know you for fault-finding, so you will have sold what is with the Creator with certainty for what is with the created with uncertainty. Even if you attained from the created the belief in your virtue, they would avail you nothing against God.

As for backbiting out of envy, it is combining two punishments, for you envied him for a worldly blessing and were tormented in this world by envy. You were not content with that until you added to it the punishment of the Hereafter, so you were a loser of your soul in this world and have also become a loser in the Hereafter, to combine the two retributions. You aimed at your envied one but struck yourself and gifted him your good deeds. Thus you are his friend and the enemy of your own soul, for your backbiting does not harm him but harms you, and it benefits him, for you transfer your good deeds to him or transfer his evil deeds to you, and it does not benefit you. You have combined the foulness of envy with the ignorance of folly. Perhaps your envy and disparagement become a cause for the spread of your envied one's virtue, as it is said:

|When God wills | |He makes for it |
|to spread a virtue| |the tongue of an envier|

As for mockery, your aim in it is to disgrace others before people by disgracing yourself before God Almighty, and before the angels and the prophets—peace be upon them. If you were to reflect on your regret and your sin, your shame and your disgrace on the Day of Resurrection—the day when you will bear the misdeeds of those you mocked and be driven to the Fire—that would astonish you away from disgracing your companion! If you knew your own state, you would be more deserving of laughing at yourself, for you mocked him before a small group, yet you exposed yourself to being taken by the hand on the Day of Resurrection before a gathering of people and driven beneath his misdeeds, as a donkey is driven to the Fire, while he mocks you, rejoices in your disgrace, and delights in God Almighty granting him victory over you and empowering him to exact vengeance from you.

As for showing mercy to him despite his sin, that is commendable. However, Satan envied you and led you astray, and he prompted you to utter words that transfer from your good deeds to him what exceeds your mercy. Thus, the sin for which mercy was shown is compensated, causing it to cease being an object of mercy, and you become deserving of being shown mercy yourself, since your reward is nullified and your good deeds are diminished. Likewise, anger for the sake of God Almighty does not entail backbiting; rather, Satan made backbiting appealing to you in order to nullify the reward of your anger and to make you, through backbiting, subject to the wrath of God, exalted and glorified.

As for amazement that leads you to backbiting, are you then amazed at yourself? How have you destroyed your own soul and religion for the sake of another's religion or worldly life, while you are not even safe from worldly punishment! That is, God may expose your secret just as you exposed your brother's secret through amazement. Therefore, the remedy for all of that is solely knowledge and verification of these matters which are among the doors of faith. So whoever's faith in all of that is strong, his tongue will inevitably refrain from backbiting.

**Clarification of the Prohibition of Backbiting with the Heart**

Know that ill suspicion is forbidden just like ill speech. Just as it is forbidden for you to speak to another with your tongue about the faults of others, it is not for you to speak to yourself by harboring ill suspicion of your brother. I mean by this nothing but the heart's conviction and its inclination toward another with evil. As for passing thoughts and the inner dialogue of the soul, they are pardoned; indeed, doubt is also pardoned. But what is prohibited is to *assume*, and assumption is an expression for what the soul leans toward and the heart inclines to. God Almighty has said: "O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin." The reason for its prohibition is that the secrets of hearts are known only to the Knower of the unseen. It is not for you to believe evil about another unless it is unveiled to you with clear evidence that does not admit interpretation. At that point, you cannot but believe what you have learned and witnessed. As for what you have not witnessed with your own eye nor heard with your own ear, yet it occurs in your heart, it is only Satan casting it to you. You should therefore deem it false, for he is the most wicked of the wicked. God Almighty has said: "O you who have believed, if there comes to you a wicked person with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance." It is not permissible to believe Iblis. Even if there is an illusion indicating corruption, yet it admits an opposite possibility, it is not permissible to believe it, for the wicked one may appear to be truthful in his good, but it is not permissible for you to believe him. For instance, if someone sniffs another and finds the smell of wine on him, it is not permissible to punish him with the prescribed penalty, for it is said it is possible he merely rinsed his mouth with wine and spat it out without drinking it, or it was forced upon him. All of that is inevitably ambiguous evidence, so it is not permissible to believe it with the heart and harbor ill suspicion of a Muslim because of it. He (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, God has made inviolable for a Muslim his blood, his wealth, and that evil suspicion be held about him." Therefore, evil suspicion is not permitted except by that which permits [taking] wealth, which is either witnessing it oneself or a just testimony. If it is not so, and a whisper of evil suspicion occurs to you, you should repel it from yourself and affirm to yourself that his state with you remains concealed as it was, and that what you saw from him admits both good and evil interpretations.

If you ask: "By what means can one recognize the binding of suspicion and the stirring of doubts, when the soul whispers?" Then say: The sign of binding ill suspicion is that the heart changes because of it from its former state, recoiling from it with a certain recoiling, finding it burdensome, and slackening in its regard, in checking upon it, in honoring it, and in seizing the opportunity because of it. These are the signs of the binding of suspicion and its establishment.

And He, may He be exalted, has said, "There are three [things] in the believer, and for him there is an escape from them. His escape from evil suspicion is that he does not confirm it." That is, he does not confirm it within himself, neither by conviction nor by deed, neither in the heart nor in the limbs. As for in the heart: it is by its changing to aversion and dislike. As for in the limbs: it is by acting according to it. And Satan may settle upon the heart with the slightest imagining of people's ill, casting to it that this is from your acumen, your quick understanding, and your intelligence, and that the believer looks with the light of God, the Exalted, while in truth he is looking with the delusion of Satan and his darkness.

When a just person informs you of something, and your inclination leans toward believing them, you are excused, for if you were to disbelieve them, you would be wronging this just individual by suspecting them of falsehood, which is also a form of ill suspicion. It is not fitting to hold a good opinion of one and a bad opinion of another. Indeed, one should investigate whether there exists enmity, envy, or obstinacy between them, through which suspicion might arise. The Sacred Law has rejected the testimony of a just father for his son due to suspicion, and it has rejected the testimony of an enemy. In such a case, you may withhold judgment; if the informant is just, neither believe nor disbelieve them, but say within yourself: The mentioned individual’s state was, in my view, under the veil of God Almighty, and his affair was concealed from me—it remains as it was, nothing of his matter has been unveiled to me. It may be that a man’s outward appearance is just and there is no envy between him and the mentioned person, yet it might be his habit to meddle in people’s affairs and mention their faults. Such a one may be thought just but is not truly just, for the backbiter is corrupt, and if this is his habit, his testimony is rejected, though due to widespread familiarity, people have become lax regarding backbiting and do not heed the violation of others’ honor.

Whenever a negative thought about a Muslim crosses your mind, you should increase in your care for him and pray for his good, for that vexes Satan and drives him away from you, so he will not cast the evil thought to you, fearing your engagement in prayer and care. And whenever you become aware of a Muslim's slip through evidence, advise him in private, and do not let Satan deceive you into calling you to backbite him. And when you admonish him, do not admonish him while you are inwardly pleased with your knowledge of his shortcoming, so that he may look at you with an eye of veneration and you look at him with an eye of contempt and elevate yourself above him, thereby harming the admonisher. Let your intention be to free him from sin while you are sorrowful, just as you would grieve for yourself if a deficiency entered your religion. And it should be that his abandoning that sin without your advice is more beloved to you than his abandoning it due to your advice. If you do that, you will have combined the reward of admonition, the reward of grieving for his affliction, and the reward of assisting him in his religion.

Among the fruits of ill suspicion is spying, for the heart is not content with suspicion and seeks verification, thus busying itself with spying, which is also forbidden. Allah the Exalted said, "And do not spy." Thus backbiting, ill suspicion, and spying are all forbidden in a single verse. The meaning of spying is not leaving the servants of Allah under the covering of Allah, but rather striving to uncover and tear the veil until what is hidden from him is revealed to him, whereas if it had remained concealed from him, it would have been safer for his heart and his religion. We have mentioned the ruling and reality of spying in the Book of Enjoining Good.

**Clarification of the Excuses Permitting Backbiting**

Know that what is permitted in mentioning the faults of others is a sound purpose in the Sacred Law that cannot be achieved except by it, and that removes the sin of backbiting. They are six matters: The first: Seeking redress. For if someone mentions a judge regarding injustice, treachery, and taking bribes, he is a backbiter and a sinner if he is not the one wronged. As for the one wronged by the judge, he may seek redress from the ruler and attribute injustice to him, for he cannot obtain his right except by it. He (the Exalted) said, "Indeed, the one with a right has a statement." And upon him be peace said, "The delay of the wealthy is injustice." And upon him be peace said, "The delay of the capable one makes his punishment and his honor permissible."

The second: seeking assistance in changing reprehensible acts and returning the transgressor to the path of rectitude. It is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, passed by 'Uthman—or it is said, by Talhah—may God be pleased with him, and greeted him, but he did not return the greeting. So 'Umar went to Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, and mentioned this to him. Abu Bakr then went to him to reconcile the matter, and this was not considered backbiting among them. Likewise, when it reached 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, that Abu Jandal was persistently consuming wine in Syria, he wrote to him: "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, Forgiver of sin, Accepter of repentance, Severe in punishment..." [Qur'an 40:1-3] and he repented. 'Umar did not consider the one who informed him of this to be guilty of backbiting, for his intention was to censure the act so that his sincere counsel might benefit him in a way that the counsel of another could not. The permissibility of this lies solely in the purity of intention; if that is not the intended purpose, then it is forbidden.

The third is seeking a formal legal opinion, as one who asks a mufti: "My father, my wife, or my brother has wronged me; what is the way to deliverance?" The safest course is to allude to the matter by saying: "What is your opinion concerning a man whose father, brother, or wife has wronged him?" However, explicit identification is permissible to this extent, based on what was narrated from Hind bint 'Utbah, who said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "Abu Sufyan is a miserly man; he does not give me what suffices for me and my child. May I take from his wealth without his knowledge?" He said, "Take what suffices you and your child in a reasonable manner." She mentioned his miserliness and his wronging her and her child, and he (peace be upon him) did not rebuke her, since her intention was to seek a formal legal opinion.

The fourth: warning a Muslim from evil. If you see a scholar frequenting an innovator or a sinner, and you fear that his innovation or sin may spread to him, you may disclose his innovation and sin, provided that your motive is solely fear for him from the contagion of innovation and sin, nothing else. This is a place of delusion, for envy may be the motive, and Satan disguises it by displaying compassion for creation. Likewise, if someone purchases a slave and you know the slave to be guilty of theft, sin, or another defect, you may mention that, for your silence harms the purchaser, and your mention harms the slave; the purchaser is more deserving of consideration. Similarly, a character witness, when asked about a witness, may impugn him if he knows grounds for impugnment. Likewise, one consulted regarding marriage or entrusting a deposit may mention what he knows with the intention of sincere advice to the consulter, not with the intention of causing harm. If he knows that refraining from marriage merely by saying, "She is not suitable for you," is sufficient and obligatory, that suffices. But if he knows that he will not be deterred except by explicitly stating her defect, he may state it explicitly, for the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Do you refrain from mentioning the wicked? Expose him so that people may know him. Mention him for what he is so that people may beware of him." And they used to say: Three are not subject to backbiting: the oppressive ruler, the innovator, and the one who openly flaunts his sin.

Fifth: When a person is known by a nickname that indicates a defect, such as "the Lame" or "the Weak-Sighted," there is no sin upon one who says, "Abu al-Zinad narrated from al-A'raj," or "Salman narrated from al-A'mash," and what follows this pattern. Scholars have done this out of necessity for identification, and because it has reached a point where the person himself would not resent it if he knew, after having become famous by it. Indeed, if a suitable alternative is found and one can identify him with another expression, that is preferable. For this reason, the blind person is called "al-Basir" (the Perceptive), avoiding a name of deficiency.

Sixth: When a person is openly flagrant in immorality, such as the effeminate man, the owner of a brothel, one who openly drinks wine, or seizes people's property, and is among those who publicly display it such that he feels no shame in it being mentioned and does not resent being described by it—then if you mention in him what he publicly displays, there is no sin upon you. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever casts off the cloak of modesty from his face has no backbiting." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "The flagrantly immoral has no sanctity," meaning the one who openly displays his immorality, not the one who conceals it, for the one who conceals it must have his sanctity respected. Al-Salt ibn Tarif said: I asked al-Hasan, "Is mentioning the openly immoral man for his depravity considered backbiting him?" He said, "No, and no honor." And al-Hasan said, "Three have no backbiting: the follower of caprice, the flagrantly immoral in his immorality, and the oppressive ruler. These three share that they publicly display it and perhaps even boast of it, so how could they resent it when they intend to make it apparent?" Indeed, if he is mentioned for something other than what he publicly displays, it is a sin. And 'Awf said: I entered upon Ibn Sirin and mentioned al-Hajjaj in his presence. He said, "God is a just Judge; He will exact vengeance for al-Hajjaj from whoever backbit him, and from al-Hajjaj for whoever he wronged. And if you meet God Almighty tomorrow, the smallest sin you have committed will be more severe upon you than the greatest sin al-Hajjaj committed."

**Explanation of the Atonement for Backbiting**

Know that it is obligatory for the backbiter to feel remorse, repent, and grieve for what he has done, to absolve himself of the right of God Almighty. Then he must seek forgiveness from the person backbitten to release him from the wrong, and thus exit from his injustice. He should seek forgiveness while sad, grieving, and remorseful for his action, for the hypocrite may seek forgiveness to display piety outwardly while inwardly not remorseful, thus committing another sin. Al-Hasan said, "Seeking forgiveness suffices without seeking pardon." Some have cited as evidence what Anas ibn Malik narrated: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The atonement for one you have backbitten is that you seek forgiveness for him." And Mujahid said, "The atonement for your eating your brother's flesh is that you praise him and pray for good for him." 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah was asked about repentance from backbiting. He said, "You should go to your companion and say to him: I lied in what I said, wronged you, and did wrong. If you wish, take your right, and if you wish, forgive." This is the most correct view. The statement of some that honor has no compensation, so seeking pardon is not obligatory from it—unlike wealth—is weak speech, for the legal punishment for slander is established for honor, and the claim for it is proven. Rather, in the authentic Hadith, it is narrated that he, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever has wronged his brother in honor or wealth, let him seek pardon from him before a day comes when there will be no dinar or dirham. Only good deeds will be taken; if he has no good deeds, the bad deeds of his companion will be taken and added to his own bad deeds." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said to a woman who said to another that she had a long train, "You have backbitten her, so seek her pardon." Therefore, seeking pardon is necessary if possible. If the person is absent or deceased, one should increase in seeking forgiveness and supplication for him and increase in good deeds.

If you ask: Is reconciliation obligatory? I say: No, for it is a voluntary act, and voluntary acts are meritorious but not obligatory. However, it is commendable, and the way of one seeking pardon is to be profuse in praising and showing affection to the offended, and to persist in this until his heart is appeased. If his heart is not appeased, his apology and affection become a good deed recorded for him, which will counter the sin of backbiting on the Day of Resurrection.

Some of the early pious predecessors would not deem lawful. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: "I do not deem lawful the property of one who has wronged me." And Ibn Sirin said: "I did not forbid it to him, so that I might then deem it lawful for him. Rather, God has forbidden backbiting to him, and I would never deem lawful what God has made unlawful."

If you ask: What is the meaning of the Prophet's saying (peace be upon him), "He ought to seek its permissibility," when rendering lawful what God the Exalted has forbidden is impossible? We say: The intent is forgiveness for the wrong, not that the forbidden becomes lawful. And what Ibn Sirin said is sound regarding seeking permission before backbiting, for it is not permissible for one to make backbiting lawful for another.

If you ask: What is the meaning of the Prophet’s saying (peace be upon him), “Is it too difficult for any of you to be like Abu Damdam? Whenever he left his house, he would say, ‘O Allah, I have given my honor in charity to the people.’” How can one give his honor in charity, and if someone does so, is it then permissible to violate it? For if his charity has no effect, what is the point of encouraging it? We say: Its meaning is that I will not seek redress from him on the Day of Resurrection, nor will I dispute with him. Otherwise, backbiting does not become lawful by it, nor is the injustice removed from him, because it is a pardon before the obligation is due, except that it is a promise, and he has the resolve to fulfill it by not disputing. If he retracts and disputes, the analogy is like all other rights—that he may do so. Indeed, the jurists have explicitly stated that if someone permits slander, his right to the punishment of the slanderer is not forfeited. The injustice of the Hereafter is like the injustice of this world. In summary, forgiveness is superior.

Al-Hasan said: When the nations kneel before God Almighty on the Day of Resurrection, a call will be made: "Let those who have a reward due from God stand." None will rise except those who pardoned people in the worldly life. And God the Exalted has said: "Hold to forgiveness, enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant." The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked: "O Gabriel, what is this forgiveness?" He replied: "God commands you to pardon whoever wronged you, maintain ties with whoever severed them, and give to whoever deprived you." It is related from Al-Hasan that a man told him: "So-and-so has backbitten you." So he sent that person fresh dates on a tray with the message: "I have been informed that you gifted me from your good deeds, so I wished to repay you for them. Please excuse me, for I am unable to fully reciprocate."

The Sixteenth Affliction: Talebearing

God Almighty said, "Slanderer, going about with calumny," then said, "Surly, and after that, ignoble." Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak said: The ignoble one is the child of adultery who does not conceal speech, indicating by this that anyone who does not conceal speech and goes about with slander shows that he is a child of adultery, inferred from His words, exalted is He, "Surly, and after that, ignoble." The ignoble one is the falsely attributed. And He said, "Woe to every slanderer, defamer." It is said the slanderer: the talebearer. And He said, "Carrier of firewood." It is said she was a talebearer, a carrier of speech. And He said, "But they both betrayed them, and they availed them nothing against God." It is said Lot's wife used to inform about the guests, and Noah's wife used to inform that he was mad. And He ﷺ said, "The talebearer will not enter Paradise." In another hadith, "The talebearer will not enter Paradise," and the talebearer is the slanderer. Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "The most beloved of you to God are the best of you in character, the most accommodating, those who foster affection and are affectionate. And the most hateful of you to God are those who go about with slander, causing division between brothers, seeking out faults for the innocent." And he ﷺ said, "Shall I not inform you of the worst among you?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Those who go about with slander, causing corruption between loved ones, seeking fault for the innocent." Abu Dharr reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Whoever spreads a word about a Muslim to disgrace him with it unjustly, God will disgrace him with it in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection." Abu al-Darda' reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Any man who spreads a word about a man while he is innocent of it to disgrace him with it in the world, it is incumbent upon God to melt him with it on the Day of Resurrection in the Fire." Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Whoever bears witness against a Muslim with testimony for which he is not qualified, let him take his seat in the Fire." It is said that one-third of the punishment of the grave is from talebearing. From Ibn Umar, from the Prophet ﷺ, "When God created Paradise, He said to it, 'Speak.' It said, 'Blessed is he who enters me.' The Almighty, majestic is His majesty and mighty is His might, said, 'By My might and majesty, eight types of people shall not dwell in you: the addicted to wine, the persistent in adultery, the talebearer—which is the slanderer—the panderer, the policeman, the effeminate, the severer of kinship ties, and he who says, 'By God, if I do not do such and such,' then does not fulfill it.'" Ka'b al-Ahbar narrated that the Children of Israel were struck by drought, so Moses, peace be upon him, prayed for rain repeatedly, but they were not given rain. God Almighty revealed to him: "I do not answer you nor those with you, for among you is a talebearer who has persisted in talebearing." Moses said, "O Lord, who is he? Show him to me so I may expel him from among us." He said, "O Moses, I forbid you from talebearing, and shall I be a talebearer?" So they all repented, and rain was given. It is said a man followed a sage for seven hundred leagues for seven words. When he came to him, he said, "I have come to you for the knowledge God Almighty has given you. Inform me about the sky and what is heavier than it? About the earth and what is wider than it? About stone and what is harder than it? About fire and what is hotter than it? About intense cold and what is colder than it? About the sea and what is richer than it? About the orphan and what is more humiliated than it?" The sage said to him, "False accusation against the innocent is heavier than the heavens, truth is wider than the earth, the content heart is richer than the sea, greed and envy are hotter than fire, need from a relative when it is not met is colder than intense cold, the heart of the disbeliever is harder than stone, and the talebearer when his affair becomes known is more humiliated than the orphan."

Explanation of the Definition of Talebearing and What is Obligatory in Repelling It

Know that the name 'talebearing' is mostly applied to one who carries the speech of others to the one spoken about, as when you say, 'So-and-so was speaking about you in such-and-such a way.' However, talebearing is not restricted to this. Rather, its definition is revealing what is disliked to be revealed, whether it is disliked by the one from whom it is reported, the one to whom it is reported, or a third party dislikes it. Whether that is a fault and deficiency in the one reported about or not, the reality of talebearing is divulging a secret and tearing the veil from what is disliked to be uncovered. Rather, everything a person sees of people's conditions that is disliked should be kept silent about, except where in reporting it there is a benefit for a Muslim or prevention of a sin, such as if he sees someone taking another's wealth, then he must bear witness to it, observing the right of the one testified for. But if he sees him hiding wealth for himself and mentions it, that is talebearing and divulging a secret. If what is carried is a fault and deficiency in the one reported about, then he has combined backbiting and talebearing. The motive for talebearing is either intending harm for the one reported about, or showing love for the one reported to, or amusement through speech and indulging in excess and falsehood.

And for everyone to whom tale-bearing is conveyed, and it is said to him, "So-and-so said such-and-such about you," or "did such-and-such against your right," or "is plotting to spoil your affair or to ally with your enemy," or "to defame your condition," or anything of that nature, six matters are incumbent upon him.

The first is that he should not believe him, for the tale-bearer is corrupt and his testimony is rejected. God Almighty has said, "O you who believe, if a corrupt person comes to you with news, verify it, lest you harm a people in ignorance."

The second is that he should forbid him from that, counsel him, and make his action seem vile to him. God Almighty has said, "And enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong."

The third is that he should hold enmity towards him for the sake of God Almighty, for he is detestable in the sight of God Almighty, and it is obligatory to hold enmity towards whom God detests.

The fourth is that he should not suspect ill of his absent brother, due to the saying of God Almighty, "Avoid much suspicion, for indeed some suspicion is sin."

The fifth is that what he has related to you should not compel you to spy and investigate for verification, following the saying of God Almighty, "And do not spy."

The sixth is that you should not permit for yourself what you have forbidden the tale-bearer from, nor should you relate his tale-bearing by saying, "So-and-so told me such-and-such," for then you would become a tale-bearer and a backbiter, and you may have committed what you forbade him from.

It has been related that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God be pleased with him, had a man enter upon him who mentioned something to him about another man. 'Umar said to him, "If you wish, we will look into your affair. If you are lying, then you are among those addressed by this verse, 'If a corrupt person comes to you with news, verify it.' And if you are truthful, then you are among those addressed by this verse, 'Slanderer, going about with tale-bearing.' Or if you wish, we shall pardon you?" The man said, "Pardon, O Commander of the Faithful. I shall never return to it."

And it is mentioned that a wise man among the sages was visited by one of his brothers, who informed him of some news about one of his friends. The wise man said to him, "You have delayed in visiting, and you have come with three offenses: you have made my brother hateful to me, you have occupied my heart which was empty, and you have accused your trustworthy self."

And it is related that Sulayman ibn 'Abd al-Malik was sitting and al-Zuhri was with him when a man came to him. Sulayman said to him, "It has reached me that you spoke ill and said such-and-such." The man said, "I did not do it nor say it." Sulayman said, "The one who informed me is truthful." Al-Zuhri said to him, "The tale-bearer cannot be truthful." Sulayman said, "You have spoken the truth." Then he said to the man, "Go in peace."

Al-Hasan said, "Whoever gossips to you will gossip about you." This indicates that the talebearer should be detested, and neither his word nor his friendship should be trusted. How could he not be detested, for he is never free from lying, backbiting, treachery, betrayal, malice, envy, hypocrisy, sowing discord among people, and deceit? He is among those who strive to sever what God has commanded to be joined and who spread corruption on earth. God Almighty has said, "The way is only against those who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right" (Quran 42:42), and the talebearer is among them. And He said, "Indeed, among the worst of people is he whom people avoid for fear of his evil" (Hadith), and the talebearer is among them. And He said, "The severer shall not enter Paradise." It was asked, "Who is the severer?" He replied, "He who severs ties between people" (Hadith), and that is the talebearer. It is also said it refers to one who severs kinship ties.

It is reported from Ali, may God be pleased with him, that a man came to him accusing another man. He said to the accuser: "O you, we will ask about what you have said. If you are truthful, we will despise you, and if you are lying, we will punish you. But if you wish, we will pardon you and let you go." The man said: "Pardon me, O Commander of the Faithful."

It was said to Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi: "Which traits of a believer are most degrading for him?" He replied: "Excessive speech, divulging secrets, and accepting the word of everyone."

A man said to Abdullah ibn 'Amir—who was a governor—"It has reached me that so-and-so informed you that I spoke ill of you." He said: "That did happen." The man said: "Then tell me what he said to you, so I may expose his lie before you?" He replied: "I do not wish to defile myself with my own tongue. It is enough for me that I did not believe him in what he said, nor did I sever my connection with you."

And the matter of talebearing was mentioned before one of the righteous, and he said: "What do you think of a people whom every faction among mankind praises for truthfulness—except them?" And Mus‘ab ibn al-Zubayr said: "We hold that accepting a tale is worse than the tale itself, for the tale is merely an indication, while acceptance is an endorsement. He who points to something and informs of it is not like he who accepts it and sanctions it. So beware of the talebearer, for even if he were truthful in his speech, he would be base in his truthfulness, since he did not preserve sanctity nor conceal the private fault." And talebearing is backbiting, except that when it is directed to one whose side is feared, it is called "sai'yah" (talebearing). And it has been said: "The talebearer who carries tales among people is not of sound parentage," meaning he is not a legitimate child. And a man entered upon Sulayman ibn ‘Abd al-Malik and sought his permission to speak, saying: "I shall address you, O Commander of the Faithful, with words—so bear with them if you dislike them, for behind them lies what you will love if you accept them." He said: "Speak." He said: "O Commander of the Faithful, there have surrounded you men who have purchased your worldly favor with their religion and your pleasure with the wrath of their Lord. They fear you in regard to God, but they do not fear God in regard to you. So do not feel secure with them concerning what God has entrusted to you, nor confide in them regarding what God has made you guardian over, for they will not cease to bring ruin upon the community, neglect to the trust, and severing and violation to honors. Their closest means is aggression and talebearing, and their most exalted instrument is backbiting and slander. And you will be questioned concerning what they have committed, but they will not be questioned concerning what you have committed. So do not set right their worldly affairs by corrupting your Hereafter, for the greatest loser among people is he who sells his Hereafter for the worldly life of another." And a man carried a tale about Ziyad al-A‘jam to Sulayman ibn ‘Abd al-Malik, so he brought the two together for reconciliation. Ziyad turned to the man and said:

If I entrusted you in private, then you are a man who either betrayed or spoke a saying without knowledge. Thus, you stand in the matter that was between us at the station between treachery and sin.

A man said to Amr ibn Ubaid: "Al-Aswari continues to mention you in his stories with disparagement." Amr replied to him: "O you, you have neither observed the right of companionship with the man by conveying his speech to us, nor have you fulfilled my right when you informed me about my brother what I dislike. But I consider that death will encompass us all, the grave will gather us, the Resurrection will assemble us, and God the Exalted will judge between us, and He is the best of judges."

And one of the informers raised a petition to al-Sahib ibn Abbad, alerting him therein about an orphan's wealth, making it seem attractive for him to take due to its abundance. He wrote on its back: "Informing is ugly, even if it is true. If you intended it as sincere advice, then your loss in it is better than gain. And God forbid that we should accept a breach in what is concealed. Were it not that you are under the protection of your gray hair, we would have met you with what your action against your like necessitates. So beware, O cursed fault-finder, for God knows best the unseen. The deceased—may God have mercy on him; the orphan—may God compensate him; the wealth—may God increase it; and the informer—may God curse him."

And Luqman said to his son: "O my son, I advise you with traits: if you hold fast to them, you will never cease to be a master. Extend your character to the near and the far. Restrain your ignorance from the noble and the base. Preserve your brothers, maintain ties with your relatives, and secure them from accepting the words of an informer or listening to a transgressor who desires your corruption and aims to deceive you. And let your brothers be those whom, when you part from them and they part from you, you do not find fault with them, nor they with you."

And one of them said: "Tale-bearing is built upon falsehood, envy, and hypocrisy, and it is the foundation stones of humiliation."

And another said: "If what the tale-bearer conveyed to you were true, then the one who dared to insult you would be more deserving of your forbearance, and the one spoken about would be more entitled to your clemency, because he did not confront you with your insult."

In summary, the evil of the talebearer is immense and must be guarded against. Hammad ibn Salamah related: A man sold a slave and said to the buyer, "He has no defect except talebearing." The buyer said, "I accept," and purchased him. The slave remained for some days, then said to his master's wife, "My master does not love you and intends to take a concubine over you. Take the razor and shave a few hairs from the nape of his neck while he sleeps, so I may enchant him with them and he will love you." Then he said to the husband, "Your wife has taken a lover and intends to kill you. Pretend to sleep for her so you may know this." So the husband pretended to sleep for her. The wife came with the razor, and he thought she meant to kill him, so he rose against her and killed her. Then the woman's family came and killed the husband, and fighting broke out between the two tribes. We ask God for good success.

The Seventeenth Affliction

The speech of the double-tongued that wavers between two adversaries

Each of them is addressed with speech that suits him, and rarely is one who witnesses two adversaries free from it, and that is the very essence of hypocrisy.

'Ammar ibn Yasir reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever has two faces in this world will have two tongues of fire on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Hurayrah reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, "You will find among the worst of Allah's servants on the Day of Resurrection the one with two faces, who comes to these people with one tale and to those with another." In another wording, "who comes to these with one face and to those with another." And Abu Hurayrah said: It is not fitting for one with two faces to be trustworthy before Allah. Malik ibn Dinar said: I read in the Torah that Allah the Exalted seeks faithfulness, and the man who deals with his companion with two different lips—Allah will destroy on the Day of Resurrection every pair of lips that differ. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The most detested of Allah's creatures to Allah on the Day of Resurrection are the liars, the arrogant, those who harbor much hatred for their brothers in their hearts yet fawn over them when they meet, and those who, when called to Allah and His Messenger, weep, but when called to Satan and his affair, are swift." Ibn Mas'ud said: Let none of you be an imma'a. They asked: What is an imma'a? He said: One who goes with every wind. They agreed that meeting two people with two different faces is hypocrisy, and hypocrisy has many signs; this is among them.

It has been narrated that a man from the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) died, and Hudhayfah did not pray over him. 'Umar said to him: "A man from the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) dies and you do not pray over him?" He replied: "O Commander of the Faithful, they are from among them." He said: "I adjure you by God, am I from among them or not?" He said: "O God, no, and I do not deem anyone safe from it after you."

If you ask: By what does a man become double-tongued, and what is the limit of that? I say: If he enters upon two adversaries and shows courtesy to each of them, and is truthful in it, he is not a hypocrite nor double-tongued. For a single person may befriend two adversaries, but it is a weak friendship that does not reach the level of brotherhood, for if true friendship were realized, it would necessitate hostility towards the enemies—as we mentioned in the Book of the Etiquettes of Companionship and Brotherhood. However, if he conveys the speech of each one to the other, then he is double-tongued, and that is worse than tale-bearing, for a tale-bearer conveys from only one side; if he conveys from both sides, he is worse than the tale-bearer. And if he does not convey speech, but approves for each of them the state of enmity they are in with their companion, this is also being double-tongued. Likewise, if he promises each of them that he will support him, and likewise if he praises one of them in his enmity. Likewise, if he praises one of them and then, when he leaves his presence, disparages him, he is double-tongued. Rather, he should remain silent or praise the one who is in the right among the adversaries. And he should praise him in his absence and in his presence, and before his enemy.

It was said to Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both: "We enter upon our rulers and say certain words, but when we leave we say something else." He replied: "We used to consider this hypocrisy in the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him." And this is hypocrisy, for if one were truly self-sufficient, he would have no need to enter upon the ruler or to praise him. If he were self-sufficient, he would be content with little and forsake wealth and status. But if he enters out of necessity for status and wealth and offers praise, then he is a hypocrite. This is the meaning of his saying, peace be upon him: "The love of wealth and status causes hypocrisy to grow in the heart just as water causes plants to grow," because it compels one to seek out rulers and to be mindful of them and to please them. However, if one is afflicted by necessity and fears harm if he does not praise, then he is excused, for warding off harm is permissible. Abu al-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Indeed, we smile in the faces of some people while our hearts curse them." And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "A man sought permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he said, 'Grant him permission, for how evil a man of his tribe he is.' Then, when he entered, he softened his speech to him. When he left, I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, you said what you said about him, then you softened your speech to him?' He said, 'O 'A'ishah, the worst of people is he whom people honor out of fear of his evil.'" However, this pertains to receiving someone and to smiling and showing a cheerful face. As for praise, it is outright falsehood and is not permissible except out of necessity or under compulsion where lying of its like is permitted—as we mentioned in the chapter on the vice of lying. Indeed, it is not permissible to offer praise, nor to express agreement, nor to nod one's head in a manner that indicates approval of false speech. Whoever does that is a hypocrite. Rather, one should reject it. If one is unable, then he should remain silent with his tongue in any situation that implies approval of false speech. Whoever does that is a hypocrite. Rather, one should reject it. If one is unable, then he should remain silent with his tongue and reject it with his heart.

The Eighteenth Affliction: Praise

It is prohibited in certain instances. As for blameworthy speech, it comprises backbiting and slander, the rulings of which we have already discussed.  
Praise, however, entails six harms: four affecting the one who praises, and two affecting the one being praised.

As for the one who praises, the preferable view is that he may go to excess, thereby reaching the point of falsehood. Khalid ibn Ma'dan said: Whoever praises an imam or any person with what is not in him before a public gathering, God will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection stumbling with his tongue.

The second: That it may involve hypocrisy, for through praise one displays love, yet may not inwardly harbor it nor believe all that is said, thus becoming a hypocritical show-off.

The third: That one may say what one does not verify nor have means to ascertain. It is narrated that a man praised another before the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he said to him, "Woe to you, you have cut the neck of your companion! Had he heard it, he would not have prospered." Then he said, "If one of you must praise his brother, let him say, 'I consider so-and-so to be such-and-such,' but I do not declare anyone pure before God; God is his reckoner, if he sees him as such." This flaw infiltrates praise with absolute attributes known through evidence, such as saying he is pious, devout, ascetic, good, and the like. But if one says, "I saw him praying at night, giving charity, and performing pilgrimage," these are certain matters. Among these is saying he is just and satisfactory, for that is hidden, so one should not assert it except after inner experience. Umar (may God be pleased with him) heard a man praising another and asked, "Have you traveled with him?" He said, "No." He asked, "Have you dealt with him in buying and selling?" He said, "No." He asked, "Are you his neighbor morning and evening?" He said, "No." He said, "By God, besides whom there is no god, I do not see that you know him."

The fourth: That it may please the praised one who is unjust or corrupt, which is not permissible. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "God Almighty becomes angry when the corrupt is praised." Al-Hasan said, "Whoever prays for a tyrant to live long has loved that God be disobeyed in His land." The unjust corrupt one should be censured to grieve him, not praised to please him.

As for the praised one, it harms him in two ways: First, it generates in him pride and self-admiration, both destructive. Al-Hasan (may God be pleased with him) said: Umar (may God be pleased with him) was sitting with a whip, people around him, when Al-Jarud ibn Al-Mundhir approached. A man said, "This is the master of Rabi'ah." Umar heard it, those around him heard it, and Al-Jarud heard it. When he drew near, Umar struck him with the whip. He said, "What is between you and me, O Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "What is between you and me? Did you not hear it?" He said, "I heard it, so what?" He said, "I feared that something of it might enter your heart, so I wished to humble you."

Second: When he is praised for good, he rejoices, becomes lax, and is pleased with himself. Whoever admires himself seldom exerts effort, for only one who sees himself deficient strives for work. When tongues are unleashed with praise, he thinks he has attained. Therefore, he (peace be upon him) said, "You have cut the neck of your companion! Had he heard it, he would not have prospered." And he (peace be upon him) said, "If you praise your brother to his face, it is as if you have passed a sharp blade over his throat." He also said to one who praised a man, "You have hamstrung the man; may God hamstring you." Mutarrif said, "I never heard praise or commendation without feeling small to myself." Ziyad ibn Abi Muslim said, "No one hears praise or commendation without Satan appearing to him, but the believer reflects." Ibn Al-Mubarak said, "Both have spoken truthfully. As for what Ziyad mentioned, that is the heart of the common people; as for what Mutarrif mentioned, that is the heart of the elect." He (peace be upon him) said, "If a man walked to another with a sharp knife, it would be better for him than praising him to his face." Umar (may God be pleased with him) said, "Praise is slaughter." That is because the slaughtered is one who becomes lax in work, and praise causes laxity, or because praise begets pride and arrogance, both destructive like slaughter; thus it is likened to it. If praise is safe from these flaws regarding the praiser and the praised, there is no harm; indeed, it may be recommended. Therefore, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) praised the Companions, saying, "If the faith of Abu Bakr were weighed against the faith of all people, it would outweigh them." And he said of Umar, "If I had not been sent, you would have been sent, O Umar." What praise exceeds this? But he (peace be upon him) spoke from truth and insight. They (may God be pleased with them) were of such high rank that it did not beget in them pride, self-admiration, or laxity. Even praising oneself is ugly due to the pride and boasting therein, as he (peace be upon him) said, "I am the master of the children of Adam, without boasting," meaning I do not say this boastfully as people intend in praising themselves. That is because his (peace be upon him) boasting was in God and nearness to God, not in being of Adam's children and surpassing them; just as one greatly accepted by a king boasts in his acceptance and rejoices in it, not in surpassing some of his subjects. By detailing these flaws, one can reconcile censuring praise and encouraging it. He (peace be upon him) said, "It has become obligatory," when they praised a deceased person. Mujahid said, "The children of Adam have sitting companions from the angels. If a man mentions his Muslim brother with good, the angels say, 'And for you the like.' If he mentions him with evil, the angels say, 'O son of Adam, the concealed your fault, take care of yourself, and praise God who concealed your fault.'" These are the flaws of praise.

Explanation of What is Upon the Praised One

Know that upon the praised one is to be intensely cautious against the flaw of pride, self-admiration, and the flaw of laxity. He is saved from it only by knowing himself and contemplating what is in the peril of the end, the subtleties of hypocrisy, and the flaws of deeds, for he knows of himself what the praiser does not know, even if all his secrets and what passes in his thoughts were revealed, the praiser would refrain from praising him. He must show dislike for praise by humbling the praiser. He (peace be upon him) said, "Throw dust in the faces of those who praise." Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah said, "Praise does not harm one who knows himself." A righteous man was praised and said, "O God, these do not know me, but You know me." Another, when praised, said, "O God, this servant of Yours has drawn near to You with what You detest, and I call You to witness my detestation of it." Ali (may God be pleased with him), when praised, said, "O God, forgive me for what they do not know, and do not hold me accountable for what they say, and make me better than what they think." A man praised Umar (may God be pleased with him), and he said, "Are you destroying me and destroying yourself?" A man praised Ali (may God honor his face) to his face—and it had reached him that he spoke against him—so he said, "I am less than what you say and more than what is in your heart."

The Nineteenth Affliction

Neglecting the subtleties of error in the essence of speech.

especially concerning God and His attributes

And it is connected to matters of religion, so none can properly articulate the wording in matters of religion except the eloquent scholars. Whoever is deficient in knowledge or eloquence, his speech will not be free from error, but God the Exalted pardons him due to his ignorance. An example is what Hudhayfah reported: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Let none of you say, 'What God wills and you will,' but rather let him say, 'What God wills, then you will.'" This is because absolute conjunction implies partnership and equalization, which is contrary to proper reverence. And Ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) said: A man came to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) to speak to him about some matter and said, "What God wills and you will." So he (peace be upon him) said, "Have you made me an equal to God? Rather, 'What God wills alone.'" And a man delivered a sermon in the presence of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and said, "Whoever obeys God and His Messenger has been guided, and whoever disobeys them both has gone astray." So he (peace be upon him) said, "Say: 'and whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has gone astray.'" The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) disliked his saying "disobeys them both" because it implies equalization and grouping. And Ibrahim [al-Nakha'i] disliked a man saying, "I seek refuge with God and with you," but it was permissible to say, "I seek refuge with God, then with you." And to say, "Were it not for God, then so-and-so?" but not to say, "Were it not for God and so-and-so?" And some of them disliked it being said, "O God, emancipate us from the Fire," and he would say, "Emancipation occurs after entry." They would seek protection from the Fire and seek refuge from the Fire. And a man said, "O God, make me among those whom the intercession of Muhammad (peace be upon him) reaches." So Hudhayfah said, "God makes the believers independent of the intercession of Muhammad, and his intercession is for the sinners among the Muslims." And Ibrahim said: If a man says to another man, "O donkey! O pig!" it will be said to him on the Day of Resurrection, "Did you see me as a donkey that I created? As a pig that I created?" And from Ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them both): "Indeed, one of you commits *shirk* until he commits *shirk* with his dog, by saying, 'Were it not for it, we would have been robbed tonight.'" And 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "God the Exalted forbids you from swearing by your fathers. Whoever must swear, let him swear by God or remain silent." 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said, "So by God, I have not sworn by them since I heard it." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Do not call grapes *karam* (vine/vineyard), for indeed *karam* is the Muslim man." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "Let none of you say 'my slave' or 'my slave woman,' for all of you are slaves of God and all your women are slave women of God. Let him say 'my young man' and 'my young woman,' and 'my boy' and 'my girl.' And let not the owned male slave say 'my lord' or 'my lady,' but let him say 'my master' and 'my mistress,' for all of you are slaves of God; the Lord is God, Glorified and Exalted is He." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Do not say to the corrupt person 'our master,' for if he is your master, you have angered your Lord." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever says, 'I am free from Islam,' then if he is truthful, he is as he said, and if he is lying, he will not return to Islam safely." This and its like are among matters that fall under speech and cannot be exhaustively listed.

Whoever contemplates all the afflictions of the tongue we have presented knows that if he lets his tongue run free, he will not be safe. At that point, he understands the secret of the saying, "Whoever remains silent is saved," for all these afflictions are perils and pitfalls lying in the path of the speaker. If he remains silent, he is safe from them all; but if he speaks and converses, he risks his soul—unless he is aided by an eloquent tongue, abundant knowledge, protective piety, and constant vigilance, and he reduces his speech, so that perhaps he may then be safe. Yet even with all that, he is not free from danger. Therefore, if you cannot be among those who speak and gain reward, then be among those who remain silent and attain safety, for safety is one of the two gains.

The Twentieth Affliction

The Inquiry of Common Folk Regarding the Attributes of God Most High and His Speech

Regarding the letters: are they eternal or created?

And among their rights is to occupy themselves with acting upon what is in the Qur'an, except that this is heavy upon the souls, while idle talk is light upon the heart. The common person delights in delving into knowledge, for Satan makes it appear to him that you are among the scholars and people of virtue, and he continually makes that beloved to him until he speaks about knowledge with what is disbelief, and he does not know. And every major sin a common person commits is safer for him than that he speaks about knowledge, especially concerning what relates to God and His attributes. The affair of the common folk is only to occupy themselves with acts of worship and to believe in what the Qur'an has brought, and to submit to what the Messengers brought without investigation, and their asking about other than what pertains to acts of worship is bad manners from them, deserving by it the loathing from God Almighty and exposing them to the danger of disbelief. It is like the stable-keepers of beasts of burden asking about the secrets of kings, and it necessitates punishment. And everyone who asks about obscure knowledge and his understanding has not reached that degree is blameworthy, for in relation to it, he is a common person. And for that reason, He ﷺ said: "Leave me with what I have left you, for those before you were only destroyed by their excessive questioning and their differing with their prophets. What I have forbidden you, avoid it, and what I have commanded you, bring of it what you are able." And Anas said: The people asked the Messenger of God ﷺ one day, and they were excessive with him and angered him. So he ascended the pulpit and said: "Ask me, you will not ask me about anything except that I will inform you of it." A man stood up to him and said: "O Messenger of God, who is my father?" He said: "Your father is Hudhafah." Then two young brothers came to him and said: "O Messenger of God, who is our father?" He said: "Your father is the one you claim." Then another man stood up to him and said: "O Messenger of God, am I in Paradise or in the Fire?" He said: "No, rather in the Fire." When the people saw the anger of the Messenger of God ﷺ, they held back. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, stood up to him and said: "We are pleased with God as Lord, with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad ﷺ as Prophet." He said: "Sit, O 'Umar, may God have mercy on you. You are, as I know, successful."

In the Hadith: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prohibited idle talk, squandering wealth, and excessive questioning. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The time is near when people will question one another until they say, 'God created creation, so who created God?' When they say that, then say: 'Say: He is God, the One, God, the Eternal Refuge,' until you complete the chapter. Then let one of you spit to his left three times and seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan."

Jabir said: "The verse of the mutual cursing was only revealed due to the abundance of questioning." In the story of Moses and Khidr, peace be upon them both, there is a warning against asking before its due time, as He said, "If you follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I mention it to you." When he asked about the ship, it was disapproved of him until he apologized, saying, "Do not hold me accountable for what I have forgotten, and do not burden me with hardship in my affair." Yet he did not endure until he asked three times, and it was said, "This is the parting between you and me," and he departed from him.

The questioning of common folk regarding the obscure matters of religion is among the greatest afflictions and a catalyst for discord; thus, they must be restrained and prevented from it. Their delving into the letters of the Qur'an resembles the state of one to whom a king wrote a letter and outlined matters within it, yet he did not occupy himself with any of its contents, wasting his time instead on whether the paper of the letter was old or new—thereby deserving punishment without doubt. Similarly, the commoner squanders the boundaries set by the Qur'an, busying himself with its letters—are they ancient or recent? And likewise concerning all the attributes of God, the Exalted and Glorified. And God, the Exalted, knows best.







An Exposition on the Grave Peril of the Tongue and the Virtue of Silence

[1] The hadith "Whoever remains silent attains salvation" was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with a weak chain, and he said it is ghareeb (rare). It is found in al-Tabarani with a sound chain.

[2] The hadith "Silence is wisdom, but few practice it" was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas with the wording "judgment" (hukm) instead of "wisdom" (hikmah), and he said 'Uthman ibn Sa'd erred in it, and the correct version is the narration from Thabit. He said the correct report from Anas is that Luqman said it. Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hibban reported it similarly in Kitab Rawdat al-'Uqala' with a sound chain going back to Anas.

[3] The hadith of Sufyan al-Thaqafi: "Inform me about Islam with a matter I will not ask anyone about after you..." was reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih, and by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. It is in Muslim without the latter part of the hadith which mentions the tongue.

[4] The hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir: I said, "O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation?" He said, "Restrain your tongue..." The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi who said it is hasan.

[5] The hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "Whoever guarantees for me what is between his jaws and what is between his legs, I guarantee Paradise for him." Reported by al-Bukhari.

[6] The hadith "Whoever is protected from the evil of his gullet, his private parts, and his tongue... has Paradise made obligatory for him" was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

[7] The hadith "He was asked about that which admits people to Paradise the most..." was reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih, and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[8] The hadith of Mu'adh: I said, "O Messenger of Allah, will we be held accountable for what we say?" He said, "May your mother be bereaved of you! Are people thrown into the Fire on their faces for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?" Reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who said it is sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[9] The hadith of 'Abdullah al-Thaqafi: I said, "O Messenger of Allah, tell me of a matter I may hold fast to..." Reported by al-Nasa'i. Ibn 'Asakir said this is an error, and the correct version is Sufyan ibn 'Abdullah al-Thaqafi, as reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih and Ibn Majah. It has preceded this by five hadiths.

[10] The hadith: "Mu'adh said, 'O Messenger of Allah, which deeds are best?' He then stuck out his tongue and placed his hand upon it." Reported by al-Tabarani and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt, who said "his finger" in place of "his hand."

[11] The hadith of Anas: "The faith of a servant is not upright until his heart is upright, and his heart is not upright until his tongue is upright..." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt and al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq with a weak chain.

[12] The hadith "Whoever is pleased to be safe, let him adhere to silence" was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt, Abu al-Shaykh in Fada'il al-A'mal, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

[13] The hadith "When the son of Adam wakes in the morning, all his limbs admonish the tongue..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri as marfu'. In the Ihya' it is attributed to Sa'id ibn Jubayr as marfu', but it is actually from Sa'id ibn Jubayr from Abu Sa'id as marfu'. Al-Tirmidhi reported it as mawquf upon 'Ammar ibn Zayd and said this is more correct.

[14] The hadith: "'Umar saw Abu Bakr extending his tongue and said, 'What are you doing, O Caliph of the Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'This has led me into perilous situations. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "There is no part of the body except that it complains to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the tongue specifically."'" Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt, Abu Ya'la in his Musnad, al-Daraqutni in al-'Ilal, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Aslam, the freed slave of 'Umar. Al-Daraqutni said the marfu' attribution is a mistake on al-Darawardi. He said this hadith is also narrated from Qays ibn Abi Hazim from Abu Bakr and has no defect.

[15] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: He was at al-Safa making the talbiyah and saying, "O tongue, speak good and you will gain." In it is the marfu' statement: "Most of the sins of the children of Adam are from their tongues." Reported by al-Tabarani, Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab with a hasan chain.

[16] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever restrains his tongue, Allah will conceal his faults." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt with a hasan chain.

[17] The hadith: "Mu'adh said, 'Counsel me.' He said, 'Worship Allah as if you see Him...'" Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt and al-Tabarani; its narrators are trustworthy though there is an interruption in the chain.

[18] The hadith of Safwan ibn Sulaym, marfu': "Shall I not inform you of the easiest worship and the lightest upon the body? Silence and good character." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus as mursal, and its narrators are trustworthy. Abu al-Shaykh reported it in Tabaqat al-Muhaddithin from the narrations of Abu Dharr and Abu al-Darda' also as marfu'.

[19] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent." Agreed upon.

[20] The hadith of al-Hasan: It was mentioned to us that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "May Allah have mercy on a servant who speaks and gains or remains silent and is safe." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas with a weak chain, for it is from the narration of Isma'il ibn 'Ayyash from the Hijazis.

[21] The hadith of al-Bara': A Bedouin came and said, "Direct me to a deed that will admit me to Paradise." He said, "Feed the hungry..." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya with a sound chain.

[22] The hadith "Guard your tongue except for good..." Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Saghir from the narration of Abu Sa'id. He has a similar version in al-Mu'jam al-Kabir, as does Ibn Hibban in his Sahih from the narration of Abu Dharr.

[23] The hadith "If you see a believer silent and dignified, draw near to him, for he is imbued with wisdom." Reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Khalad with the wording: "If you see a man given abstinence from the world and few words, draw near to him, for wisdom is cast upon him." It has preceded.

[24] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "People are of three types: a gainer, a safe one, and a wretched one..." Reported by al-Tabarani and Abu Ya'la from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with the wording "gatherings." Ibn 'Adi weakened it. I did not find the version with "three" from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.

[25] The hadith "The tongue of the believer is behind his heart. When he wishes to speak of something, he considers it with his heart..." I did not find it as marfu'. Al-Khara'iti reported it in Makarim al-Akhlaq

[29] The hadith "A believer's silence is but contemplation, his gaze but reflection, and his speech but remembrance" – I have not found a basis for it. It was narrated by Muhammad ibn Zakariyya al-'Ala'i, one of the weak narrators, from Ibn 'A'ishah from his father, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, delivered a sermon and said, "Verily, God has commanded me that my speech be remembrance, my silence contemplation, and my gaze reflection."

[30] The hadith "Part of a person's good Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him" was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *gharib* (rare), and by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[31] The hadith "A youth from among us was martyred on the day of Uhud, and a rock was found tied to his stomach due to hunger..." The hadith includes: "Perhaps he used to speak of that which did not concern him and withhold that which would not harm him." Al-Tirmidhi reported it concisely from the hadith of Anas and said it is *gharib*. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in *al-Samt* with the wording of the author via a weak chain.

[32] The hadith of Muhammad ibn Ka'b: "The first to enter through this door is a man from the people of Paradise," and 'Abdullah ibn Salam entered... The hadith includes: "The firmest thing I hope for is soundness of heart and leaving that which does not concern me." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus as *mursal* (with a broken chain), and in it is Abu Najih, regarding whom there is disagreement.

[33] The hadith of Muhammad ibn Ka'b: "The first to enter through this door is a man from the people of Paradise," and 'Abdullah ibn Salam entered... The hadith includes: "The firmest thing I hope for is soundness of heart and leaving that which does not concern me." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus as *mursal* (with a broken chain), and in it is Abu Najih, regarding whom there is disagreement.

[34] The hadith of Abu Dharr: "Shall I not teach you a deed light upon the body?" ... The hadith includes: "It is silence, good character, and leaving that which does not concern you." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it with an interrupted chain.

(The Second Harm: Superfluous Speech)

[35] Blessed is he who restrains the excess of his tongue and spends the excess of his wealth. Al-Baghawi and Ibn Qani' recorded it in their compilations of the Companions' biographies, and Al-Bayhaqi recorded it from the narration of Rukb al-Masri. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr said it is a *hasan* (good) hadith. Al-Baghawi said, "I do not know if he heard it from the Prophet (peace be upon him) or not." Ibn Mandah said, "He is unknown; we do not know of his companionship." Al-Bazzar recorded it from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

[36] Hadith of Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullah from his father: "I came to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) with a group from (the tribe of) 'Amir. They said, 'You are our father and you are our master.'" The hadith was recorded by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* with different wording, and Ibn Abi al-Dunya recorded it with the wording of the author (Al-Ghazali).

[37] Hadith of 'Amr ibn Dinar: "A man spoke before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and spoke excessively. He (the Prophet) said, 'How many veils are there before your tongue?'" The hadith was recorded by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in this manner as *mursal* (with a missing link in the chain), though its narrators are trustworthy.

(The Third Affliction: Indulging in Futility)

[38] The hadith of Bilal ibn al-Harith: "Indeed, a man may speak a word pleasing to Allah..." Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih.

[39] The hadith: "Indeed, a man may speak a word to make his companions laugh, and because of it he will plummet farther than the Pleiades." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a hasan chain. Also in the two Sahihs and al-Tirmidhi: "Indeed, a man may speak a word, seeing no harm in it, and because of it he will plummet seventy autumns into the Fire." The wording is from al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan gharib.

[40] The hadith: "The people with the greatest sins on the Day of Resurrection will be those who indulged most in falsehood." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the hadith of Qatadah as mursal, and its narrators are trustworthy. He and al-Tabarani also reported it as mawquf from Ibn Mas'ud with a sahih chain.

(The Fourth Harmful Trait: Disputation and Contentious Argument)

[42] The hadith: "Abandon argumentation, for its wisdom is not comprehended and its trial is not safe," was reported by al-Tabarani from the narrations of Abu al-Darda', Abu Umamah, Anas ibn Malik, and Wathilah ibn al-Asqa' with a weak chain, excluding the phrase 'its wisdom is not comprehended.' Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it with this addition, attributed as a *mawquf* statement to Ibn Mas'ud.

[45] The hadith: "No people have ever gone astray except that they were given disputation," was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Umamah and he graded it as sound, adding after it: "from a guidance they were upon."

[46] The hadith: "A servant does not attain the perfection of faith until he abandons argumentation, even if he is in the right," was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the narration of Hisham from 'A'ishah with the wording: "May Allah have mercy on a person who restrains his tongue from the honor of the Muslims." It is interrupted and very weak.

[62] The hadith prohibiting the reviling of the polytheists slain at Badr was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-Baqir as a mursal report, and its narrators are trustworthy. Al-Nasa'i reported it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a sound chain: A man spoke ill of a father of al-'Abbas from the pre-Islamic era, so he slapped him. The hadith includes: "Do not revile our dead, lest you hurt our living."

[63] The hadith "The believer is not one who disparages, nor one who curses, nor one who is foul-mouthed, nor one who is obscene" was reported by al-Tirmidhi with a sound chain from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, who said it is hasan gharib, and he authenticated it. It is also reported as a mawquf statement. Al-Daraqutni said in al-'Ilal that the mawquf version is more sound.

It was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of Shufayy ibn Ma'ni'. There is disagreement regarding his status as a Companion; Abu Nu'aym listed him among the Companions, while al-Bukhari and Ibn Hibban listed him among the Successors.

[66] The hadith "O 'A'ishah, if foulness were a man, he would be an evil man" was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah from Abu al-Nadr from Abu Salamah from her.

[69] The hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah: "Indeed, foulness and obscenity have nothing to do with Islam" was reported by Ahmad and Ibn Abi al-Dunya with a sound chain.

[70] The hadith: A Bedouin said, "Advise me." He replied, "Be mindful of Allah. And if a man reproaches you for something he knows is in you, do not reproach him for something you know is in him." It was reported by Ahmad and al-Tabarani with a good chain from the narration of Abu Juray al-Hujaymi. It is said his name is Jabir ibn Sulaym, and it is said Sulaym ibn Jabir.

[71] The hadith of 'Iyad ibn Himar: I said, "O Messenger of Allah, a man from my people reviles me, and he is inferior to me. Is there any harm if I retaliate against him?" He said, "The two who revile each other are two devils, accusing each other of falsehood and hurling abuse." It was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tayalisi, and its origin is with Ahmad.

[72] The hadith "Reviling a Muslim is wickedness, and fighting him is unbelief" is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.

The two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) agreed upon the second wording from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

(The Eighth Malady: Cursing)

[75] The hadith: "The believer is not one who curses." The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, "The believer is not one who reviles or curses," preceded this by eleven hadiths. And from Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The believer is not a curser."

[76] The hadith: "Do not curse with the curse of Allah." Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud narrated it from the hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub. Tirmidhi said: Good and sound.

[77] The hadith of 'Imran ibn Husayn: While the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was on one of his journeys, a woman from the Ansar was on her she-camel, and it annoyed her, so she cursed it... Muslim narrated it.

[78] The hadith of 'A'ishah: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, heard Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, cursing his servant. He turned to him and said, "O Abu Bakr, cursers and truthful ones?!" Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it in *al-Samt*, and his teacher, Bashshar ibn Musa al-Khaffaf; the majority considered him weak, but Ahmad held a good opinion of him.

[79] The hadith: "The cursers will not be intercessors nor witnesses on the Day of Resurrection." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu al-Darda'.

[80] The hadith of Anas: A man was with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on a camel, and he cursed his camel. He said, "O servant of Allah, do not travel with us on a cursed camel." Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it with a good chain.

[81] The hadith: "O Allah, upon You is Abu Jahl ibn Hisham and 'Utbah ibn Rabi'ah," and he mentioned a group. Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud.

[82] The hadith: That he used to curse those who killed the companions of the Well of Ma'unah in his *qunut* for a month, then the verse was revealed: "Not for you is the decision." The two Shaykhs narrated it from the hadith of Anas: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, supplicated against those who killed the companions of the Well of Ma'unah for thirty mornings... In a narration of theirs: He performed *qunut* for a month, supplicating against Ri'l and Dhakwan... And from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: He used to say when he finished the recitation in the Fajr prayer and said the *takbir* and raised his head... "O Allah, curse Liḥyan and Ri'l..." And in it: Then it reached us that he left that when Allah revealed: "Not for you is the decision," in the wording of Muslim.

[83] The hadith: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, asked Abu Bakr about a grave he passed by while heading to Ta'if. He said, "This is the grave of a man who was insolent towards Allah and His Messenger, and he is Sa'id ibn al-'As." His son became angry... Abu Dawud narrated it in *al-Marasil* from the narration of 'Ali ibn Rabi'ah: When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, conquered Makkah, he proceeded immediately to Ta'if, and with him were Abu Bakr and the two sons of Sa'id ibn al-'As. Abu Bakr said, "Whose grave is this?" They said, "The grave of Sa'id ibn al-'As." Abu Bakr said, "May Allah curse the occupant of this grave, for he used to fight against Allah and His Messenger..." And in it: "When you revile the polytheists, revile them all together."

[84] The hadith: Nu'man drank wine and was punished several times in the gathering of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Some of the Companions said, "May Allah curse him, how often he is brought!" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, "Do not be an aid to Satan against your brother." In another narration: "Do not say this, for he loves Allah and His Messenger." Ibn 'Abd al-Barr narrated it in *al-Isti'ab* from the path of al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar from the narration of Muhammad ibn 'Amr ibn Hazm, *mursal*. This Muhammad was born during his lifetime, peace be upon him, and he named him Muhammad and gave him the *kunya* 'Abd al-Malik. And al-Bukhari has from the hadith of 'Umar: A man during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was named 'Abdullah and was nicknamed "Donkey," and he used to make the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, laugh, and he had been lashed for drinking. He was brought one day and was ordered to be lashed. A man among the people said, "O Allah, curse him, how often he is brought!" The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Do not curse him, for by Allah, I only know that he loves Allah and His Messenger." From the hadith of Abu Hurayrah regarding a man who drank and was not named, and in it: "Do not aid Satan against him." In another narration: "Do not be an aid of Satan against your brother."

[85] The hadith: "No man accuses another of disbelief or accuses him of wickedness except that it returns upon him if his companion is not like that." Agreed upon, and the context is from al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Dharr, with mention of wickedness first.

[86] The hadith: "No man testifies against another of disbelief except that it comes to one of them. If he was a disbeliever, then it is as he said; and if he was not a disbeliever, then he has disbelieved by declaring him a disbeliever." Abu Mansur al-Daylami narrated it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with a weak chain.

[87] The hadith of Mu'adh: "I forbid you from insulting a Muslim or disobeying a just ruler." Abu Nu'aym narrated it in *al-Hilyah* during a long hadith of his.

[88] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "Do not insult the dead, for they have gone to what they have sent forth." Al-Bukhari narrated it, and the author mentioned at its beginning a story concerning 'A'ishah. It is with Ibn al-Mubarak in *al-Zuhd wa al-Raqa'iq* along with the story.

[89] The hadith: "Do not insult the dead, for you hurt the living." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah, and its narrators are trustworthy except that someone inserted between al-Mughirah and Ziyad ibn 'Alaqah a man who was not named.

[90] The hadith: "O people, preserve me concerning my Companions, my brothers, and my in-laws, and do not insult them. O people, when a person dies, mention good about him." Abu Mansur al-Daylami narrated it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of 'Iyad al-Ansari: "Preserve me concerning my Companions and my in-laws," and its chain is weak. And the two Shaykhs have from the hadith of Abu Sa'id and Abu Hurayrah: "Do not insult my Companions." And Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi have, and he said it is rare, from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Mention the good qualities of your dead and refrain from their bad qualities." And al-Nasa'i has from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Do not mention your dead except with good," and its chain is good.

[91] The hadith: A man said, "Advise me." He said, "I advise you not to be a curser." Ahmad, al-Tabarani, and Ibn Abi 'Asim in *al-Ahad* and the second narrated it from the hadith of Jarmuz al-Hujaymi, and in it is a man who was not named; Ibn Abi 'Asim omitted mention of him.

[92] The hadith: "Cursing a believer is like killing him." Agreed upon from the hadith of Thabit ibn al-Dahhak.

[93] The hadith: "The oppressed indeed supplicates against the oppressor until he is recompensed, then there remains for the oppressor a surplus with him on the Day of Resurrection." I have not found an origin for it. And al-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of 'A'ishah with a weak chain: "Whoever supplicates against one who wronged him has taken revenge."

(The Ninth Affliction: Singing and Poetry)

[94

[122] Aisha reported: I imitated a person, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to me, "I would not like that I should imitate anyone, even if I were to receive such and such." (Narrated by Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi, who graded it authentic.)

[123] Abdullah ibn Zam'ah reported: He admonished them regarding laughing at the passing of wind, saying, "Why does one of you laugh at what he himself does?" (Agreed upon.)

[124] A Hadith: Verily, for those who mock people, a gate of Paradise is opened for one of them, and it is said, 'Come forth.' So he comes with his distress and grief. But when he comes, it is closed behind him. (Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in 'Al-Samt' from a mursal narration of Al-Hasan. We also narrated it in 'Tamaniyat al-Najib' from the narration of Abu Hadbah, one of the perished, from Anas.)

[125] Mu'adh ibn Jabal reported: Whoever reproaches his brother for a sin from which he has repented will not die until he commits it. (Narrated by Tirmidhi without the phrase 'from which he has repented,' and he said it is hasan gharib, though its chain is not continuous. Ahmad ibn Mani' said they said, 'for a sin from which he has repented.')

(The Twelfth Detriment: Revealing Secrets)

[126] A narration: When a man relates a narration and then turns away, it is a trust. Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the narration of Jabir.
[127] A narration: Speech between you is a trust. Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of Ibn Shihab, as a mursal report.
(The Thirteenth Affliction: The False Promise)

[128] The hadith "A promise is a gift" was transmitted by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the hadith of Qubath ibn Ashim with a weak chain, and by Abu Nu'aym in al-Hilyah from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud. It was also narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt and by al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq from the hadith of al-Hasan as a mursal report.

[129] The hadith "A promise is like a debt, or better" was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah as a mursal report, and he said "al-wa'y" means a promise. It was also narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of 'Ali with a weak chain.

[130] The hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Abi al-Khansa': "I pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he made me promise to meet him in that same place. I forgot that day and the next. I came to him on the third day, and he was in his place. He said, 'O my son, you have caused me hardship; I have been here for three days waiting for you.'" Narrated by Abu Dawud, and there is disagreement regarding its chain. Ibn Mahdi said, "I do not think Ibrahim ibn Tahman erred in it."

[131] The hadith: "When he made a promise, he would say, 'Perhaps,'" I have not found a basis for it.

[132] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Three traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite..." and in it: "...and when he makes a promise, he breaks it." Agreed upon, and it has been mentioned previously.

[133] The hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "Four traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite..." Agreed upon.

[134] The hadith: "He had promised Abu al-Haytham ibn al-Tayyihan a servant. He was brought three captives, so he gave two away and one remained. Fatimah came asking him for it..." and in it: "...and he kept saying, 'What about my promise to Abu al-Haytham?' So he gave it to him over Fatimah." The story of Abu al-Haytham was mentioned previously in the chapter on the Etiquettes of Eating, and it is found in al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, but it does not mention Fatimah.

[135] The hadith: "He was sitting, distributing the spoils of Hawazin at Hunayn, when a man stood before him and said, 'I have an appointment with you.' He said, 'You speak the truth. Decide as you wish...'" and in it: "...the companion of Moses who directed him to the bones of Joseph was more prudent than you..." Narrated by Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak from the hadith of Abu Musa with some variation. Al-Hakim said its chain is sound, but it is subject to scrutiny.

[136] The hadith: "It is not considered breaking a promise if a man makes a promise to another while intending to fulfill it..." Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who weakened it, from the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam with the second wording, except they said, "...but he did not fulfill it." In another wording: "If a man promises his brother while intending to fulfill it, but he is unable, there is no sin upon him."

(The Fourteenth Vice: Lying in Speech and Oaths)

[137] The narration of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood before us in this very spot of mine a year ago, then wept and said, "Beware of lying in speech." This is reported by Ibn Majah and al-Nasa'i in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*. The author attributes it to the narration of Isma'il ibn Awsat from Abu Bakr, but it is actually Awsat ibn Isma'il ibn Awsat, and its chain is sound.

[138] The narration of Abu Umamah: "Lying is a gate from the gates of hypocrisy." Reported by Ibn 'Adi in *Al-Kamil* with a weak chain, containing 'Umar ibn Musa al-Wajihi, who is very weak. It is sufficiently compensated for by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Three traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite," and the narration, "Four traits, whoever possesses them is a hypocrite," in both of which he said, "...and when he speaks, he lies." Both are in the two *Sahih* collections and have preceded in the preceding vice.

[139] The narration: "It is a great betrayal that you narrate to your brother a speech which he believes from you, while you are lying to him concerning it." Reported by al-Bukhari in *Al-Adab al-Mufrad* and Abu Dawud from the narration of Sufyan ibn Usayd, and Ibn 'Adi weakened it. Ahmad and al-Tabarani reported it from the narration of al-Nawwas ibn Sam'an with a sound chain.

[140] The narration of Ibn Mas'ud: "The servant continues to lie until he is recorded with God as a liar." Agreed upon.

[141] The narration: "He passed by two men trading a sheep and swearing an oath..." In it is: "So he said, 'One of them has made the sin and the expiation obligatory.'" Reported by Abu al-Fath al-Azdi in *Kitab al-Asma' al-Mufradah* from the narration of Nasikh al-Hadrami. We have narrated it thus in the dictations of Ibn Sam'un. Nasikh is mentioned by al-Bukhari thus in *Al-Tarikh*, and Abu Hatim said he is 'Abdullah ibn Nasikh.

[142] The narration: "Lying diminishes provision." Reported by Abu al-Shaykh in *Tabaqat al-Asbahaniyyin* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. We have narrated it likewise in the shaykh-list of al-Qadi Abu Bakr, and its chain is weak.

[143] The narration: "Indeed, the merchants are the wicked..." In it is: "...and they speak and lie." Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Shibl.

[144] The narration: "Three whom God will not speak to on the Day of Resurrection nor look at: the one who reminds of his gift, the one who sells his merchandise by false oath, and the one who lets his lower garment drag." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Dharr.

[145] The narration: "No one swears an oath by God, inserting into it [something false] even like the wing of a mosquito, except that it becomes a stain in his heart until the Day of Resurrection." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Unays.

[146] The narration of Abu Dharr: "Three whom God loves..." In it is: "...and three whom God detests: the merchant or the seller who swears oaths frequently." Reported by Ahmad—the wording is his—and it contains Ibn al-Ahmas, whose condition is unknown. He and al-Nasa'i reported it with another wording with a sound chain. Al-Nasa'i has from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Four whom God hates: the seller who swears oaths..." and its chain is sound.

[147] The narration: "Woe to the one who speaks and lies to make people laugh. Woe to him, woe to him." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*, and al-Nasa'i in *Al-Kubra* from the narration of Yahya ibn Hakim from his father from his grandfather.

[148] The narration: "I saw as if a man came to me and said to me, 'Get up.' So I got up with him, and behold, I was with two men, one standing and the other sitting. In the hand of the standing one was an iron hook which he was thrusting into the mouth of the sitting one..." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Samurah ibn Jundub in a long *hadith*.

[149] The narration of 'Abdullah ibn Jarad: He asked the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "Can a believer commit adultery?" He said, "That can happen from him." He said, "Can he lie?" He said, "No." Reported by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in *Al-Tamhid* with a weak chain. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in *Al-Samt*, restricting it to lying and making the questioner Abu al-Darda'.

[150] The narration of Abu Sa'id: "O God, purify my heart from hypocrisy, my private parts from adultery, and my tongue from lying." This is found in copies of *Al-Ihya'* from Abu Sa'id, but it is actually from Umm Ma'bad. Al-Khatib reported it thus in *Al-Tarikh* without his saying "my private parts from adultery," and he added, "...and my action from ostentation, and my eye from treachery." Its chain is weak.

[151] The narration: "Three whom God will not speak to nor look at..." In it is: "...and the lying leader." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[152] The narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came to our house while I was a small boy. I went to play, and my mother said, "O 'Abdullah, come so I may give you." He said, "What did you intend to give him?" She said, "A date." He said, "If you do not do it, a lie will be recorded against you." Reported by Abu Dawud, and it contains an unnamed narrator. Al-Hakim said that 'Abdullah ibn 'Amir was born during his lifetime, peace and blessings be upon him, and did not hear from him. I say: It has a supporting narration from the narration of Abu Hurayrah and Ibn Mas'ud, and their narrators are trustworthy, except that al-Zuhri did not hear from Abu Hurayrah.

[153] The narration: "If God were to bestow upon me wealth the number of these pebbles, I would distribute it among you, then you would not find me miserly, nor a liar, nor cowardly." Reported by Muslim and has preceded in the chapter on the morals of prophethood.

[154] The narration: "Shall I not inform you of the greatest of the major sins?" In it is: "Indeed, and bearing false witness." Agreed upon from the narration of Abu Bakrah.

[155] The narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Indeed, the servant tells a lie, and because of the foulness of what he has brought, the angel distances himself from him by a distance of a mile." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan gharib*.

[156] The narration of Anas: "Bring me six things, and I will bring you Paradise: When one of you speaks, let him not lie..." Reported by al-Hakim in *Al-Mustadrak* and al-Khara'iti in *Makarin al-Akhlaq*. It contains Sa'd ibn Sinan, whom Ahmad and al-Nasa'i weakened, but Ibn Ma'in declared him trustworthy. Al-Hakim reported something similar from the narration of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit and said its chain is sound.

[157] The narration: "Indeed, Satan has kohl and a sweet paste..." Reported by al-Tabarani and Abu Nu'aym from the narration of Anas with a weak chain, and it has preceded.

[158] The narration: "'Umar delivered a sermon at al-Jabiyah..." In it is: "...then lying becomes widespread." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it, and al-Nasa'i in *Al-Kubra* from the narration of Ibn 'Umar from 'Umar.

[161

[183] The hadith: "Every Muslim is sacred to another Muslim: his blood, his wealth, and his honor," was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[184] The hadith: "Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not backbite one another, and be servants of God as brothers," is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, except for the phrase "do not backbite one another," which was mentioned earlier in the chapter on the Etiquette of Companionship.

[185] The hadith of Jabir and Abu Sa'id: "Beware of backbiting, for backbiting is more severe than fornication," was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt*, Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa'*, and Ibn Mardawayh in *al-Tafsir*.

[186] The hadith of Anas: "On the night I was taken on the Night Journey, I passed by people who were scratching their faces with their fingernails," was narrated by Abu Dawud with a connected chain (*musnad*) and a broken chain (*mursal*), and the connected chain is more sound.

[187] The hadith of Sulaym ibn Jabir: "I came to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and said, 'Teach me something good by which God will benefit me,'" was narrated by Ahmad in *al-Musnad* and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt* with this wording, which is his. Ahmad did not include in it, "and when he turns away, do not backbite him." There is weakness in the chains of both.

[188] The hadith of al-Bara': "O you who believe with your tongues but not with your hearts, do not backbite the Muslims," was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya as such, and Abu Dawud narrated it in the hadith of Abu Barzah with a good chain.

[189] The hadith of Anas: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) commanded the people to fast and said, 'Let no one break his fast until I give him permission.' So the people fasted," is in the story of the two women who backbit during their fast, and each of them vomited a clot of blood. It was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt* and Ibn Mardawayh in *al-Tafsir* from the narration of Yazid al-Raqashi from him, and Yazid is weak.

[190] The hadith about the two aforementioned women, stating: "These two fasted from what God made lawful for them and broke their fast on what God made unlawful for them," was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of 'Ubayd, the freed slave of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). In it is a man who was not named. Abu Ya'la narrated it in his *Musnad*, omitting the mention of the man in question.

[191] The hadith of Anas: "He preached to us and mentioned usury and the gravity of its matter," and in it is, "and the worst usury is violating the honor of a Muslim man," was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya with a weak chain.

[192] The hadith of Jabir: "We were with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) on a journey when he came upon two graves whose occupants were being punished. He said, 'They are being punished, and they are not being punished for something major. As for one of them, he used to backbite people,'" was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt* and Abu al-'Abbas al-Daghuli in *Kitab al-Adab* with a good chain. It is in the two *Sahih* collections from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, except that it mentions tale-bearing (*namimah*) instead of backbiting. Al-Tayalisi has in his version, "As for one of them, he used to eat the flesh of people." Ahmad and al-Tabarani have a similar narration from the hadith of Ibn Bukayrah with a good chain.

[193] The hadith concerning his saying to the man who said to his companion regarding the stoned man, 'This one is crushed like a dog is crushed,' and then he passed by a carcass and said, 'Bite from it,'" was narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i from a hadith of Abu Hurayrah, similar to it, with a good chain.

[194] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever eats the flesh of his brother in this world will have his flesh brought near to him in the Hereafter, and it will be said to him, 'Eat it dead as you ate it alive,'" was narrated by Ibn Mardawayh in *al-Tafsir* as both elevated (*marfu'*) and stopped (*mawquf*). In it is Muhammad ibn Ishaq, who narrated it with *'an'ana*.

[195] The hadith: "A woman was mentioned to him who fasted and prayed much, but she used to harm her neighbors. He said, 'She is in the Fire,'" was narrated by Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Another woman was mentioned in his presence as being miserly, and he said, "Then what good is she?" This hadith...

[196] ...was narrated by al-Khara'iti in *Makarin al-Akhlaq* from the hadith of Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Ali as *mursal*, and we narrated it in the *Amali* of Ibn Sha'mun as such.

[197] The hadith: "Do you know what backbiting is?" They said, "God and His Messenger know best." He said, "Mentioning your brother with what he dislikes," was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[198] The hadith of Mu'adh: "A man was mentioned, and the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) frowned. They said, 'What has incapacitated him?'" was narrated by al-Tabarani with a weak chain.

[199] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "She mentioned a woman and said, 'She is short.' He said, 'You have backbitten her.'" Ahmad narrated it, and its origin is with Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it with another wording. In the author's work, it is from Hudhayfah from 'A'ishah, and likewise it is in *al-Samt* of Ibn Abi al-Dunya. The correct version is from Abu Hudhayfah, as in Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and al-Tirmidhi. The name of Abu Hudhayfah is Salamah ibn Suhayb.

[200] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "I said to a woman, 'And this one has a long train (on her garment).' He (peace be upon him) said, 'Spit it out.' So she spat out a piece of flesh." It was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya and Ibn Mardawayh in *al-Tafsir*. In its chain is a woman I do not know.

[201] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "A woman entered upon us, and I gestured with my hand, meaning she is short. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'You have backbitten her.'" It was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya and Ibn Mardawayh from the narration of Hassan ibn Mukhariq from her. Ibn Hibban declared Hassan trustworthy, and the rest are reliable.

[202] The hadith: "It would not please me that I should relate and I have such-and-such," was mentioned earlier in the Eleventh Affliction.

[203] The hadith: "When he disliked something about a person, he would say, 'What is the matter with people who do such-and-such?'" was narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'A'ishah, without the phrase "and he would not reproach him." Its narrators are narrators of the *Sahih*.

[204] The hadith: "The listener is one of the backbiters," was narrated by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) forbade backbiting and listening to backbiting." It is weak.

[205] The hadith: "Abu Bakr and 'Umar, one of them said to his companion, 'So-and-so is a heavy sleeper.' Then they sought some condiment from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). He said, 'You have already taken your condiment.' They said, 'We do not know.' He said, 'Yes, you ate the flesh of your companion.'" It was narrated by Abu al-'Abbas al-Daghuli in *al-Adab* from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla, as *mursal*, similar to it.

[206] The

[214] The saying "He who guards against his Lord regarding all his tongue and does not quench his rage" — reported by Abu Mansur Al-Daylami in Musnad Al-Firdaws from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd with a weak chain; and we have narrated it in Al-Arba'in Al-Baladaniyah by Al-Silafi.

[215] The saying "He who suppresses his rage while capable of acting upon it..." — reported by Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi who graded it as good (hasan), and Ibn Majah from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas.

[216] The saying "Verily, God has made inviolable for a Muslim his blood, his wealth, and that evil suspicion be held against him" — reported by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain; and Ibn Majah has something similar from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[217] The saying "Three things are in the believer, yet he has an escape from them" — reported by Al-Tabarani from the narration of Harithah ibn Al-Nu'man with a weak chain.

[218] The saying "The Law rejects the testimony of a just parent and the testimony of an enemy" — reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'A'ishah and he deemed it weak: "The testimony of a treacherous man or a treacherous woman is not permissible, nor of one lashed for a prescribed punishment, nor of one bearing rancor against his brother." And in it: "Nor of one suspected in matters of clientage or kinship." And Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah reported with a sound chain from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, rejected the testimony of the treacherous man, the treacherous woman, and one bearing rancor against his brother.

[223] The saying "Do you refrain from mentioning the wicked? Expose him so that people may know him. Mention him for what is in him to warn the people" — reported by Al-Tabarani, Ibn Hibban in Al-Du'afa', and Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Bahz ibn Hakim, from his father, from his grandfather, without the phrase "so that people may know him." And Ibn Abi Al-Dunya reported it with this addition in Al-Samt.

[224] The saying "He who casts off the cloak of modesty has no backbiting against him" — reported by Ibn 'Adi and Abu Al-Shaykh in the book Thawab Al-A'mal from the narration of Anas with a weak chain, and it has preceded.

[225] The saying "The expiation for one you have backbitten is that you seek forgiveness for him" — reported by Ibn Abi Al-Dunya in Al-Samt and Al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his Musnad from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

When he would leave his house, he would say: 'O God, I have given my honor in charity to the people'" — reported by Al-Bazzar, Ibn Al-Sunni in Al-Yawm wa Al-Laylah, and Al-'Uqayli in Al-Du'afa' from the narration of Anas with a weak chain. Ibn 'Abd Al-Barr mentioned it from the narration of Thabit as a mursal report when mentioning Abu Damdam among the Companions. I say: He is but a man from among those who came before us, as in the reports of Al-Bazzar and Al-'Uqayli.

[228] The saying regarding the revelation of the verse "Hold to forgiveness..." [Qur'an 7:199] — He (the Prophet) said: "O Gabriel, what is this?" He said: "God commands you to pardon whoever wronged you, maintain ties with whoever cut you off, and give to whoever deprived you." This has preceded in the chapter on Spiritual Discipline.

[229] A talebearer shall not enter Paradise. In another narration: a slanderer. Agreed upon from the narration of Hudhayfah, and it has preceded.

[230] The narration of Abu Hurayrah: "The most beloved of you to Allah are the best of you in character, those who are accommodating and gentle." Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat and al-Saghir, and it has preceded in the chapter on the Etiquette of Companionship.

[231] The narration: "Shall I not inform you of the worst among you?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Those who go about with slander..." The hadith is reported by Ahmad from the narration of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari, and it has preceded.

[232] The narration of Abu Dharr: "Whoever spreads a word about a Muslim to disgrace him with it without right, Allah will disgrace him with it in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt* and al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*. In its chain is 'Abdullah ibn Maymun; if he is al-Qaddah, then he is abandoned in narration.

[233] The narration of Abu al-Darda': "Any man who spreads about another man a word from which he is innocent, to disgrace him with it in this world, it is incumbent upon Allah to melt him with it in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya as a statement stopped at Abu al-Darda' (mawquf), and al-Tabarani reported it with another wording, raised to the Prophet (marfu'), from his narration, and it has preceded.

[234] The narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever bears witness against a Muslim with testimony for which he is not qualified, let him take his abode in the Fire." Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Abi al-Dunya. In Ahmad's version is a man not named, whom Ibn Abi al-Dunya omitted from the chain.

[235] The narration of Ibn 'Umar: "When Allah created Paradise, He said to it, 'Speak.' It said, 'Fortunate is he who enters me.' The Almighty said, 'By My Might and My Majesty, eight shall not dwell in you.' He mentioned among them, '...nor a *qattāt*,' which is a talebearer. I have not found it complete like this. Ahmad has: 'Shall not enter Paradise one who is disobedient to his parents, nor a cuckold.' Al-Nasa'i has from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: 'Shall not enter Paradise one who reminds others of his favors, nor one disobedient to parents, nor an addict to wine.' The two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) have from the narration of Hudhayfah: 'A talebearer shall not enter Paradise.' And they both have from the narration of Jubayr ibn Mut'im: 'A severer of kinship ties shall not enter Paradise.' The author of *al-Firdaws* reported from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: 'When Allah created Paradise, He said to it, "Speak and adorn yourself." So it adorned itself and said, "Blessed is he who enters me and with whom my Lord is pleased." Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said, "No effeminate man shall dwell in you, nor a professional wailing woman."'"

[236] The narration: "Among the worst of people is he whom people fear on account of his evil." Agreed upon from a narration of 'A'ishah, similar to it.

[237] The narration: "A severer of kinship ties shall not enter Paradise." Agreed upon from the narration of Jubayr ibn Mut'im.

[238] The narration: "One who goes between people for other than a righteous purpose." Reported by al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Musa: "Whoever goes between people does so for other than a righteous purpose, or there is something of that in it." And he said to him, "The chains of this—are their best ones?" I said, "In it is Sahl ibn 'Atiyyah." Ibn Tahir said in *al-Tadhkirah*: "His narration is rejected (munkar al-riwayah)." He said, "And the hadith has no basis." Ibn Hibban mentioned Sahl ibn 'Atiyyah in *al-Thiqat*. Al-Tabarani reported it with the wording: "None goes between people except a child of fornication, or one in whom there is a trace of it." And he added between Sahl and Bilal ibn Abi Burdah: Abu al-Walid al-Qurashi.

(The Seventeenth Affliction)

[239] The hadith of 'Ammar ibn Yasir: Whoever has two faces in this world will have two tongues of fire on the Day of Resurrection. Reported by al-Bukhari in *al-Adab al-Mufrad* and Abu Dawud with a *hasan* chain.

[240] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: You will find among the worst of Allah's servants on the Day of Resurrection the one with two faces... The hadith is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*). Al-Bukhari's wording is: "You will find among the worst of people..." It is found in Ibn Abi al-Dunya with the wording of the compiler.

[241] The hadith: The most hateful of Allah's creatures to Allah on the Day of Resurrection are the liars, the arrogant, and those who harbor much hatred for their brothers in their hearts, yet when they meet them, they flatter them. I have not found a source for it.

[242] The hadith: It was said to Ibn 'Umar, "We enter upon our rulers and say one thing, but when we leave, we say something else." He said, "We used to consider that hypocrisy during the time of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)." Reported by al-Tabarani through various chains.

[243] The hadith: Love of status and wealth cause hypocrisy to grow in the heart just as water causes plants to grow. Reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from a hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain, except that he said "love of singing" and said "grass" instead of "plants."

[244] The hadith of 'A'ishah: A man sought permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He said, "Grant him permission, for how evil a man of the tribe he is!" ...In it: "The worst of people is he whom people honor out of fear of his evil." Agreed upon. It has preceded in the preceding affliction.

(The Eighteenth Affliction: Praise)

[245] The hadith: A man praised another man in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He said, "Woe to you! You have severed the neck of your companion." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Bakrah in a similar manner. It is in *al-Samt* by Ibn Abi al-Dunya with the compiler's wording.

[246] The hadith: Allah becomes angry when a wicked person is praised. Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Samt* and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from a hadith of Anas. In its chain is Abu Khalaf, the servant of Anas, who is weak. Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili and Ibn 'Adi reported it with the wording: "When a wicked person is praised, the Lord becomes angry and the Throne trembles." Al-Dhahabi said in *al-Mizan*: "Disapproved (*munkar*)." It has preceded in the etiquettes of earning.

[247] The hadith: If you praise your brother to his face, it is as if you have passed a sharp razor over his throat. Reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in *al-Zuhd wa al-Raqa'iq* from the narration of Yahya ibn Jabir, *mursal*.

[248] The hadith: "May Allah cripple you as you have crippled the man." He said this to one who praised a man. I have not found a source for it.

[249] The hadith: If a man were to walk to another with a sharp knife, it would be better for him than to praise him to his face. I have not found it either.

[250] The hadith: If the faith of Abu Bakr were weighed against the faith of all people, it would outweigh it. It has preceded in the chapter on knowledge.

[251] The hadith: "If I had not been sent, you would have been sent, O 'Umar." Reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from a hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and it is disapproved (*munkar*). The well-known hadith from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir is: "If there were to be a prophet after me, it would be 'Umar ibn al-Khattab." Reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*.

[252] The hadith: "I am the master of the children of Adam, and I do not say this out of pride." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from a hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Al-Hakim reported it from a hadith of Jabir and said its chain is sound (*sahih*). From a hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: "I am the master of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and I do not say this out of pride." In Muslim, from a hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "I am the master of the children of Adam on the Day of Resurrection."

[257] The hadith: A man spoke before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "Whoever obeys God and His Messenger has been rightly guided, and whoever disobeys them has gone astray." Reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'Adi ibn Hatim.
