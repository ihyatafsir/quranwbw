The Book of the Etiquettes of Reciting the Qur'an
                      Being the Eighth Book of the Quarter of Worship
                           In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
   Praise be to God, who has bestowed favor upon His servants through His sent Prophet and His revealed Book, which falsehood cannot approach from before it or behind it, a revelation from the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. So vast has the path of reflection become for the people of thought through what it contains of narratives and reports, and so clear has the traversing of the straight path and the upright way become through what is detailed within it of rulings, distinguishing between the lawful and the unlawful. It is the illumination and the light, and through it is salvation from delusion, and within it is healing for what is in the breasts. Whosoever opposes it from among the tyrants, God will break him, and whosoever seeks knowledge elsewhere, God will lead him astray. It is the firm rope of God, His manifest light, the surest handhold, and the most faithful refuge. It encompasses the little and the much, the small and the great. Its wonders do not cease, nor are its marvels exhausted. Its benefits cannot be encompassed by definition among the people of knowledge, nor is it worn out by much repetition among the people of recitation. It is that which guided the former and the latter peoples. When the jinn heard it, they did not tarry before returning to their people as warners, saying, "Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an, guiding to right conduct, so we have believed in it. And we will never associate anyone with our Lord." So, whoever believes in it has been granted success; whoever speaks by it has spoken truthfully; whoever holds fast to it has been guided; and whoever acts by it has triumphed. And God, exalted is He, said: "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Remembrance, and indeed, We will be its guardian." Among the causes of its preservation in hearts and in copies is the continuity of its recitation and the perseverance in its study, along with upholding its etiquettes and conditions, and safeguarding what it contains of inward deeds and outward manners. This necessitates its explanation and detailing, and its objectives are unveiled in four chapters. Chapter One: On the excellence of the Qur'an and its people. Chapter Two: On the outward etiquettes of recitation. Chapter Three: On the inward deeds during recitation. Chapter Four: On understanding the Qur'an and interpreting it by opinion and otherwise.
          (Chapter One: On the excellence of the Qur'an and its people, and censure of those negligent in its recitation)
                               (The Excellence of the Qur'an)
   He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever recites the Qur'an and then thinks that anyone has been given better than what he has been given has certainly belittled what God, exalted is He, has magnified." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no intercessor of a higher station with God, exalted is He, than the Qur'an—not a prophet, nor an angel, nor anyone else." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If the Qur'an were in a hide, fire would not touch it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best worship of my community is the recitation of the Qur'an." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, also said: "God, mighty and majestic, recited Ta-Ha and Ya-Sin a thousand years before He created creation. When the angels heard the Qur'an, they said, 'Blessed is a community upon whom this is sent down, blessed are the hearts that carry this, and blessed are the tongues that utter this.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best of you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God, blessed and exalted, says, 'Whoever is occupied with reciting the Qur'an from supplicating to Me and asking of Me, I will give him the best reward of the thankful.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Three on the Day of Resurrection will be upon a dune of black musk; terror will not dismay them, nor will reckoning reach them until judgment is passed among the people: a man who recited the Qur'an seeking the Countenance of God, mighty and majestic, and an imam who led a people and they were pleased with him." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The people of the Qur'an are the people of God and His chosen ones." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, hearts rust just as iron rusts." It was said, "O Messenger of God, and what is their polish?" He said, "The recitation of the Qur'an and the remembrance of death." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God is more attentive to the reciter of the Qur'an than the owner of a singing girl is to his singing girl."
Narrations: Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: "Recite the Qur'an, and do not be deceived by these copies hanging [on walls], for God does not punish a heart that is a vessel for the Qur'an." Ibn Mas'ud said: "If you desire knowledge, then scatter the Qur'an [i.e., seek it therein], for indeed within it is the knowledge of the former and the latter peoples." He also said: "Recite the Qur'an, for you are rewarded for it with ten good deeds for every letter. I do not say that 'Alif Lam Mim' is one letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter, and Mim is a letter." He also said: "Let none of you be asked about himself except by the Qur'an. If he loves the Qur'an and is pleased with it, then he loves God, glorious and sublime, and His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him. And if he hates the Qur'an, then he hates God, glorious and sublime, and His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him." 'Amr ibn al-'As said: "Every verse in the Qur'an is a degree in Paradise and a lamp in your houses." He also said: "Whoever recites the Qur'an has had prophethood placed between his sides, except that revelation is not sent to him." Abu Hurayrah said: "Indeed, the house in which the Qur'an is recited expands for its inhabitants, its goodness increases, the angels attend it, and the devils depart from it. And indeed, the house in which the Book of God, mighty and majestic, is not recited becomes constricted for its inhabitants, its goodness diminishes, and the angels depart from it."

And the devils were present in his company. Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I saw God, the Almighty, in a dream, and I said, "O Lord, what is the best means by which those who draw near seek closeness to You?" He said, "Through My speech, O Ahmad." I said, "O Lord, with understanding or without understanding?" He said, "With understanding and without understanding." And Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi said: When people hear the Qur'an from God, the Almighty, on the Day of Resurrection, it will be as if they had never heard it before. And al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said: It behooves the bearer of the Qur'an to have no need of anyone, nor of the caliphs nor those below them. Rather, the needs of creation should be directed to him. He also said: The bearer of the Qur'an is the bearer of the banner of Islam; therefore, it is not fitting for him to engage in frivolity with those who are frivolous, nor to be heedless with those who are heedless, nor to indulge in idle talk with those who do so, out of reverence for the sanctity of the Qur'an. And Sufyan al-Thawri said: When a man recites the Qur'an, an angel is placed between his eyes. And 'Amr ibn Maymun said: Whoever opens a copy of the Qur'an at the time of the morning prayer and recites one hundred verses from it, God, the Almighty, will elevate for him the equivalent of the deeds of all the people of the world. And it is related that Khalid ibn 'Uqbah came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, "Recite the Qur'an to me." So he recited to him, {"Indeed, God commands justice, good conduct, and giving to relatives..."} [the verse]. He said to him, "Repeat it." So he repeated it, and he said, "By God, it possesses sweetness and bears freshness; its lower part is verdant and its upper part is fruitful. No human says this." And al-Hasan said: By God, there is no sufficiency apart from the Qur'an, and no poverty after it. And al-Fudayl said: Whoever recites the conclusion of Surah al-Hashr in the morning and then dies that day, he will be sealed with the stamp of the martyrs. And whoever recites it in the evening and then dies that night, he will be sealed with the stamp of the martyrs. And al-Qasim ibn 'Abd al-Rahman said: I said to one of the ascetics, "Is there anyone here with whom we can find companionship?" He stretched out his hand to the Qur'an, placed it on his lap, and said, "This one." And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, said: Three things increase memory and dispel phlegm: the toothstick, fasting, and reciting the Qur'an.

(On the censure of the recitation of the heedless)
Anas ibn Malik said: Many a reciter of the Qur'an is cursed by the Qur'an. And Maysarah al-Gharib said: It is the Qur'an in the belly of the wicked. And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: The angels of punishment are swifter to the bearers of the Qur'an who disobey God, the Almighty, than they are to the idol-worshippers when they disobeyed God, the Glorified, after the Qur'an. And one of the scholars said: When a son of Adam recites the Qur'an, then mixes [his deeds], then returns and recites, it is said to him, "What is wrong with you and My speech?" And Ibn al-Rummah said: I regretted memorizing the Qur'an because it reached me that the companions of the Qur'an will be questioned about that which the prophets are questioned on the Day of Resurrection. And Ibn Mas'ud said: It behooves the bearer of the Qur'an to be known by his night when people are asleep, and by his day when people are negligent, and by his sorrow when people are joyful, and by his weeping when people laugh, and by his silence when people engage in idle talk, and by his humility when people are arrogant. And it behooves the bearer of the Qur'an to be humble and gentle; it is not fitting for him to be harsh, nor quarrelsome, nor a shouter, nor a clamorous one, nor sharp-tempered. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The most hypocritical among this nation are its reciters." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Recite the Qur'an as long as it restrains you; for if it does not restrain you, then you are not reciting it." And he, peace be upon him, said: "He has not believed in the Qur'an who makes lawful what it has forbidden." And some of the predecessors said: Indeed, a servant may begin a chapter, and the angels invoke blessings upon him until he finishes it. And indeed, a servant may begin a chapter, and it curses him until he finishes it. It was said to him: "How is that?" He said: If he makes lawful its lawful and forbids its forbidden, they invoke blessings upon him; otherwise, it curses him. And some of the scholars said: Indeed, a servant may recite the Qur'an and curse himself without knowing it, saying, "Indeed, the curse of God is upon the wrongdoers," while he is wronging himself; "Indeed, the curse of God is upon the liars," while he is among them. And al-Hasan said: You have taken the recitation of the Qur'an as stages and made the night a camel, which you ride to traverse those stages. But those before you considered it messages from their Lord, so they would ponder them by night and implement them by day. And Ibn Mas'ud said: The Qur'an was sent down to them so that they might act upon it, but they took its study as the action. Indeed, one of you may recite the Qur'an from its beginning to its end without dropping a single letter, yet he has dropped acting upon it. And in the narration of Ibn 'Umar and the narration of Jundub, may God be pleased with them both: "We lived for a long time, and one of us would be given faith before the Qur'an. Then a chapter would be revealed to Muhammad, peace be upon him, and we would learn its lawful and unlawful, its commands and prohibitions, and where one ought to pause in it. Then I have seen men to whom the Qur'an is given before faith, so he recites from the opening of the Book to its end without knowing what it commands him, what it prohibits him, or where he ought to pause in it, scattering it like the scattering of dry dates." The narration of Ibn 'Umar and Jundub: "We lived for an age, and one of us would be given faith before the Qur'an..." the narration.

They preceded in knowledge, and it has been reported in the Torah: O My servant, are you not ashamed before Me? A letter comes to you from one of your brothers while you are walking on the road, so you turn aside from the path and sit down for its sake, reading it and pondering it letter by letter so that nothing of it escapes you. And this is My Book which I have sent down to you—look how many discourses I have elaborated for you therein, and how often I have repeated it to you so that you might contemplate its length and breadth. Yet you turn away from it. Was I, then, of less importance to you than some of your brothers? O My servant, one of your brothers sits with you and you turn to him with your whole countenance and listen to his speech with your whole heart. If someone speaks or some distraction occupies you from his speech, you signal to them to be silent. And here am I, turning to you and speaking to you, while you turn your heart away from Me. Did you make Me of less importance to you than some of your brothers?

(Chapter Two: On the Outward Etiquettes of Recitation)
They are ten: The first concerns the state of the reciter: It is that he be in a state of ablution, standing in a posture of reverence and stillness, either standing or sitting, facing the direction of prayer, with his head lowered, not sitting cross-legged, nor reclining, nor sitting in a posture of arrogance. His sitting alone should be like his sitting before his teacher. The best state is to recite while standing in prayer and to be in the mosque, for that is among the best of deeds. If he recites without ablution while lying in bed, he also has merit, but it is less than that. Allah the Exalted said: "Those who remember Allah standing, sitting, and on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth..." He praised them all but gave precedence to remembrance while standing, then sitting, then remembrance while reclining. Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Whoever recites the Quran while standing in prayer, for every letter he receives a hundred good deeds. Whoever recites it while sitting in prayer, for every letter he receives fifty good deeds. Whoever recites it outside of prayer while in a state of ablution receives twenty-five good deeds. And whoever recites it without ablution receives ten good deeds." What is done by standing at night is best, for it is more freeing for the heart. Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Indeed, abundant prostration by day and prolonged standing by night are superior."

The second concerns the amount of Quran: Reciters have different customs regarding abundance and brevity. Among them are those who complete the Quran once in a day and night, some twice, and some have reached three. Among them are those who complete it once a month. The most appropriate reference for these estimations is the saying of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: "Whoever recites the Quran in less than three days has not comprehended it." This is because exceeding that prevents proper measured recitation. Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said when she heard a man rushing through the Quran hastily: "This one has neither recited the Quran nor remained silent." The Prophet, peace be upon him, instructed Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, to complete the Quran every seven days. Likewise, a group of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, used to complete the Quran every week, such as Uthman, Zayd ibn Thabit, Ibn Mas'ud, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b, may Allah be pleased with them. In completion, there are four levels: Completion in a day and night, which a group disliked; completion every month, a part each day from thirty parts, which seems an extreme in brevity just as the first is an extreme in abundance; and between them are two moderate levels: one is once a week, and the second is approximately twice in three weeks. It is beloved to complete one recitation by night and one by day, making his daytime completion on Monday in the two rak'ahs of Fajr or after them, and making his nighttime completion on the night of Friday in the two rak'ahs of Maghrib or after them, so that he faces the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night with his completion. For the angels, peace be upon them, pray upon him if his completion is at night until morning, and if by day until evening, so their blessing encompasses all of night and day. The detail regarding the amount of recitation is that if he is among the worshippers traversing the path of action, he should not fall below two completions per week. If he is among those traversing through the works of the heart and modes of reflection, or among those occupied with spreading knowledge, it is acceptable to limit himself to once a week. If his thought penetrates the meanings of the Quran, he may suffice with once a month due to his great need for much repetition and contemplation.

The third concerns the manner of division: As for one who completes it once a week, he divides the Quran into seven sections. The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, divided it into sections. It is narrated that Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, would begin on the night of Friday with Al-Baqarah to Al-Ma'idah, on the night of Saturday with Al-An'am to Hud, on the night of Sunday with Yusuf to Maryam, on the night of Monday with Ta-Ha to Taha, Musa, and Fir'awn, on the night of Tuesday with Al-'Ankabut to Sad, on the night of Wednesday with Al-Tanzil to Al-Rahman, and would complete on the night of Thursday. Ibn Mas'ud would divide it...

The divisions are not in this order, and it is said that the Qur'an is divided into seven sections. The first section comprises three surahs, the second five surahs, the third seven surahs, the fourth nine surahs, the fifth eleven surahs, the sixth thirteen surahs, and the seventh is the detailed portion from Qaf to the end. Thus did the Companions, may God be pleased with them, divide it, and they would recite it accordingly. There is a report concerning this from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. This was before the divisions into fifths, tenths, and parts were established; anything besides this is an innovation.

Fourth, concerning writing: It is recommended to beautify the script of the Qur'an and make it clear. There is no harm in using dots and marks in red or other colors, for they are an adornment and clarification, and they prevent error and mispronunciation for the one who recites. Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin used to disapprove of the divisions into fifths, tenths, and parts. It is reported from al-Sha'bi and Ibrahim a dislike for red dots and for taking payment for that. They used to say, "Keep the Qur'an plain." The opinion concerning them is that they disliked opening this door, fearing it might lead to introducing additions, and to close the door, and out of zeal to guard the Qur'an from any change that might approach it. However, if it does not lead to a prohibition and the consensus of the community is established upon what increases understanding, then there is no harm in it. Its being an innovation does not prevent it, for how many innovations are good, as was said concerning establishing congregations for the Tarawih prayers that they are from the innovations of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, and that they are a good innovation. Indeed, the blameworthy innovation is that which contradicts the ancient Sunnah or nearly leads to changing it. Some used to say, "I recite from a dotted copy of the Qur'an, but I do not dot it myself." Al-Awza'i reported from Yahya ibn Abi Kathir that the Qur'an was plain in the copies, and the first thing they innovated in it was dots on the ba' and ta', and they said there is no harm in it, for it is a light for it. Then after that they innovated large dots at the end of verses, and they said there is no harm in it, for by it the head of the verse is known. Then after that they innovated the endings and beginnings. Abu Bakr al-Hadhali said: I asked al-Hasan about dotting the copies with red. He said, "And what is dotting them?" I said, "They parse the word with Arabic." He said, "As for parsing the Qur'an, there is no harm in it." Khalid al-Hadhdha' said: I entered upon Ibn Sirin and saw him reciting from a dotted copy, though he used to dislike dots. It is said that al-Hajjaj was the one who innovated that, and he gathered the reciters until they counted the words and letters of the Qur'an, standardized its parts, and divided it into thirty parts and other divisions.

Fifth, measured recitation: This is recommended in the manner of reciting the Qur'an, for we will show that the purpose of recitation is reflection, and measured recitation is an aid to that. For this reason, Umm Salamah, may God be pleased with her, described the recitation of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, as being clearly articulated letter by letter. Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "That I recite al-Baqarah and Al 'Imran with measured recitation and contemplation is more beloved to me than reciting the Qur'an hastily." He also said: "That I recite 'Idha zulzilat' and 'al-Qari'ah' with contemplation is more beloved to me than reciting al-Baqarah and Al 'Imran hastily." Mujahid was asked about two men who entered prayer, and their standing was equal except that one recited only al-Baqarah and the other recited the entire Qur'an. He said, "They are equal in reward." Know that measured recitation is recommended not merely for contemplation, for the non-Arab who does not understand the meaning of the Qur'an is also recommended to recite with measured recitation and deliberation, because that is closer to veneration and respect and has a stronger effect on the heart than hasty and rushed recitation.

Sixth, weeping: Weeping is recommended during recitation. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Recite the Qur'an and weep. If you do not weep, then make as if weeping." And he, peace be upon him, said: "He is not from us who does not chant the Qur'an." Salih al-Murri said: "I recited the Qur'an to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in a dream. He said to me: 'O Salih, this is the recitation, but where is the weeping?'" Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "When you recite the prostration verse of 'Subhan', do not hasten to prostrate until you weep. If one of you does not weep with his eye, then let his heart weep." The way to induce weeping is to bring grief to one's heart, for from grief arises weeping. He, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, the Qur'an was revealed with grief, so when you recite it, then grieve." The method of bringing grief is to contemplate what it contains of threat and warning, covenants and promises, then to contemplate one's own shortcomings regarding its commands and prohibitions. He will inevitably grieve and weep. If grief and weeping do not come to him as they come to the possessors of pure hearts, then let him weep over the absence of grief and weeping, for that is the greatest of calamities.

Seventh, that one observes the rights of the verses: When he comes upon a verse of prostration, he prostrates. Likewise, if he hears a prostration verse from another, he prostrates if the one reciting prostrates. He should not prostrate except in a state of purity. In the Qur'an there are fourteen prostrations, and in al-Hajj there are two prostrations. There is no prostration in Sad. The minimum is to prostrate by placing his forehead on...

The most complete manner is to recite the takbir, then prostrate and supplicate in the prostration with what is fitting for the verse he has recited. For example, if he recites the words of the Exalted: "They fell down prostrate, weeping, and it increased them in humility," he should say: O Allah, make me among those who prostrate to Your Countenance, glorifying You with Your praise, and I seek refuge in You from being among those who are too arrogant to obey Your command or to humble themselves before Your allies. And if he recites the words of the Exalted: "And they fall down upon their faces weeping, and it increases them in humility," he should say: O Allah, make me among those who weep to You, humble before You. And so for every prostration. The conditions for this prostration are the same as the conditions for prayer: covering the private parts, facing the qiblah, and purity of the garment and body from ritual impurity and filth. Whoever is not in a state of purity upon hearing it should prostrate after he has purified himself. It has been said concerning its perfection that he says the takbir raising his hands for the opening, then says the takbir for descending to prostration, then says the takbir for rising, then gives the salutation. Some have added the tashahhud, but there is no basis for this except analogy to the prostration of prayer, and that is far-fetched, for the command regarding prostration has been conveyed, so it should be followed. The takbir for descending is closest to the beginning, and anything beyond that is remote. Then, the follower should prostrate when the imam prostrates, and he should not prostrate for his own recitation if he is a follower.

The eighth is to say at the beginning of his recitation: I seek refuge in Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan. "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the whisperings of the devils. And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me." And let him recite: "Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind," and the Opening Chapter of the Book, and let him say upon completing his recitation: Allah, the Exalted, has spoken the truth, and His Messenger has conveyed it. O Allah, benefit us by it and bless us in it. All praise is to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and I seek forgiveness from Allah, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. And during the recitation, if he passes by a verse of glorification, he should glorify and magnify; if he passes by a verse of supplication and seeking forgiveness, he should supplicate and seek forgiveness; if he passes by a verse of hope, he should ask; if he passes by a verse of fear, he should seek refuge. He should do this with his tongue or in his heart, saying: Glory be to Allah, we seek refuge in Allah, O Allah, provide for us, O Allah, have mercy on us. Hudhayfah said: I prayed with the Messenger of Allah, and he began with Surah al-Baqarah. He would not pass by a verse of mercy without asking, nor a verse of punishment without seeking refuge, nor a verse of exaltation without glorifying. When he finished, he would say what he, prayers and peace of Allah be upon him, used to say upon completing the Quran: O Allah, have mercy on me by the Quran and make it for me a leader, a light, a guidance, and a mercy. O Allah, remind me of what I have forgotten from it and teach me from it what I am ignorant of, and grant me its recitation during the night and the ends of the day, and make it an argument for me, O Lord of the worlds.

The ninth concerns raising the voice in recitation. There is no doubt that one must raise it to the extent that he hears himself, for recitation is the articulation of letters with sound, and sound is necessary. Its minimum is what he hears himself. If he does not hear himself, his prayer is not valid. As for raising it so that others hear, it is beloved in one respect and disliked in another. What indicates the recommendation of whispering is what has been reported that he said: "The superiority of secret recitation over open recitation is like the superiority of secret charity over open charity." And in another wording: "The one who recites the Quran openly is like the one who gives charity openly, and the one who recites it secretly is like the one who gives charity secretly." And in the general report: "A secret deed is superior to an open deed by seventyfold." Likewise his saying: "The best provision is that which suffices, and the best remembrance is the hidden." And in the report: "Do not raise your voices over one another in recitation between Maghrib and Isha." Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab heard one night in the mosque of the Messenger of Allah, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz raising his voice in recitation during his prayer, and he had a beautiful voice. He said to his servant: Go to this praying man and tell him to lower his voice. The servant said: The mosque is not ours, and the traveler has a share in it. Sa'id raised his voice and said: O praying man, if you intend Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, with your prayer, then lower your voice; and if you intend people, they will not avail you anything against Allah. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz fell silent and lightened his rak'ah. When he gave the salutation, he took his sandals and left, and he was the governor of Medina at that time. What indicates the recommendation of raising the voice is what has been reported that the Prophet heard a group of his Companions raising their voices in the night prayer and approved of that. And he said: "When one of you stands for night prayer, let him raise his voice in recitation, for the angels and the inhabitants of the house listen to his recitation and pray with his prayer." And he passed by three of his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, in different states. He passed by Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, who was whispering. He asked him about that, and he said: The One I am conversing with hears me. He passed by Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, who was raising his voice. He asked him about that, and he said: To awaken the sleepy and drive away Satan. He passed by Bilal who was reciting a verse from this surah and a verse from that surah. He asked him about that, and he said: I mix good with good. He said: All of you have done well and are correct. Therefore, the correct approach...

In reconciling these narrations, whispering is further from ostentation and affectation, thus it is superior for one who fears such for himself. But if he does not fear it, and there is nothing in reciting aloud that would disturb another worshipper during his prayer, then reciting aloud is superior because the action therein is greater, and because its benefit also extends to others—and the good that extends to others is superior to that which is confined. Moreover, it awakens the heart of the reciter, gathers his focus toward reflecting upon it, and directs his hearing to it. It also drives away sleep by raising the voice, increases his vigor for recitation, and lessens his laziness. He may hope through his loud recitation that a sleeper awakens, thus he becomes the cause of his revival. Or he may be seen by an idle, heedless person, who then becomes invigorated by his vigor and yearns for service. So whenever any of these intentions is present, reciting aloud is superior. And if these intentions combine, the reward is multiplied. Through the multitude of intentions, the deeds of the righteous are purified and their rewards multiplied. If a single act contains ten intentions, it contains ten rewards. For this reason, we say reciting the Qur'an from a physical copy is superior, as it increases the action of looking, contemplating the copy, and carrying it, thus increasing the reward thereby. It has been said that completing the Qur'an from a copy is equivalent to seven, because looking at the copy is also an act of worship. 'Uthman (may God be pleased with him) wore out two copies due to his frequent recitation from them. Many of the Companions used to recite from copies and disliked a day passing without them looking into a copy. One of the jurists of Egypt entered upon al-Shafi'i (may God be pleased with him) during the last part of the night, and before him was a copy. Al-Shafi'i said to him, "Your preoccupation with legal thought has kept you from the Qur'an. Verily, I pray the 'Isha prayer and place the copy before me, and I do not close it until dawn."

The tenth is beautifying the recitation: and its measured recitation with modulation of the voice, without excessive elongation that alters the composition, is a Sunnah. He (peace be upon him) said, "Adorn the Qur'an with your voices." The hadith "Adorn the Qur'an with your voices" was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of al-Bara' ibn 'Azib. And he (peace be upon him) said, "God has not listened to anything as He listens to a beautiful voice reciting the Qur'an." The hadith "God has not listened to anything as He listens to a beautiful voice reciting the Qur'an" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, with the wording, "God has not listened to anything as He listens to a prophet chanting the Qur'an." Muslim added, "to a prophet with a beautiful voice," and in another narration of his, "like His listening to a prophet chanting the Qur'an." And he (peace be upon him) said, "He is not of us who does not chant the Qur'an." It was said he meant self-sufficiency by it, and it was said he meant melodious recitation and modulation of melodies with it, which is closer according to the people of language. It is narrated that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was one night waiting for 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her), and she was delayed. He said, "What detained you?" She said, "O Messenger of God, I was listening to the recitation of a man; I have never heard a voice more beautiful than his." He (peace be upon him) rose until he listened to him for a long time, then returned and said, "This is Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah. Praise be to God who has placed the like of him in my community." And he (peace be upon him) also listened one night to 'Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud, and with him were Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may God be pleased with them). They stood for a long time, then he said, "Whoever wishes to recite the Qur'an fresh and tender as it was revealed, let him recite according to the recitation of Ibn Umm 'Abd." And he (peace be upon him) said to Ibn Mas'ud, "Recite to me." He said, "O Messenger of God, shall I recite to you when it was revealed to you?" He said, "I love to hear it from others." So he recited, and the eyes of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) overflowed. And he (peace be upon him) listened to the recitation of Abu Musa and said, "He has been given something from the psalms of the family of David." That reached Abu Musa, and he said, "O Messenger of God, had I known you were listening, I would have beautified it for you with beautification." And Haytham the reciter saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) in a dream. He said, "He said to me, 'Are you Haytham who adorns the Qur'an with your voice?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'May God reward you with good.'" In a report: The Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), when they gathered, would command one of them to recite a chapter from the Qur'an. 'Umar used to say to Abu Musa (may God be pleased with them), "Remind us of our Lord," and he would recite near him until the prayer time was almost midway. It would be said, "O Commander of the Faithful, the prayer, the prayer!" He would say, "Are we not in prayer?"—pointing to the saying of the Almighty: "And the remembrance of God is greater." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever listens to a verse from the Book of God Almighty, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection." In a report, ten good deeds are recorded for him. However great the reward for listening is, and the reciter is the cause of it, he is a partner in the reward, unless his intention is ostentation and affectation.

(The Third Chapter: On the Inner Acts in Recitation)
They are ten: understanding the root of the speech, then reverence, then presence of the heart, then reflection, then comprehension, then removal of impediments to understanding, then personal application, then being affected, then ascension, then disavowal. The first is understanding the majesty of the speech, its loftiness, and the grace of God, glorified and exalted, and His gentleness with His creation in its descent from the throne of His majesty to the level of His creation's comprehension. So let him consider how gentle He is with His creation in conveying the meanings of His speech, which is an attribute...

Ancient and self-subsisting, it manifests to the understandings of His creation, yet how could that attribute be unveiled to them within the folds of letters and sounds, which are attributes of humans? For humanity is incapable of attaining comprehension of the attributes of God, Exalted and Glorified, except through the medium of their own attributes. Were not the essence of the majesty of His speech concealed within the garment of letters, neither throne nor earth could endure hearing the Speech; all that lies between them of the grandeur of His dominion and the radiance of His light would vanish. And had God, Exalted and Glorified, not granted firmness to Moses, peace be upon him, he could not have borne hearing His speech, just as the mountain could not withstand the beginnings of His manifestation, being reduced to dust. The magnificence of the Speech cannot be conveyed except through analogies commensurate with the understanding of creation. Therefore, some of the knowers expressed it, saying: "Every letter of the speech of God, Exalted and Glorified, in the Preserved Tablet is greater than Mount Qaf. And if all the angels, peace be upon them, were to gather to lift a single letter, they could not bear it until Israfil, peace be upon him—the angel of the Tablet—comes and raises it, lifting it by the permission and mercy of God, Exalted and Glorified, not by his own strength and capacity, but because God, Exalted and Glorified, empowered him with that and employed him therein."

Indeed, some sages excelled in expressing the aspect of divine gentleness in conveying the meanings of the Speech, despite its exalted rank, to human understanding and establishing it despite the deficiency of their station. He gave an example that did not fall short: He called a certain king a sage to the law of the prophets, peace be upon them. The king asked him about matters, and he answered with what his understanding could not bear. The king said, "What do you say about what the prophets bring when they claim it is not the speech of humans but the speech of God, Exalted and Glorified? How can people bear it?" The sage replied, "We have observed that when people wished to make some animals and birds understand what they desired—to advance, retreat, approach, or withdraw—and saw that the animals fell short in discerning their speech, which issues from the lights of their intellects, despite its beauty, adornment, and exquisite composition, they descended to the level of the animals' discernment and conveyed their intentions to the inner beings of the animals through sounds they devised suitable for them, such as tapping, whistling, and sounds close to their own, so that they could bear them. Likewise, people are incapable of bearing the speech of God, Exalted and Glorified, in its essence and perfection of attributes, so they resorted to the sounds they exchanged among themselves, through which they heard wisdom, like the sound of tapping and whistling that animals hear from people. This did not prevent the meanings of wisdom hidden within those attributes, for the nobility of the speech—that is, the sounds—is due to its nobility, and its greatness is due to its exaltation. Thus, the sound became a body and dwelling for wisdom, and wisdom became a soul and spirit for the sound. Just as human bodies are honored and revered for the sake of the spirit within, so too are the sounds of speech ennobled for the wisdom they contain."

The Speech is of a lofty station, exalted in degree, possessing overwhelming authority, and its judgment penetrates truth and falsehood. It is the just judge and the accepted witness; it commands and forbids. Falsehood has no power to stand before the speech of wisdom, just as a shadow cannot speak before the sunbeam, nor do humans have the capacity to penetrate the depths of wisdom, just as they cannot penetrate with their sight the light of the sun's eye. Yet they attain from the light of the sun's eye what gives life to their sight and by which they discern their needs only. Thus, the Speech is like a king whose face is veiled and absent, yet his command is effective; like the abundant sun, manifest yet its essence concealed; like the shining stars by which one who does not know their course may be guided. It is the key to precious treasuries, the drink of life—whoever drinks from it does not die—and the remedy for ailments—whoever is given to drink from it does not fall ill. This which the sage mentioned is a glimpse into conveying the meaning of the Speech; to add to it is not fitting for the science of spiritual conduct, so one should confine oneself to it.

The second: Exalting the Speaker. The reciter, at the outset of reciting the Quran, should bring to heart the majesty of the Speaker and know that what he recites is not from the speech of humans, and that in reciting the speech of God, Exalted and Glorified, lies the utmost peril. For He, the Exalted, said: "None touch it except the purified." Just as the external skin and paper of the Mus'haf are guarded from the touch of any hand unless it is purified, so too the inner meaning, by virtue of its honor and majesty, is veiled from the inner heart unless it is purified from all defilement and illuminated by the light of exaltation and reverence. And just as not every hand is fit to touch the skin of the Mus'haf, so not every tongue is fit to recite its letters, nor every heart to attain its meanings. For such exaltation, 'Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, when he opened the Mus'haf, would faint and say, "It is the speech of my Lord, it is the speech of my Lord." Exalting the Speech is exalting the Speaker, and the majesty of the Speaker will not be present to him unless he reflects upon His attributes, His majesty, and His actions. When there comes to his mind the Throne, the Footstool, the heavens and the earth, and what is between them of jinn, humans, and animals...

And the trees, and knowing that the Creator of all of them, the One capable over them, and the Provider for them is One, and that all are within the grasp of His power, oscillating between His favor and mercy on one hand, and His punishment and severity on the other. If He bestows favor, it is by His grace; and if He punishes, it is by His justice. And He is the One who says, "These to Paradise, and I do not care, and these to the Fire, and I do not care." This is the ultimate in grandeur and exaltation. So, by reflecting on examples like this, awe of the Speaker becomes present, and then awe of the speech.

Third: The presence of the heart and abandoning the inner chatter. It is said in the interpretation of, "O Yahya, take the Book with strength" — meaning with earnestness and diligence. And taking it with earnestness is to be devoted to it during its recitation, directing one's aspiration to it to the exclusion of all else. Someone was asked, "When you recite the Qur'an, does your inner self chatter about something?" He replied, "Is there anything more beloved to me than the Qur'an that I would chatter to myself about it?" Some of the pious predecessors, if they recited a verse and their heart was not present in it, would repeat it a second time. This quality is generated from what precedes it—namely, awe. For one who holds the speech he is reciting in awe rejoices in it, finds intimacy with it, and is not heedless of it. In the Qur'an is that which brings intimacy to the heart, if the reciter is worthy of it. So how can one seek intimacy through pondering other than it, while he is in its gardens and promenades? One who promenades in gardens does not ponder other than them. It has been said that in the Qur'an are arenas, orchards, pavilions, brides, brocades, meadows, and inns. The *mim*s are the arenas of the Qur'an, the *ra*s are its orchards, the *ha*s are its pavilions, the *musabbihat* are its brides, the *hawamim* are its brocades, the *Mufassal* is its meadows, and the inns are what remains. So when the reciter enters the arenas, plucks from the orchards, enters the pavilions, beholds the brides, wears the brocades, strolls in the meadows, and lodges in the rooms of the inns, that engrosses him and occupies him to the exclusion of all else, so his heart does not wander and his thought does not scatter.

Fourth: Contemplation (*tadabbur*). This is beyond the presence of the heart, for one may not think of other than the Qur'an, yet he merely limits himself to hearing the Qur'an from himself without contemplating it. The intended purpose of recitation is contemplation. For this reason, measured recitation (*tartil*) has been legislated, for measured recitation outwardly facilitates contemplation inwardly. 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "There is no good in worship without understanding, nor in recitation without contemplation." If one cannot achieve contemplation except by repetition, then let him repeat, unless he is following an Imam, for if he remained contemplating one verse while the Imam had moved on to another, he would be acting improperly—like one who busies himself marveling at a single word from someone conversing with him, to the neglect of understanding the rest of his speech. Likewise, if he is in the glorification of the bowing position while pondering a verse his Imam recited, this is *waswas* (whispering distraction). It is narrated from 'Amir ibn 'Abd Qays that he said, "*Waswas* overcomes me in prayer." He was asked, "Is it about worldly matters?" He said, "For my spear to be confused is more beloved to me than that. Rather, my heart becomes occupied with my standing before my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, and how I will depart." That was counted as *waswas*, and it is indeed so, for it distracts him from understanding what he is engaged in. Satan cannot achieve the like of this except by occupying one with an important religious matter, but thereby prevents him from what is superior. When this was mentioned to al-Hasan, he said, "If you are truthful about him, then God has not fashioned that among us." And it is narrated that he (the Prophet, peace be upon him) recited "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" and repeated it twenty times, and he only repeated it due to his contemplation of its meanings. And from Abu Dharr, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, led us in prayer one night and stood repeating a verse: 'If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants; and if You forgive them...' the verse." And Tamim al-Dari stood one night with this verse: "Or do those who commit evil deeds think...?" the verse. And Sa'id ibn Jubayr stood one night repeating this verse: "And [it will be said], 'Stand apart today, O criminals.'" And some of them said: "I begin a chapter, and something I witness within it stops me from finishing it until dawn breaks." And some of them would say: "A verse I do not comprehend, and my heart is not present in it—I do not count its reward for myself." And it is related from Abu Sulayman al-Darani that he said: "I recite a verse and dwell on it for four or five nights, and were it not that I cut off the thought in it, I would not move beyond it to another." And from some of the predecessors, that he remained on Surah Hud for six months, repeating it and not finishing due to his contemplation within it. And one of the knowers (*'arifun*) said: "I have a completion (*khatmah*) every week, a completion every month, a completion every year, and I have a completion for thirty years that I have not yet finished." And that is according to the degrees of his contemplation and investigation. And this one also used to say: "I have placed myself in the position of a hired worker, so I work by the day, by the month, by the year, and by the decade."

Fifth: Comprehension (*tafahhum*). It is to seek clarity from every verse of what is appropriate to it, for the Qur'an comprises the mention of the attributes of God, Mighty and Majestic, the mention of His actions, the mention of the states of the prophets, upon them be peace, the mention of the states of those who denied them and how they were destroyed, and the mention of His commands and prohibitions.

And mention of Paradise and Hell. As for the attributes of God, may He be exalted, they are like His saying, exalted is He: "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing," and like His saying, exalted is He: "The Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of Peace, the Granter of Security, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Supreme." So let one contemplate the meanings of these names and attributes, that their secrets may be unveiled to him, for within them are buried meanings that are not unveiled except to those who are granted success. To this, 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, alluded in his saying: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, confided nothing to me that he concealed from the people, except that God, may He be exalted, grants a servant understanding of His Book. So let him be eager in seeking that understanding." And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever desires the knowledge of the ancients and the later ones, let him delve into the Qur'an. And the greatest of the Qur'an's sciences lie beneath the names and attributes of God, may He be exalted, for most of creation has not attained from them except matters suitable to their comprehension, and they have not stumbled upon their depths."

And as for His acts, may He be exalted, such as His mention of the creation of the heavens and the earth and others, let the reciter understand from them the attributes and majesty of God, may He be exalted, for the act points to the actor. Thus, its greatness points to His greatness. Therefore, one should witness in the intellect the Actor, not the act. For whoever knows the Truth sees Him in everything, since everything is from Him, and to Him, and by Him, and for Him. He is, in truth, the All. And whoever does not see Him in everything he sees, it is as if he has not known Him. And whoever knows Him knows that everything other than God is false, and that everything will perish except His Face—not that it will become false at a later moment, but it is false now if one considers its essence in itself, unless one considers its existence insofar as it exists by God, may He be exalted, and by His power, in which case it has permanence by way of subordination, but by way of independence it is pure falsehood. This is one of the principles of the science of unveiling.

For this reason, when the reciter reads His saying, may He be exalted: "Have you considered what you sow? Have you considered what you emit? Have you considered the water which you drink? Have you considered the fire which you kindle?" he should not restrict his view to the water, the fire, the seed, and the semen. Rather, let him contemplate the semen, which is a drop of fluid with similar parts, then observe how it divides into flesh, bone, veins, and nerves, and how its limbs are formed into different shapes—the head, the hand, the foot, the liver, the heart, and others. Then [observe] the noble attributes that appear in it, such as hearing, sight, intellect, and others. Then [observe] the blameworthy attributes that appear in it, such as anger, desire, arrogance, ignorance, denial, and argumentation, as He, exalted is He, said: "Does man not consider that We created him from a drop? Then at once he is a clear adversary." So let him contemplate these wonders, that he may ascend from them to the Wonder of wonders, which is the Attribute from which these wonders issued forth. Thus, he continually looks at the creation and sees the Creator.

And as for the states of the prophets, upon them be peace: when he hears from them how they were denied, struck, and some of them killed, let him understand from it the attribute of God's, may He be exalted, independence from the messengers and those to whom they were sent, and that if He destroyed all of them, it would not affect His dominion in the least. And when he hears of their victory in the end, let him understand the power of God, may He be exalted, and His will to grant victory to the truth.

And as for the states of the deniers, like 'Aad and Thamud and what befell them, let his understanding from it be a feeling of fear from His overpowering might and His punishment. And let his share from it be taking admonition for himself, that if he is heedless and acts improperly and is deluded by the respite granted, perhaps punishment will overtake him and the decree will be executed upon him.

Likewise, when he hears the description of Paradise and Hell and all else that is in the Qur'an, it is not possible to exhaust what is understood from it, for that has no end. Rather, for every servant is according to his allotted provision. "There is nothing fresh or dry but is in a clear Book." "Say, 'If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement.'" For that reason, 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "If I wished, I could load seventy camels with the interpretation of the Opening of the Book." The purpose of what we have mentioned is to alert to the path of comprehension, that its door may be opened. As for exhaustive treatment, there is no hope for it. And whoever has no understanding of what is in the Qur'an, even in the lowest degrees, enters into His saying, exalted is He: "And among them are those who listen to you until, when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge, 'What did he say just now?' Those are the ones upon whose hearts God has set a seal." The seal refers to the obstacles which we will mention in the obstacles to understanding. And it has been said: "The seeker is not a true seeker until he finds in the Qur'an all that he desires, and recognizes from it the deficiency from the increase, and becomes independent through the Master from the servants."

Sixth: Abandoning the obstacles to understanding. For most people are prevented from understanding the meanings of the Qur'an due to reasons and veils which Satan has cast over their hearts, so the wonders of the Qur'an's secrets are blinded to them. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Were it not that the satans hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze at the Kingdom of the heavens."

The Divine Realm (al-Malakūt) encompasses the meanings of the Qur'an, and everything veiled from the senses, apprehended only by the light of inner vision, belongs to the Divine Realm. The veils over understanding are four.

The first is when one's concern is diverted to perfecting the pronunciation of letters, articulating them from their precise points of articulation. A devil is assigned to oversee this, preying upon reciters to divert them from understanding the meanings of God Almighty's speech. He persistently incites them to repeat a letter, deluding them into thinking it has not been correctly articulated. Thus, their contemplation remains confined to the points of articulation—how then can the meanings be unveiled to them? The devil's greatest mockery is reserved for one who obeys such deception.

The second is when one blindly imitates a school of thought merely heard through imitation, becomes rigid upon it, and entrenches in oneself partisanship for it solely by following what was heard, without attaining it through inner vision and direct witnessing. This person is shackled by their belief, preventing them from transcending it. They cannot conceive in their mind anything other than their belief, so their perspective is confined to what they have heard. If a flash of lightning appears from afar, and a meaning from among those meanings which contradict what they have heard becomes apparent to them, the devil of blind imitation assails them, saying, "How can this occur to your mind when it contradicts the belief of your forefathers?" They then see that as a delusion from Satan, so they distance themselves from it and guard against its like. It is of this that the Sufis said, "Knowledge is a veil," meaning by 'knowledge' the dogmas upon which most people persist merely through imitation, or through mere dialectical statements formulated by partisan sectarians and cast to them. As for true knowledge, which is unveiling and witnessing by the light of inner vision, how could it be a veil? It is the ultimate objective. This blind imitation may be false, thus becoming a barrier—like one who believes regarding [God's] establishment upon the Throne (al-istiwā') [a meaning of] settling and being firmly seated. If it occurs to them, for example, regarding al-Quddūs (The Holy) that it means being sanctified from all that is possible for His creation, their blind imitation prevents this from becoming established in their heart. Had it become established, it would have led to a second and third unveiling, and so on continuously. But they hasten to repel it from their thoughts because it contradicts their false imitation. It may also be true, yet still be a barrier to understanding and unveiling, because the truth which creation is charged to believe in has levels and degrees; it has an apparent beginning and a hidden depth. The nature's rigidity upon the apparent prevents reaching the hidden depth, as we mentioned concerning the difference between the outward and inward knowledge in the book *The Foundations of Beliefs*.

The third is when one is persistent in a sin, characterized by arrogance, or generally afflicted by an obeyed worldly desire. For that is a cause of the heart's darkness and tarnish; it is like filth upon a mirror, preventing the clarity of truth from being reflected therein. This is the greatest veil for the heart, and by it most people are veiled. The more desires accumulate intensely, the more the meanings of speech are intensely veiled. The lighter the burdens of the world upon the heart become, the closer the manifestation of meaning becomes within it. The heart is like a mirror, desires are like tarnish, the meanings of the Qur'an are like the images that appear in the mirror, and the heart's discipline by removing desires is like polishing clarity for the mirror. Therefore, the Prophet ﷺ said: "When my community exalts the dinar and the dirham, the awe of Islam will be stripped from them. And when they abandon enjoining good and forbidding evil, they will be deprived of the blessing of revelation." Al-Fuḍayl said, meaning they are deprived of understanding the Qur'an. God Almighty has made turning in repentance (inābah) a condition for understanding and remembrance, saying, Exalted is He: "[This is] an insight and a reminder for every servant who turns [to God]" (Qur'an 50:8). And He, Glorified is He, said: "But none will remember except those who turn [to God]" (Qur'an 40:13). And He said: "Only people of understanding will be reminded" (Qur'an 39:9). He who prefers the delusion of this world over the bliss of the Hereafter is not among the people of understanding, and therefore the secrets of the Book are not unveiled to him.

The fourth is when one has read an outward exegesis and believes that the words of the Qur'an have no meaning except what has been transmitted from Ibn 'Abbās, Mujāhid, and others, and that anything beyond that is interpretation by personal opinion, and that whoever interprets the Qur'an by his opinion has taken his seat in the Fire. This too is among the great veils. We will clarify the meaning of interpretation by opinion in the fourth chapter, and that it does not contradict the statement of 'Alī, may God be pleased with him, "Except that God gives a servant understanding of the Qur'an," and that if the meaning were only the apparent, transmitted one, people would not have differed over it.

The seventh [veil] is personalization (al-takhṣīṣ), which is to presume that one is the specific addressee of every discourse in the Qur'an. If one hears a command or prohibition, one presumes one is the one being prohibited or commanded. If one hears a promise or threat, it is likewise. If one hears the stories of the ancients and the prophets, one knows that storytelling is not the objective; rather, the objective is to take admonition from it and to extract from its folds what one needs. There is no story in the Qur'an except that its context is for a benefit regarding the Prophet ﷺ and his community. Therefore, God Almighty said: "That We might strengthen your heart thereby" (Qur'an 11:120). So let the servant consider that God strengthened his heart with what...

He recounts to him the states of the prophets and their patience in the face of harm, and their steadfastness in religion while awaiting the victory of God Almighty. How can one not be capable of this when the Qur’an was not sent down upon the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) for the Messenger of God alone, but rather it is a healing, a guidance, a mercy, and a light for all worlds. For this reason, God Almighty commanded all to give thanks for the blessing of the Book, saying, Exalted is He: "And remember the favor of God upon you and what He has sent down to you of the Book and wisdom by which He instructs you." And He, Mighty and Majestic, said: "We have certainly sent down to you a Book in which is your remembrance. Then will you not reason? And We have sent down to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them." "Thus does God set forth parables for the people." "And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord." "This is insight for the people and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain." "This is a clear statement for the people and guidance and admonition for the righteous." If the address is intended for all people, then the individuals are intended. Thus, this single reciter is intended, so what is for him and for all other people, let him consider that he is the one addressed. God Almighty said: "And this Qur’an was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whoever it reaches." Muhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi said: "Whoever the Qur’an reaches, it is as if God has spoken to him." When one realizes that, he does not take the study of the Qur’an as his mere occupation; rather, he recites it as a servant recites the letter of his master which was written to him, to ponder it and act according to its requirements. For this reason, some of the scholars said: "This Qur’an are messages that have come to us from our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, containing His covenants. We reflect upon them in the prayers, we pause over them in solitude, and we implement them in acts of obedience and followed traditions." Malik ibn Dinar used to say: "What has the Qur’an planted in your hearts, O people of the Qur’an? Verily, the Qur’an is the spring of the believer, just as rain is the spring of the earth." Qatadah said: "No one sits with this Qur’an except that he rises with an increase or a decrease." He, Exalted is He, said: "It is healing and a mercy for the believers, and it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss."

The eighth: Being affected—that his heart is affected by various effects according to the variation of the verses, so that he has a state according to each understanding, and a feeling that characterizes his heart from sadness, fear, hope, and other than that. Whenever his knowledge is perfected, awe becomes the predominant state upon his heart, for constriction is prevalent in the verses of the Qur’an. He does not see the mention of forgiveness and mercy except coupled with conditions that the one who knows falls short of attaining, such as His saying, Mighty and Majestic: "And indeed, I am Forgiving," then followed that with four conditions: "for those who repent, believe, do righteous deeds, and then remain guided." And His saying, Exalted is He: "By time, indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience." He mentioned four conditions. And where He limited the mention to a comprehensive condition, He said, Exalted is He: "Indeed, the mercy of God is near to the doers of good." Thus, doing good encompasses all. And so it is for whoever peruses the Qur’an from its beginning to its end. Whoever understands that, it is fitting that his state be one of awe and sadness. For this reason, al-Hasan said: "By God, no servant recites the Qur’an today, believing in it, except that his sadness increases, his joy decreases, his weeping increases, his laughter decreases, his toil and preoccupation increase, and his rest and idleness decrease." Wahb ibn al-Ward said: "We looked into these narrations and admonitions, and we did not find anything more softening to the hearts nor more compelling of sadness than reciting the Qur’an, understanding it, and reflecting upon it."

Thus, the servant being affected by the recitation is that he comes to be characterized by the attribute of the recited verse. When there is a warning and the tying of forgiveness to conditions, he diminishes from fear as if he is nearly dying. When there is expansiveness and the promise of forgiveness, he rejoices as if he is flying from joy. When God and His attributes and names are mentioned, he lowers himself in humility to His majesty and with a sense of His greatness. When the disbelievers are mentioned with what is impossible for God, Mighty and Majestic, such as their ascribing to God, Mighty and Majestic, a child or a spouse, he lowers his voice and is broken inwardly from shame at the ugliness of their statement. When Paradise is described, a longing for it surges within him. When the Fire is described, his limbs tremble from fear of it. (And when the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to Ibn Mas‘ud: "Recite to me," he said: "So I began Surah al-Nisa’. When I reached, 'So how will it be when We bring from every nation a witness and We bring you as a witness over these?' I saw his eyes overflowing with tears. He said to me: 'That is enough for now.'") This is because witnessing that state completely absorbed his heart. Indeed, among those who fear were some who fell down unconscious upon hearing verses of warning. Among them were some who died while listening to the verses. Such states take one out of being merely a reporter in his speech. If he says, "Indeed, I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day," and he is not fearful, he is merely reporting. If he says, "Upon You we have relied, and to You we have turned back, and to You is the destination," and his state is not one of reliance and turning back, he is merely reporting. If he says, "And we will be patient over whatever harm you cause us," then let his state be one of patience or resolve upon it, until he finds the sweetness of recitation.

He who does not possess these qualities, and whose heart does not waver between these states, his portion of recitation is merely the movement of the tongue, along with a clear curse upon himself in the words of God, Exalted is He: "Behold, the curse of God is upon the wrongdoers," and in His words: "How hateful it is in the sight of God that you say what you do not do," and in the words of the Mighty and Majestic: "While they are heedless, turning away," and in His words: "So turn away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world," and in His words: "And whoever does not repent—then it is those who are the wrongdoers," and other such verses. He falls under the meaning of His words: "And among them are the unlettered who know not the Scripture except in wishful thinking," meaning mere recitation, and His words: "And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they are turning away from it?" For the Qur'an is what clarifies those signs in the heavens and the earth. Whenever one passes over them and is not affected by them, he is turning away from them. Therefore, it is said: Whoever is not characterized by the morals of the Qur'an, when he recites the Qur'an, God, Exalted is He, calls out to him: "What have you to do with My speech while you are turning away from Me? Leave My speech alone if you do not repent to Me." The example of the disobedient one when he recites and repeats the Qur'an is like one who repeats the king's letter many times each day, while it was written to him concerning the cultivation of his kingdom, yet he is busy ruining it and confines himself to studying his letter. Perhaps if he had abandoned the study while in opposition, he would have been further from mockery and deserving of wrath. Therefore, Yusuf ibn Asbat said: "I intend to recite the Qur'an, but when I remember what is in it, I fear wrath, so I turn to glorification and seeking forgiveness." The one who turns away from acting upon it is intended by His words: "But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. Wretched is that which they purchase." Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Recite the Qur'an as long as your hearts are in harmony with it and your skins are softened by it. But when you differ, you are not reciting it." In another narration: "When you differ, then rise from it." God, Exalted is He, said: "Those who, when God is mentioned, their hearts tremble, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith, and upon their Lord they rely." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The best of people in voice with the Qur'an is the one whom, when you hear him recite, you see that he fears God, Exalted is He." And he, peace be upon him, said: "No one hears the Qur'an from anyone more desirably than from one who fears God, the Mighty and Majestic." The Qur'an is intended to attract these states to the heart and to act upon it. Otherwise, the effort in moving the tongue with its letters is light. Therefore, some reciters said: "I recited the Qur'an to a shaykh of mine, then I returned to recite a second time, and he rebuked me, saying: 'You have made the Qur'an a burden upon yourself. Go and recite before God, the Mighty and Majestic, and see what He commands you and what He forbids you.'" By this, the Companions, may God be pleased with them, were occupied in states and deeds. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed away leaving twenty thousand Companions, of whom only six had memorized the Qur'an—with disagreement about two of them. Most of them would memorize a surah or two, and those who memorized Al-Baqarah and Al-An'am were among their scholars. When a man came to learn the Qur'an and reached the words of God: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it," he said, "This is sufficient," and departed. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The man departed as a jurist." The precious thing is that state which God, Exalted is He, bestows upon the heart of the believer following the understanding of the verse. As for the mere movement of the tongue, its benefit is little. Indeed, the one who recites with the tongue while turning away from action is worthy of being the one intended by His words: "But whoever turns away from My remembrance—indeed, he will have a straitened life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind," and by His words: "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you be forgotten this Day." That is, you left them, did not look at them, and paid no heed to them. For the one who is negligent in a matter is said to have forgotten the matter. The recitation of the Qur'an, its true recitation, is that the tongue, the intellect, and the heart all participate in it. The tongue's portion is the correct pronunciation of the letters with measured recitation; the intellect's portion is the interpretation of the meanings; and the heart's portion is taking admonition and being affected, by heeding warnings and obeying commands. Thus, the tongue recites, the intellect translates, and the heart takes admonition. The ninth: Ascension. I mean by it that one ascends to hearing the Speech from God, Exalted is He, not from himself. The degrees of recitation are three. The lowest is that the servant imagines as if he is reciting it to God, Exalted is He, standing before Him, while He is looking at him and listening to him. His state in this imagining is one of asking, flattering, supplicating, and beseeching. The second is that he witnesses with his heart as if God, Exalted is He, sees him, addresses him with His gentleness, and whispers to him with His blessings and favors. His station is one of shame, veneration, listening attentively, and understanding. The third is that he sees in the Speech the Speaker, and in the words the Attributes, so he looks not to himself nor to his recitation.

Nor is it directed towards the attachment of blessings upon him inasmuch as he is the recipient of favor; rather, his concern is confined solely to the Speaker, his thought arrested upon Him, as if he is absorbed in witnessing the Speaker to the exclusion of all else. This is the station of those brought near (al-Muqarrabun), and what precedes it is the station of the Companions of the Right Hand (Ashab al-Yamin). Whatever falls outside of this constitutes the degrees of the heedless (al-Ghafilun).

Concerning the supreme degree, Ja‘far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq, may God be pleased with him, reported, saying: "By God, God Almighty has indeed manifested Himself to His creation in His speech, but they do not see." He also said—when he was asked about a state that overcame him during prayer until he fell down unconscious—and when he recovered, he was asked about it, and he said: "I kept repeating the verse to my heart until I heard it from the One who spoke it, and my body could not endure witnessing His power." It is in such a degree that the sweetness and delight of intimate discourse are magnified. Therefore, one of the wise men said: "I used to recite the Qur’an but found no sweetness in it until I recited it as if I were hearing it from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, reciting it to his Companions. Then I was elevated to a station above that: I recited it as if I were hearing it from Gabriel, upon him be peace, delivering it to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Then God brought me to another station, and now I hear it from the Speaker Himself. It was then that I found for it a delight and a bliss from which I cannot bear to be parted."

‘Uthman and Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with them, said: "If hearts were purified, they would never have their fill of reciting the Qur’an." They said this only because through purification they ascend to witnessing the Speaker in the speech. For this reason, Thabit al-Bunani said: "I struggled with the Qur’an for twenty years and took delight in it for twenty years."

Through witnessing the Speaker to the exclusion of all else, the servant complies with His words, exalted is He: "So flee to God" (51:50), and His words: "And do not set up another god with God" (51:51). For whoever does not see Him in everything has seen other than Him. Indeed, everything the servant turns to besides God Almighty involves in that turning something of hidden polytheism. Rather, pure monotheism is to see in everything only God Almighty.

The tenth is disavowal (al-Tabri), and I mean by it that he disavows his own power and strength and turning to himself, whether in satisfaction or self-praise. So when he recites verses of promise and praise for the righteous, he does not witness himself at that time; rather, he witnesses the faithful and the truthful therein and aspires that God Almighty will join him to them. And when he recites verses of wrath and censure of the disobedient and the negligent, he bears witness against himself there and considers himself the one addressed, out of fear and apprehension. For this reason, Ibn ‘Umar, may God be pleased with them, used to say: "O God, I seek Your forgiveness for my wrongdoing and my ingratitude." He was asked: "This is wrongdoing, but what about the ingratitude?" So he recited His words, exalted is He: "Indeed, man is wrongdoing, ungrateful" (14:34). And it was said to Yusuf ibn Asbat: "When you recite the Qur’an, what do you supplicate with?" He said: "What should I supplicate with? I seek the forgiveness of God Almighty for my shortcomings seventy times."

If he sees himself in the form of shortcoming in the recitation, his seeing it becomes a cause of his nearness. For whoever witnesses remoteness while in nearness is treated gently through fear until that fear drives him to another degree of nearness beyond it. And whoever witnesses nearness while in remoteness is afflicted with a sense of security that leads him to another degree of remoteness lower than his current state. Whenever he is witnessing himself with the eye of self-satisfaction, he becomes veiled by himself. But if he transcends the limit of turning to himself and witnesses only God Almighty in his recitation, the secret of the dominion (al-Malakut) is unveiled to him.

Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God be pleased with him, said: "Ibn Thawban promised a brother of his that he would break his fast with him. He was delayed until dawn appeared. His brother met him the next day and said to him: 'You promised me you would break your fast with me, but you broke your promise.' He said: 'Were it not for my appointment with you, I would not tell you what detained me from you. When I prayed the night prayer, I said: "I will perform the witr prayer before I come to you, for I cannot be safe from what death may bring." When I was in the supplication of the witr, I was lifted to a green meadow containing various kinds of flowers from Paradise, and I kept gazing at it until morning.'"

These unveilings (al-Mukashafat) occur only after disavowing the self and refraining from turning to it and its desires. Then these unveilings are specified according to the states of the one to whom they are unveiled. So when he recites verses of hope and the state of glad tidings predominates in him, the image of Paradise is unveiled to him, and he witnesses it as if seeing it with his own eyes. And if fear predominates in him, he is granted an unveiling of the Fire until he sees the various kinds of its torment. This is because the speech of God Almighty comprises the gentle and easy, the severe and harsh, the hoped-for and the feared, and that is according to His attributes, for among them are mercy, gentleness, vengeance, and might. According to the witnessing of the words and the attributes, he fluctuates in differing states, and according to each of these states he becomes prepared for an unveiling with a matter that corresponds and is akin to that state. For it is impossible that the state of the listener be one while what is heard is diverse, for within it is the speech of One pleased, the speech of One angered, the speech of a Bestower of favor, the speech of an Avenger, the speech of a Mighty, Proud One who does not care, and the speech of a Compassionate, Tender One who does not neglect.

Perhaps you may say: You have greatly emphasized the matter in what preceded concerning understanding the secrets of the Qur’an and the meanings unveiled to the possessors of purified hearts. So how can that be recommended when the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever interprets the Qur’an according to his own opinion, let him take his seat in the Fire.” And from this, the scholars of outward exegesis have vehemently criticized those among the Sufis who are deficient and ascribed to Sufism, for interpreting certain words in the Qur’an contrary to what has been transmitted from Ibn ‘Abbas and other exegetes, and they have deemed it disbelief. If what the exegetes say is correct, then what is the meaning of understanding the Qur’an besides memorizing its interpretation? And if it is not correct, then what is the meaning of his saying (peace be upon him): “Whoever interprets the Qur’an according to his own opinion, let him take his seat in the Fire”?

Know then that whoever claims that the Qur’an has no meaning except what is conveyed by the outward interpretation is only informing about the limit of his own self, and he is correct in informing about himself, but he is mistaken in judging all of creation by reducing them to his own level, which is his limit and station. Rather, the reports and traditions indicate that there is ample scope in the meanings of the Qur’an for the possessors of understanding. ‘Ali (may God be pleased with him) said: “Unless God grants a servant understanding of the Qur’an, for if it were only the transmitted interpretation, then what is that understanding?” And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Indeed, the Qur’an has an outward and an inward, a limit and a point of ascent.” It is also narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud, attributed to him, and he is among the scholars of exegesis. So what is the meaning of the outward, the inward, the limit, and the point of ascent? And ‘Ali (may God honor his face) said: “If I wished, I could load seventy camels with the interpretation of the Opening Chapter of the Book.” So what does that mean, when its outward interpretation is extremely concise? And Abu al-Darda’ said: “A man does not comprehend until he assigns multiple aspects to the Qur’an.” And some scholars have said: “Every verse has sixty thousand understandings, and what remains of its understanding is more.” Others have said: “The Qur’an contains seventy-seven thousand and two hundred sciences, for every word is a science. Then that multiplies fourfold, for every word has an outward, an inward, a limit, and a point of ascent.” And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) repeated “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful” twenty times only to ponder the inward meanings of it, for its translation and outward interpretation do not require such repetition.

And Ibn Mas‘ud (may God be pleased with him) said: “Whoever desires the knowledge of the ancients and the later ones, let him ponder the Qur’an.” And that is not attained by mere outward interpretation. In summary, all sciences are encompassed within the acts and attributes of God Almighty, and in the Qur’an is an explanation of His Essence, His acts, and His attributes, and these sciences are endless. And in the Qur’an are allusions to their totality. The stations of delving into its details refer back to understanding the Qur’an, and its mere outward interpretation does not allude to that. Rather, everything that perplexes the thinkers and about which creatures differ in theoretical and rational matters—in the Qur’an there are symbols and indications toward it, which the people of understanding are specifically able to perceive. So how can the translation of its outward and its interpretation suffice for that? Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Recite the Qur’an and seek its wonders.” And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the hadith concerning ‘Ali (may God honor his face): “By the One who sent me with the truth as a prophet, my community will split from the root of its religion and its unity into seventy-two sects, all of them astray and leading astray, calling to the Fire. When that happens, then hold fast to the Book of God Almighty, for in it is news of what was before you and news of what will come after you, and the judgment of what is between you. Whoever opposes it from the tyrants, God Almighty will break him, and whoever seeks knowledge elsewhere, God Almighty will lead him astray. It is the strong rope of God, His clear light, His beneficial healing, a protection for whoever clings to it, and salvation for whoever follows it. It does not falter so as to be set right, nor deviate so as to be straightened. Its wonders do not cease, nor is it worn out by much repetition.” And in the hadith of Hudhayfah: “When the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) informed him of the differences and divisions after him, I said: ‘O Messenger of God, what do you command me if I live to see that?’ He said: ‘Learn the Book of God and act according to what is in it, for it is the deliverance from that.’ I repeated that to him three times, and he (peace be upon him) said three times: ‘Learn the Book of God Almighty and act according to what is in it, for in it is salvation.’”

And ‘Ali (may God honor his face) said: “Whoever understands the Qur’an interprets with it the totality of knowledge,” indicating that the Qur’an alludes to the totality of all sciences. And Ibn ‘Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) said regarding His saying, Almighty and Exalted: “And whoever is given wisdom has indeed been given much good” — meaning understanding in the Qur’an. And Almighty God said: “So We gave Solomon understanding of it, and to each We gave judgment and knowledge.” He named what He gave both of them as knowledge and judgment, and He specified what Solomon uniquely perceived with the term “understanding,” making it precede judgment and knowledge. These matters indicate that in understanding the meanings of the Qur’an there is a vast and extensive scope, and that what is transmitted as outward interpretation is not the ultimate perception of it.

As for his saying (peace be upon him): “Whoever interprets the Qur’an according to his own opinion,” and his prohibition of it, and the saying of Abu Bakr...

May God be pleased with him: What earth would carry me, and what sky would shade me, if I were to speak about the Qur’an based on my own opinion? As for the reports and traditions that prohibit interpreting the Qur’an by opinion, the intended meaning cannot be but one of two possibilities: either it means restricting oneself to transmitted reports and what has been heard, abandoning independent reasoning and autonomous understanding, or it intends something else. It is absolutely false that it means no one should speak about the Qur’an except with what he has heard, for several reasons:

First: That would require such statements to be directly heard from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and attributed to him—a condition met only in part of the Qur’an. As for what Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn Mas‘ud said from their own understanding, it would have to be rejected and labeled as interpretation by opinion, since they did not hear it from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him—and likewise for other Companions, may God be pleased with them.

Second: The Companions and interpreters differed in interpreting certain verses, offering various explanations that cannot be reconciled. It is impossible that all of them were heard from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him; if one were heard, the others would be rejected. This decisively shows that each interpreter spoke according to the meaning that appeared to him through his own reasoning. For example, regarding the letters at the beginning of some chapters, they gave seven different explanations that cannot be harmonized: some said “Alif Lam Ra” are letters from “Al-Rahman”; others said Alif stands for Allah, Lam for Latif, and Ra for Rahim; and still others said something else. Reconciliation is impossible, so how could all have been heard?

Third: The Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed for Ibn ‘Abbas, may God be pleased with him, saying, “O God, grant him deep understanding in religion and teach him the interpretation.” If interpretation were simply heard like revelation and preserved in the same way, what would be the point of singling him out for this supplication?

Fourth: God Almighty said, “...for those who derive understanding from them” (Qur’an 4:83), affirming for people of knowledge the act of derivation, which is known to go beyond mere hearing. The totality of what we have transmitted from the early generations regarding understanding the Qur’an contradicts this imagined restriction. Thus, it is invalid to require direct hearing for interpretation, and it is permissible for each person to derive meaning from the Qur’an according to his understanding and intellectual capacity.

As for the prohibition, it applies in one of two ways:

First: A person has a preconceived opinion or inclination stemming from his nature or desires, and he interprets the Qur’an to align with that opinion and desire, using it to argue for his objective. Had he not held that opinion or desire, that meaning would not have occurred to him from the Qur’an. This sometimes occurs with knowledge—as when someone argues with certain Qur’anic verses to validate his innovation, knowing that this is not the intended meaning but using it to confuse his opponent—and sometimes with ignorance. When a verse is ambiguous, his understanding leans toward the aspect that suits his aim, and he favors that side with his opinion and desire. Thus, he has interpreted by opinion—meaning his opinion drove him to that interpretation; without it, that aspect would not have been favored in his view. Sometimes he may have a sound objective and seeks evidence for it from the Qur’an, arguing from what he knows is not intended—like one who calls to remembrance in the last part of the night and cites the Prophet’s saying, “Take the pre-dawn meal, for in it there is blessing,” claiming it refers to spiritual vigilance, while knowing it actually refers to eating. Or like one who calls to struggle against a hardened heart and says, “God Almighty said, ‘Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed,’” pointing to his own heart and implying that Pharaoh is meant to symbolize it. This type is sometimes used by preachers for sound purposes to embellish speech and attract listeners, though it is not permissible. It is also used by the esoteric sects for corrupt aims, deceiving people and inviting them to their false doctrine, interpreting the Qur’an according to their opinion and sect in matters they know are certainly not intended. These are the first aspect of the prohibition against interpretation by opinion, where “opinion” means corrupt opinion aligned with desire, not sound independent reasoning. “Opinion” encompasses both sound and corrupt, but the one conforming to desire may be specifically termed “opinion.”

Second: Hastening to interpret the Qur’an based on the apparent meaning of Arabic without recourse to transmitted reports and narrations concerning the obscure aspects of the Qur’an, its ambiguous and substituted terms, its ellipses, omissions, implied meanings, and rearrangements. Whoever does not master the apparent interpretation and rushes to derive meanings based solely on Arabic comprehension will often err and fall into the category of those who interpret by opinion. Transmission and hearing are indispensable first for the apparent interpretation, to avoid mistakes; thereafter, understanding and derivation may expand. The obscure aspects that can only be understood through transmission are numerous. We will allude to some of them as examples, so that one may infer the rest and realize that neglecting to first memorize the apparent interpretation is not permissible, nor is there any hope in...

To reach the inner meaning before mastering the outward is invalid. Whoever claims to comprehend the secrets of the Quran without perfecting its outward exegesis is like one who claims to reach the interior of a house before passing through its door, or who claims to understand the intentions of the Turks from their speech while not understanding the Turkish language. For the outward exegesis functions as the instruction in the language, which is indispensable for understanding. Among the necessary disciplines of hearing [the language] are many types, such as omission and ellipsis. Like His saying, exalted is He: "And We gave Thamud the she-camel, a clear sign, but they wronged [with it]" — meaning a clear sign, and they wronged themselves by killing it. One looking only at the outward Arabic might think the intended meaning is that the she-camel was seeing and not blind, and would not know whom they wronged, others or themselves. And His saying, exalted is He: "And they were made to drink into their hearts the calf because of their disbelief" — meaning the love of the calf, so 'love' is omitted. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "I would have made you taste double the life and double the death" — meaning double the punishment of the living and double the punishment of the dead, so 'punishment' is omitted, and 'the living' and 'the dead' are substituted by mentioning 'life' and 'death'. All of this is permissible in eloquent Arabic. And His saying, exalted is He: "And ask the town where we were and the caravan in which we returned" — meaning 'O people of the town' and 'people of the caravan', so 'people' in both is omitted and implied. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "It became heavy in the heavens and the earth" — meaning it was concealed from the people of the heavens and the earth, for when a thing is concealed it becomes heavy, so the wording is substituted and placed in its position, and 'people' is implied and omitted. And His saying, exalted is He: "And you make your provision that you deny" — meaning the gratitude for your provision. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "And give us what You promised us through Your messengers" — meaning 'on the tongues of Your messengers', so 'tongues' is omitted. And His saying, exalted is He: "Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree" — He meant the Quran, which had been mentioned previously. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "Until it disappeared behind the veil" — He meant the sun, which had been mentioned previously. And His saying, exalted is He: "And those who take besides Him allies [say], 'We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position'" — meaning 'they say: We only worship them...' And His saying, mighty and majestic: "What is [wrong] with these people that they can hardly understand any statement? Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself" — meaning they can hardly understand a statement [in which] they say, 'Whatever good befalls you is from Allah...' For if this were not intended, it would contradict His saying: "Say, 'All is from Allah.'" And the understanding of the Qadariyyah sect would precede from it. Among them is the inverted transmission, like His saying, exalted is He: "And Mount Sinai" — meaning Mount Sinai. "Peace upon the Family of Yasin" — meaning upon Ilyas (Elijah), and it is said Idris, for in the reading of Ibn Mas'ud it is 'Peace upon Idrasin'. Among them is the repeated [word] that cuts the apparent connection of speech, like His saying, mighty and majestic: "And those whom they invoke besides Allah do not create anything, while they are themselves created. They follow not except assumption" — and His saying, mighty and majestic: "Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed, to those who believed among them" — meaning those who were arrogant to those who believed among those who were oppressed. Among them is the advanced and the delayed, which is a place of potential error, like His saying, mighty and majestic: "And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been an obligation [binding] and a specified term" — meaning were it not for the word and a specified term, it would have been binding. And were it not, it would have been a predicate like 'binding'. And His saying, exalted is He: "They ask you as if you are well-informed about it" — meaning they ask you about it as if you are diligent concerning it. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "For them is forgiveness and noble provision. As your Lord brought you out of your home in truth" — this speech is not connected; rather, it refers back to His preceding saying: "Say, 'The spoils of war are for Allah and the Messenger. As your Lord brought you out of your home in truth'" — meaning thus the spoils of war became for you, since you were pleased with your departure while they were averse. Intervening between the speech is the command for piety and other matters. Of this type is His saying, mighty and majestic: "Until you believe in Allah alone, except for the saying of Abraham to his father..." the verse. Among them is the ambiguous, which is the word shared between meanings of a term or a particle. As for the term, like 'thing', 'companion', 'nation', 'spirit', and their like. Allah, exalted is He, said: "Allah presents an example of a slave owned, unable to do a thing" — He meant by it expenditure from what he is provided. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "And Allah presents an example of two men, one of them dumb, unable to do a thing" — meaning the command to justice and uprightness. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "If you follow me, then do not ask me about anything" — He meant by it from the attributes of Lordship, which are the knowledges it is not permissible to ask about until the knower is initiated with them at the time of deserving. And His saying, mighty and majestic: "Or were they created by nothing, or are they the creators?" — meaning without a creator. Perhaps one might imagine from it that it indicates nothing is created except from something. As for 'companion', like His saying, mighty and majestic: "And his companion will say, 'This is what is with me, prepared.' 'Cast into Hell every stubborn disbeliever'" — He meant by it the angel assigned to him.

He said, "His companion said, 'Our Lord, I did not make him transgress, but he was far astray'" — intending by it Satan. As for the term "Ummah" (nation/community), it is applied in eight senses: The Ummah as a group, as in His saying, exalted is He, "He found there a group of people watering [their flocks]"; and the followers of the prophets, as when you say "the Ummah of Muhammad" (peace be upon him); and a man comprehensive in good, who is followed, as in His saying, exalted is He, "Indeed, Abraham was a nation, devoutly obedient to God"; and the Ummah as religion, as in His saying, mighty and majestic, "We found our fathers following a religion"; and the Ummah as a period or time, as in His saying, mighty and majestic, "until a numbered term" and His saying, mighty and majestic, "And remember after a period"; and the Ummah as stature, it is said, "So-and-so has a good Ummah," meaning stature; and a man who is alone in a religion, no one sharing it with him, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Zayd ibn 'Amr ibn Nufayl will be raised as a nation by himself"; and the Ummah as mother, it is said, "This is the Ummah of Zayd," meaning the mother of Zayd. The term "Ruh" (spirit) also occurs in the Qur'an with many meanings, so we shall not prolong by listing them. Likewise, ambiguity may occur in pronouns, such as His saying, mighty and majestic, "So they stirred up thereby dust, and penetrated thereby the center of the gathering" — the first "thereby" refers to the hooves, which are the strikers [of fire], meaning they stirred up dust with the hooves; and the second refers to the raid, which are the raiders at dawn, so they penetrated thereby the gathering of the polytheists, meaning they raided with their gathering. And His saying, exalted is He, "Then We sent down thereby water" — meaning the clouds — "and brought forth thereby all kinds of fruits" — meaning the water. And examples like this in the Qur'an are innumerable. Among them is gradual clarification, as in His saying, mighty and majestic, "The month of Ramadan in which the Qur'an was sent down" — since it was not made clear by it whether it was night or day — and it became clear by His saying, mighty and majestic, "Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed night" — and it was not made clear by it which night — then it became clear by His saying, exalted is He, "Indeed, We sent it down on the Night of Decree." And perhaps it may seem superficially that there is discrepancy between these verses. This and its like are matters in which nothing avails except transmission and hearing. For the Qur'an, from beginning to end, is not devoid of this genre, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, thus encompassing the varieties of their speech: conciseness and prolixity, implication and omission, substitution and precedence and delay, so that it would be a confutation for them and a miracle in their regard. So whoever is content with understanding the apparent Arabic and hastens to interpret the Qur'an without seeking support through hearing and transmission in these matters, he falls into the category of those who interpret the Qur'an by their own opinion — such as understanding from "Ummah" the most famous meaning, so his nature and opinion incline to it; then when he hears it in another context, he inclines his opinion to what he heard of its famous meaning and neglects to follow transmission regarding many of its meanings. This is what can be prohibited, without [prohibiting] comprehending the secrets of meanings, as preceded. So when hearing is attained regarding such matters, the apparent interpretation — which is the translation of the words — is known, and that does not suffice for understanding the realities of the meanings. And the difference between the realities of meanings and the apparent interpretation is grasped by an example: that God, mighty and majestic, said, "And you did not throw when you threw, but God threw." Its apparent interpretation is clear, but the reality of its meaning is obscure, for it affirms throwing and negates it — two contradictory things apparently, unless it is understood that he threw from one aspect and did not throw from another, and from the aspect he did not throw, God, mighty and majestic, threw. Likewise, He said, exalted is He, "Fight them; God will punish them by your hands." If they are the fighters, how can God, glorified is He, be the punisher? And if God, exalted is He, is the punisher by moving their hands, then what is the meaning of commanding them to fight? The reality of this is drawn from a vast ocean of the sciences of unveilings, which the apparent interpretation cannot suffice for. It is to know the aspect of the connection of actions to the originated power, and to understand the aspect of the connection of power to the power of God, mighty and majestic, until, after clarifying many obscure matters, the truth of His saying, mighty and majestic, "And you did not throw when you threw, but God threw" becomes unveiled. Perhaps if a lifetime were spent in uncovering the secrets of this meaning and what is connected to its premises and consequences, the lifetime would end before exhausting all its consequences. And there is not a single word of the Qur'an but that its verification requires something like that. Only to those firmly grounded in knowledge are its secrets unveiled according to the abundance of their knowledge, the purity of their hearts, the abundance of their motives for reflection, and their devotion to seeking. And each one has a limit in ascending to a degree higher than his; as for complete attainment, there is no hope for it, even if the sea were ink and the trees pens. For the secrets of God's words have no end; the seas would be exhausted before the words of God, mighty and majestic, are exhausted. From this perspective, creation varies in understanding after sharing in the knowledge of the apparent interpretation. And the apparent interpretation is indispensable. An example is what some possessors of hearts understood from his saying (peace be upon him) in his prostration: "I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment, and I seek refuge in You from You."

I cannot count the praises upon You; You are as You have praised Yourself. It is said that he was commanded: "Prostrate and draw near," and he found nearness in prostration. Then he gazed upon the attributes and sought refuge in some from others, for pleasure and displeasure are two attributes. Then his nearness increased, and the first nearness was encompassed within it, so he ascended to the Essence and said: "I seek refuge in You from You." Then his nearness increased through that which made him shy from seeking refuge upon the carpet of nearness, so he resorted to praise and praised by saying: "I cannot count the praises upon You." Then he knew that this was inadequacy, so he said: "You are as You have praised Yourself." These are insights opened for the possessors of hearts. Then beyond this are depths: understanding the meaning of nearness and its specific connection to prostration, and the meaning of seeking refuge from one attribute by another, and from Him by Him. The secrets of this are many, and the interpretation of the outward does not indicate it. Nor is the wording contradictory to the outward interpretation; rather, it is a completion of it and an arrival at its core from its outward. This is what we present for understanding the inward meanings, not what contradicts the outward. And God knows best.

Here ends the Book of the Etiquettes of Recitation. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, and prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, and upon every chosen servant from among all the worlds, and upon the family of Muhammad and his companions, and peace. To follow, if God Almighty wills, is the Book of Remembrances and Supplications. And God is the One whose help is sought; there is no lord but He.

Mentioned by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Isti'ab without a chain. And reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a good chain, except that he said al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah instead of Khalid ibn 'Uqbah. And likewise, Ibn Ishaq mentioned it in the Sirah similarly.
[13] A hadith: "The most hypocritical of my community are its reciters." Reported by Ahmad from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir and 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr, and in both is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[14] A hadith states: "Recite the Quran as long as it restrains you; for if it does not restrain you, then you are not reciting it." Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with a weak chain.

[17] A hadith states: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr to complete the recitation of the Quran every week." This is agreed upon from his narration.

Awf said: "I asked the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, 'How do you divide the Quran?' They said: 'Three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, and the portion of the Mufassal (the shorter chapters).'" In a narration by Al-Tabarani: "We asked the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, 'How did the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, apportion the Quran?' They said: 'He would apportion it in threes,'" and he mentioned it as a raised narration (marfu'), and its chain is good.

[19] A hadith: "Umm Salamah described the recitation of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and she described it as a clear recitation, letter by letter." Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and Al-Tirmidhi said it is good and sound.

O God, remind me of what I have forgotten from it, teach me what I am ignorant of from it, grant me its recitation during the hours of the night and the ends of the day, and make it a proof for me, O Lord of the worlds.'" Narrated by Abu Mansur Al-Muzaffar ibn Al-Husayn Al-Arjani in *Fada'il al-Qur'an* and Abu Bakr ibn Al-Dahhak in *Al-Shama'il*, both from the path of Abu Dharr Al-Harawi from the narration of Dawud ibn Qays, disconnected (mu'dal).

[25] A hadith states: "The superiority of reciting the Quran secretly over reciting it aloud is like the superiority of giving charity secretly over giving it openly." And in another wording: "One who recites the Quran aloud is like one who gives charity openly, and one who recites the Quran secretly is like one who gives charity secretly." Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir with the second wording, and Al-Tirmidhi graded it as good.

[26] A hadith states: "A deed done in secret is superior to a deed done openly by seventy-fold." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in *Al-Shu'ab* from the narration of 'A'ishah.

Abu Dawud transmitted it from the narration of Al-Bayadi without the phrase "between Maghrib and 'Isha'," and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* from the narration of 'Ali before 'Isha' and after it, and in it is Al-Harith Al-A'war, who is weak.

[29] A hadith: "He heard a group of Companions reciting aloud in the night prayer and approved of that." In the two Sahih collections: from the narration of 'A'ishah: "A man stood in the night and recited, raising his voice with the Quran. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'May God have mercy on so-and-so...' the hadith." And from the narration of Abu Musa: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'If you had seen me as I listened to your recitation last night...' the hadith." And from another narration: "I only recognize the voices of the Ash'ari group by the Quran when they enter at night, and I recognize their dwellings by their voices in reciting the Quran...' the hadith."

[30] A hadith states: "When one of you stands for prayer at night, let him recite aloud, for the angels and the dwellers...

The abode listens to his recitation and prays with his prayers. It was narrated similarly with additions by Abu Bakr al-Bazzar, Nasr al-Maqdisi in "Al-Mawa'iz," and Abu Shuja' from the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal, and it is a munkar (rejected) and disconnected hadith.

[31] The hadith of his passing by Abu Bakr while he was reciting quietly, by 'Umar while he was reciting aloud, and by Bilal while he was reciting from this surah and that surah—the hadith has preceded in the chapter on prayer.

[32] The hadith: He was waiting for 'A'ishah, and she was delayed. He said, "What kept you?" She said, "O Messenger of Allah, I heard the recitation of a man whose voice I have never heard more beautiful." So he stood until he listened to him for a long time, then returned and said, "This is Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah. Praise be to Allah who has placed the likes of him in my nation." Reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and the men of its chain are trustworthy.

[33] The hadith: He listened one night to 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, and with him were Abu Bakr and 'Umar. They stood for a long time, then he said, "Whoever wishes to recite the Qur'an as fresh as when it was revealed, let him recite it according to the recitation of Ibn Umm 'Abd." Reported by Ahmad and al-Nasa'i in "Al-Kubra" from the hadith of 'Umar, and by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud that Abu Bakr and 'Umar gave him the glad tidings that the Messenger of Allah said, "Whoever loves to recite the Qur'an..." The hadith. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan sahih.

[34] The hadith: That he said to Ibn Mas'ud, "Recite." He said, "O Messenger of Allah, shall I recite while it was revealed to you?" He said, "I love to hear it from others." The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud.

[35] The hadith: He listened to the recitation of Abu Musa and said, "Indeed, this one has been given something from the psalms of the family of Dawud." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa.

[36] The hadith: "Whoever listens to a verse from the Book of Allah, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection." And in the report: "Ten good deeds are written for him." Reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever listens to a verse from the Book of Allah, a multiplied good deed is written for him, and whoever recites it, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection." There is weakness and discontinuity in it.

[37] The hadith: That he recited "Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim" and repeated it twenty times. Reported by Abu Dharr al-Harawi in his "Mu'jam" from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

He said, "No, by the One who split the seed and created the soul, except that Allah grants a servant understanding in His Book." The hadith. And in al-Bukhari with the wording: "Do you have from the Messenger of Allah anything not in the Qur'an?" And in a narration: "And he said once: 'What is not with the people.'" And in Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i: "So we said, 'Did the Messenger of Allah entrust you with something he did not entrust to the people?' He said, 'No, except what is in this book of mine.'" The hadith, and he did not mention understanding in the Qur'an.

[40] The hadith: "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze upon the dominion." It has preceded in the chapter on prayer.

[41] The hadith: "When my nation exalts the dinar and the dirham, the awe of Islam will be stripped from them, and when they abandon enjoining good, they will be deprived of the blessing of revelation." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Book of Enjoining Good" as a mursal from the hadith of al-Fadl ibn 'Iyad, who said it was mentioned from the Prophet of Allah.

[42] The hadith: That he said to Ibn Mas'ud, "Recite to me." The hadith has preceded in the previous chapter.

[43] The hadith: "Recite the Qur'an as long as your hearts are in harmony with it and your skins are softened by it. But when you differ, you are not reciting it." And in some versions: "When you differ, then rise from it." Agreed upon from the hadith of Jundub ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali in the second wording, without his saying "and your skins are softened."

[44] The hadith: "The most beautiful of people in voice with the Qur'an is the one whom, when you hear him recite, you see that he fears Allah Almighty." Reported by Ibn Majah with a weak chain.

[45] The hadith: "No one hears the Qur'an from anyone more desirable than one who fears Allah Almighty." Reported by Abu 'Abdullah al-Hakim as mentioned by Abu al-Qasim al-Ghafiqi in "The Book of the Virtues of the Qur'an."

[46] The hadith: The Messenger of Allah passed away leaving twenty thousand Companions, and among them only...

Six individuals differed regarding two of them, and most of them memorized a surah or two. Among their scholars, the one who memorized Al-Baqarah and Al-An'am was counted. I said: His statement that he died leaving twenty thousand—perhaps he meant in Medina; otherwise, it has been narrated from Abu Zur'ah al-Razi that he said: There passed away from among the Companions one hundred and fourteen thousand who narrated from him and heard from him. As for those who memorized the Qur'an during his time, in the two Sahihs from the hadith of Anas, he said: The Qur'an was compiled during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, by four, all of whom were from the Ansar: Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Zayd, and Abu Zayd. I said: Who is Abu Zayd? He said: One of my uncles. Ibn Abi Shaybah added, like the author, from the narration of al-Sha'bi in a mursal form: and Abu al-Darda' and Sa'id ibn 'Ubayd. In the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: Seek the recitation of the Qur'an from four: from 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, Salim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b. Ibn al-Anbari narrated with his chain to 'Umar: The virtuous among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in the early part of this ummah were those who memorized from the Qur'an a surah or the like. The hadith, and its chain is weak. Al-Tirmidhi, who graded it hasan, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sent an expedition, and they were numerous. He tested their recitation, and each man recited what he had of the Qur'an. He came to a man who was the youngest among them and said: What do you have, O so-and-so? He said: I have such and such, and Surah Al-Baqarah. He said: Do you have Surah Al-Baqarah? He said: Yes. He said: Go, for you are their leader. The hadith.

[47] The hadith of the man who came to learn and reached the verse: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it." He said: This is sufficient for me, and he departed. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: The man departed as a faqih. Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: A man came to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and said: Recite to me, O Messenger of Allah. The hadith includes: So the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, recited to him "Idha zulzilat" until he finished it. The man said: By the One who sent you with the truth, I will never add to these two. Then the man turned away. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: The man has succeeded, the man has succeeded. In Ahmad and al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra from the hadith of Sa'sa'ah, the uncle of al-Farazdaq, that he was the companion of the nussah, and he said: It is sufficient for me; I do not care if I hear nothing else.

[48] The hadith: Whoever interprets the Qur'an by his own opinion, let him take his seat in the Fire. Previously mentioned in the third chapter of Knowledge.

[49] The hadith: Reports and traditions indicating that in the meanings of the Qur'an there is ample scope for people of understanding. Previously mentioned is the saying of 'Ali in the chapter: Except that Allah grants a servant understanding in His Book.

[50] The hadith: Verily, the Qur'an has an outer and an inner, a limit and a point of ascent. Previously mentioned in the Foundations of Belief.

[51] The hadith: The Prophet, peace be upon him, repeating the basmalah twenty times. Previously mentioned in the preceding chapter.

[52] The hadith: Recite the Qur'an and seek its rare aspects. Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording: "Make clear," and its chain is weak.

[53] The hadith of 'Ali: By the One who sent me with the truth, my ummah will split upon the foundation of its religion and its community into seventy-two sects, all of them astray and leading astray, calling to the Fire. When that occurs, then hold fast to the Book of Allah, for in it is news of those before you. The lengthy hadith is found in al-Tirmidhi without mention of the splitting of the ummah, with the wording: Indeed, there will be a misleading trial. I said: What is the way out from it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: The Book of Allah, in it is news of those before you. He mentioned it with differences and said it is gharib, and its chain is unknown.

[54] The hadith of Hudhayfah regarding differences and division after him. I said: What do you command me if I live to see that? He said: Learn the Book of Allah and act according to what is in it. The hadith reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra includes: Learn the Book of Allah and follow what is in it, three times.

[55] The hadith of his supplication for Ibn 'Abbas: O Allah, give him understanding in the religion and teach him the interpretation. Previously mentioned in the second chapter of Knowledge.

[56] The hadith: Take the pre-dawn meal, for indeed in the suhur there is blessing. Previously mentioned in the third chapter of Knowledge.

[58] The hadith of his saying, peace be upon him, in his prostration: I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment. The hadith reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'A'ishah.
