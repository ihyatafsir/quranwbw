The Book of Love, Longing, Intimacy, and Contentment

This is the sixth book of the quarter of the salvations from the book The Revival of the Religious Sciences.

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who has purified the hearts of His saints from turning toward the adornment and splendor of this world, and cleansed their innermost beings from beholding anything other than His presence. Then He singled them out to dwell upon the carpet of His majesty, then manifested to them through His names and attributes until they shone with the lights of His knowledge. Then He unveiled for them the radiance of His Countenance until they were consumed by the fire of His love. Then He veiled Himself from them in the essence of His grandeur until they wandered lost in the wilderness of His sovereignty and greatness. Whenever they trembled at witnessing the essence of His majesty, they were overwhelmed by such awe that dimmed the face of intellect and insight. And whenever they despaired and sought to turn away, they were called from the pavilions of beauty: "Patience, O you who despair of attaining the Truth due to ignorance and haste!" Thus they remained, suspended between rejection and acceptance, repulsion and arrival, drowned in the ocean of His knowledge and burning in the fire of His love. And blessings upon Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, in the perfection of his prophethood, and upon his family and companions, the masters of creation and its leaders, the guides of truth and its standard-bearers, abundant peace.

Now then: Love for God is the ultimate goal among spiritual stations and the highest peak among degrees. There is no station beyond attaining love except that it is a fruit from its fruits and a follower from its consequences, such as longing, intimacy, contentment, and their like. And there is nothing before love except that it is a prelude from its preludes, such as repentance, patience, asceticism, and others. As for the rest of the spiritual stations, even if their occurrence is rare, hearts have not been devoid of faith in their possibility. However, the love of God Almighty—faith in its possibility has become so rare that some scholars have denied its possibility, saying: "It has no meaning except persistence in obeying God Almighty, while the reality of love is impossible except with similarity and likeness." Since they denied intimacy, longing, the delight of intimate discourse, and all the requisites and consequences of love, it is necessary to lift the veil from this matter.

In this book, we shall expound: the demonstration of the proofs of the Sacred Law concerning love, then the exposition of its true nature and its causes, then the exposition that none is truly deserving of love except God, the Exalted, then the exposition that the greatest of delights is the delight of gazing upon the countenance of God, the Exalted, then the exposition of the reason for the increase of the delight of gazing in the Hereafter over the knowledge in this world, then the exposition of the causes that strengthen the love of God, the Exalted, then the exposition of the reason for the disparity among people in love, then the exposition of the reason for the deficiency of understandings in knowing God, the Exalted, then the exposition of the meaning of longing, then the exposition of God's love for the servant, then the discourse on the signs of the servant's love for God, the Exalted, then the exposition of the meaning of intimacy with God, the Exalted, then the exposition of the meaning of expansion in intimacy, then the discourse on the meaning of contentment and the exposition of its virtue, then the exposition of its true reality, then the exposition that supplication and aversion to sins do not contradict it, and likewise fleeing from sins, then the exposition of scattered narratives and sayings of the lovers. These are all the expositions of this book.

Explanation of the Evidences from the Sacred Law Regarding the Servant's Love for God, Exalted is He

Know that the Ummah is unanimously agreed that love for God Almighty and His Messenger ﷺ is an obligation. How can something that has no existence be made obligatory, and how can love be interpreted as obedience when obedience is a consequence of love and its fruit? Thus, it is necessary that love comes first, and only thereafter does one obey the beloved. The affirmation of love for God Almighty is indicated by His exalted saying, "He loves them, and they love Him," and His saying, "And those who believe are stronger in love for God." This is evidence for affirming love and affirming its varying degrees.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, made love for God a condition of faith in many narrations, as when Abu Razin al-‘Uqayli asked, “O Messenger of God, what is faith?” He replied, “That God and His Messenger be dearer to you than all else.”

And in another narration: "None of you truly believes until Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than all else."

And in another narration: "The servant does not believe until I am more beloved to him than his family, his wealth, and all people." In one version: "and than his own self." How can this be, when God Almighty has said: "Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers..." [Qur'an 9:24]? This was only stated in the context of admonition and reproach.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded concerning love, saying: "Love God for what He nourishes you with from His blessings, and love me for the love God has for me."

It is narrated that a man said: "O Messenger of God, I love you." He (peace be upon him) said: "Prepare for poverty." The man said: "I love God, the Exalted." He said: "Prepare for affliction."

And from Umar, may God be pleased with him, who said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, looked at Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr as he approached, wearing a tanned sheepskin that he had girded himself with. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Look at this man whose heart God has illumined. I saw him with his parents, who fed him the finest food and drink. Then the love of God and His Messenger called him to what you see."

In the famous tradition, "When the Angel of Death came to take his soul, Abraham, peace be upon him, said to him: 'Have you ever seen a friend cause his friend to die?' Then God, exalted is He, revealed to him: 'Have you ever seen a lover who hates meeting his beloved?' So he said: 'O Angel of Death, take it now.'" This is only found in a servant who loves God with all his heart. Thus, when he knows that death is the means to the meeting, his heart yearns for it, and he has no beloved other than Him to turn his attention toward.

Our Prophet ﷺ said in his supplication: "O Allah, grant me Your love, and the love of that which brings me nearer to Your love, and make Your love more beloved to me than cool water."

A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "O Messenger of God, when is the Hour?" He said, "What have you prepared for it?" He replied, "I have not prepared much prayer or fasting for it, except that I love God and His Messenger." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to him, "A person is with the one he loves." Anas said: "I never saw the Muslims rejoice over anything after embracing Islam as they rejoiced over that."

Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: Whoever tastes the pure love of God, the Exalted, is thereby preoccupied from seeking this world and feels estranged from all of humankind.

Al-Hasan said: Whoever knows his Lord loves Him, and whoever knows the world renounces it. The believer does not amuse himself until he becomes heedless, and when he reflects, he grieves.
Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: Verily, among God's creation are those whom not even Paradise and its bliss distract from Him—so how could they be distracted from Him by the world?

It is related that Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by three men whose bodies had become emaciated and whose complexions had changed. He said to them, "What has brought you to the state I see?" They said, "Fear of the Fire." He said, "It is God's due to grant security to those who fear." Then he passed beyond them to three others, and they were even more emaciated and altered. He said, "What has brought you to the state I see?" They said, "Longing for Paradise." He said, "It is God's due to give you what you hope for." Then he passed beyond them to three others, and they were the most emaciated and altered, as if their faces were mirrors of light. He said, "What has brought you to the state I see?" They said, "Love for God, the Mighty and Majestic." He said, "You are the ones brought near, you are the ones brought near, you are the ones brought near."

And 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: I passed by a man standing in the snow and said, "Do you not feel the cold?" He replied, "Whoever is preoccupied by the love of God does not feel the cold."

From Sari al-Saqati: On the Day of Resurrection, the nations will be called by their prophets, peace be upon them, and it will be said: "O community of Moses, O community of Jesus, O community of Muhammad." Except for the lovers of God Almighty, for they will be called, "O friends of God, come forth to God, glorified be He," and their hearts will nearly burst with joy.

Haram ibn Hayyan said: When a believer knows his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, he loves Him; and when he loves Him, he turns to Him; and when he tastes the sweetness of turning to Him, he no longer looks upon this world with the eye of desire, nor upon the Hereafter with the eye of weariness, for it grieves him in this world and gives him rest in the Hereafter.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: His pardon encompasses all sins, so what of His good pleasure? And His good pleasure encompasses all hopes, so what of His love? And His love bewilders the intellects, so what of His intimate friendship? And His intimate friendship makes one forget all besides Him, so what of His subtle grace?

And in some scriptures: My servant, I am the Truth for you, a Lover; so by My right over you, be a lover for Me.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: A mustard seed's weight of love is dearer to me than seventy years of worship devoid of love.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: My God, I dwell in Your courtyard, occupied with Your praise. While I was small, You drew me to Yourself, clothed me in knowledge of You, granted me access to Your subtle grace, and moved me and turned me among deeds—as a covering, as repentance, as renunciation, as longing, as contentment, as love—giving me to drink from Your pools and leaving me to wander in Your gardens, constant in Your command and enraptured by Your speech. And when my lips have grown moist and my bird has taken flight, how should I turn away from You today, now that I am grown, when I became accustomed to this from You while I was small? So let me have, as long as I remain circling You, a constant murmur and, in supplication to You, a persistent whisper, for I am a lover, and every lover is enraptured with his beloved and turned away from other than his beloved.

And there has come down concerning the love of God, exalted is He, from the reports and traditions that which no enumerator can encompass, and that is a manifest matter. The obscurity lies only in ascertaining its true meaning, so let us occupy ourselves with that.

Explanation of the true nature of love, its causes, and the verification of the meaning of the servant's love for God Almighty.

Know that the objective of this chapter is not unveiled except by comprehending the reality of love in its essence, then by knowing its conditions and causes, and thereafter by examining the realization of its meaning in relation to God, exalted be He. The first matter that ought to be ascertained is that love cannot be conceived except after knowledge and perception, for a person loves only what he knows. Thus, it is inconceivable for an inanimate object to be characterized by love; rather, it is a particular attribute of the living, perceiving being. Perceived objects, in their division, are divided into that which agrees with the nature of the perceiver, suits him, and delights him; into that which opposes him, repels him, and pains him; and into that which has no effect on him in terms of pain or pleasure. Everything in whose perception there is pleasure and comfort is beloved to the perceiver, and that in whose perception there is pain is detested by the perceiver. That which is free from the consequence of pain or pleasure is not described as being beloved or hated. Therefore, every delightful thing is beloved to the one who delights in it, and the meaning of it being beloved is that there is in the nature an inclination toward it, while the meaning of it being detested is that there is in the nature an aversion from it. Thus, love is an expression for the inclination of nature toward the delightful thing. If that inclination becomes firm and strong, it is called passion. Hatred is an expression for the aversion of nature from the painful, burdensome thing; if it becomes strong, it is called abhorrence. This is a fundamental principle regarding the true meaning of love that must be known.

The second principle: Since love follows perception and knowledge, it inevitably divides according to the division of perceived objects and the senses. For each sense perceives a type of perceived objects, and for each of them there is pleasure in some perceived objects, and due to that pleasure, the nature has an inclination toward them, so they become beloved by the sound nature. The pleasure of the eye lies in seeing and perceiving beautiful sights, lovely and pleasing forms that are delightful. The pleasure of the ear lies in melodious, harmonious sounds. The pleasure of smell lies in pleasant fragrances. The pleasure of taste lies in flavors. The pleasure of touch lies in softness and smoothness.

Since these sensory perceptions are pleasurable, they become beloved—meaning the sound nature inclines toward them. Thus the Messenger of God ﷺ said: “Three things from your world have been made beloved to me: perfume, women, and the coolness of my eye has been placed in prayer.” He called perfume beloved, though it is known that sight and hearing have no share in it; rather, only smell. And he called women beloved, though in them there is no share except for sight and touch, not smell, taste, or hearing. And he called prayer the coolness of the eye and made it the most profound of beloved things, though it is known that the five senses do not partake of it; rather, it is a sixth sense whose seat is the heart, which none perceives except one who possesses a heart. The pleasures of the five senses are shared by beasts and humans alike. If love were confined to what the five senses perceive—so that it might be said that God, exalted is He, is not perceived by the senses nor represented in imagination, and thus is not loved—then the distinctive quality of the human being would be nullified, along with that by which he is distinguished: the sixth sense, expressed as intellect, light, heart, or whatever terms you wish—there is no dispute in this. But far from it! The inner insight is stronger than outward sight, and the heart perceives more intensely than the eye. The beauty of meanings perceived by the intellect is greater than the beauty of outward forms beheld by the eyes. Thus, inevitably, the delight of the heart in what it perceives of noble, divine realities—which are exalted beyond being grasped by the senses—is more complete and profound. Therefore, the inclination of the sound nature and sound intellect toward it is stronger. And love means nothing but an inclination toward that in whose perception there is pleasure—as will be detailed later. So none denies the love of God, exalted is He, except one whom deficiency has confined to the rank of beasts, never transcending sensory perception at all.

The Third Principle: It is not hidden from man that he loves himself, nor is it hidden that he may love another for the sake of himself. But is it conceivable to love another for that other's own sake, not for one's own? This is something that may perplex the weak, to the point that they imagine it inconceivable for a person to love another for that other's own sake unless some benefit returns to the lover beyond merely perceiving the beloved's essence. The truth is that this is both conceivable and existent. Let us, therefore, clarify the causes and categories of love.

Its explanation is that the primary beloved for every living being is his own self and essence. The meaning of his love for himself is that in his nature there is an inclination toward the permanence of his existence and an aversion to its non-existence and annihilation. For what is loved by nature is that which is agreeable to the lover, and what thing is more perfectly agreeable than his own self and the permanence of his existence? And what thing has greater opposition and aversion for him than his non-existence and annihilation? For this reason, man loves the permanence of existence and hates death and killing—not merely for what he fears after death, nor merely from dread of death's agonies. Rather, even if he were snatched away without pain and caused to die without reward or punishment, he would not consent to it and would be averse to it. He does not love death, non-existence, and pure nothingness except when enduring a pain in life. Whenever he is afflicted by a trial, his beloved is the removal of that trial. If he loves non-existence, he does not love it because it is non-existence, but because within it lies the removal of the trial. Thus, annihilation and non-existence are detested, and the permanence of existence is beloved.

And just as the permanence of existence is beloved, so too is the perfection of existence. For deficiency is a non-existence relative to the missing degree, and it is an annihilation in relation to it. Annihilation and non-existence are detested in attributes, and the perfection of existence—just as it is beloved in the essence itself—the existence of perfect attributes is beloved, just as the permanence of the root of existence is beloved. This is an instinct within natural dispositions by the decree of God's established way: "And never will you find in the way of Allah any change."

Thus, the primary beloved for a human being is his own self, then the soundness of his limbs, then his wealth, his children, his kin, and his friends. The limbs are beloved and their soundness is sought because the perfection of existence and the continuity of existence depend upon them. Wealth is beloved because it is also an instrument for the continuity and perfection of existence, and likewise all other means. Therefore, a human loves these things not for their own essences, but because his share in the continuity and perfection of existence is tied to them. Indeed, he even loves his child—though no benefit may reach him from the child—and endures hardships for his sake because the child succeeds him in existence after his own non-existence. Thus, in the survival of his progeny there is a kind of survival for him. Due to his intense love for the survival of his own self, he loves the survival of the one who stands in his place, as if he were a part of him, since he is incapable of aspiring to the eternal survival of his own self. Indeed, if he were given the choice between his own killing and the killing of his child—while his nature remained balanced—he would prefer the survival of his own self over the survival of his child, because the survival of his child resembles his survival from one aspect, yet it is not his actual, realized survival. Similarly, his love for his relatives and kin reverts to his love for the perfection of his own self, for he sees himself as abundant through them, strong because of them, and adorned by their perfections. For kin, wealth, and external means are like a wing that perfects a human being. And the perfection and continuity of existence are beloved by nature, without doubt. Therefore, the primary beloved for every living being is his own self, the perfection of his self, and the continuity of all that; and what is hateful to him is the opposite of that. This is the first of the causes.

The second cause is beneficence, for man is a servant of kindness. Hearts are naturally disposed to love those who treat them well and to dislike those who mistreat them. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "O God, do not grant a wicked person a favor over me, lest my heart become attached to him." This indicates that the heart's love for a benefactor is compelling and cannot be resisted; it is an innate disposition and a natural constitution that cannot be altered. Through this cause, a person may come to love a stranger with whom he has no kinship or connection. If examined, this reverts to the first cause, for the benefactor is one who provides wealth, aid, and all the means that lead to the continuation and perfection of existence, and to the attainment of fortunes that prepare one's being. However, the distinction is that a person's own limbs are beloved because through them lies the perfection of his existence, and they are the very perfection sought. As for the benefactor, he is not the very perfection sought but may be a cause for it, like a physician who is a cause for the continued health of the limbs. Thus, there is a difference between loving health and loving the physician who is the cause of health, for health is desired for its own sake, while the physician is loved not for himself but because he is the cause of health. Similarly, knowledge is beloved and the teacher is beloved, but knowledge is beloved for its own sake, while the teacher is beloved for being the cause of beloved knowledge. Likewise, food and drink are beloved, and dinars are beloved, but food is beloved for its own sake, while dinars are beloved because they are a means to food. Therefore, the distinction ultimately reverts to a difference in rank; otherwise, each one returns to the love of man for himself. Thus, whoever loves a benefactor for his beneficence does not truly love his essence, but loves his beneficent act, which is one of his actions. If it were to cease, the love would cease while his essence remains in reality. If it decreases, the love decreases, and if it increases, the love increases. It is subject to increase and decrease according to the increase and decrease of the beneficence.

The third cause is to love something for its own sake, not for any benefit to be gained beyond its essence, but rather its very essence becomes the benefit itself. This is the true and consummate love whose permanence is assured. Such is the love for beauty and comeliness, for every beauty is beloved to the perceiver of beauty, and that is for the sake of beauty itself, because the perception of beauty is itself delight, and delight is beloved for its own sake, not for another. Do not suppose that love for beautiful forms is conceivable only for the sake of satisfying desire, for the satisfaction of desire is another pleasure for which beautiful forms may be loved. Moreover, the perception of beauty itself is delightful, so it is plausible that it be loved for its own sake. How can this be denied when verdure and flowing water are beloved, not for drinking the water or eating the verdure, nor for gaining any benefit other than the act of seeing itself? Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, took delight in verdure and flowing water. Sound dispositions naturally find pleasure in gazing upon lights, flowers, and lovely birds with beautiful colors, exquisite patterns, and harmonious forms, so much so that a person's sorrows and anxieties are dispelled by looking at them, without seeking any benefit beyond the gaze. These causes are delightful, and every delightful thing is beloved, and every fair and beautiful thing—its perception is not devoid of delight. No one denies that beauty is beloved by nature. If it is established that God is Beautiful, then He is inevitably beloved to those to whom His beauty and majesty are unveiled, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, God is Beautiful and loves beauty."

The Fourth Foundation: On Explaining the Meaning of Beauty and Grace; know that one confined within the narrow confines of imaginings and sensory perceptions may suppose that beauty and grace have no meaning except the proportionality of form and figure, the comeliness of color, such as whiteness tinged with redness, the elongation of stature, and the like of what is described from the beauty of a human person. For the beauty most prevalent among creation is the beauty of sight, and their attention is mostly directed to the images of persons, so they imagine that what is not visible, not imaginable, not formed, and not colored is not estimable, thus they cannot conceive its beauty, and if they cannot conceive its beauty, there is no pleasure in its perception, so it is not beloved. This is an evident error, for beauty is not restricted to the perceptions of sight nor to the proportionality of form and the blending of whiteness with redness. Indeed, we say this is beautiful handwriting and this is a beautiful voice and this is a beautiful horse, nay we say this is a beautiful garment and this is a beautiful vessel. So what meaning is there for the beauty of sound, handwriting, and all other things if beauty were only in form? And it is known that the eye delights in looking at beautiful handwriting, and the ear delights in listening to beautiful, pleasant melodies, and there is nothing among the perceptible things except that it is divided into beautiful and ugly. So what is the meaning of beauty in which these things share? It is necessary, then, to investigate it. This investigation is lengthy, and it is not fitting for the science of spiritual conduct to elaborate upon it, so we state the truth plainly and say: Everything, its beauty and grace lies in the presence of its appropriate, possible perfection. If all its perfections are present, it is in the utmost beauty, and if only some are present, then it has beauty and grace in proportion to what is present. Thus, the beautiful horse is that which gathers all that is fitting for a horse in terms of posture, form, color, beauty of gallop, and ease of charging and retreating upon it; and beautiful handwriting is all that gathers what is fitting for handwriting in terms of proportionality of letters, their parallelism, straightness of their arrangement, and beauty of their order. Everything has a perfection that is fitting for it, and what is fitting for it may be the opposite of what is fitting for another. So the beauty of everything lies in its own fitting perfection. Thus, a human is not beautified by what beautifies a horse, nor is handwriting beautified by what beautifies a voice, nor are vessels beautified by what beautifies garments, and likewise all other things.

If you were to say: "These things, even if not all perceived by the sense of sight, such as sounds and tastes, are nonetheless inseparable from sensory perception—they are sensible objects. Beauty and comeliness in sensible objects are not denied, nor is the attainment of pleasure through perceiving their beauty. This is only denied for what is not apprehended by the senses?" Then know that beauty and comeliness exist beyond sensible objects, for it is said: "This is a good character," "This is a noble knowledge," "This is a praiseworthy conduct," and "These are beautiful morals." By beautiful morals are meant knowledge, intellect, chastity, courage, piety, generosity, and all other virtuous traits. None of these qualities are perceived by the five senses; rather, they are perceived by the inner light of insight. All these beautiful traits are beloved, and the one described by them is naturally loved by those who recognize his attributes. A proof that this is so is that human nature is disposed to love the prophets, peace be upon them, and to love the Companions, may God be pleased with them, even though they have not beheld them. Indeed, love for the founders of schools of thought, such as al-Shafi'i, Abu Hanifah, Malik, and others, is such that a man's love for the founder of his school may exceed the bounds of passion, leading him to spend all his wealth in defending his school and to risk his life fighting those who attack his imam and leader. How much blood has been shed in support of the founders of schools! I wonder: who loves al-Shafi'i, for example? He loves him without ever having seen his form. Had he seen him, he might not have admired his outward appearance. The admiration that compels such excessive love is for his inner form, not his outward form, for his outward form has turned to dust with the dust. He loves him for his inner qualities: religion, piety, abundant knowledge, mastery of religious understanding, and his exertion in imparting the knowledge of the Sacred Law and spreading these virtues in the world. These are beautiful matters whose beauty is perceived only by the light of insight, while the senses are incapable of perceiving them. Likewise, one who loves Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, and prefers him over others, or loves 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, prefers him, and is zealous for him, loves them only for admiration of their inner forms: knowledge, religion, piety, courage, generosity, and the like. It is known that one who loves al-Siddiq, for example, does not love his bones, flesh, skin, limbs, or shape, for all that has vanished, changed, and perished. What remains is that by which al-Siddiq was a Siddiq: the praiseworthy qualities that are the sources of beautiful conduct. Thus, love remains through the permanence of those qualities despite the disappearance of all forms. Those qualities all ultimately refer to knowledge and capability—when one knows the realities of matters and is able to compel himself to act upon them by subduing his desires. All virtuous traits branch from these two attributes, and they are not perceived by the senses. Their place in the totality of the body is an indivisible part, and that is what is truly beloved. This indivisible part has no form, shape, or color visible to the eye that would cause it to be loved for that reason. Therefore, beauty exists in conduct. Even if beautiful conduct were to issue from one without knowledge and insight, it would not necessitate love. What is beloved is the source of beautiful conduct, which is noble character and virtuous qualities, all of which ultimately refer to the perfection of knowledge and capability. This is naturally beloved and not perceived by the senses. Indeed, if we wish to endear to a child, left to his natural disposition, someone absent or present, alive or dead, we have no means except by elaborating in describing him with courage, generosity, knowledge, and all other noble traits. Whenever he believes that, he cannot restrain himself and is unable not to love him. Did the Companions, may God be pleased with them, prevail, and did the hatred of Abu Jahl and the hatred of Iblis, may God curse him, come about except through elaboration in describing merits and faults that are not perceived by the senses? Rather, when people described Hatim as generous and Khalid as courageous, hearts loved them by necessity. This is not due to gazing upon a sensible form nor due to any benefit the lover attains from them. Indeed, when it is recounted of kings in some regions of the earth that they practice justice, benevolence, and bestow good, love for them overcomes hearts, despite despair of their benevolence reaching the lovers due to the distance of their abode and the remoteness of their lands.

Therefore, human love is not confined solely to those who have shown them kindness. Rather, the benevolent person is beloved in their very essence, even if their kindness never reaches the lover at all. This is because all beauty and goodness are beloved, and form encompasses both the apparent and the hidden. Beauty and goodness include both. Apparent forms are perceived by the outward sight, while hidden forms are perceived by the inward insight. Thus, whoever is deprived of the inward insight does not perceive them, takes no delight in them, feels no love for them, and is not drawn to them. And for whom the inward realm holds greater sway than the outward senses, their love for inward meanings is greater than their love for outward meanings. How vast is the difference between one who loves a painted image on a wall for the beauty of its outward form, and one who loves a prophet from among the prophets for the beauty of his inward form.

The fifth cause: the hidden affinity between the lover and the beloved, for indeed two persons may have love firmly established between them not due to beauty or fortune, but merely through a correspondence of spirits, as it is said: "Thus, what is acquainted among them unites, and what is estranged among them diverges." We have elaborated on this in the Book of the Etiquettes of Companionship, in the discussion of love for the sake of God; so let it be sought from there, for it is also among the wonders of the causes of love. Therefore, the categories of love ultimately revert to five causes: It is a person's love for the existence, perfection, and permanence of his own self; his love for one who benefits him in what pertains to the continuity of his existence and assists in his preservation and wards off destruction from him; his love for one who is inherently benevolent to people, even if not benevolent specifically to him; his love for everything that is beautiful in its essence, whether among apparent forms or inner realities; and his love for one with whom he shares a hidden, inner affinity. If these causes were to converge in a single individual, love would undoubtedly multiply, as if a person were a child beautiful in form, excellent in character, perfect in knowledge, sound in judgment, benevolent to creation, and dutiful to his parents—he would be loved without doubt to the utmost degree of love. The strength of love after the gathering of these qualities is according to the strength of these traits in themselves; if these attributes are at the highest degrees of perfection, then love is undoubtedly at the highest degree. Thus, it has now become clear that all these causes cannot be conceived in their perfection and conjunction except in relation to God, exalted is He. Therefore, none truly deserves love except God, glorious and exalted is He.

Explanation that the One deserving of love is God alone

And whoever loves other than God, not in relation to His connection to God, that is due to his ignorance and deficiency in knowing God the Exalted. Love for the Messenger ﷺ is praiseworthy because it is the very love of God the Exalted, and likewise love for the scholars and the pious, for the beloved of the Beloved is beloved, and the messenger of the Beloved is beloved, and the lover of the Beloved is beloved. All of this returns to love of the Origin and does not extend beyond it to another. Thus, in truth, for those of insight there is no beloved except God the Exalted, and none deserving of love but Him. To clarify this, we return to the five causes we mentioned and show that they are all combined in the right of God the Exalted in their totality, and are not found in other than Him except individually. They are a reality in the right of God the Exalted, while their existence in the right of another is illusion and fancy, a pure metaphor with no reality to it. Once this is established, it becomes clear to every possessor of insight the opposite of what the weak in intellect and heart imagined regarding the impossibility of truly loving God the Exalted, and it becomes evident that true realization necessitates that you love no one other than God the Exalted.

As for the first cause: it is man's love for his own self, its permanence, perfection, and continued existence, and his aversion to its annihilation, non-existence, deficiency, and whatever cuts off its perfection. This is the innate disposition of every living being, and it is inconceivable that one should be free from it. This necessarily entails the utmost love for God, exalted be He. For whoever knows himself and knows his Lord knows with certainty that he has no existence from his own essence; rather, the existence of his essence, the permanence of his existence, and the perfection of his existence are from God, to God, and by God. He is the Inventor who brings him into being, He is the One who sustains him, and He is the One who perfects his existence by creating attributes of perfection and creating the means that lead to it—He who creates guidance for employing those means. Otherwise, the servant, from the standpoint of his own essence, has no existence from himself; rather, he is pure effacement and sheer non-existence were it not for the grace of God, exalted be He, upon him through bringing him into being. And he would perish immediately after his existence were it not for the grace of God upon him through preservation. And he would be deficient after existence were it not for the grace of God upon him through perfecting his creation. In sum, there is nothing in existence that subsists by itself except the Self-Subsisting, Living One who is established by His own essence. Everything other than Him subsists by Him. Thus, if the knower loves his own self, and the existence of his self is derived from another, then necessarily he loves the One who bestows his existence and perpetuates it—if he knows Him as Creator, Originator, Inventor, Sustainer, Self-Subsisting, and the One who establishes others. If he does not love Him, it is due to his ignorance of himself and his Lord. Love is the fruit of knowledge; it vanishes with its absence, weakens with its weakness, and strengthens with its strength. For this reason, al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, said: "Whoever knows his Lord loves Him, and whoever knows the world abstains from it." How can it be conceived that a man loves himself but does not love his Lord, by whom his own self subsists? It is known that one afflicted by the heat of the sun, since he loves shade, necessarily loves the trees by which the shade subsists. And everything in existence in relation to the power of God, exalted be He, is like shade in relation to trees and light in relation to the sun, for all are traces of His power, and the existence of all follows from His existence, just as the existence of light follows from the sun and the existence of shade follows from trees. Indeed, this analogy is sound in relation to the fancies of the common people, for they imagine that light is an effect of the sun, overflowing from it and existing through it. Yet this is pure error when it becomes unveiled to the possessors of hearts—a unveiling clearer than the sight of eyes—that light is obtained from the power of God, exalted be He, through creation at the occurrence of opposition between the sun and dense bodies, just as the light of the sun, its essence, its form, and its image are also obtained from the power of God, exalted be He. But the purpose of analogies is comprehension, so one should not seek absolute truths in them. Therefore, if man's love for himself is necessary, then his love for the One by whom he subsists primarily and by whom he endures secondarily—in his essence and attributes, his outward and inward, his substances and accidents—is also necessary, if he knows it as such. And whoever is devoid of this love is because he is preoccupied with himself and his desires, heedless of his Lord and Creator, so he does not know Him as He truly ought to be known, and his sight is limited to his desires and sensory perceptions. He is of the world of testimony, which he shares with beasts in enjoying and indulging in it, not of the world of the dominion, whose ground is trodden only by one who draws near to the likeness of the angels. He gazes into it according to the degree of his closeness in attributes to the angels, and falls short of it according to the degree of his descent to the lowest level of the world of beasts.

As for the second cause: which is love for one who has shown kindness to him, aiding him with his wealth, speaking to him gently, supporting him with his assistance, volunteering to defend him, suppressing his enemies, undertaking to repel the harm of the wicked from him, and striving as a means to secure all his interests and objectives concerning himself, his children, and his relatives—such a person is inevitably beloved to him. This very matter necessitates that one should love none but God Almighty, for if he truly knew with genuine knowledge, he would realize that the benefactor to him is God Almighty alone. As for the varieties of His kindness to all His servants, I do not enumerate them, for no enumerator can encompass them, as God Most High has said: "And if you should count the favors of God, you could not enumerate them." We have alluded to a portion of this in the Book of Gratitude. However, we now confine ourselves to clarifying that kindness from people is inconceivable except metaphorically; the true benefactor is God Almighty. Let us suppose this regarding someone who bestowed upon you all his treasures and empowered you to dispose of them as you wish: you might think that this kindness is from him, but that is a mistake. For his kindness was only accomplished through him, his wealth, his capability, and the motives that prompted him to direct the wealth to you. So who is it that bestowed his creation, the creation of his wealth, the creation of his capability, and the creation of his will and motive? And who is it that endeared you to him, turned his attention to you, and cast into his heart that the rectitude of his religion or his worldly life lies in being kind to you? Were it not for all that, he would not have given you a single grain of his wealth. Whenever God subjects him to motives and establishes in his heart that the rectitude of his religion or his worldly life lies in surrendering his wealth to you, he is compelled and constrained in the surrender, unable to oppose it. Thus, the benefactor is the One who compelled him for you, subjugated him, and subjected him to the motives that drive and press him to the action. As for his hand, it is merely an intermediary through which God's kindness reaches you, and the possessor of the hand is compelled in that, like the course of water flowing within it. If you believe him to be a benefactor or thank him from the perspective of his own self, not as an intermediary, you are ignorant of the reality of the matter. For kindness from a human being is conceivable only toward himself; as for kindness to others, it is impossible for created beings, because he does not expend his wealth except for a purpose of his own—either deferred, which is reward, or immediate, which is obligation and subjugation, or praise and renown, fame for generosity and magnanimity, or attracting the hearts of creation to obedience and love. Just as a person does not cast his wealth into the sea since he has no purpose in it, so he does not cast it into the hand of another except for a purpose of his own therein. That purpose is his desire and aim. As for you, you are not the aim; rather, your hand is an instrument for him in receiving, so that he may attain his purpose of remembrance, praise, gratitude, or reward due to your receiving the wealth. Thus, he has enlisted you in receiving to achieve his own purpose; he is therefore being kind to himself and compensating for what he expended of his wealth with a substitute that is more valuable to him than his wealth. Were it not for the preponderance of that benefit to him, he would not have relinquished his wealth for your sake at all, ever. Consequently, he is not deserving of gratitude and love from two perspectives.

One is that he is compelled by God's imposition of motives upon him, so he has no power to oppose them; thus, he proceeds in the manner of the treasurer of a ruler, for he is not considered a benefactor by delivering the ruler's robe of honor to the one upon whom it is bestowed, because from the ruler's side he is compelled to obey and comply with what is decreed, unable to oppose it. If the ruler left him to his own devices, he would not deliver it. Similarly, every apparent benefactor, if God left him to himself, would not give even a grain of his wealth until God imposed motives upon him and cast into his heart that his share, both in religion and worldly life, lies in giving it, so he gives for that reason.

The second is that he is compensated for what he gives with a share that is more complete and beloved to him than what he gave. Just as a seller is not considered a benefactor because he gives in exchange for something more beloved to him than what he gave, so too the giver is compensated with reward, or praise and commendation, or another recompense. It is not a condition of compensation that it be a tangible possession; rather, all shares are compensations that render wealth and possessions insignificant in comparison to them. True beneficence lies in generosity, and generosity is giving wealth without any compensation or share returning to the giver, which is impossible for anyone other than God, exalted be He, for He is the one who bestows favor upon all worlds as a beneficence to them and for their sake, not for any share or purpose returning to Him, as He is exalted above purposes. Thus, the terms generosity and beneficence, when applied to others, are false or metaphorical, and their meaning in relation to others is impossible and unattainable, like combining black and white. He alone is unique in generosity, beneficence, bounty, and grace. If by nature there is love for the benefactor, then the knower should love none but God Almighty, since beneficence from anyone else is impossible, so He alone deserves this love. As for others, they deserve love from a person only on the condition of ignorance of the meaning and reality of beneficence.

As for the third cause: which is your love for the benefactor in himself, even though his beneficence has not reached you. This too is found in human nature, for if news reaches you of a king who is devout, just, knowledgeable, gentle with people, kind to them, and humble before them—while he is in a distant land far from you—and news reaches you of another king who is oppressive, arrogant, dissolute, shameless, and wicked—while he too is far from you—you will find in your heart a distinction between them. For you will find in the heart an inclination toward the first, which is love, and an aversion from the second, which is hatred, even though you despair of any good from the first and feel safe from any harm from the second, since your hope of reaching their lands is cut off. This, then, is love for the benefactor solely because he is a benefactor, not because he has benefited you. This also necessitates love for God Almighty—indeed, it necessitates that no one else be loved at all except in relation to some cause connected to Him. For God is the Benefactor to all and the Bestower of grace upon every kind of creation: first, by bringing them into existence; second, by perfecting them with limbs and means that are among their necessities; third, by providing them comfort and ease through creating means that lie within the realm of their needs, even if not among their necessities; and fourth, by adorning them with excellences and additions that lie within the realm of their adornment, which are beyond their necessities and needs.

An example of a necessary limb is the head, the heart, and the liver; an example of what is needed is the eye, the hand, and the foot; and an example of adornment is the arching of the eyebrows, the redness of the lips, and the coloring of the eyes, among other things whose absence would not disrupt a need or a necessity.

An example of a necessary blessing outside the human body is water and nourishment; an example of a need is medicine, meat, and fruits; and an example of excellences and additions is the greenery of trees, the beauty of lights and flowers, and the delights of fruits and foods whose absence would not disrupt a need or a necessity.

These three divisions exist for every animal, indeed for every plant, indeed for every category among the categories of creation, from the pinnacle of the Throne to the furthest reaches of the footstool. Therefore, He is the Benefactor, so how could any other be a benefactor, when that benefactor is but one good deed among the good deeds of His power? For He is the Creator of goodness, the Creator of the benefactor, the Creator of beneficence, and the Creator of the causes of beneficence. Thus, love for another on account of this cause is pure ignorance, and whoever knows this will not love for this cause except God, the Exalted.

As for the fourth cause: which is the love of every beautiful thing for the sake of beauty itself, not for any benefit attained beyond the perception of beauty: we have clarified that this is innate in human nature, and that beauty is divided into the beauty of the outward form, perceived by the eye of the head, and the beauty of the inward form, perceived by the eye of the heart and the light of insight. The first is perceived by children and beasts, while the second is exclusively perceived by the possessors of hearts, and those who know nothing but the outward aspect of the worldly life do not share in it. All beauty is beloved to the perceiver of beauty. If it is perceived by the heart, then it is beloved to the heart. An observable example of this is the love for the Prophets, the scholars, and those of noble virtues and pleasing morals, for this is conceivable even with a disheveled face and other limbs, and this is what is meant by the beauty of the inward form, which the senses cannot perceive. Indeed, it is perceived through the goodness of its effects emanating from it, which indicate it, until when the heart is guided to it, the heart inclines toward it and loves it. Thus, whoever loves the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, or the Truthful One, may God Most High be pleased with him, or al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy upon him, loves them only for the goodness that appeared from them, and that is not for the beauty of their forms nor for the beauty of their actions. Rather, the beauty of their actions indicates the beauty of the attributes which are the source of the actions, for actions are effects emanating from them and indicating them. So whoever observes the excellence of a scholar's composition, the beauty of a poet's verse, indeed the beauty of an engraver's engraving and a builder's construction, is revealed through these actions their inward attributes, the essence of which, upon investigation, returns to knowledge and capability. Then, whenever the object of knowledge is more noble and more perfect in grandeur and majesty, the knowledge of it is more noble and more beautiful. Likewise, the object of capability: whenever it is of greater rank and more exalted station, the capability over it is of more exalted rank and nobler measure. The most exalted object of knowledge is God Most High, so it is no wonder that the finest and most noble of sciences is the knowledge of God Most High, and likewise what is associated with Him and specific to Him; its nobility is according to the degree of its connection to Him.

Thus, the beauty of the attributes of the truthful ones, whom hearts naturally love, returns to three matters: the first is their knowledge of God, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the laws of His prophets.

The second is their capacity to rectify themselves and to rectify God's servants through guidance and governance.

The third is their purification from base traits, vile impurities, and overwhelming desires that divert from the paths of goodness and draw toward the way of evil. It is by such qualities that the prophets, the scholars, the righteous caliphs, and the kings—who are people of justice and generosity—are beloved. Therefore, attribute these qualities to the attributes of God, the Exalted.

As for knowledge: where does the knowledge of the first and the last stand in relation to the knowledge of God, exalted be He, which encompasses all things with an encompassing beyond limit, such that not an atom's weight in the heavens or on earth escapes Him? He has addressed all creation, saying, exalted be He, "And you have not been given of knowledge except a little." Nay, were the inhabitants of earth and heaven to gather to encompass His knowledge and wisdom in the detailed creation of an ant or a mosquito, they would not attain a tenth of a tenth of that. "And they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except by what He wills." And the slight measure of knowledge that all creatures possess, they know it only by His teaching, as He, exalted be He, has said: "He created man and taught him clear expression." If the beauty and nobility of knowledge is a beloved thing, and it is in itself an adornment and a perfection attributed to it, then it is not fitting to be loved for this reason except by God, exalted be He. The knowledge of the learned is ignorance in comparison to His knowledge. Indeed, one who knows the most learned person of his time and the most ignorant person of his time would find it impossible to love the more ignorant one because of knowledge and abandon the more learned one, even though the more ignorant one is not devoid of some knowledge required for his livelihood. The disparity between God's knowledge and the knowledge of all creatures is greater than the disparity between the knowledge of the most learned creature and the most ignorant one. For the most learned one only surpasses the most ignorant one by a limited, finite amount of knowledge which it is possible for the most ignorant one to attain through acquisition and striving. But the superiority of the knowledge of God, exalted be He, over the knowledge of all creatures is beyond limit, for His objects of knowledge are without end, while the objects of knowledge for creatures are finite.

As for the attribute of power: it is also a perfection, and incapacity a deficiency. Thus, every perfection, splendor, majesty, glory, and dominion is beloved, and its perception is delightful. Indeed, a person may hear in a narrative of the courage of ‘Ali and Khalid, may God be pleased with them both, and other brave ones, and of their power and dominance over their peers, and he finds in his heart a necessary stirring, joy, and pleasure from the mere delight of hearing, let alone witnessing. This begets in the heart a necessary love for the one described by it, for it is a kind of perfection. Now, compare the power of creation to the power of God, exalted is He. The mightiest person in strength, the most expansive in dominion, the most powerful in force, the most subduing of desires, the most restraining of the soul's vile traits, and the most comprehensive in ability to govern himself and others—what is the limit of his power? Its utmost extent is over some of his own attributes and over some human individuals in some matters. Yet, with all that, he possesses for himself neither death, nor life, nor resurrection, nor harm, nor benefit. Nay, he cannot protect his eye from blindness, his tongue from muteness, his ear from deafness, or his body from illness. There is no need to enumerate what he is incapable of concerning himself and others, which is, in sum, related to his power, let alone what his power does not pertain to—the dominion of the heavens and their spheres and stars, and the earth and its mountains, seas, winds, thunderbolts, minerals, plants, animals, and all its parts. He has no power over an atom of it. And what he is capable of concerning himself and others, his power is not from himself or by himself; rather, God is his Creator, and the Creator of his power, and the Creator of its causes, and the One who enables him in that. If He were to empower a mosquito against the greatest king and strongest being among animals, it would destroy him. Thus, the servant has no power except by the enabling of his Master, as He said regarding the greatest king of the earth, Dhul-Qarnayn, when He said, "Indeed, We established him in the earth." So, all his kingship and sovereignty were only by God, exalted is He, enabling him in a portion of the earth. And the entire earth is but a speck of dust in comparison to the bodies of the universe, and all the territories people possess from the earth are a mote of that speck. Then, that mote is also from the grace of God, exalted is He, and His enabling. It is therefore impossible that one should love a servant from among the servants of God, exalted is He, for his power, governance, enabling, dominance, and perfection of strength, yet not love God, exalted is He, for that. There is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Most Great. He is the Compeller, the Subduer, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. The heavens are folded in His right hand, and the earth and its dominion and what is upon it are in His grasp, and the forelocks of all creatures are in the grasp of His power. If He destroyed them from the last of them, not an atom would diminish from His sovereignty and dominion. And if He created their like a thousand times, He would not be wearied by their creation, nor would fatigue or lassitude touch Him in their origination. Thus, there is no power and no possessor of power except as an effect from the effects of His power. To Him belong beauty, splendor, majesty, grandeur, subjugation, and dominion. If it is conceivable to love a powerful one for the perfection of his power, then none fundamentally deserves love for the perfection of power except Him.

As for the attribute of being exalted from defects and deficiencies, and sanctified from vices and foulness, it is one of the necessitators of love and requisites of beauty and comeliness in inward forms. Although the prophets and the truthful are exalted from defects and foulness, the perfection of sanctity and exaltation is inconceivable except for the One, the True, the Sovereign, the Holy, Possessor of Majesty and Honor.

As for every created being, it is not free from deficiency and shortcomings. Rather, its very nature—being incapable, created, subjugated, and compelled—is the essence of defect and deficiency. Thus, perfection belongs to God alone, and no other possesses perfection except to the extent that God has granted it. It is not within the realm of possibility to bestow the ultimate perfection upon another, for the lowest degree of ultimate perfection is to not be a servant subjugated to another, dependent upon another—and this is impossible for any other. He is the Unique in perfection, the One exalted above deficiency, sanctified from defects. To elaborate the aspects of sanctity and transcendence in His regard, free from shortcomings, would be lengthy, and it is among the secrets of the sciences of unveiling, so we shall not prolong mentioning it. Therefore, this attribute also, if it is a perfection and beauty that is beloved, its true reality is not realized except for Him. The perfection and transcendence of any other is not absolute but relative to that which is more deficient than it—just as a horse possesses a perfection relative to a donkey, and a human possesses a perfection relative to a horse. The root of deficiency encompasses all, and they only vary in the degrees of deficiency.

Thus, beauty is beloved, and absolute beauty is the One who has no peer, the Singular who has no opposite, the Eternal who has no rival, the Self-Sufficient who has no need, the Omnipotent who does what He wills and decrees what He desires—none can repel His decree nor overturn His judgment. He is the All-Knowing from whose knowledge not an atom's weight in the heavens or earth escapes, the Overpowering from whose grasp of power the necks of tyrants cannot slip, nor can the necks of emperors escape His might and dominion. He is the Pre-Eternal, without beginning to His existence, the Everlasting, without end to His permanence, the Necessarily Existent, around whose presence the possibility of non-existence cannot hover. He is the Self-Sustaining, who subsists by Himself and by whom every existent subsists, the Compeller of the heavens and earth, the Creator of inanimate objects, animals, and plants, the Sole Possessor of might and grandeur, the Unique in sovereignty and dominion. He is the Possessor of grace, majesty, splendor, beauty, power, and perfection—before whose grandeur intellects are bewildered in knowing Him, and tongues are struck silent in describing Him. The pinnacle of the knowers' knowledge is to confess incapacity to know Him, and the utmost of the prophets' prophethood is to acknowledge inadequacy in describing Him, as the master of the prophets—may God's blessings be upon him and upon them all—said: "I cannot enumerate praise of You; You are as You have praised Yourself."

The Master of the Truthful, may God be exalted, said: The inability to grasp comprehension is itself comprehension. Glory be to Him who has not made for creation any path to knowing Him except through the inability to know Him. Would that I knew, who denies the possibility of loving God, the Exalted, as a reality and deems it a mere metaphor? Does he deny that these attributes are from the attributes of beauty, praiseworthiness, the traits of perfection, and excellence? Or does he deny that God, the Exalted, is described by them, or deny that perfection, beauty, splendor, and majesty are beloved by nature to one who perceives them? So glory be to Him who has veiled Himself from the insights of the blind out of jealousy for His beauty and majesty, that none may behold Him except those for whom the ultimate good from Him has preceded—those who are kept far from the fire of the veil. And He has left the losers wandering in the darkness of blindness, lingering in the pastures of the sensory and the desires of beasts; they busy themselves with the outward aspect of the worldly life, while they are heedless of the Hereafter. Praise be to God, but most of them do not know.

Thus, love for this reason is stronger than love for beneficence, because beneficence increases and decreases. For this reason, God, the Exalted, revealed to David, peace be upon him: "Indeed, the dearest of the beloved to Me is a servant who worships Me without seeking reward, but rather to give the right of Lordship its due."

In the Psalms: Who is more unjust than one who worships Me for Paradise or out of fear of Hell? Had I not created Paradise or Hell, would I not still be worthy of being obeyed?
And Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by a group of worshippers who had grown emaciated. They said, "We fear the Fire and we hope for Paradise." He said to them, "You fear a created thing and you hope for a created thing." Then he passed by another group in a similar state, and they said, "We worship Him out of love for Him and reverence for His majesty." He said, "You are the true allies of God; with you I have been commanded to take my stand."

Abu Hazim said: I am ashamed to worship Him for reward or punishment, for then I would be like the wicked servant who does not work unless he fears, and like the wicked hireling who does not work unless he is paid.

In the tradition: "Let not any of you be like the bad hired worker who, if not given his wage, does not work; nor like the bad slave who, if not fearing punishment, does not work."

As for the fifth cause of love, it is affinity and resemblance, for like is drawn to like, and form inclines to form. Thus you see a child befriending a child, an elder befriending an elder, a bird taking comfort with its own kind and shunning other kinds, a scholar finding more companionship with a scholar than with a craftsman, and a carpenter finding more companionship with a carpenter than with a farmer. This is a matter attested by experience and confirmed by reports and traditions, as we have detailed in the chapter on Brotherhood for God's Sake in the Book of the Etiquette of Fellowship—so let it be sought from there. And if affinity is a cause of love, then affinity may be in an apparent meaning, such as the affinity of a child for a child in the meaning of childhood, or it may be hidden, so much so that it is not disclosed, as you see in the union that occurs between two persons without consideration of beauty, desire for wealth, or anything else, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) alluded to when he said: "Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those that recognize each other come together, and those that do not recognize each other differ." Thus recognition is affinity, and non-recognition is disparity. This cause also necessitates the love of God, the Exalted, due to an inner affinity that does not revert to resemblance in images and forms, but rather to inner essences, some of which may be mentioned in books and some of which may not be written down but are left beneath the veil of dust until discovered by the wayfarers when they fulfill the conditions of the path.

What may be mentioned is the servant's closeness to his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, in the attributes in which he has been commanded to emulate and adorn himself with the traits of divinity, such that it is said: "Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God." This is in acquiring praiseworthy qualities that are among the attributes of divinity: knowledge, righteousness, beneficence, gentleness, bestowing good, mercy upon creation, sincere counsel for them, and guiding them to truth while restraining them from falsehood, among other noble aspects of the Sacred Law. All of this brings one closer to God, Glorified and Exalted, not in the sense of seeking nearness in place, but in attributes.

As for that which may not be written down in books concerning the special affinity with which the human being is uniquely endowed, it is that to which His statement alludes: "And they ask you about the spirit. Say: 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord.'" For He indicated that it is a divine command beyond the grasp of created intellects. Clearer than that is His statement: "When I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit," and for that reason He commanded His angels to prostrate to him. And His statement alludes to it: "Indeed, I will make a vicegerent on the earth," for Adam did not merit the vicegerency of God, the Exalted, except through that affinity. And to this His statement (peace and blessings be upon him) symbolically refers: "Indeed, God created Adam in His image," until the limited ones thought that there is no image except the apparent image perceived by the senses, so they likened, corporealized, and formed—exalted is God, Lord of the worlds, high above what the ignorant say.

And to this His statement to Moses (peace be upon him) alludes: "I was ill and you did not visit Me." He said: "O Lord, and how is that?" He said: "My servant so-and-so was ill and you did not visit him; had you visited him you would have found Me with him." This affinity does not become manifest except through persistence in supererogatory acts after perfecting the obligatory ones, as God, the Exalted, said: "The servant continues to draw near to Me through supererogatory acts until I love him. And when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his tongue with which he speaks." This is a place where the reins of the pen must be restrained, for people have divided concerning it into the limited, who inclined to apparent similitude, and the extremists, who transgressed the limit of affinity to union and claimed indwelling, until some of them said: "I am the Truth." And the Christians went astray concerning Jesus (peace be upon him), saying: "He is God," while others among them claimed the human nature borrowed the divine nature, and others said: "He became united with it." As for those to whom the impossibility of similitude and representation, and the impossibility of union and indwelling, became clear, and to whom the reality of the secret within them became evident—they are the fewer. Perhaps Abu al-Hasan al-Nuri was contemplating this station when, overcome by ecstasy, he recited the poet's verse:

I have not ceased descending from
Your love a dwelling place
At whose descent
Minds are bewildered.

He continued to run in his fervor through a thicket whose reeds had been cut, leaving only their roots, until his feet split open and swelled, and he died from it. This is the greatest cause of love and the strongest, yet also the rarest and most elusive in existence. These are the known causes of love, and their totality converges in the case of God Almighty as reality, not metaphor, and at the highest levels, not the lowest. Thus, what is rationally acceptable to those of insight is love for God alone, just as what is rationally possible for the blind is love for other than God alone. Moreover, anyone who loves a created being due to one of these causes can imagine loving another who shares in that cause, and partnership diminishes love and detracts from its perfection. No one possesses an attribute of the beloved exclusively without potentially having a partner in it; if none exists, it is possible one could exist—except for God Almighty, who is described with attributes that are the pinnacle of majesty and perfection, and He has no partner in this in reality, nor is it conceivable as a possibility. Therefore, inevitably, there is no partnership in loving Him, so deficiency does not encroach upon His love, just as partnership does not encroach upon His attributes. Thus, He is deserving—indeed—of the essence of love and of the perfection of love, with a deservingness that admits no sharing whatsoever.

The Explanation That the Ultimate and Highest of Pleasures is the Knowledge of God, Exalted is He

And gazing upon His Noble Countenance, and that it is inconceivable that any other pleasure would be preferred over it, save by one who is deprived of this pleasure.



Know that pleasures follow perceptions, and man encompasses a totality of powers and instincts. For every power and instinct there is a pleasure, and its pleasure lies in attaining that which its nature demands, for which it was created. For these instincts were not placed in man in vain; rather, each power and instinct was placed for a purpose that is its natural demand. Thus, the instinct of anger was created for vindication and retaliation, so undoubtedly its pleasure lies in domination and retaliation, which is the demand of its nature. And the instinct of appetite for food, for example, was created to obtain nourishment by which one is sustained, so undoubtedly its pleasure lies in attaining this nourishment, which is the demand of its nature. Likewise, the pleasure of hearing, sight, and smell lies in seeing, listening, and smelling. Thus, no instinct among these instincts is devoid of pain and pleasure relative to its perceptions.

Similarly, in the heart there is an instinct called the Divine Light, as per His saying, exalted is He: "Is he whose breast God has expanded for Islam, so he is upon a light from his Lord?" It is also called intellect, and it is called the inner insight, and it is called the light of faith and certainty. There is no point in preoccupation with names, for terminologies differ. The weak imagine that the difference lies in the meanings, because the weak seek meanings from words, which is the opposite of what is required. The heart is distinct from all other parts of the body by a quality through which it perceives meanings that are neither imagined nor sensed, such as perceiving the creation of the world or its need for an eternal Creator, a wise Manager described with divine attributes. Name that instinct 'intellect' on condition that from the term 'intellect' one does not understand that by which the methods of disputation and debate are perceived, for the name intellect has become famous for this, and for this reason some Sufis have criticized it. Otherwise, the quality by which man is distinguished from beasts and by which he perceives the knowledge of God, exalted is He, is the most honored of qualities and should not be criticized. This instinct was created to know thereby the realities of all things, so the demand of its nature is knowledge and understanding, and that is its pleasure, just as the demand of other instincts is their pleasure. It is not hidden that in knowledge and understanding there is pleasure, such that one who is attributed with knowledge and understanding, even in something base, rejoices in it, and one who is attributed with ignorance, even in something trivial, is grieved by it. Indeed, man can hardly refrain from boasting of knowledge and priding himself on it in trivial matters. Thus, one knowledgeable in playing chess, despite its baseness, cannot remain silent about teaching it, and his tongue flows with mentioning what he knows. All of that is due to the extreme pleasure of knowledge and what he senses of the perfection of his self through it, for knowledge is among the most specific attributes of lordship, and it is the ultimate perfection. Therefore, nature finds comfort when praised for intelligence and abundance of knowledge, because upon hearing praise he senses the perfection of his self and the perfection of his knowledge, so he admires himself and takes pleasure in it.

Yet, the pleasure of knowledge in farming and tailoring is not like the pleasure of knowledge in governing a kingdom and managing the affairs of creation. Nor is the pleasure of knowledge in grammar and poetry like the pleasure of knowledge of God, exalted is He, His attributes, His angels, and the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Rather, the pleasure of knowledge is according to the nobility of the knowledge, and the nobility of knowledge is according to the nobility of the known. So much so that one who knows the inner states of people and informs of it finds pleasure in it, even if his nature urges him to investigate it. If he knows the inner states of the town's chief and the secrets of his management in his leadership, that is more pleasurable and sweeter to him than knowing the inner state of a farmer or a weaver. If he becomes aware of the secrets of the minister and his management and what he intends in the affairs of the ministry, that is more desirable and pleasurable to him than his knowledge of the secrets of the chief. If he is knowledgeable of the inner states of the king and sultan, who is the sovereign, that is sweeter and more pleasurable to him than his knowledge of the inner secrets of the minister. And his boasting of that, his eagerness for it and for investigating it, is stronger, and his love for it is greater, because his pleasure in it is greater. Through this it becomes clear that the most pleasurable of knowledges is the noblest of them, and its nobility is according to the nobility of the known. If among the known things there is that which is most sublime, most perfect, most noble, and greatest, then knowledge of it is inevitably the most pleasurable of sciences, the noblest and sweetest of them.

Would that I knew: Is there in existence anything more sublime, higher, nobler, more perfect, and greater than the Creator of all things, their Perfecter, their Adorner, their Originator, their Restorer, their Manager, and their Arranger? And can it be conceived that there is a presence in sovereignty, perfection, beauty, splendor, and majesty greater than the Divine Presence, whose beginnings of majesty and wonders of states no describer can encompass? If you do not doubt that, then you should not doubt that insight into the secrets of lordship and knowledge of the arrangement of divine matters encompassing all existents is the highest kind of knowledge and insight, the most pleasurable, sweetest, and most desirable of them. And it is most fitting that souls, when qualified by it, sense their perfection and beauty, and most deserving of magnifying joy, comfort, and gladness. By this it is clarified that knowledge is delightful, and that the most delightful knowledge is knowledge of God, exalted is He, His attributes, His actions, and His management in His dominion—from the utmost limit of His Throne to the depths of the earths. Therefore, it should be known that the pleasure of...

Knowledge is more potent than all other pleasures—I refer to the pleasures of appetites and anger, and the pleasures of the five senses. For pleasures differ in kind first, such as the difference between the pleasure of intercourse and the pleasure of listening, and the pleasure of knowledge and the pleasure of leadership. They also differ in weakness and strength, such as the difference between the pleasure of ardent, inflamed desire in copulation and the pleasure of one whose appetite is tepid, and like the difference between the pleasure of gazing upon a face of surpassing beauty and the pleasure of gazing upon what falls short of it in beauty. The strongest pleasure is known only by its influence over others. For when one is given the choice between looking at a beautiful image and enjoying its sight, and inhaling pleasant fragrances, if they choose to look at the beautiful image, it is known that it is more pleasurable to them than the pleasant fragrances. Likewise, if food is present at mealtime, and the chess player persists in playing and forsakes eating, it is thereby known that the pleasure of victory in chess is stronger for them than the pleasure of eating. This is a truthful measure in revealing the preponderance of pleasures. Thus we return and say:

Pleasures are divided into apparent ones, such as the pleasures of the five senses, and internal ones, such as the pleasure of leadership, dominance, honor, knowledge, and others. For this pleasure is not for the eye, nor the nose, nor the ear, nor touch, nor taste. The internal meanings hold greater sway over those of perfection than the apparent pleasures. If a man were given the choice between the pleasure of fat chicken and almond paste, and the pleasure of leadership, subduing enemies, and attaining a degree of dominion, then if the one choosing is base in aspiration, dead in heart, and intensely gluttonous, he would choose the meat and the sweetness. But if he is of high aspiration and complete intellect, he would choose leadership, and hunger and patience from the necessity of sustenance for many days would become light to him. His choice of leadership indicates that it is more pleasurable to him than the delicious foods. Indeed, the deficient one whose internal meanings have not yet become complete, like a child, or one whose internal faculties have died, like the feeble-minded, it is not far-fetched that he would prefer the pleasure of foods over the pleasure of leadership. And just as the pleasure of leadership and honor is the most dominant pleasure for one who has passed beyond the deficiency of childhood and feeble-mindedness, so the pleasure of knowing God Almighty, contemplating the beauty of the Divine Presence, and gazing upon the secrets of divine matters is more pleasurable than leadership, which is the highest of the pleasures dominant over creation. The ultimate expression concerning it is to say, "No soul knows what delights of the eyes are kept hidden for them," and that He has prepared for them what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has not occurred to the heart of any human. This, now, is known only by one who has tasted both pleasures, for he will inevitably prefer seclusion, solitude, reflection, and remembrance, and plunge into the oceans of knowledge, and abandon leadership, and deem contemptible the creation over whom he presides, due to his knowledge of the annihilation of his leadership and the annihilation of those over whom he has leadership, and its being mixed with turbidities from which freedom is inconceivable, and its being severed by death, which must inevitably come no matter how much the earth is adorned and embellished and its people think they are capable upon it. Thus, he magnifies, in comparison to it, the pleasure of knowing God and contemplating His attributes, His actions, and the order of His kingdom from the highest heights to the lowest depths. For it is free from competitors and disturbances, vast for those who come to it, not constricted for them due to its greatness. Indeed, its breadth, in terms of estimation, is the heavens and the earth. And when consideration transcends estimations, there is no end to its breadth. So the knower, by contemplating it, remains in a paradise whose breadth is the heavens and the earth, grazing in its meadows, plucking from its fruits, and drinking from its pools, secure from its cessation, for the fruits of this paradise are neither severed nor forbidden. Moreover, it is eternal, everlasting, not severed by death, for death does not demolish the abode of the knowledge of God Almighty, and its abode is the spirit, which is a divine, heavenly command. Death only changes its states, severs its distractions and obstacles, and frees it from its confinement. But as for annihilating it, no. "And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision, rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to join them] who have not yet joined them from behind them." And do not think that this is specific to the one killed in battle, for the knower has with every breath the rank of a thousand martyrs. And in the report: "Indeed, the martyr wishes in the Hereafter to be returned to the world so he could be killed again, due to the greatness of the reward for martyrdom he sees. And indeed, the martyrs wish they had been scholars, due to what they see of the lofty rank of the scholars."

Thus, all realms of the heavenly and earthly dominion are the arena of the knower, wherein he takes his abode wherever he wills, without need to move toward them with his body or person. For he beholds the beauty of the dominion in a garden whose breadth is the heavens and the earth, and every knower has the like thereof, without any crowding of one upon another whatsoever. Yet they differ in the expanse of their paradises according to the difference in the breadth of their vision and the vastness of their knowledge, and they are degrees with God—the disparity of their degrees cannot be encompassed. Thus it has become clear that the pleasure of leadership, which is inward, is stronger in those of perfection than all sensory pleasures, and that this pleasure is not for beasts, nor children, nor the foolish. And the pleasure of sensibles and appetites may be present for those of perfection alongside the pleasure of leadership, but they prefer leadership. As for the meaning that knowledge of God, His attributes, His acts, the dominion of His heavens, and the secrets of His kingdom is a greater pleasure than leadership—this is specific to one who has attained the rank of knowledge and tasted it. It cannot be established for one who has no heart, for the heart is the mine of this power, just as the superiority of the pleasure of intercourse over the pleasure of playing with a polo mallet cannot be established for children, nor its superiority over the pleasure of smelling violets for the blind, because they lack the faculty by which that pleasure is perceived. But whoever is free from the affliction of impotence and whose sense of smell is sound perceives the difference between the two pleasures. At this point, nothing remains but to say: “Whoever tastes, knows.” By my life, seekers of knowledge, even if they are not occupied with seeking knowledge of divine matters, have inhaled the fragrance of this pleasure when difficulties are unveiled and doubts are resolved, for which they were intensely eager in their pursuit—for these too are knowledges and sciences, even if their objects are not as noble as the nobility of divine objects. As for one whose reflection has long been devoted to knowing God, glorified be He, and to whom even a little of the secrets of God’s kingdom has been unveiled, his heart encounters at the moment of unveiling such joy that it nearly takes flight, and he marvels at himself for remaining firm and enduring the intensity of his joy and delight. This is something that cannot be grasped except by taste, and narration concerning it is of little benefit. This much alerts you that knowledge of God, glorified be He, is the most delightful of things and that there is no pleasure above it.

For this reason, Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: “God has servants whom fear of Hell does not distract from God, nor hope of Paradise—so how could the world distract them from God?” And for this reason, one of the brothers of Ma‘ruf al-Karkhi said to him: “Inform me, O Abu Mahfuz, what thing stirred you to worship and withdrawal from creation?” He remained silent, then said: “Remembrance of death.” He asked: “And what is death?” He replied: “Remembrance of the grave and the Barzakh.” He asked: “And what is the grave?” He replied: “Fear of Hell and hope of Paradise?” He said: “And what is this? A King in whose hand is all of this—if you love Him, He makes you forget all of that, and if there is knowledge between you and Him, He suffices you for all of this.”

And in the reports of Jesus, peace be upon him: “If you see a youth passionately seeking the Lord, exalted be He, that has distracted him from all else.”

And one of the shaykhs saw Bishr ibn al-Harith in a dream and said: “What has become of Abu Nasr al-Tammar and ‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Warraq?” He replied: “I left them just now before God, exalted be He, eating and drinking.” I said: “And you?” He said: “God knew the scantiness of my desire for eating and drinking, so He gave me the vision of Him.”

And from ‘Ali ibn al-Muwaffaq, he said: “I saw in a dream as if I entered Paradise, and I saw a man seated at a table with two angels on his right and left feeding him from all delights, and he was eating. And I saw a man standing at the gate of Paradise, scrutinizing the faces of people, admitting some and turning others away.” He said: “Then I passed them to the garden of holiness and saw within the pavilion of the Throne a man whose gaze was fixed, looking at God, exalted be He, without blinking. I said to Ridwan: ‘Who is this?’ He said: ‘Ma‘ruf al-Karkhi, a servant of God—not out of fear of His Fire, nor longing for His Paradise, but out of love for Him, so He has permitted him to gaze upon Him on the Day of Resurrection.’” And it was mentioned that the others were Bishr ibn al-Harith and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.

For this reason, Abu Sulayman said: “Whoever is today occupied with himself will tomorrow be occupied with himself, and whoever is today occupied with his Lord will tomorrow be occupied with his Lord.”

And al-Thawri said to Rabi‘a: “What is the reality of your faith?” She said: “I have not worshiped Him out of fear of His Fire, nor out of love for His Paradise, lest I be like a bad hireling. Rather, I have worshiped Him out of love for Him and longing for Him.” And she said regarding the meaning of love, in verse:

I love you with two loves: a love of passion,
and a love for which You are worthy.
As for that which is love of passion,
my occupation with remembrance of You keeps me from all besides You.
And as for that for which You are worthy,
Your unveiling of the veils for me until I see You.
So praise is not for me in this or that,
but for You is the praise in this and that.

Perhaps she intended by the love of passion: the love of God for His benevolence to her and His favors upon her with the shares of the immediate world, and by loving Him for what He is worthy of: the love for His beauty and majesty that was unveiled to her; and it is the highest and strongest of the two. The delight of beholding the beauty of Lordship is what the Messenger of God ﷺ expressed when he said, narrating from his Lord, the Exalted: "I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human." Some of these delights are hastened in this world for one whose heart's purity has reached the ultimate limit, and for that reason some have said: "Indeed, I say, 'O Lord, O God,' and I find that upon my heart heavier than mountains, because the call comes from behind a veil; and have you ever seen a companion calling out to his companion?" And he said: "When a man reaches the ultimate in this knowledge, people stone him;" meaning his speech exceeds the limits of their intellects, so they regard what he says as madness or disbelief. The aim of all the knowers is solely His union and meeting; it is the coolness of the eye that no soul knows what is hidden for them of it. When it is attained, all worries and desires are obliterated, and the heart becomes immersed in its bliss. So if he were cast into the Fire, he would not feel it due to his immersion, and if the bliss of Paradise were presented to him, he would not turn to it because of the perfection of his bliss and his reaching the ultimate beyond which there is no ultimate. Would that I knew how one who understands only the love of tangible things can believe in the delight of gazing upon the face of God, the Exalted, when He has no image or form? And what meaning is there to God's promise of it to His servants and His mention that it is the greatest of blessings? Rather, whoever knows God knows that the scattered delights of varying desires are all encompassed within this delight, as some have said:

My heart had scattered desires, but they gathered as one when my eyes beheld you.  
Now he envies me whom I once envied, for since you became my master, I became master of all.  
O my faith and my world, I left people occupied with their worldly life and their religion, while I am engrossed in remembrance of you.

And for this reason, some have said:

Its abandonment is more severe than its fire, and its connection is sweeter than its paradise.

They intended by this nothing but preferring the heart in knowing God Almighty over the pleasure of eating, drinking, and intercourse. For Paradise is the mine of sensory enjoyment, but as for the heart, its delight is solely in meeting God.

An example of the stages of creation in their pleasures is what we shall mention: The child, at the beginning of its movement and discernment, manifests an instinct by which it delights in play and amusement, such that this becomes for it more delightful than all other things. Then, after that, the pleasure of adornment, wearing clothes, and riding mounts appears, and with it, the pleasure of play is deemed trivial. Then, after that, the pleasure of intercourse and the desire for women appears, and for its sake, all that preceded it is abandoned in order to attain it. Then appears the pleasure of leadership, superiority, and rivalry in abundance, and it is the last, highest, and strongest of worldly pleasures, as the Almighty has said: "Know that the life of this world is but play and amusement, adornment and boasting among you, and rivalry in increase of wealth and children..." (Quran 57:20). Then, after this, another instinct appears by which the pleasure of knowing God Almighty and knowing His actions is perceived, and with it, all that preceded it is deemed trivial. Thus, each later stage is stronger, and this is the final one. For the love of play appears at the age of discernment, the love of women and adornment at the age of puberty, the love of leadership after twenty, and the love of knowledge near forty, which is the highest goal. And just as the child laughs at one who abandons play and busies himself with the dalliance of women and the pursuit of leadership, so too do the leaders laugh at one who abandons leadership and busies himself with the knowledge of God Almighty. And the knowers say: "If you ridicule us, we ridicule you just as you ridicule. And you will come to know."

Explanation of the reason why contemplating the delights of the Hereafter surpasses worldly knowledge

Know that perceptions are divided into that which enters the imagination, such as imagined forms and colored, shaped bodies of animal and plant individuals, and into that which does not enter the imagination, such as the Essence of God Almighty and all that is not a body, like knowledge, power, will, and others. Whoever sees a person then averts his gaze finds that person's image present in his imagination as if he is looking at it, but when he opens his eye and sees, he perceives a distinction between them. This distinction does not revert to a difference between the two images, for the visible image conforms to the imagined one; rather, the separation lies in the increase of clarity and unveiling. For the image of the seen becomes, through vision, more complete in unveiling and clarity. It is like a person seen at the time of dawn before the spread of daylight, then at the fullness of light: one state does not depart from the other except in the increase of unveiling. Therefore, imagination is the beginning of perception, and vision is the completion of the perception of imagination—it is the ultimate unveiling. That is called vision because it is the ultimate unveiling, not because it is in the eye. Indeed, if God created this complete, unveiled perception in the forehead or the chest, for example, it would deserve to be called vision.

When you comprehend this regarding imaginable things, know that the intelligible realities which are not formed in the imagination also have two degrees for their knowledge and perception: one is primary, and the second is a perfection of it. Between the first and the second is a disparity in the increase of unveiling and clarity, like that between the imagined and the seen. Therefore, the second is also called, in relation to the first, witnessing, encounter, and vision. This naming is because vision is called vision for being the ultimate unveiling. Just as the established way of God Almighty is that the closing of eyelids prevents the complete unveiling through sight and becomes a veil between the sight and the seen, and the veils must be lifted for vision to occur—and what does not lift, the perception attained is mere imagination—so too is the requirement of God’s established way: as long as the soul remains veiled by the accidents of the body, the demands of appetites, and the human traits that dominate it, it does not attain witnessing and encounter regarding the intelligible realities beyond imagination. Rather, this life is necessarily a veil over it, like the veil of eyelids over the sight of the eyes. The discourse on the reason for it being a veil is lengthy and not suited to this science. Therefore, God Almighty said to Moses, peace be upon him, "You will not see Me," and He said, "Vision perceives Him not," meaning in this world. The correct view is that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not see God Almighty on the Night of Ascension. So when the veil is lifted by death, the soul remains tainted with the impurities of the world, not entirely free from them, though they vary. Among them are those upon whom filth and rust have accumulated, so they become like a mirror whose substance is corrupted by the long accumulation of filth, no longer accepting rectification and polishing. These are the ones veiled from their Lord for all eternity—we seek refuge in God from that. Among us are those who have not reached the limit of stain and sealing and have not left the capacity for purification and polishing. They are exposed to the Fire in a manner that suppresses the filth with which they are soiled, and the exposure to the Fire is according to the need for purification—its least being a light moment and its longest being the period of the believers, as reports have mentioned, seven thousand years. No soul departs from this world except accompanied by some dust and impurity, however little. Therefore, God Almighty said, "And there is none of you but will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed. Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees." Every soul is certain of coming to the Fire but not certain of emerging from it. When God completes its purification and cleansing, and the term decreed by the Book reaches its end, and the completion of all that the Law promised regarding the Reckoning, the Exposure, and other matters occurs, and the entitlement to Paradise arrives—and that is an ambiguous time, which God has not disclosed to any of His creation, for it occurs after the Resurrection; and the time of the Resurrection is unknown—then at that time, the soul becomes occupied with its purity and clarity from impurities, where no dust or darkness covers its face, for therein the Truth, glorified and exalted, manifests Himself. He manifests to it a manifestation whose unveiling, in relation to what it knew, is like the unveiling of the mirror's manifestation in relation to what it imagined. This witnessing and manifestation is what is called vision. Therefore, vision is true, provided that what is understood from vision is not the completion of imagination into an imagined, conceived form specific to a direction and place; for that is something from which the Lord of lords is greatly exalted. Rather, just as you knew Him in this world with a true, complete knowledge, without imagination, conception, or ascribing shape and form, so will you see Him in the Hereafter. Indeed, I say: the very knowledge attained in this world is what becomes perfected, reaching the fullness of unveiling and clarity, and transforms into witnessing. There is no difference between the witnessing in the Hereafter and the known in this world except in terms of the increase of unveiling and clarity, as we illustrated with the example of the completion of imagination through vision. So if there is no affirmation of the form of His face in the knowledge of God Almighty, then in the perfection of that very knowledge and its ascent in clarity to the ultimate unveiling, there is also no direction or form, for it is the very same, not differing from it except in the increase of unveiling—just as the seen form is the very imagined one, except in the increase of unveiling. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Their light proceeding before them and on their right, they say, 'Our Lord, perfect for us our light.'" For the perfection of light only affects the increase of unveiling. Therefore, none attain the degree of gazing and vision except those who knew in this world, because knowledge is the seed that transforms in the Hereafter into witnessing, just as the kernel transforms into a tree and the seed into crops. He who has no kernel in his land, how can he obtain a palm tree? He who did not sow the seed, how can he harvest the crop? Likewise, he who did not know God Almighty in this world, how will he see Him in the Hereafter? Since knowledge is of varying degrees, the manifestation is also of varying degrees. The difference in manifestation relative to the difference in knowledges is like the difference in plants relative to the difference in seeds, for they inevitably differ.

In their abundance or scarcity, beauty or strength, weakness or vigor. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, God reveals Himself to people in general, and to Abu Bakr in particular." Therefore, one should not suppose that anyone other than Abu Bakr, or anyone inferior to him, would attain the same delight of vision and witnessing that Abu Bakr attained. Rather, they would attain only a tenth of his tenth, if their knowledge in this world was a tenth of his tenth. And whoever among people is distinguished by a secret firmly rooted in their heart is inevitably distinguished by a unique manifestation granted to them alone. Just as you see in this world those who prefer the delight of leadership over food and intimate relations, and you see those who prefer the delight of knowledge and the unveiling of the mysteries of the heavens and the earth and all divine matters over leadership, intimate relations, food, and drink altogether; so too in the Hereafter there will be a people who prefer the delight of gazing upon the Countenance of God, exalted is He, over the bliss of Paradise, since its bliss ultimately reverts to food and intimate relations. These very individuals are those whose state in this world is as we described: preferring the delight of knowledge, gnosis, and insight into the secrets of Lordship over the delight of intimate relations, food, and drink, while the rest of creation is preoccupied with these. For this reason, when Rabi'a was asked, "What do you say about Paradise?" she replied, "The Neighbor, then the abode." Thus, she made clear that her heart held no inclination toward Paradise, but rather toward the Lord of Paradise. Whoever knows God in this world will not see Him in the Hereafter, and whoever does not find the delight of gnosis in this world will not find the delight of vision in the Hereafter. For no one is granted in the Hereafter what did not accompany them in this world. One reaps only what one has sown, and a person is resurrected only upon what they died upon, and they die only upon what they lived upon. Thus, the gnosis that accompanied them is that by which they alone will find delight, except that it is transformed into direct witnessing by the removal of the veil, and the delight is thereby multiplied; just as the delight of a lover is multiplied when the imagined form of the beloved is replaced by the vision of their actual form, for that is the ultimate limit of their delight. Indeed, the goodness of Paradise for everyone therein is what they desire. So for one who desires nothing but the meeting with God, exalted is He, there is no delight for them in anything else; indeed, they may even be pained by it. Therefore, the bliss of Paradise is proportionate to the love of God, exalted is He, and the love of God is proportionate to one's love for Him. Thus, the foundation of all felicities is gnosis, which the Sacred Law has expressed as faith.

If you say: "If the delight of vision has any proportion to the delight of knowledge, it is little, even if it were multiplied many times, because the delight of knowledge in this world is weak, so its multiplication reaches a limit that does not ascend in power to the point of making all the delights of Paradise seem contemptible in comparison to it?" Then know that this contempt for the delight of knowledge stems from being devoid of knowledge. For how can one who is devoid of knowledge perceive its delight? And if he possesses a weak knowledge while his heart is filled with attachments to the world, how can he perceive its delight? For the knowers, in their knowledge, their contemplation, and their intimate communion with God Most High, there are delights such that if Paradise in this world were offered to them in exchange, they would not trade the delight of Paradise for them. Yet this delight, despite its perfection, has absolutely no proportion whatsoever to the delight of the encounter and the vision, just as the delight of imagining the beloved has no proportion to seeing him, nor does the delight of inhaling the fragrance of delicious foods have any proportion to tasting them, nor does the delight of touch by hand have any proportion to the delight of union.

And to manifest the vast disparity between them, nothing suffices but to offer an example. Thus we say: The pleasure of gazing upon the beloved's countenance in this world varies due to causes. The first is the perfection or deficiency of the beloved's beauty, for the pleasure in beholding the more beautiful is undoubtedly more complete.

The second is the intensity of love, desire, and passionate yearning, for the delight of one whose passion is vehement is not like the delight of one whose desire and love are feeble.

The third is the perfection of perception, for the delight in seeing the beloved in darkness, or from behind a thin veil, or from a distance, is not like the delight in perceiving him in proximity, without any veil, and in the fullness of light. Nor is the perception of pleasure in intimacy while a garment intervenes like perceiving it in a state of bareness.

The fourth is the removal of distracting obstacles and pains that preoccupy the heart, for the delight of a healthy, unoccupied heart, free to contemplate the Beloved, is not like the delight of one who is fearful and terrified, or sick and suffering, or whose heart is preoccupied with some pressing concern.

Imagine a lover of feeble passion gazing upon the countenance of his beloved through a thin veil, at a distance that prevents the full disclosure of the essence of his form, while in a state where scorpions and wasps assail him, harming him, stinging him, and distracting his heart. In this state, he is not devoid of some pleasure from beholding his beloved. If, suddenly, a condition were to occur wherein the veil is rent asunder, the light shines forth, the harmful creatures are driven away, and he remains sound and unoccupied, and a powerful desire and excessive love assail him until they reach the utmost limits—then consider how the pleasure multiplies until the former pleasure bears no significant proportion to it. Understand, then, the proportion of the pleasure of sight to the pleasure of knowledge. The thin veil is a metaphor for the body and preoccupation with it. The scorpions and wasps are a metaphor for the desires that dominate man—hunger, thirst, anger, grief, and sorrow. The weakness of desire and love is a metaphor for the soul's deficiency in this world and its shortcoming in yearning for the Highest Assembly, and its turning towards the lowest of the low—like the deficiency of a child in perceiving the pleasure of leadership and his turning to playing with a sparrow. The knower, even if his knowledge is strong in this world, is not free from these disturbances, and it is inconceivable that he should be entirely free from them. Yes, these obstacles may weaken in some circumstances and not persist. Thus, it is no wonder that a glimpse of the beauty of knowledge appears, which bewilders the intellect, and its pleasure becomes immense to the point that the heart nearly shatters from its greatness. Yet, this is like a flash of lightning—swift and seldom lasting. Rather, distractions, thoughts, and whisperings arise that disturb and taint it. This is a permanent necessity in this fleeting life; thus, this pleasure remains tainted until death. Truly, the good life is after death, and truly, the real life is the life of the Hereafter: "And indeed, the Home of the Hereafter is the true life, if only they knew." Whoever reaches this station loves meeting God Almighty and thus loves death. He dislikes it only from the perspective of anticipating an increase in the perfection of knowledge, for knowledge is like a seed, and the ocean of knowledge has no shore. Encompassing the essence of God's majesty is impossible. Thus, the more knowledge of God, His attributes, His actions, and the secrets of His dominion increases and strengthens, the more bliss in the Hereafter increases and becomes greater—just as the more the seed is abundant and good, the more the harvest is abundant and good. This seed can only be acquired in this world, sown only in the soil of the heart, and harvested only in the Hereafter. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The greatest felicity is a long life spent in obedience to God," because knowledge only becomes complete, abundant, and expands through a long life with constant reflection, perseverance in striving, detachment from worldly attachments, and devotion to the quest—this inevitably requires time. Thus, whoever loves death does so because he sees himself having attained in knowledge the utmost of what was made easy for him. Whoever dislikes death does so because he hoped for additional knowledge to be gained through a long life and saw himself falling short of what his capacity could bear if he lived long. This is the reason for the dislike and love of death among the people of knowledge.

As for the rest of creation, their vision is confined to the desires of this world. If their circumstances expand, they love to remain; and if they become constrained, they wish for death. All of this is deprivation and loss, stemming from ignorance and heedlessness. For ignorance and heedlessness are the seedbed of every misery, while knowledge and gnosis are the foundation of every felicity. Now you have come to know, through what we have mentioned, the meaning of love, and the meaning of passionate love—for it is excessive, intense love—and the meaning of the delight of gnosis, and the meaning of the vision, and the meaning of the delight of the vision, and the meaning of it being more delightful than all other delights to those possessed of intellect and perfection, even if it is not so to those possessed of deficiency—just as leadership is not the most delightful of foods to children.

If you ask: "Is this vision located in the heart or the eye in the Hereafter?" Then know that people have differed concerning this, yet the possessors of spiritual insight do not turn their attention to this disagreement nor do they contemplate it. Rather, the intelligent person eats the vegetable without inquiring about the vegetable patch, and whoever longs to see his Beloved, his love preoccupies him from turning his attention to whether his vision is created in his eye or his forehead. Instead, he seeks the vision and its delight, whether that is by the eye or otherwise. For the eye is merely a location and a vessel; no consideration is given to it, nor does it have any ruling. The truth of the matter is that the Eternal Divine Power is vast, so it is not permissible for us to judge it as incapable of either of the two matters. This is regarding the ruling of permissibility. As for what actually occurs in the Hereafter from among the two permissible possibilities, it cannot be known except through the revealed texts. And the truth—as has become evident to the People of the Sunnah and the Community from the evidences of the Sacred Law—is that it is created in the eye so that the expression 'vision' and 'seeing,' and all other expressions mentioned in the Sacred Law, may be applied according to their apparent meanings. For it is not permissible to remove meanings from their apparent sense except out of necessity. And God, the Exalted, knows best.

Explanation of the Factors that Strengthen the Love for God, Exalted is He

Know that the most fortunate of creatures in the Hereafter are those whose love for God, exalted be He, is strongest. For the Hereafter means coming before God, exalted be He, and attaining the bliss of meeting Him. How immense is the delight of the lover when he comes before his Beloved after long yearning! And when he attains the permanence of gazing upon Him for all eternity, without any distress or disturbance, without any watcher or rival, and without any fear of separation! However, this delight is according to the strength of love: whenever love increases, pleasure increases. The servant acquires the love of God, exalted be He, in this world. The foundation of love does not depart from a believer, for it does not depart from the foundation of knowledge. As for the strength of love and its mastery, to the point of reaching the reckless passion called 'ishq (ardent love), that is what most people lack. This is attained only by two means:

The first is severing the ties of this world and expelling love for other than God from the heart, for the heart is like a vessel; it cannot accommodate vinegar, for example, unless the water within it is first removed. "God has not placed two hearts within any man's breast." The perfection of love lies in loving God, exalted and glorified, with one's entire heart. As long as one's attention turns to other than Him, a corner of the heart remains occupied by another. In proportion to how much one is occupied with other than God, love for God diminishes, just as the amount of vinegar poured into a vessel is reduced by the amount of water remaining within it. This exclusivity and purification is alluded to in His saying, exalted is He: "Say, 'God,' then leave them to their idle talk," and in His saying: "Indeed, those who have said, 'Our Lord is God,' and then remained steadfast." Indeed, it is the meaning of your saying, "There is no god but God"—meaning there is no object of worship and no object of love but Him. For every beloved is an object of worship, for the servant is the one bound, and the object of worship is that by which he is bound, and every lover is bound by what he loves. Therefore, God, exalted is He, said: "Have you seen he who has taken his desire as his god?" and He said: "The most hated god a servant has on earth is [his own] desire." For this reason, upon him be peace, said: "Whoever says 'There is no god but God' sincerely shall enter Paradise." The meaning of sincerity is that his heart becomes purely for God, leaving no share within it for other than God, so that God becomes the beloved of his heart, the worshipped of his heart, and the sole aim of his heart. For one in this state, the world is his prison, for it prevents him from witnessing his Beloved, and his death is liberation from the prison and arrival at the Beloved. So what is the state of one who has but a single Beloved, whose longing for Him has been prolonged, and whose imprisonment has been extended, when he is then freed from the prison, enabled to reach the Beloved, and granted eternal security forever? One of the causes for the weakness of love for God in hearts is the strength of love for the world, including love for family, wealth, children, relatives, property, animals, gardens, and places of leisure—to the point that one who delights in the pleasant songs of birds and the gentle breeze of the dawn is turning towards the pleasures of the world and is thereby exposed to a diminishment of love for God, exalted is He. In proportion to how much one finds comfort in the world, his comfort in God diminishes. No one is given anything from this world without necessarily being deprived of its equivalent from the Hereafter, just as a person cannot draw nearer to the east without necessarily moving farther from the west by an equal measure, and a man's heart cannot find joy with his wife without his heart being distressed by her co-wife in equal measure. The world and the Hereafter are two co-wives; they are like the east and the west. This has become clear to those with hearts with a clarity more evident than sight with the eye. The way to uproot love of the world from the heart is to tread the path of asceticism and persistently adhere to patience, submitting to them with the reins of fear and hope. The stations we have mentioned—such as repentance, patience, asceticism, fear, and hope—are preliminaries by which one may acquire one of the two pillars of love, which is the purification of the heart from other than God. Its beginning is faith in God and the Last Day, Paradise and Hell. From this branch out fear and hope, and from these two branch out repentance and patience upon them. This then leads to asceticism regarding the world, wealth, status, and all worldly shares, until from all of this is achieved the purity of the heart from other than God alone, so that it may afterwards expand to receive the descent of the knowledge of God and His love. All of that is preliminary to purifying the heart, which is one of the two pillars of love. This is alluded to in his saying, upon him be peace: "Purity is half of faith," as we mentioned at the beginning of the Book of Purification.

The second cause: the strength of love lies in the strength and expansiveness of knowing God, the Exalted, and its dominion over the heart. This occurs after purifying the heart from all worldly distractions and attachments, akin to placing a seed in the earth after clearing it of weeds—this is the second stage. From this seed then grows the tree of love and knowledge, which is the good word to which God gave a parable when He said: "God sets forth a parable of a good word like a good tree, its root firm and its branches in the sky." And to this refers His saying, the Exalted: "To Him ascends the good word," meaning knowledge, "and the righteous deed raises it." Thus, the righteous deed is like an adornment for this knowledge and like a servant. Indeed, all righteous deeds consist first in purifying the heart from the world, then in maintaining its purity. The deed is sought only for the sake of this knowledge. As for the knowledge of how to perform deeds, it is sought for the deed itself. Thus, knowledge is both the first and the last. The first knowledge is that of spiritual conduct, its aim being action, and the aim of spiritual conduct is the clarity and purity of the heart, so that the radiance of Truth may become manifest within it and it may be adorned with the knowledge of gnosis, which is the knowledge of unveiling. Whenever this knowledge is attained, love necessarily follows, just as one of balanced temperament, upon beholding beauty and perceiving it with the outward eye, loves it and inclines toward it. And whenever one loves it, delight is attained. Thus, delight necessarily follows love, and love necessarily follows knowledge. One cannot reach this knowledge after severing worldly distractions from the heart except through pure reflection, constant remembrance, utmost exertion in seeking, and continuous contemplation of God, the Exalted, His attributes, the dominion of His heavens, and all His creation.

Those who attain this station are divided into the strong, whose first knowledge is of God Most High, and through Him they come to know other than Him; and the weak, whose first knowledge is of the acts, from which they then ascend to the Agent. To the first group is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Is it not sufficient that your Lord is Witness over all things?" and in His saying: "God bears witness that there is no god but He." From this is the statement of one of them when he was asked, 'How did you know your Lord?' He replied, 'I knew my Lord, and were it not for my Lord, I would not have known my Lord.' To the second group is the allusion in His saying: "We will show them Our signs on the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth," and in His saying, mighty and majestic: "Have they not contemplated the dominion of the heavens and the earth?" and in His saying: "Say, 'Observe what is in the heavens and the earth,'" and in His saying: "He who created seven heavens in layers. You see no incongruity in the creation of the All-Merciful. So return your gaze; do you see any flaw? Then return your gaze twice again; your gaze will come back to you humbled and weary.'" This path is the easiest for the majority and the broadest for the wayfarers, and to it belongs most of the Qur'an's call when commanding reflection, contemplation, taking heed, and observing signs beyond enumeration.

If you say: Both paths are difficult, so clarify for us from them what can be relied upon to attain knowledge and through it reach love, then know that the higher path is bearing witness by the Truth, exalted is He, over all creation, but it is obscure, and discourse concerning it lies beyond the comprehension of most people, so there is no benefit in presenting it in books. As for the easier, lower path, most of it is not beyond the grasp of understandings; rather, understandings fall short of it due to their turning away from contemplation and their preoccupation with worldly desires and the interests of the self. What prevents mentioning this [path] is its vastness, its abundance, and the branching of its doors beyond enumeration and limit, for there is not a single particle from the highest heavens to the depths of the earths except that within it are wondrous signs pointing to the perfection of God Almighty's power, the perfection of His wisdom, and the ultimate extent of His majesty and greatness, and that is among what is infinite: "Say, 'If the sea were ink for [writing] the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted.'" Delving into it is immersion in the seas of the sciences of unveiling, and one cannot intrude with it upon the sciences of practical conduct. However, it is possible to allude to a single example with brevity, so that an alertness to its kind may occur. We say:

The easier of the two paths is to contemplate the actions. Let us speak of them and leave aside the loftier, then the divine actions are many, so we seek the least, the most insignificant, and the smallest of them, and let us reflect upon their wonders. The least of the creations is the earth and what is upon it—I mean, in comparison to the angels and the dominion of the heavens—for if you contemplate it from the perspective of body and size in form, the sun, as you see in its smallness of volume, is like the earth one hundred and sixty-some times over. So consider the smallness of the earth in comparison to it. Then consider the smallness of the sun in comparison to its celestial sphere in which it is fixed, for it bears no proportion to it, and it is in the fourth heaven, and it is small in comparison to what is above it of the seven heavens. Then the heavens in the Throne are like a ring in a desert, and the Throne in the Footstool is likewise. This is a contemplation of the outward forms from the perspective of magnitudes, and how insignificant is the entire earth in comparison to them! Nay, how small is the earth in comparison to the seas! For the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The earth in the sea is like a stable on the earth." The truth of this is known by observation and experience, and it is known that the exposed part of the earth from the water is like a small island in comparison to the whole earth. Then consider the human being, created from dust—which is a part of the earth—and the rest of the animals, and his smallness in comparison to the earth. Leave all that aside. The smallest of what we know of animals is the mosquito, the bee, and what follows their course. So reflect upon the mosquito despite its minute size, and contemplate it with a present intellect and a clear thought. Consider how God, exalted is He, created it in the form of the elephant, which is the greatest of animals! For He created for it a proboscis like its trunk, and He created for its small form all the other limbs just as He created them for the elephant, with the addition of two wings. And consider how He apportioned its outward limbs, causing its wing to grow, bringing forth its hand and its foot, and splitting its hearing and its sight? And how He arranged within its interior the limbs of nourishment and its instruments as He arranged in the rest of the animals, and placed within it the nourishing, attractive, repulsive, retentive, and digestive faculties as He placed in the rest of the animals. This is regarding its form and attributes. Then consider its guidance: how God, exalted is He, guided it to its nourishment and made it know that its nourishment is human blood. Then consider how He caused its instrument of flight to grow to reach the human! And how He created for it the long proboscis with its sharp tip! And how He guided it to the pores of human skin so that it places its proboscis in one of them! Then how He strengthened it so that it inserts therein the proboscis! And how He taught it to suck and draw the blood! And how He created the proboscis, despite its fineness, hollow so that the thin blood flows through it, reaches its interior, and spreads to all its parts, nourishing it! Then how He made it know that the human intends it with his hand, so He taught it the stratagem of escape and the readiness of its instrument! And He created for it the hearing by which it hears the faint movement of the hand while it is still distant from it, so it ceases sucking and flees! Then if the hand becomes still, it returns! Then consider how He created for it two pupils so that it sees the place of its nourishment and heads for it despite the smallness of its face. And consider that the pupil of every small animal, because its pupil does not bear eyelids due to its smallness—and the eyelids are polishers for the mirror of the pupil from dust and debris—He created for the mosquito and the fly. So look at the fly and you will see it constantly wiping its pupils with its hands.

As for humans and larger animals, He created eyelids for their pupils so that one may close over the other, with their edges sharp to gather the dust that reaches the pupil and cast it to the ends of the lashes. He created black eyelashes to gather the light of the eye, aid in vision, beautify the eye’s appearance, and form a lattice when dust stirs up, so one looks through the lattice of the lashes; their interweaving prevents dust from entering but does not hinder sight. As for the mosquito, He created for it two polished pupils without eyelids and taught it how to polish them with its hands. Due to the weakness of its sight, you see it rushing toward the lamp, for its vision is feeble and it seeks daylight. When the poor creature sees the lamp’s light at night, it thinks it is in a dark house and the lamp is a window from the dark house to a bright place. It keeps seeking the light and throwing itself toward it, but when it passes by and sees darkness, it thinks it missed the window and did not aim correctly, so it returns to it again until it burns. Perhaps you think this is due to its deficiency and ignorance, but know that human ignorance is greater than its ignorance. Indeed, the image of a person plunging into worldly desires is like the image of a moth rushing into the fire, for the lights of desires appear to a person from their outward form, and he does not know that beneath them lies deadly, lethal poison. He keeps throwing himself upon them until he becomes immersed in them, bound by them, and perishes eternally. If only human ignorance were like the ignorance of the moth! For in its delusion by the outward light, if it burns, it is freed instantly, while the person remains in the fire forever or for a long duration. Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would call out and say: “I am holding you back from the Fire, yet you rush into it like moths rushing.” This is a wondrous glimpse of the marvels of God’s creation in the smallest of animals, containing wonders that if all earlier and later generations gathered to comprehend its essence, they would fall short of its reality and fail to perceive evident matters from its outward form. As for the hidden meanings of this, none knows them except God Almighty.

Then in every animal and plant there is a wonder and wonders unique to it, shared by no other. Consider the bee and its marvels: how God inspired it to make homes from mountains, trees, and what they erect; how He extracted from its saliva wax and honey, making one a light and the other a cure. Then if you ponder the marvels of its affairs in gathering flowers and blossoms, avoiding impurities and filth, and obeying one among them who is largest in body—its leader—and the justice and fairness God has subjugated for its leader among them—so much so that it kills at the hive entrance any bee that has fallen on impurity—you would judge it another wonder of wonders, if you are insightful in yourself and free from the concerns of your belly, private parts, and the desires of your soul in opposing your peers and befriending your brothers. Then leave all that aside and look at its building of homes from wax, choosing from all shapes the hexagonal shape. It does not build a round, square, or pentagonal house, but a hexagonal one, due to a property in the hexagonal shape that the understanding of engineers falls short of grasping: that the widest and most capacious shapes are the round and those close to it. For the square has wasted corners, and the bee’s shape is round and oblong, so it avoids the square to prevent wasted corners remaining empty. If it built them round, gaps would remain outside the cells, for round shapes when gathered do not fit tightly together. No shape among angular shapes approaches the round in capacity and then fits together so that no gap remains after their assembly except the hexagon. This is a unique property of this shape. See how God inspired the bee, despite its small body and delicate frame, with subtlety and care for its existence and what it needs to enjoy its life. Glory to Him, how great is His affair, how vast His subtlety and favor!

Reflect upon this slight glimmer from the lowliest of creatures, and turn away from the wonders of the earthly and heavenly dominions. For the portion our limited comprehension has grasped of them, lifetimes would expire before it could be fully clarified. There is no proportion between what our knowledge encompasses and what the scholars and prophets encompass, nor any proportion between what the knowledge of all created beings encompasses and what God, Exalted is He, has reserved for His own knowledge. Indeed, all that creation has come to know does not deserve to be called knowledge in comparison to the knowledge of God, Exalted is He. By contemplating this and its like, the knowledge one possesses increases by the easier of the two paths, and with the increase of knowledge, love increases. If you are a seeker of the bliss of meeting God, Exalted is He, then cast the world behind your back and immerse your entire life in perpetual remembrance and necessary reflection, so that you may perhaps attain from it a small measure. Yet, by that small measure, you will gain a great, endless dominion.

Explanation of the Reason for the Disparity Among People in Love

Know that the believers share in the root of love due to their sharing in the root of affection, yet they differ in degree because of their differing in knowledge and in love for this world. For things only vary according to the variance of their causes. Most people possess from God, exalted is He, nothing but the attributes and names that have struck their hearing, which they then memorized and preserved. Perhaps they imagined for them meanings from which the Lord of lords is exalted, or perhaps they did not perceive their reality nor imagine for them a corrupt meaning, but rather believed in them with a faith of submission and affirmation, busying themselves with action and abandoning investigation. These are the people of safety from the companions of the right hand. Those who imagine are the astray, and those who know the realities are the ones brought near. God has mentioned the state of the three categories in His saying, exalted is He: "As for him who is of those brought near, then [for him is] rest, fragrance, and a garden of bliss" [Qur'an, 56:88-89]. If you only understand matters through examples, then let us strike an example for the variance in love. We say: The companions of al-Shafi'i, for example, share in love for al-Shafi'i—may God have mercy on him—both the jurists among them and the common folk, because they share in knowing his merit, his religion, the goodness of his conduct, and the praiseworthy qualities of his character. However, the common person knows his knowledge in a general way, while the jurist knows it in detail. Thus, the jurist's knowledge of him is more complete, and his admiration for him and love for him is stronger. For whoever sees the composition of a composer, approves of it, and recognizes his merit through it, will inevitably love him and his heart will incline to him. If he then sees another composition more excellent and wondrous than it, his love will inevitably multiply because his knowledge of his knowledge has multiplied. Likewise, a man may believe about a poet that he composes good poetry and thus love him. If he hears from the marvels of his poetry that which magnifies his skill and craft, his knowledge of him increases and his love for him increases. So it is with all crafts and virtues. The common person may hear that so-and-so is a composer and that his composition is good, but he does not know what is in the composition. Thus, he has a general knowledge and, accordingly, a general inclination. The insightful one, when he examines the compositions for the wonders they contain, his love inevitably multiplies, because the wonders of craft, poetry, and composition point to the perfection of the attributes of the doer, the composer, and the knower. In its totality, it is the making and composition of God, exalted is He. The common person knows and believes that. As for the insightful one, he contemplates the detail of God's making in it, until he sees in a mosquito, for example, such wonders of His making that his intellect is bewildered and his inner mind is perplexed by it, and because of it, the majesty, grandeur, and perfection of God's attributes in his heart inevitably increase, and thus his love for Him increases. Whenever his awareness of the wonders of God's making increases, he deduces from it the majesty and grandeur of God the Maker, and his knowledge of Him and love for Him increase. This ocean of knowledge—I mean knowledge of the wonders of God's making—is an ocean without a shore. Thus, inevitably, the variance among the people of knowledge in love is without limit. Among that which causes love to vary is the difference in the five causes we mentioned for love. For example, whoever loves God because He is a benefactor to him, bestowing favors upon him, and does not love Him for His essence, his love is weak, for it changes with the change of beneficence. Thus, his love in a state of tribulation is not like his love in a state of favor and blessings. As for one who loves Him for His essence and because He is deserving of love due to His perfection, beauty, glory, and majesty, his love does not vary with the variance of beneficence to him. This and its like is the cause of people's variance in love. The variance in love is the cause for the variance in the happiness of the Hereafter. Therefore, God, exalted is He, said: "And for the Hereafter are greater degrees and greater excellence" [Qur'an, 17:21].

Explanation of the Reason for the Shortcomings of Human Understanding in Knowing God, Exalted is He



Know that the most manifest and evident of existences is God, exalted be He. This would necessitate that knowledge of Him be the first of knowledges, the most readily grasped by understandings, and the easiest upon intellects. Yet you find the matter to be the opposite of that, so the cause for it must be clarified.

We said He is the most manifest and evident of existences for a reason you will not comprehend except by an example: When we see a person writing or sewing, for instance, his being alive is, to us, among the most manifest of existences. Thus, his life, his knowledge, his power, and his will to sew are more evident to us than his other apparent and hidden attributes. For his hidden attributes—like his desire, anger, disposition, health, and sickness—are all unknown to us. As for his apparent attributes, we do not know some of them, and we are uncertain about others, such as the measure of his height, the variation in his skin color, and other such qualities. However, his life, power, will, knowledge, and his being an animal are clear to us without our sense of sight being connected to his life, power, or will. For we do not perceive these attributes with any of the five senses. Yet we cannot know his life, power, and will except through his sewing and his movement. If we were to look at everything in the world besides him, we would not know his attribute by it. Thus, there is only a single indication for it, yet it is clear and evident.

Likewise, the existence of God, exalted be He, His power, His knowledge, and all His other attributes are necessarily witnessed by everything we observe and perceive with our outer and inner senses—from stone and clay, plants and trees, animals, sky and earth, stars, sea, fire, air, substance and accident. Indeed, the first witnesses to Him are our own souls, our bodies, our qualities, the shifting of our states, the changing of our hearts, and all our phases in our movements and stillness. The most manifest things in our knowledge are our own selves, then our sense-perceptions via the five senses, then our intellectual perceptions via reason and insight. Each one of these perceived things has but a single perceiver, a single witness, and a single proof. All that is in the world are eloquent witnesses and testifying proofs for the existence of their Creator, their Manager, their Disposer, and their Mover, indicating His knowledge, His power, His subtle grace, and His wisdom.

The perceivable existences are beyond enumeration. If the life of the writer is manifest to us, and nothing bears witness to it except a single witness—namely, what we sensed of the movement of his hand—then how can that not be manifest for which there is nothing conceivable in existence, within our souls or outside them, that is a witness to it and to His majesty and grandeur? For every single atom proclaims, by the tongue of its state, that its existence is not by itself, nor its movement by its own essence, and that it is in need of a Bringer-into-being and a Mover for it. This is witnessed first by the composition of our limbs, the harmony of our bones, flesh, nerves, the growth of our hair, the formation of our extremities, and all our other outer and inner parts. For we know they did not harmonize by themselves, just as we know the hand of the writer did not move by itself.

But since there remains nothing in existence—perceived, sensed, conceived, present, or absent—that is not a witness and a knower of the immensity of His manifestation, the intellects are dazzled and bewildered from perceiving Him.

That which our intellects fall short of comprehending has two causes: One is its own obscurity and hiddenness—the example of which is not hidden. The other is its ultimate clarity. This is like the bat, which sees by night but does not see by day—not due to the day's obscurity and concealment, but because of the intensity of its manifestation. For the sight of the bat is weak; the light of the sun dazzles it when it rises. Thus, the strength of its manifestation, combined with the weakness of its sight, becomes the cause for its inability to see. For we see nothing except when light mixes with darkness and its manifestation is weakened.

Thus, our intellects are weak, and the beauty of the Divine Presence is at the utmost degree of radiance and illumination, and at the peak of all-encompassing immersion, such that not an atom of the dominion of the heavens and the earth has escaped the manifestation of His presence. Thus, His manifestation has become the cause of His hiddenness. Glory be to the One who is veiled by the radiance of His light and concealed from insights by His very appearance. Let none be astonished that such hiddenness arises from manifestation, for things are made known by their opposites, and what is so pervasive in existence that it has no opposite becomes difficult to perceive. If things differed, and some indicated while others did not, distinction would be grasped with ease. But since they all share in indicating in a single, uniform pattern, the matter becomes obscure.

An example is the light of the sun shining upon the earth. We know it is an incidental attribute that occurs upon the earth and vanishes when the sun sets. If the sun were perpetually shining, never setting, we would suppose that bodies have no state except their colors—such as black, white, and others—for we would observe in black only blackness and in white only whiteness. As for the light itself, we would not perceive it alone. But when the sun sets and places darken, we grasp the distinction between the two states, and we learn that the bodies had been illuminated by a light and characterized by a quality that left them at sunset. Thus, we know the existence of light through its absence, and we would scarcely have become aware of it except through its lack, because we witness bodies as similar, not differing, in both darkness and light—this despite light being the most evident of sensed things, since by it all other sensed things are perceived. That which is manifest in itself and makes others manifest—consider how its matter becomes ambiguous due to its very manifestation, were it not for the occurrence of its opposite?

So God, exalted is He, is the most manifest of all things, and by Him all things are manifest. If He had any absence, disappearance, or change, the heavens and the earth would collapse, and sovereignty and dominion would be nullified. Then distinction between the two states would be perceived. If some things existed through Him and others through something else, the distinction between the two indicators would be grasped. But His indication is universal in all things, in a single pattern, and His existence is perpetual in all states, admitting no contrary. Thus, inevitably, intensity of manifestation has produced hiddenness. This is the reason for the deficiency of understandings.

As for one whose insight is strong and whose perception is not weakened, he is in a state of equilibrium in his affair. He sees nothing but God Almighty and knows no other. He knows that there is nothing in existence except God. His actions are an effect among the effects of His power, thus they follow Him and have no true existence apart from Him. Existence belongs solely to the One through whom all actions exist. One in this state does not look upon any action without seeing within it the Actor, becoming heedless of the action itself inasmuch as it is sky, earth, animal, or tree. Rather, he looks upon it from the perspective that it is the handiwork of the One True Reality, so his gaze does not pass beyond it to another. This is like one who looks at a person's poetry, handwriting, or composition and sees within them the poet and the composer, perceiving his traces from the perspective of his trace, not from the perspective that it is ink, gallnut, and vitriol inscribed upon whiteness. Thus, he does not look at anything other than the composer. The entire world is the composition of God Almighty. So whoever looks upon it from the perspective that it is the act of God, knows it as the act of God, and loves it as the act of God, does not look except in God, knows nothing but God, and loves nothing but Him. He is the true monotheist who sees nothing but God. Indeed, he does not look upon his own self from the perspective of his self, but from the perspective that he is a servant of God. This is the one of whom it is said that he is annihilated in divine unity and annihilated from his self. To this alludes the saying of one who said: "We were with us, then we were annihilated from us, and we remained without 'we'." These are matters known to the possessors of insight, yet they have become obscure due to the weakness of understandings in grasping them and the incapacity of scholars' ability to clarify and explain them with an expression that conveys the meaning to minds. Or due to their preoccupation with themselves and their belief that explaining this to others is of no concern to them. This is the cause for the deficiency of understandings in knowing God Almighty. Added to this is that all the perceptible things which bear witness to God are only perceived by a person in childhood when reason is absent. Then the innate faculty of reason appears in him little by little while he is wholly absorbed in concern for his desires and has become accustomed to his perceptions and sensory experiences, growing familiar with them, so their impact upon his heart has fallen away due to prolonged familiarity. Therefore, if he suddenly sees a strange animal, a strange plant, or an act of God Almighty that breaks customary norms and is wondrous, his tongue naturally utters knowledge, saying, "Glory be to God!" Yet he sees throughout the entire day his own self, his limbs, and all the familiar animals—all of which are decisive witnesses—but he does not feel their testimony due to prolonged familiarity with them. Were a blind man, having reached the age of reason, to have the veil lifted from his eye and his sight extended to the sky, the earth, the trees, plants, and animals all at once, suddenly, one would fear for his reason that it might be dazzled by the greatness of his wonder at the testimony of wonders to their Creator.

This and similar causes, coupled with immersion in base desires, are what have blocked humanity from the path of illumination by the lights of divine knowledge and from swimming in its vast oceans. In their quest to know God, people are like the bewildered man of the parable: he is mounted upon his donkey, yet he searches for his donkey. When that which is clear and evident becomes an object of pursuit, it becomes elusive and difficult to grasp. This is the secret of this matter—let it be deeply contemplated. And for this reason it is said:

It has become manifest, yet it does not remain hidden except from one who is blind and knows not the moon. But it is concealed by what it has revealed, so how can one who is veiled by custom recognize what has been veiled?

Explanation of the Meaning of Longing for God, Exalted is He

Know that whoever denies the reality of love for God Most High must inevitably deny the reality of longing, for longing cannot be conceived except toward a beloved. We affirm the existence of longing for God Most High, and that the knower is compelled toward it by way of reflection and insight through the lights of inner vision, and by way of reports and transmitted traditions. As for reflection, what has preceded in establishing love suffices to prove it, for every beloved is inevitably longed for in absence, whereas what is present is not longed for, since longing is a seeking and yearning for something, and what is present is not sought. But its explanation is that longing cannot be conceived except toward something that is perceived from one aspect and not perceived from another. As for what is not perceived at all, it is not longed for, for one who has never seen a person, nor heard a description of them, cannot be conceived to long for them. And what is perceived in its entirety is not longed for, for complete perception is through vision; thus, whoever is in constant sight of their beloved, gazing upon them perpetually, cannot be conceived to have longing. Rather, longing attaches only to what is perceived from one aspect and not perceived from another, and it is from two aspects that is not unveiled except by an example from observable things.

We say, for example: when one's beloved is absent, yet their image remains in the heart, one yearns to complete that image through vision. But if the memory, image, and knowledge of them were erased from the heart until they were forgotten, one could not conceive of yearning for them. And if one saw them, one could not conceive of yearning at the moment of seeing. Thus, the meaning of longing is the soul's yearning to complete its image. Similarly, one may see them in darkness such that the true form is not unveiled, and so one longs to complete the vision and achieve full unveiling of their form by the illumination of light upon it.

The second is when one beholds the face of the beloved but does not see, for example, their hair or any of their other beauties, and thus yearns to see them—even if one has never seen these features at all and no image arising from sight has been established in the soul. Rather, one knows that the beloved possesses a limb and limbs of beauty, yet has not grasped the details of their beauty through vision, and so longs for what has never been seen to be unveiled.

Both aspects are conceivable in relation to God Almighty—indeed, they are necessarily inherent for all who possess spiritual knowledge. For the divine realities that become clear to the knowers—even if they reach the utmost clarity—are as if veiled behind a delicate curtain, never attaining absolute transparency, but rather tinged with the impurities of imaginings. In this world, the imagination never ceases to represent and imitate all that is known, and these imaginings cloud true knowledge and disturb its purity. To these are added the distractions of worldly affairs. Perfect clarity is achieved only through direct vision and the full radiance of divine manifestation, and this occurs solely in the Hereafter. This necessarily gives rise to longing, for it is the ultimate object of the knowers’ desire. This is the first type of longing: the desire for the completion of clarity in what has already been grasped to some degree.

The second is that divine realities are without end. Each servant among the servants only uncovers a portion of them, while an infinite number of matters remain obscure. The knower is aware of their existence and that they are known to God Almighty. He knows that what is absent from his knowledge far exceeds what is present, so he remains in a state of longing to attain the root of knowledge regarding what he has not yet acquired from the remaining realities he does not know at all—neither with clear knowledge nor with obscure.

The first yearning culminates in the Hereafter with the meaning termed vision, meeting, and witnessing, and it is inconceivable that it would find rest in this world. Ibrahim ibn Adham was among the yearning ones, and he said: One day I said, "O Lord, if You have given any of Your lovers something by which his heart finds rest before meeting You, then grant me that, for anxiety has afflicted me." He said: Then I saw in a dream that He stood me before Him and said, "O Ibrahim, are you not ashamed before Me to ask Me to grant you something by which your heart finds rest before meeting Me? Does the yearner find rest before meeting his Beloved?" So I said, "O Lord, I am lost in love for You, so I knew not what to say. Forgive me and teach me what to say." He said, "Say: O Allah, make me content with Your decree, make me patient under Your trial, and inspire me to give thanks for Your blessings." For this yearning finds rest only in the Hereafter.

As for the second type of longing, it resembles that which has no end, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter, for its culmination is that the servant be unveiled in the Hereafter from the majesty of God Almighty, His attributes, His wisdom, and His acts that which is known to God Almighty, and that is impossible because it has no end. The servant remains ever aware that there remains of beauty and majesty what has not become clear to him, so his longing never subsides, especially for one who sees above his station many degrees. Yet, he longs for the perfection of union while having attained the foundation of union, thus he finds for that a delightful longing in which no pain appears, nor is it far-fetched that the subtleties of unveiling and vision might follow one upon another without end, so bliss and delight increase perpetually forever, and the delight of what is renewed from the subtleties of bliss preoccupies from feeling the longing for what has not been attained. This is on the condition that unveiling is possible regarding what has not been unveiled in this world at all, for if that is not granted, then the bliss remains at a limit that does not multiply but is continuous perpetually. His saying, exalted and glorified is He: "Their light runs before them and on their right hands; they say, 'Our Lord, perfect for us our light,'" is susceptible to this meaning: that He bestows upon him the completion of light however much he provisioned from the world the foundation of light. And it is susceptible that the intended meaning is the completion of light in other than what was illuminated in the world—an illumination needing increase in perfection and radiance—so that is what is intended by its completion. And His saying, exalted is He: "Wait for us, that we may borrow from your light—it was said, 'Turn back behind you and seek a light,'" indicates that the lights must have their foundation provisioned in the world, then increase in radiance in the Hereafter. As for a light being newly created, no. Judgment in this by conjecture of suspicions is perilous, and what is reliable in it has not been unveiled to us yet, so we ask God Almighty to increase us in knowledge and right guidance and to show us the truth as truth. This measure of the lights of insight is revealing of the realities and meanings of longing.

As for the evidences from the narrations and traditions, they are too numerous to count. Among the well-known supplications of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, is that he would say: "O God, I ask You for contentment after the decree, and a coolness of life after death, and the delight of gazing upon Your Noble Countenance, and the yearning for meeting You."

And Abu al-Darda' said to Ka'b: "Inform me of the most specific verse"—meaning in the Torah—so he said: "God, the Exalted, says: 'Long has been the yearning of the righteous for My meeting, and I am for their meeting even more intensely yearning.'" He said: "And written beside it is: 'Whoever seeks Me finds Me, and whoever seeks other than Me does not find Me.'" So Abu al-Darda' said: "I bear witness that I indeed heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say this."

In the accounts of David, peace be upon him: Indeed, God the Exalted said: O David, convey to the inhabitants of My earth that I am a beloved to whoever loves Me, a companion to whoever keeps My company, a source of intimate fellowship to whoever finds solace in My remembrance, a friend to whoever befriends Me, a chooser of whoever chooses Me, and obedient to whoever obeys Me. No servant loves Me while knowing that with certainty from his heart, except that I accept him for Myself and love him with a love that none of My creation precedes. Whoever seeks Me in truth finds Me, and whoever seeks other than Me does not find Me. Therefore, renounce, O inhabitants of the earth, the delusion you are in, and accompany Me and keep My company. Find intimate fellowship with Me, and I will fellowship with you, and I hasten to your love. For I created the clay of My beloved ones from the clay of Abraham My intimate friend, Moses My confidant, and Muhammad My chosen one, and I created the hearts of the yearning ones from My light, and I made them rejoice in My majesty.

It has been narrated from some of the pious predecessors: Allah, the Exalted, revealed to one of the truthful servants: "Verily, I have servants among My servants who love Me and I love them, who yearn for Me and I yearn for them, who remember Me and I remember them, who look to Me and I look to them. If you follow their path, I will love you, and if you deviate from them, I will detest you." He said: "O Lord, and what is their sign?" He said: "They watch over the shadows by day as the compassionate shepherd watches over his flock, and they long for the setting sun as the bird longs for its nest at dusk. When night envelops them and darkness mingles, when beds are spread and couches are set up, and every intimate is alone with their beloved, they stand upon their feet and prostrate upon their faces, and they commune with Me through My words, and they appeal to Me through My favors. Among them is one crying out and weeping, and another sighing and complaining; one standing and another sitting; one bowing and another prostrating. With My eye, I see what they endure for My sake, and with My hearing, I hear what they lament from love of Me. The first thing I grant them is three: I cast from My light into their hearts, so they speak of Me as I speak of them. The second: If the heavens and the earth and all within them were placed in their scales, it would be too little for them. The third: I turn My face toward them; and do you see the one upon whom I have turned My face? Does anyone know what I intend to bestow upon him?"

In the accounts of David, peace be upon him: Indeed, God Almighty revealed to him: "O David, for how long will you remember Paradise and not ask Me for longing for Me?" He said: "O Lord, who are those who long for You?" He said: "The longing ones are those whom I have purified from every impurity, alerted through caution, and rent from their hearts a rent through which they gaze upon Me. I carry their hearts and place them upon My heaven. Then I call the noble ones of My angels, and when they gather, they prostrate to Me. I say: 'I did not call you to prostrate to Me, but I called you to display to you the hearts of those who long for Me, and to boast through you to the people of longing for Me. For their hearts shine in My heaven for My angels as the sun shines for the people of the earth. O David, I created the hearts of the longing from My pleasure and favored them with the light of My Countenance, so I took them for Myself as My intimate confidants. I made their bodies the place of My gaze upon the earth, and I cut from their hearts a path through which they gaze upon Me, increasing in longing each day.'" David said: "O Lord, show me the people of Your love." He said: "O David, go to Mount Lebanon, for there are fourteen souls upon it—among them youths, among them elders, and among them middle-aged. When you come to them, convey My peace to them and say to them: 'Your Lord sends you peace and says to you: Will you not ask for a need? For you are My beloved, My chosen, and My friends. I rejoice in your joy and hasten to your love.'"

So David, peace be upon him, came to them and found them by a spring, contemplating the majesty of God, Mighty and Majestic. When they looked upon David, peace be upon him, they rose to disperse from him. David said: "I am the messenger of God to you. I have come to deliver to you a message from your Lord." They turned towards him, directing their hearing to his words and casting their gazes to the ground. David said: "I am the messenger of God to you. He sends you peace and says to you: 'Will you not ask for a need? Will you not call upon Me that I may hear your voice and your speech? For you are My beloved, My chosen, and My friends. I rejoice in your joy and hasten to your love, and I look upon you every hour with the look of the compassionate, tender mother.'" He said: Tears flowed upon their cheeks.

Their elder said: "Glory be to You, glory be to You! We are Your servants and the sons of Your servants, so forgive us for what diverted our hearts from Your remembrance in the past of our lives." Another said: "Glory be to You, glory be to You! We are Your servants and the sons of Your servants, so bestow upon us the grace of goodly regard between us and You." Another said: "Glory be to You, glory be to You! We are Your servants and the sons of Your servants. Would we dare to supplicate when You know we have no need for anything in our affairs? So make us constant in the path to You and complete that favor upon us." Another said: "We are deficient in seeking Your pleasure, so help us against ourselves by Your generosity." Another said: "From a drop You created us and favored us with contemplation of Your majesty. Would one who is occupied with Your majesty, contemplating Your grandeur, dare to speak? Our quest is nearness to Your light." Another said: "Our tongues are incapable of supplicating You due to the greatness of Your affair, Your closeness to Your friends, and the abundance of Your favor upon the people of Your love." Another said: "You have guided our hearts to Your remembrance and freed us to be occupied with You, so forgive us our shortcoming in thanking You." Another said: "You already know our need; it is only to gaze upon Your Countenance." Another said: "How can a servant dare before his Master? Since You have commanded us to supplicate by Your generosity—grant us a light by which we may be guided in the darknesses of the layers of the heavens?" Another said: "We call upon You to turn to us and make it perpetual with us." Another said: "We ask You for the completion of Your favor in what You have granted us and bestowed upon us." Another said: "We have no need for anything of Your creation, so bestow upon us the gaze upon the beauty of Your Countenance." Another said: "I ask You from among them that You blind my eye from looking at the world and its people, and my heart from being occupied with the Hereafter." Another said: "You have known—Blessed and Exalted are You—that You love Your friends, so bestow upon us the occupation of the heart with You to the exclusion of everything besides You."

Then God Almighty revealed to David, peace be upon him: "Say to them: I have heard your speech and answered you to what you desired. So let each one of you depart from his companion and take for himself a secluded cell, for I shall lift the veil between Me and you until you gaze upon My light and My majesty." David said: "O Lord, by what did they attain this from You?" He said: "By good expectation, abstention from the world and its people, seclusions with Me, and their intimate prayers to Me. This is a station none attains except one who rejects the world and its people, does not occupy himself with any remembrance of it, empties his heart for Me, and chooses Me over all My creation. At that point, I incline to him, empty his soul, and lift the veil between Me and him until he gazes upon Me with the gaze of one looking with his eye at a thing. I show him My honor every hour and bring him near to the light of My Countenance. If he falls ill, I make him ill as the compassionate mother makes her child ill. If he thirsts, I quench him and let him taste the flavor of My remembrance. When I do that to him, O David, his soul becomes blind to the world and its people, and I do not make him love it. He does not cease from being occupied with Me; he hastens My coming, and I dislike to cause his death because he is the place of My gaze among My creation. He sees none but Me, and I see none but him. If you were to see him, O David, with his soul melted, his body emaciated, and his bones shattered..."

His limbs tremble and his heart is rent asunder when he hears the remembrance with which I boast of him to My angels and the inhabitants of My heavens, increasing in fear and worship. By My might and majesty, O David, I shall seat him in Paradise and I shall heal the breasts of those who gaze upon Me until they are content, and beyond contentment.

And in the accounts of David, peace be upon him, it is also said: Say to My servants who are turned toward My love: What harm has befallen you if I have veiled Myself from My creation and lifted the veil between Me and you, so that you may gaze upon Me with the eyes of your hearts? And what harm has befallen you from what I have withheld from you of this world, if I have spread My religion for you? And what harm has befallen you from the displeasure of creation, if you have sought My pleasure?

And in the reports of David as well: Indeed, Allah the Exalted revealed to him: You claim that you love Me. If you truly love Me, then expel the love of this world from your heart, for My love and its love do not gather together in one heart. O David, be purely for My beloved ones in purity, and mix with the people of the world in mixing, but your religion—entrust it to Me and do not entrust your religion to men. As for what has become clear to you that conforms to My love, hold fast to it. And as for what is obscure to you, entrust it to Me in truth, upon the condition that I hasten to govern you and set you aright, and I become your leader and your guide. I give you without you asking Me, and I aid you in hardships. And I have sworn upon Myself that I reward none except a servant whose quest and intention I have known to be the folding of his side before Me, and that he has no sufficiency apart from Me. If you are thus, I remove abasement and estrangement from you and settle richness in your heart. For I have sworn upon Myself that no servant of Mine finds tranquility in himself, looking to his own deeds, except that I abandon him to them. Ascribe things to Me; do not oppose your work so that you become toiling, and he who accompanies you does not benefit from you, and you find no limit for My knowledge, for it has no end. And whenever you seek increase from Me, I give you, and you find no limit to increase from Me. Then know, among the Children of Israel, that there is no kinship between Me and any of My creation. So let their aspiration and their will be great before Me, and I will permit for them what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and what has not occurred to the heart of any human. Place Me between your eyes and look to Me with the sight of your heart, and do not look with the eye in your head at those whose intellects I have veiled, so they have despaired and I have withheld My reward from them. For I have sworn by My might and majesty that I will not open My reward to a servant who enters into obedience to Me for the sake of trial and procrastination. Be humble before whom you know, and do not be haughty over the seekers. If the people of My love knew the station of the seekers with Me, they would be as earth upon which they walk. O David, that you bring out a seeker from an intoxication he is in, rescuing him, I write you with Me as one striving. And whom I write with Me as striving, upon him there is no estrangement nor need for the created beings. O David, hold fast to My speech and take from your soul for your soul; do not come to Me from it, lest I veil from you My trial. Do not cause My servants to despair of My mercy. Sever your desire for My sake, for I have only permitted desires for the weak among My creation. What is the matter with the strong that they attain to desires? For they diminish the sweetness of intimate discourse with Me. And indeed, the punishment of the strong with Me, in the place of partaking, the least that reaches them is that I veil their intellects from Me, for I was not pleased with the world for My beloved and I have purified him from it. O David, do not place between Me and you a scholar who veils you with his intoxication from My love. Those are the highway robbers upon My servant-seekers. Seek help in abandoning desires by persisting in fasting, and beware of trial in breaking the fast, for My love is for the persistence of fasting. O David, endear yourself to Me by opposing your soul; prevent it from desires. Look to Me and you will see the veils between Me and you lifted. I only deal with you gently so that you may have strength for My reward when I bestow it upon you, and I withhold it from you while you hold fast to obedience to Me.

God Almighty revealed to David: O David, if those who turn away from Me knew how I await them, My gentleness with them, and My longing for them to abandon their sins, they would die of yearning for Me and their limbs would be severed out of love for Me. O David, this is My will concerning those who turn away—so what then of My will concerning those who draw near to Me? O David, the servant is in greatest need of Me when he feels independent of Me, and I am most merciful to My servant when he turns away from Me, and he is most honored before Me when he returns to Me. These reports and their countless like affirm the reality of love, longing, and intimate communion. The true meaning of these is unveiled by what has preceded.

Explanation of God's Love for the Servant and Its Meaning

Know that the evidences of the Quran converge in showing that God, exalted is He, loves His servant; thus, it is necessary to understand the meaning of this. Let us first present the evidences of His love, for God, exalted is He, has said: "He loves them, and they love Him," and He has said: "Indeed, God loves those who fight in His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure," and He has said: "Indeed, God loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves." For this reason, the Almighty refuted the one who claimed to be the beloved of God by saying: "Say, then why does He punish you for your sins?"

It has been narrated by Anas from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "When God, the Exalted, loves a servant, no sin harms him, and the repentant from sin is like one who has no sin." Then he recited: "Indeed, God loves those who constantly repent." Its meaning is that when He loves him, He grants him repentance before death, so past sins do not harm him, even if they are many, just as past disbelief does not harm after embracing Islam. God, the Exalted, has made the forgiveness of sin a condition for His love, saying: "Say, 'If you love God, then follow me; God will love you and forgive you your sins.'"

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, God Almighty gives the worldly life to those He loves and to those He does not love, but He does not grant faith except to those He loves."

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever humbles himself for God, God will elevate him; and whoever acts arrogantly, God will abase him; and whoever frequently remembers God, God will love him."

And upon him be peace, he said: "God Almighty said: 'The servant continues to draw near to Me through supererogatory acts until I love him. And when I love him, I become his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees.'"

Zaid ibn Aslam said: Indeed, Allah loves a servant so profoundly that He may say: "Do as you wish, for I have forgiven you." The expressions of divine love that have been transmitted are beyond enumeration.

We have previously established that the servant's love for God, exalted be He, is a reality and not metaphorical, for in the linguistic sense, love denotes the soul's inclination toward that which is agreeable, while passionate infatuation denotes an overwhelming, excessive inclination. We have clarified that beneficence is agreeable to the soul, and beauty is also agreeable, and that beauty and beneficence are at times perceived by the physical sight and at times perceived by the inner insight. Love follows each of these perceptions and is not exclusive to physical sight.

As for God's love for the servant, it cannot possibly be understood in this sense at all. Rather, all names, when applied to God, Exalted is He, and to other than God, are not applied to both in a single, identical sense whatsoever. Even the name "Existence," which is the most general of names in terms of shared application, does not encompass the Creator and the creation in one and the same manner. On the contrary, everything other than God, Exalted is He, derives its existence from the existence of God, Exalted is He. The dependent existence cannot be equal to the existence upon which it depends. The equivalence lies merely in the application of the name, akin to the horse and the tree sharing the name "body," for the meaning and reality of corporeality are similar in both, without either one inherently deserving it as an essential attribute, since the corporeality of one is not derived from the other. Such is not the case with the name "Existence" for God or for His creation. This disparity is even more evident in all other names, such as Knowledge, Will, Power, and the like. In all of these, the Creator in no way resembles the creation. The originator of language established these names primarily—or not—for creation, for creation is more readily grasped by intellects and understandings than the Creator. Therefore, their application to the Creator is by way of metaphor, figurative usage, and transference.

In linguistic usage, love is an expression of the soul's inclination toward a suitable, agreeable object. This is only conceivable for a deficient soul, for it attains a perfection by obtaining what agrees with it and delights in attaining it. This is impossible for God, Exalted is He, for every perfection, beauty, splendor, and majesty possible for divinity is eternally and perpetually present, inherent, and necessarily existent. Its renewal or disappearance is inconceivable. Thus, He has no regard for other than Himself inasmuch as it is other; rather, His regard is only for His own Essence and His own acts. In existence, there is nothing but His Essence and His acts. For this reason, when the verse, "He loves them, and they love Him," was recited to him, the Shaykh Abū Saʿīd al-Mīhanī, may God have mercy on him, said: "Rightly does He love them, for He loves none but Himself"—meaning that He is the All and that there is nothing in existence other than Him. Therefore, whoever loves only his own self, his own acts, and his own compositions does not extend his love beyond his own essence and what follows from his essence insofar as they are related to his essence. Thus, he loves only himself. As for the expressions that have come regarding His love for His servants, they are interpreted, and their meaning reverts to the lifting of the veil from his [the servant's] heart so that he may see Him with his heart, to enabling him to attain proximity to Him, and to His eternal will for that for him. Therefore, His love for whom He loves is eternal whenever it is attributed to the eternal will that necessitated enabling this servant to tread the paths of this proximity. And when it is attributed to His act which lifts the veil from the heart of His servant, it is a temporal occurrence that happens with the occurrence of its necessitating cause, as God, Exalted is He, has said: "My servant continues to draw near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him." Thus, his drawing near through supererogatory works becomes a cause for the purity of his innermost being, the removal of the veil from his heart, and his arrival at the station of proximity to his Lord. All of that is the act of God, Exalted is He, and His gentleness toward him, and that is the meaning of His love.

This cannot be understood except by an example: It is that a king may bring his servant close to himself and permit him at all times to be present in his court, due to the king's inclination toward him—either to support him with his strength, to find comfort in seeing him, to seek his counsel in his opinion, or to prepare the means for his food and drink. Then it is said: "The king loves him," and its meaning is the king's inclination toward him for what is in him of a meaning agreeable and suitable to him. And a king may bring a servant close and not prevent him from entering upon him, not for benefiting from him nor for seeking his aid, but because the servant in himself is described with praiseworthy morals and noble qualities that befit him to be close to the presence of the king and abundant in share of his nearness, while the king has no purpose in him at all. So when the king lifts the veil between himself and him, it is said: "He has loved him." And when he acquires from the noble qualities what necessitates the lifting of the veil, it is said: "He has drawn near and endeared himself to the king." Thus, God's love for the servant is only by the second meaning, not the first. And it is only correct to illustrate it by the second meaning on the condition that there does not precede into your understanding the entrance of change upon Him with the renewal of nearness. For the beloved is the one close to God Almighty, and nearness to God lies in distancing oneself from the attributes of beasts, predators, and devils, and in adorning oneself with noble morals, which are the divine morals. So it is a nearness by attribute, not by place. And whoever was not near and then became near has changed. So perhaps one might think by this that when nearness is renewed, the description of the servant and the Lord both have changed, since He became near after not being near—and that is impossible in the case of God Almighty, for change upon Him is impossible. Rather, He remains perpetually in the attributes of perfection and majesty as He was in the eternity of eternities.

This matter cannot be unveiled except through an analogy of proximity between persons. For two persons may draw near to one another by both moving, or one may be stationary while the other moves, thus achieving proximity through a change in one without a change in the other. Indeed, proximity in attributes is likewise. For the student seeks proximity to the degree of his master in the perfection and beauty of knowledge, while the master stands firm in the perfection of his knowledge, not moving by descending to the degree of the student. The student is moving, ascending from the depths of ignorance to the heights of knowledge, ever striving in change and ascension until he draws near to his master, while the master is constant and unchanging. In the same way, one should understand the servant's ascension through the degrees of proximity. Whenever he becomes more perfect in attribute, more complete in knowledge, more encompassing in the realities of matters, more established in strength to subdue Satan and suppress base desires, and more manifest in purity from vices, he draws nearer to the degree of perfection. The ultimate perfection belongs to God, and each person's proximity to God, exalted is He, is according to his own perfection. Indeed, a student may be capable of drawing near to his master, equaling him, or even surpassing him, but this is impossible in relation to God, for His perfection has no end. The servant's journey through the degrees of perfection is finite and ends only at a limited boundary, so he has no hope of equality. Moreover, the degrees of proximity vary with a variation that also has no end, due to the absence of any limit to that perfection.

Thus, God’s love for the servant is His drawing him near to Himself by removing distractions and sins from him, purifying his inner being from the impurities of this world, and lifting the veil from his heart until he beholds Him as if he sees Him with his heart.

As for the servant's love for God, it is his inclination toward attaining that perfection which he is bankrupt of and lacking in. Thus, he yearns for what has eluded him, and when he attains something of it, he delights in it. Longing and love, in this sense, are impossible for God, the Exalted.

If you ask: "God's love for the servant is a matter of ambiguity, so how does the servant know that he is beloved to God?" I say:
It is recognized by its signs. It has been said: "When God loves a servant, He tests him; and when He loves him with an intense love, He takes possession of him." It was asked: "What does 'takes possession of him' mean?" He replied: "He leaves him neither family nor wealth." Thus, the sign of God's love for a servant is that He makes him feel estranged from all else and places a barrier between him and all else.

It was said to Jesus, peace be upon him: "Why do you not buy a donkey to ride?" He replied: "I am too precious to God, exalted is He, for Him to occupy me with a donkey instead of Himself."

In the tradition: "When God, exalted is He, loves a servant, He tests him. If he endures patiently, He chooses him. If he is content, He selects him."

Some scholars have said: When you see that He loves you and you see that He tests you, then know that He intends to draw you into intimate friendship.

A disciple said to his master: "I have glimpsed something of divine love." He replied: "O my son, has a beloved equal been presented to you, and have you preferred Him over that beloved?" The disciple said: "No." The master said: "Then do not aspire to divine love, for He does not grant it to a servant until He tests him."

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When God, exalted is He, loves a servant, He appoints for him an admonisher from his own self and a restrainer from his heart, commanding him and forbidding him." And he said: "When God, exalted is He, desires good for a servant, He shows him the faults of his own soul." Thus, the most specific sign of his love for God, exalted is He, is that it indicates God's love for him.

As for the action indicating that one is beloved by God, it is that God Almighty takes charge of his affair—both outwardly and inwardly, in secret and in public—so that He becomes the one who advises him, manages his matters, adorns his character, employs his limbs, guides his outer and inner states, makes his concerns a single concern, instills hatred for this world in his heart, makes him feel estranged from all else, grants him the delight of intimate communion in his solitude, and lifts the veils between him and the knowledge of Him. This and the like are signs of God’s love for the servant. Let us now mention the signs of the servant’s love for God Almighty, for these too are among the signs of God’s love for the servant.

The Discourse on the Signs of the Servant's Love for God, Exalted is He

Know that love is claimed by everyone, yet how easy is the claim and how rare is the true essence. Therefore, one should not be deceived by the trickery of Satan and the illusions of the self, however much one professes love for God Almighty, unless it is tested by signs and demanded by proofs and evidences. Love is a goodly tree, its root firm and its branch in heaven, and its fruits appear in the heart, the tongue, and the limbs. These abundant effects flowing from it upon the heart and limbs indicate love, just as smoke indicates fire and fruits indicate trees. They are many, among them is the love of meeting the Beloved through unveiling and direct witnessing in the Abode of Peace. It is inconceivable that the heart should love a beloved without loving to see Him and meet Him. And when it knows that there is no arrival except by departing from this world and leaving it through death, then one ought to be a lover of death, not fleeing from it. For the lover is not burdened by journeying from his homeland to the abode of his beloved to delight in beholding Him, and death is the key to meeting and the gate of entry into direct witnessing.

He said: "Whoever loves to meet God, God loves to meet him."

Hudhayfah said at the time of his death: "A beloved has come in a state of need; never shall prosper one who regrets."

Some of the early pious said: There is no trait more beloved to God for a servant to possess, after the love of meeting God, than abundant prostration. Thus, he gave precedence to the love of meeting God over prostration. And God, glorified and exalted, has made truthfulness in love conditional upon being killed in His cause, when they said, "Indeed, we love God." So He made being killed in God's cause and seeking martyrdom its sign, as the Almighty said: "Indeed, God loves those who fight in His cause in ranks," and the Mighty and Majestic said: "They fight in the cause of God, so they kill and are killed."

In the counsel of Abu Bakr to 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both: Truth is weighty, yet despite its weight it is pleasing; and falsehood is light, yet despite its lightness it is vile. If you preserve my counsel, no absent thing will be more beloved to you than death, for it shall surely reach you. And if you neglect my counsel, no absent thing will be more detested by you than death, yet you will not escape it.

It is narrated from Ishaq ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, who said: My father related to me that Abdullah ibn Jahsh said to him on the day of Uhud: "Shall we not supplicate to God?" So they withdrew to a secluded spot, and Abdullah ibn Jahsh supplicated, saying: "O Lord, I adjure You: when I meet the enemy tomorrow, confront me with a man of mighty strength and fierce wrath, that I may fight him for Your sake and he may fight me. Then let him seize me and cut off my nose and my ear, and slit open my belly. So that when I meet You tomorrow, You will say: 'O Abdullah, who cut off your nose and your ear?' and I will reply: 'For Your sake, O Lord, and for the sake of Your Messenger,' and You will say: 'You have spoken truthfully.'" Sa'd said: "Indeed, I saw him at the end of the day, with his nose and his ear hanging by a thread." Said ibn al-Musayyib said: "I hope that God will fulfill the latter part of his oath as He fulfilled the first."

Sufyan al-Thawri and Bishr al-Hafi would say: None despises death except the suspicious, for the beloved, in every state, does not despise meeting his beloved.

Al-Buwayti said to one of the ascetics: "Do you love death?" It was as if he hesitated, so he said: "If you were truthful, you would love it." And he recited the saying of the Almighty: 'Then wish for death if you are truthful.' The man said: "But the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'Let none of you wish for death.'" He replied: "He only said that due to an affliction that had befallen him, for contentment with the decree of God Almighty is better than seeking escape from it."

If you ask: "Can one who does not love death be considered a lover of God?" I say: Aversion to death may stem from love of this world and sorrow at parting from family, wealth, and children. This contradicts the perfection of love for God Almighty, for perfect love is that which consumes the entire heart. Yet it is not impossible that alongside love for family and children, there exists a weak trace of love for God Almighty, for people vary in their love. This variation is indicated by what was narrated: When Abu Hudhayfah ibn 'Utbah ibn Rabi'ah ibn 'Abd Shams married his sister Fatimah to his freed slave Salim, the Quraysh reproached him, saying, "Have you married a noblewoman of Quraysh to a freed slave?" He replied, "By God, I have married her to him, and I know that he is better than her." His saying that was harder upon them than his action. They said, "How can that be, when she is your sister and he is your freed slave?" He said, "I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say, 'Whoever wishes to look upon a man who loves God with all his heart, let him look at Salim.'" This indicates that among people are those who do not love God with all their heart, but love Him and also love others. Thus, it is no wonder that his bliss in meeting God upon arrival to Him is according to the measure of his love, and his torment in parting from this world at death is according to the measure of his love for it.

As for the second reason for aversion: It is that the servant is at the beginning stage of the station of love and does not dislike death itself, but dislikes its hastening before he is prepared to meet God. This does not indicate weakness in love. It is like a lover who receives news of his beloved's imminent arrival and wishes his coming to be delayed an hour so that he may prepare his house and arrange his means, to meet him as he desires—with a heart free from distractions and a back lightened of obstacles. Aversion for this reason does not contradict the perfection of love at all, and its sign is diligence in work and total preoccupation with preparation.

Among them is one who prefers what God Almighty loves over what he himself loves, outwardly and inwardly. He endures the hardships of striving, avoids following caprice, and turns away from the ease of indolence. He remains constant in obedience to God, drawing near to Him through supererogatory acts, and seeking with Him the distinctions of higher degrees, just as a lover seeks increased closeness in the heart of his beloved. God Almighty has described the lovers with preference, saying, "They love those who emigrate to them and find no need in their breasts for what they are given but prefer them over themselves, even though poverty afflicts them." Whoever remains settled in following caprice, his beloved is what he desires; rather, the lover abandons his own caprice, as it is said:

I desire union with Him, so I abandon what I desire for the sake of what He desires.
He desires my separation, yet I desire what He desires.

Rather, when love prevails, it suppresses desire, leaving no pleasure except in the Beloved. As it is related that when Zulaykha believed and was married to Joseph, peace be upon him, she withdrew from him and devoted herself to worship, turning exclusively to God Almighty. He would call her to his bed by day, but she would defer him until night; and if he called her by night, she would postpone him until day, saying, "O Joseph, I loved you before I knew Him, but now that I know Him, His love has left no love for another, and I desire no substitute for Him." Until he said to her, "Indeed, God, glorious is His remembrance, has commanded me in this and informed me that He will bring forth from you two sons and make them prophets." She replied, "If God Almighty has commanded you this and made me a means to it, then obedience to the command of God Almighty." At that, she acquiesced to him. Thus, whoever loves God does not disobey Him. For this reason, Ibn al-Mubarak said concerning it:

You disobey God while you claim love for Him—
This, by my life, is an astonishing deed.
If your love were sincere, you would obey Him,
For the lover is obedient to the one he loves.

In this meaning:
I abandon what I desire so that I may be pleased with what pleases You, even if my soul is displeased with what I have desired.

Sahl, may God have mercy upon him, said: The sign of love is preferring the beloved over oneself. Yet, not everyone who performs an act of obedience to God, exalted is He, becomes a beloved. Rather, the beloved is he who abstains from the prohibitions, as it is said, for his love for God, exalted is He, is the cause of God's love for him, as He, exalted is He, said: "He loves them, and they love Him." And when God loves him, He takes charge of him and grants him victory over his enemies. Indeed, his enemy is his own soul and its desires, so God does not abandon him nor leave him to his whims and lusts.

Therefore, God Almighty has said: "And God knows best who your enemies are, and sufficient is God as a Guardian, and sufficient is God as a Helper."

If you ask: Does disobedience contradict the very essence of love? I say: It contradicts its perfection but not its essence. For how many a person loves himself while he is ill, and loves health, yet eats what harms him while knowing it is harmful? This does not indicate an absence of love for himself. Rather, knowledge may weaken and desire may overpower, so he becomes incapable of fulfilling the right of love. This is indicated by what has been narrated: that Nu'ayman would be brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, every so often, and he would be prescribed a legal penalty for a sin he had committed, until one day he was brought and the penalty was applied. A man cursed him and said, "How often he is brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him!" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not curse him, for he loves God and His Messenger." Thus, his sin did not expel him from love. Indeed, sin expels one from the perfection of love. Some of the knowers of God have said: If faith is in the outer heart, one loves God, exalted is He, with a moderate love. But when it enters the innermost core of the heart, one loves Him with consummate love and abandons sins. In summary, there is peril in claiming love. For this reason, Fudayl said: If you are asked, "Do you love God, exalted is He?" be silent. For if you say "no," you have disbelieved, and if you say "yes," your description does not match that of the true lovers—so beware of deserving wrath. Indeed, some scholars have said: In Paradise, there is no bliss higher than the bliss of the people of true knowledge and love, and in Hell, there is no torment more severe than the torment of one who claimed knowledge and love but realized nothing of it.

And among them is that one becomes heedless in the remembrance of God, exalted is He, such that his tongue does not desist from it nor does his heart become empty of it. For whoever loves something necessarily increases in mentioning what pertains to it. Thus, the sign of love for God is love for His remembrance, love for the Qur’an which is His speech, love for His Messenger (peace be upon him), and love for everyone ascribed to Him. For whoever loves a person loves even the dog of his neighborhood. When love becomes strong, it extends from the beloved to everything connected to the beloved, surrounding him and related to his causes. This is not a sharing in love, for whoever loves the messenger of the beloved because he is his messenger, and his speech because it is his speech, has not diverted his love to another; rather, it is proof of the perfection of his love. And whoever is overcome by the love of God in his heart loves all of God’s creation because they are His creation. How then could he not love the Qur’an, the Messenger, and the righteous servants of God? We have elaborated on the verification of this in the Book of Brotherhood and Companionship. Therefore, God, exalted is He, said: "Say, [O Muhammad], 'If you should love God, then follow me, [so] God will love you.'" And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Love God for what He nourishes you with of His blessings, and love me for the sake of God, exalted is He."

Sufyan said: Whoever loves those whom God Most High loves, indeed loves God; and whoever honors those whom God Most High honors, indeed honors God.

It is related from a certain seeker that he said: I had found the sweetness of intimate communion in the age of aspiration, so I persisted in reciting the Qur’an night and day. Then a period of languor overtook me and I ceased the recitation. He said: I heard a speaker saying in a dream: “If you claim that you love Me, why then have you turned away from My Book? Have you not pondered what it contains of My subtle reproach?” He said: I awoke with the love of the Qur’an infused into my heart, and I returned to my former state.

Ibn Mas'ud said: No one should be questioned about himself except through the Qur'an, for if he loves the Qur'an, then he loves God Almighty; and if he does not love the Qur'an, then he does not love God.

Sahl, may God have mercy upon him, said: The sign of love for God is love for the Qur'an; the sign of love for God and love for the Qur'an is love for the Prophet, peace be upon him; the sign of love for the Prophet, peace be upon him, is love for the Sunnah; the sign of love for the Sunnah is love for the Hereafter; the sign of love for the Hereafter is hatred for this world; and the sign of hatred for this world is that one takes from it nothing but provision and what suffices for the journey to the Hereafter.

Among them is that one finds intimacy in seclusion and communion with God, Exalted is He, and the recitation of His Book, so he persists in night prayers and seizes the stillness of the night and the clarity of the moment, free from distractions. The lowest degree of love is to delight in seclusion with the Beloved and to take pleasure in conversing with Him. So for one who finds sleep and engaging in idle talk more delightful and pleasing than communion with God, how can his love be true? It was said to Ibrahim ibn Adham when he descended from the mountain: "From where have you come?" He replied: "From intimacy with God."

And in the accounts of David, peace be upon him: Do not seek intimate companionship from any of My creation, for I only sever from Myself two types of men: a man who deems My reward slow, so he withdraws, and a man who forgets Me and becomes content with his own state. The sign of this is that his provision is attributed to himself, and I leave him in the world bewildered. And whenever one finds intimate companionship with other than God, to the degree of that companionship with other than God, he becomes estranged from God Almighty and falls from the station of His love.

In the account of Barkh—the black slave through whom Moses, peace be upon him, sought rain—it is related that God, exalted be He, said to Moses, peace be upon him: "Verily, Barkh is an excellent servant to Me, save that he has one flaw." Moses said: "O Lord, and what is his flaw?" He replied: "He is delighted by the breeze of the late night and finds repose in it; yet whoever loves Me does not find repose in anything."

It is related that a worshipper devoted himself to God, the Exalted, in a thicket for a long time. He then looked at a bird that had nested in a tree, taking refuge in it and chirping near it. He said, "If only I moved my place of prayer to that tree, I would find companionship in the sound of this bird." It is said that he did so. Then God, the Exalted, revealed to the prophet of that time: "Say to so-and-so, the worshipper, 'You sought companionship with a creature; therefore, I shall strip from you a spiritual station you would never have attained by any of your deeds.'"

Thus, the sign of love is perfect intimacy in conversing with the Beloved, perfect delight in seclusion with Him, and perfect aversion to anything that disturbs that seclusion or hinders the pleasure of communion. The sign of intimacy is when the intellect and understanding become entirely absorbed in the delight of communion, like one who addresses and converses with their beloved. This delight reached such a degree in some that, while in prayer, a fire broke out in their house and they were unaware of it; and the leg of another was amputated due to an affliction that befell him during prayer, and he felt it not. Whenever love and intimacy prevail, seclusion and communion become the coolness of his eyes, dispelling all sorrows. Indeed, intimacy and love so engulf his heart that he comprehends nothing of worldly matters unless they are repeated to his hearing many times—like the infatuated lover who speaks to people with his tongue while his inner being is intimate with the remembrance of his beloved. Thus, the lover is one who finds no tranquility except with his Beloved.

Qatadah said regarding God's words, "Those who believe and whose hearts find tranquility in the remembrance of God—truly, in the remembrance of God do hearts find tranquility": He meant that the heart inclines toward it and finds solace in it.

And the Truthful One, may God be pleased with him, said: Whoever tastes the pure love of God, that preoccupies him from seeking the world and makes him feel estranged from all of mankind.

Ma'truf ibn Abi Bakr said: The lover never wearies of conversing with his beloved.

And God, exalted be He, revealed to David, peace be upon him: "He has lied who claims My love, yet when the night enshrouds him, he sleeps and is heedless of Me. Does not every lover yearn for the meeting with his Beloved? Behold, I am present for whoever seeks Me."

Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, where are You, that I may seek You?" He replied: "When you seek, you have already arrived."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: Whoever loves God hates his own self. He also said: Whoever lacks three traits is not a lover [of God]: preferring the speech of God Almighty over the speech of creation, meeting God Almighty over meeting creation, and worship over serving creation.

Among these traits is that he does not grieve over what he misses of anything other than God, the Mighty and Majestic, and he magnifies his grief over the loss of every hour that passes without the remembrance of God Almighty and obedience to Him. Thus, he frequently returns from heedlessness with supplication, seeking pardon, and repentance.

Some of the knowers of God have said: Verily, God has servants who have loved Him and found tranquility in Him, so regret has departed from them. They do not busy themselves with seeking their own share, since the dominion of their Sovereign is complete, and what He wills comes to be. Thus, what reaches them comes to them, and what passes them by is due to His excellent management of their affairs. It is incumbent upon the lover, when he returns from heedlessness in a moment, to turn to his Beloved and occupy himself with self-reproach, asking Him and saying: "My Lord, for what sin have You withheld Your blessing from me, distanced me from Your presence, and occupied me with my own self and the vexations of Satan?" This then extracts from him a purity of remembrance and a tenderness of heart that atones for what preceded of heedlessness, and his lapse becomes a cause for the renewal of his remembrance and the purification of his heart. Whenever the lover sees nothing but the Beloved and sees nothing except from Him, he feels no regret and harbors no doubt; he meets everything with acceptance, knowing that the Beloved has decreed for him only what contains his good. And he recalls His saying: "But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you."

And among them is that one delights in obedience and does not find it burdensome, and the toil of it falls away from him, as some have said: "I struggled with the night for twenty years, then I delighted in it for twenty years."

Junayd said: The sign of the lover is constant vigor and diligence, with a longing that wearies his body but does not weary his heart.

Some have said: Action born of love is never touched by languor.

And some scholars said: By God, the lover of God never finds complete satisfaction in His obedience, even if he were to attain the greatest of means.

All this and its like are witnessed in experience, for the lover does not find the pursuit of his beloved's desire burdensome, and his heart delights in serving him even if it is arduous for his body. Whenever his body falters, the dearest thing to him is that capability should return to him and incapacity should depart, so that he may be occupied with it. Thus is the love of God, the Exalted, for every love that becomes dominant inevitably overpowers what is beneath it. So whoever holds his beloved dearer than indolence abandons indolence in his service, and if he holds him dearer than wealth, he abandons wealth for his love.

It was said to one of the lovers—who had expended his self and his wealth until nothing remained to him—“What was the cause of this state of yours in love?” He replied, “I heard one day a lover who was alone with his beloved, saying, ‘By God, I love you with my whole heart, yet you turn away from me with your whole face!’ His beloved said to him, ‘If you love me, then what will you spend upon me?’ He said, ‘My master, I give you all I possess, then I would spend my very soul upon you until it perishes.’ So I said, ‘This is a creature for a creature and a servant for a servant—how then for a servant of the One Worshipped?’ All this is because of that.”

Among these traits is that he is compassionate towards all of God's servants, merciful to them, and severe against all enemies of God and against anyone who commits anything He dislikes, as God Almighty said: "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves." He is not swayed by the blame of any blamer, nor diverted from anger for God's sake by any diversion. With this, God described His allies when He said of those who are infatuated with My love as a child is infatuated with a thing, and who take refuge in My remembrance as an eagle takes refuge in its nest, and who become angry for the sake of My prohibitions as a tiger becomes angry when enraged—for it does not care whether people are few or many. So reflect on this example: for when a child is infatuated with something, he does not part from it at all; if it is taken from him, he has no concern except crying and shouting until it is returned to him; if he sleeps, he takes it with him in his clothes; when he wakes, he returns and clings to it; whenever he is parted from it, he weeps, and whenever he finds it, he laughs. Whoever disputes it with him, he dislikes; whoever gives it to him, he loves. As for the tiger, it cannot control itself when angry, to the point that its intense anger may destroy itself. These are the signs of love. Whoever possesses these signs completely has perfected his love, and his affection is purified, so that in the Hereafter his drink is pure and his source sweet. But whoever mixes with his love love for other than God will enjoy in the Hereafter according to his love, for his drink is mixed with a portion of the drink of the Near Ones, as God said concerning the righteous: "Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss," then said: "They will be given to drink of a pure wine, sealed, whose seal is musk—so for this let the competitors compete—and whose mixture is of Tasneem, a spring from which those near to God drink." Thus, the drink of the righteous is sweetened by admixture with the pure drink that is for the Near Ones. The "drink" is an expression for the entirety of Paradise's bliss, just as the "book" is used to express all deeds, as He said: "Indeed, the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyyun," then said: "Witnessed by those brought near." So it was a sign that their record had risen to where the Near Ones witness it. And just as the righteous find increase in their state and knowledge through their proximity to the Near Ones and their witnessing them, so will be their state in the Hereafter: "He did not create you nor resurrect you except as a single soul; as We began the first creation, We will repeat it," and as God said: "A reward matching," meaning the reward corresponds to their deeds: the pure is met with pure drink, and the mixed with mixed. The mixture of each drink is according to the measure of mixture that preceded in his love and deeds: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it—and indeed, God does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves—indeed, God does not wrong by an atom's weight, and if there is a good deed, He multiplies it—and even if it were the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth, and sufficient are We as reckoners." So whoever in this world loved out of hope for the bliss of Paradise, the houris, and palaces, is granted Paradise to settle wherever he wishes, to play with youths and enjoy women; there his pleasure ends in the Hereafter, for each person in love is given what his soul desires and his eye delights in. But whoever aimed for the Lord of the Abode and Owner of Sovereignty, and was overcome only by his love with sincerity and truth, is placed "in a seat of honor near a Sovereign, Perfect in Ability." Thus, the righteous roam in gardens and delight in Paradises with houris and youths, while the Near Ones are constant in the Presence, devoted with their gaze upon it, considering the bliss of Paradise insignificant compared to an atom of it. For some are preoccupied with satisfying the appetite of the belly and private parts, while others are for companionship. Therefore, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Most of the inhabitants of Paradise are the simple-minded, and 'Illiyyun is for those of intellect." And when understandings fell short of grasping the meaning of 'Illiyyun, its matter was magnified, so He said: "And what can make you know what 'Illiyyun is?" just as God said: "The Striking Calamity—what is the Striking Calamity? And what can make you know what the Striking Calamity is?"

Among these traits is that in his love he is fearful, humbled under awe and reverence. One might think fear opposes love, but it is not so; rather, perception of majesty necessitates awe, just as perception of beauty necessitates love. The lovers have specific fears in the station of love that others do not, and some of their fears are more intense than others. The first is fear of being turned away, more intense is fear of the veil, and even more intense is fear of banishment. This meaning in Surah Hud is what turned the hair of the master of lovers gray when he heard God's saying: "So away with Thamud! Away with Midian as Thamud was taken away!" Indeed, the awe of distance and fear of it are magnified in the heart of one accustomed to proximity, who has tasted and delighted in it. The mention of distance regarding the banished turns the hair gray of those near in proximity upon hearing it. One accustomed to distance does not yearn for proximity, nor does one weep from fear of distance who has not been granted the carpet of nearness. Then there is fear of standing still and deprivation of increase, for we have previously stated that the degrees of proximity have no end, and it is the servant's duty to strive with every breath to increase in nearness. Therefore, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever's two days are equal is at a loss, and whoever's today is worse than his yesterday is cursed."

Likewise, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, a veil descends upon my heart day and night, until I seek forgiveness from God seventy times." His seeking forgiveness was due to the first station, for it was distant in relation to the second station. This becomes a punishment for them on account of laxity on the path and turning attention to other than the Beloved. As it has been related that God Almighty says: "The least of what I do to the learned one who prefers the desires of this world over My obedience is that I deprive him of the sweetness of intimate communion with Me." Thus, deprivation of increase due to desires is a punishment for the general. As for the elect, they are veiled from increase merely by claim, self-admiration, and contentment with what has appeared of the beginnings of divine grace. That is the hidden deceit from which none can guard themselves except those of firm footing. Then, the fear of losing what cannot be regained once lost—Ibrahim ibn Adham heard a speaker saying while he was wandering upon the mountain:

"Everything from You, save turning away, is forgiven us.
We have granted You what is Yours, so grant us what we have missed of You."

He became agitated and fell unconscious, not regaining consciousness for a day and a night. Various states befell him, then he said: I heard a call from the mountain: O Abraham, be a servant, so I became a servant and found rest.

Then he feared the departure of yearning from him, for the lover is accompanied by longing and earnest seeking; he does not cease desiring increase, nor is he consoled except by a new gentleness. If he becomes consoled from that, that becomes a cause for his stagnation or a cause for his turning back. Yearning departs from him from where he does not perceive, just as love may enter him from where he does not perceive. For these fluctuations have hidden, celestial causes which are not within human power to perceive. So when God wills to plot against him and lure him gradually, He conceals from him what has come upon him of the departure of yearning, and he stands with hope, deceived by fair consideration, or by the dominance of heedlessness, caprice, or forgetfulness—all of that being from the soldiers of Satan which overcome the soldiers of the angels: knowledge, intellect, remembrance, and clarity. And just as among the attributes of God, Exalted is He, are those which appear and necessitate the stirring of love—and they are the attributes of gentleness, mercy, and wisdom—so among His attributes are those which gleam and bequeath the departure of yearning, such as the attributes of compulsion, might, and self-sufficiency. That is from the preliminaries of plotting, wretchedness, and deprivation.

Then he feared being replaced by the heart’s transition from love of Him to love of another, and that is the object of wrath. The departure of yearning from Him is a preliminary to this station, and aversion and the veil are preliminaries to the departure of yearning. Constriction of the breast with piety and its shrinking from constant remembrance, and weariness with the routines of litanies, are causes and preliminaries of these meanings. The appearance of these causes is evidence of transfer from the station of love to the station of wrath—we seek refuge in God from it. Adherence to fear regarding these matters and intense caution from them with pure vigilance is evidence of the sincerity of love. For whoever loves something inevitably fears its loss, so the lover is not devoid of fear if the beloved is something whose loss is possible. Some of the knowers have said: Whoever worships God, Exalted is He, with love without fear perishes through expansiveness and presumptuousness. Whoever worships Him by way of fear without love is cut off from Him through distance and estrangement. Whoever worships Him by way of love and fear, God, Exalted is He, loves him, draws him near, empowers him, and teaches him. Thus the lover is not devoid of fear, nor the fearful devoid of love. But the one upon whom love predominates until he expands in it, and who has but little fear, is said to be in the station of love and is counted among the lovers. The admixture of fear settles a little of the intoxication of love, for if love predominated and knowledge took full possession, human capacity could not endure it. Indeed, fear balances it and lightens its impact upon the heart.

It has been narrated in some reports that one of the truthful was asked by one of the substitutes to ask God, Exalted is He, to grant him an atom of His knowledge. He did so, and the man wandered in the mountains, his intellect bewildered, his heart distraught, remaining staring for seven days, benefiting from nothing and nothing benefiting from him. The truthful one asked his Lord, Exalted is He, saying: O Lord, reduce for him some of that atom. God, Exalted is He, revealed to him: We only gave him one part of one hundred thousand parts of knowledge. That is because one hundred thousand servants asked Me for something of love at the time this one asked Me, and I delayed answering them until you interceded for this one. When I answered you in what you asked, I gave them as I gave him, so I divided an atom of knowledge among one hundred thousand servants. This is what befell him from that. He said: Glory be to You, O Wisest of Judges! Reduce for him from what You have given him! So God removed from him the whole part, and there remained with him ten tenths of it, which is one part of ten thousand parts of one hundred thousand parts of an atom. Then his fear, his love, and his hope became balanced, and he settled and became like the rest of the knowers.

And it has been said in description of the state of the knower:
Near to ecstasy, yet his aim is far,
From the free and from the slaves apart.
Strange in description, with knowledge rare,
His heart was like a slab of iron, hard to bear.
Sublime are his meanings, hidden from sight,
Except for the martyr, they are a glorious light.
He sees feasts in times that ever flow,
For him in every day a thousand feasts bestow.
Yet for the beloved, and joy he cannot find,
His happiness lies far, far behind.

Junayd, may God have mercy upon him, used to recite verses alluding to the mysteries of the states of the knowers, though such matters ought not to be disclosed. These are the verses:

They journeyed with folk whose hearts are in the unseen realms,
Leaving them near the Glorious, the Bestower.
Courtyards near God, in the shade of His holiness,
Their spirits wander there and move about.
Their sources therein are upon majesty and prohibition,
And their return therefrom is to what is most perfect.
They take delight in a singular majesty from His attributes,
And in the garments of divine unity they walk and are adorned.
And after this, what subtle are His attributes!
And what He concealed is more worthy and just in His sight.
I shall conceal from my knowledge of Him what preserves it,
And I shall expend from it what I see the Truth expends.
And I shall give the servants of God from it their due rights,
And I shall withhold from it what I see withholding prefers.
Yet for the All-Merciful there is a mystery He preserves,
Conveyed to its people in secret, and preservation is more beautiful.

And such spiritual insights to which allusion is made are not permissible for people to share in common, nor is it permissible for one to whom something of this has been unveiled to disclose it to one to whom it has not been unveiled. Indeed, if people were to share in them, the world would be laid waste, for wisdom necessitates that heedlessness should prevail for the building up of the world. Nay, if all people were to eat only lawful food for forty days, the world would be laid waste due to their renunciation of it, and markets and livelihoods would cease. Nay, if the scholars were to eat only lawful food, they would become preoccupied with their own selves, and tongues and pens would desist from much of the knowledge that has spread. But God, exalted is He, has in what appears outwardly as evil, secrets and wisdoms, just as He has in good secrets and wisdoms; and there is no end to His wisdom, just as there is no limit to His power.

Among these matters is the concealment of love and the avoidance of claim-making, and the guarding against displaying ecstasy and love out of reverence for the Beloved, honoring Him, awe of Him, and jealousy for His secret. For love is a secret among the secrets of the Beloved. And because claim-making may involve what exceeds the limit of the meaning and adds to it, and that becomes a kind of falsehood, and the punishment for it is magnified in the Hereafter, and tribulation is hastened upon him in this world. Yet, it may be that a lover has an intoxication in his love such that he is bewildered in it and his states become agitated, and his love becomes apparent upon him. If that occurs without affectation or acquisition, then he is excused, for he is overpowered. And perhaps the flames of love blaze up, so its dominion cannot be withstood, and the heart may overflow with it, so its flood cannot be repelled. One who is capable of concealment says:

They said: "He is near." I said: "What am I to do with the sunbeam's nearness if it were in my bosom? I have nothing from Him but a remembrance that stirs in my mind, kindling the fire of love and longing in my breast!"

The one incapable of it says:
Tears reveal its secrets, though they conceal,
And the soul’s longing becomes manifest upon him.

And he also says:
He whose heart is with another, how is his state?
He whose joy lies in his eyelid, how can he conceal it?

A certain gnostic once said: "Those most distant from God are often the most vocal in pointing to Him." It is as if he meant: Whoever frequently alludes to Him in every matter and ostentatiously displays mention of Him before everyone is detested by the lovers of God and those truly knowledgeable of God, the Almighty.

Dhū al-Nūn al-Miṣrī once visited one of his brethren—a man who spoke often of divine love—and saw him afflicted with a trial. Dhū al-Nūn said: "He is not loved by one who feels the pain of His harm!" The man replied: "But I say: He is not loved by one who does not find delight in His harm." Dhū al-Nūn then said: "Yet I say: He is not loved by one who makes a show of his love for Him." The man responded: "I seek God's forgiveness and repent to Him."

If you ask: "Love is the ultimate station, and manifesting it is a manifestation of good, so why is it disapproved?" Then know that love is praiseworthy and its manifestation is also praiseworthy. What is blameworthy is the ostentation in it due to the claim and arrogance that enter into it. The right of the lover is that his hidden love should be betrayed by his actions and states, not by his words and deeds. And his love should appear without his intending to show the love or to show the action indicating love. Rather, the lover's intention should be solely to make the Beloved aware. As for his desire to make others aware, it is polytheism in love and a flaw therein, as it is conveyed in the Gospel: "When you give charity, give it such that your left hand does not know what your right hand gives." For He who sees the hidden will reward you openly. "And when you fast, wash your face and anoint your head, so that none may know of it save your Lord." Therefore, showing speech and action is all blameworthy, except when the intoxication of love overcomes, so the tongue speaks freely and the limbs become agitated; then its possessor is not to blame.

It is related that a man witnessed from one of the madmen something he deemed foolish in him, and informed Maruf al-Karkhi, may God have mercy on him, of it. He smiled and then said: "O my brother, He has lovers who are young and old, sane and mad! What you witnessed is from among their mad ones."

Among what is disliked is the ostentatious display of love, because if the lover is a knower—and knows the states of the angels in their perpetual love and their constant yearning, by which they glorify night and day without ceasing, never disobeying God in what He commands them and doing what they are commanded—he would disdain himself and his display of love, knowing for certain that he is among the basest of lovers in His dominion and that his love is more deficient than the love of every lover of God.

One of the disclosers among the lovers said: "I worshipped God Almighty for thirty years with the works of the hearts and limbs, exerting utmost effort and expending all energy, until I thought I had something with God." He mentioned things from disclosures of celestial signs in a long story, at the end of which he said: "Then I reached a row of angels equal in number to all that God created of anything. I said: 'Who are you?' They said: 'We are the lovers of God, Mighty and Majestic, worshipping Him here for three hundred thousand years, and never has any equal crossed our hearts, nor have we remembered other than Him.'" He said: "I felt ashamed of my works, so I gave them to one upon whom the threat [of punishment] was due, to lighten it for him in Hell."

Therefore, whoever knows himself knows his Lord and feels from Him the true shame, his tongue becomes silent from ostentatious claim. Indeed, his movements and stillness, his advances and hesitations, his uncertainties bear witness to his love; as is related from al-Junayd that he said: "Our teacher al-Sari, may God have mercy on him, fell ill, and we did not know a remedy for his ailment, nor did we know its cause. A skilled physician was described to us. He took a vial of his water [urine]. The physician looked at it and gazed at him intently, then said to me: 'I see it as the urine of a lover!'" Al-Junayd said: "I was thunderstruck, fainted, and the vial fell from my hand. Then I returned to al-Sari and informed him. He smiled and said: 'May God fight him, how perceptive he is!' I said: 'O teacher, and love is evident in urine?!' He said: 'Yes.'"

And al-Sari once said: "If I wished, I could say: What has dried my skin upon my bone and wasted my body except His love!" Then he fainted. The swoon indicates that he was more eloquent in the overwhelming ecstasy and the precursors of fainting. These are the gatherings of the signs of love and its fruits.

Among them are intimacy and contentment, as will come.

In summary, all the beauties of religion and noble character traits are the fruit of love. What does not bear its fruit is following caprice, and it is among the base traits. Indeed, one may love God for His benevolence to him, and one may love Him for His majesty and beauty even if He has not been benevolent to him. The lovers do not depart from these two categories. For this reason, al-Junayd said: "People in the love of God Almighty are general and special. The common folk attained that through their knowledge of His constant benevolence and abundance of His favors, so they could not help but please Him, except that their love decreases and increases according to the measure of favors and benevolence. As for the special, they attained love through the greatness of His decree and power, knowledge and wisdom, and His unique possession of sovereignty. When they knew His perfect attributes and beautiful names, they could not refrain from loving Him, for He deserved love from them because of that, for He is worthy of it even if He removed from them all favors." Indeed, among people are those who love their caprice. And the enemy of God, Iblis—and he, despite that, deceives himself by the rule of delusion and ignorance—so he thinks he is a lover of God, Mighty and Majestic, while he is the one in whom these signs are absent. Or he deceives with hypocrisy, ostentation, reputation-seeking, and his aim is the immediate share of this world, while he displays from himself the opposite of that, like the evil scholars and evil reciters; those are the objects of God's wrath in His earth. And Sahl, when he would speak with a person, would say: "O dust" (meaning O beloved). He was asked: "He may not be a beloved, so why do you say this?" He whispered secretly into the questioner's ear: "He is not free from being either a believer or a hypocrite. If he is a believer, then he is the beloved of God, Mighty and Majestic. If he is a hypocrite, then he is the beloved of Iblis." And Abu Tarab al-Takhshibi said—regarding the signs of love—verses:

Do not be deceived, for the beloved has signs and the beloved has means.
Among them is his comfort and his joy in all that he does when affliction passes.
So denial from him is a gift, and poverty is an honor, accepted and immediate goodness.
And among the signs is the compliance of the beloved, even if the blamer insists.
And among the signs is that the heart sees him smiling amidst the beloved's trials.
And among the signs is that he sees him comprehending the speech of one who is favored, while the petitioner is with him.
And among the signs is that he sees him abstemious, guarded from all that he says.

And Yahya ibn Mu'adh said:
Among the signs is one who, in two tattered garments upon the shores,
You see him with his sleeves rolled up, on the banks.
And among the signs is his sorrow and his lament,
In the belly of darkness, with none to reproach him.

Among the signs is that you see him journeying toward jihad and every noble deed.
Among the signs is his detachment from what he beholds—from the abode of humiliation and fleeting luxury.
Among the signs is that you see him weeping over ugly deeds.
Among the signs is that you see him submitting all affairs to the Sovereign, the Just.
Among the signs is that you see him content with his Sovereign in every decree that descends.
Among the signs is his laughter among people while the heart is grieving, like the heart of one bereaved.

Explanation of the Meaning of Intimate Communion with God

We have previously mentioned that intimacy, fear, and longing are effects of love, except that these are diverse effects upon the lover according to his perspective and what predominates over him in his state. If there predominates over him the aspiration to gaze from behind the veils of the unseen toward the utmost beauty, and he senses his incapacity to perceive the essence of majesty, the heart is stirred to seek and is agitated toward it, yearning intensely. This state of agitation is called longing, and it pertains to an absent matter. If there predominates over him the joy of nearness and witnessing the presence through what is attained of unveiling, and his gaze is confined to contemplating the present, unveiled beauty without turning to what he has not yet attained, the heart rejoices in what it observes, and its rejoicing is called intimacy. And if his gaze is upon the attributes of might, self-sufficiency, and indifference, and the peril of possible departure and distance, the heart is pained by this awareness, and its pain is called fear. These states follow these observations, and the observations follow causes that necessitate them, which cannot be enumerated. Thus, intimacy means the heart’s rejoicing and delight in contemplating beauty, to the extent that when it predominates and becomes detached from observing what is absent from it and what may intrude upon it from the peril of vanishing, its bliss and pleasure become immense. Hence, some have reflected, as when one was asked, “Are you longing?” He replied, “No, for longing is for the absent. If the absent is present, then for whom does one long?” This statement is wholly absorbed in joy over what has been attained, without turning to what remains possible of the graces of divine kindness.

And whoever is dominated by the state of intimate communion, his desire is only for solitude and seclusion, as it is related that Ibrahim ibn Adham descended from the mountain and was asked: "From where have you come?" He replied: "From intimate communion with God." This is because intimate communion with God necessitates feeling estranged from all besides God. Indeed, anything that obstructs seclusion becomes among the heaviest things upon the heart, as it is narrated that when God spoke to Moses, peace be upon him, he remained for an age unable to hear anyone's speech without being overcome by nausea, for love necessitates the sweetness of the Beloved's speech and the sweetness of His remembrance, thereby expelling from the heart the sweetness of all else. Therefore, one of the wise said in his supplication: "O You who has made me intimate through Your remembrance and made me feel estranged from Your creation." And God, Mighty and Majestic, said to David, peace be upon him: "Be longing for Me, intimate through Me, and estranged from all besides Me."

It was said to Rabi'a: "By what means have you attained this station?" She replied: "By abandoning what does not concern me, and by being heedless of one who is not eternal."

Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: I passed by a monk and asked him, "O monk, has solitude truly pleased you?" He replied, "O you, if you tasted the sweetness of solitude, you would feel estranged from your own self for its sake. Solitude is the pinnacle of worship." I said, "O monk, what is the least you find in solitude?" He said, "Relief from humoring people and safety from their harm." I asked, "O monk, when does a servant taste the sweetness of intimacy with God, exalted is He?" He said, "When affection becomes pure and dealings become sincere." I said, "And when does affection become pure?" He said, "When concerns converge and become a single concern in obedience."

Some sages have said: How wondrous that creation seeks a substitute for You! How wondrous that hearts find comfort in other than You, turning away from You!

If you ask: What is the sign of intimacy (with God)? Know that its distinctive sign is a constriction of the chest from keeping company with creation, vexation with them, and finding sweetness in remembrance (of God). For if one mixes with them, he is like one who is solitary in a crowd and gathered in seclusion, a stranger in residence and present in travel, a witness in absence and absent in presence—mingling in body but solitary in heart, absorbed in the sweetness of remembrance. As ‘Ali, may God honor his countenance, said in describing them: "They are a people upon whom knowledge has descended, revealing the reality of the matter. They have experienced the spirit of certainty and found gentle what the indulgent find harsh, and they have become intimate with what the ignorant find desolate. They accompany the world with bodies whose spirits are attached to the Highest Abode. Those are God’s vicegerents on His earth and the callers to His religion." This, then, is the meaning of intimacy with God, this is its sign, and these are its evidences.

Some theologians have denied the reality of spiritual intimacy, yearning, and love, supposing that these imply anthropomorphism. They are ignorant that the beauty perceived by the inner sight is more perfect than the beauty perceived by the eyes, and the delight of knowing Him is more overwhelming for the possessors of hearts. Among them was Ahmad ibn Ghalib, known as Ghulam al-Khalil, who rejected the discourse of love, yearning, and passionate love from al-Junayd, Abu al-Hasan al-Nuri, and the community. Some even denied the station of contentment, saying, "There is only patience; as for contentment, it is inconceivable." This is deficient, limited speech. They have only glimpsed the outer shells of the stations of religion and thus imagined that nothing exists but the shell. For all sensory matters and everything that enters the imagination by way of religion is a mere shell; beyond it lies the desired kernel. Whoever reaches only the shell of a walnut thinks the walnut is entirely wood, and deems it impossible for oil to emerge from it inevitably. He is excused, but his excuse is not accepted. And it has been said:

Intimacy with God is not attained by the idle, nor can the schemer grasp it through his own power. Those who find intimacy are men, all of them chosen by God, all of them noble, all of them workers.

Explanation of the meaning of expansion and familiarity that results from the predominance of intimacy

Know that when intimacy [with God] persists, prevails, and becomes firmly established, and is not disturbed by the agitation of longing nor soured by the fear of change and veiling, then it yields a kind of expansiveness in words, deeds, and intimate communion with God, Exalted is He. This may appear unseemly in form due to what it contains of boldness and diminished awe, yet it is acceptable from one who has been established in the station of intimacy. But whoever has not been established in that station and merely imitates them in action and speech is ruined by it and teeters on the brink of disbelief.

And its example is the intimate supplication of Barakh al-Aswad, whom God Almighty commanded His interlocutor Moses, peace be upon him, to ask him to pray for rain for the Children of Israel. This was after they had suffered drought for seven years, and Moses, peace be upon him, went out to pray for rain for them with seventy thousand people. Then God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to him: "How shall I answer them when their sins have darkened over them? Their inner selves are vile; they call upon Me without certainty and feel secure from My guile. Return to a servant of Mine named Barakh and tell him to come forth so that I may answer him." So Moses, peace be upon him, inquired about him but did not find him. Then one day, as Moses was walking along a path, a black servant met him, with dust from the trace of prostration between his eyes, wearing a patched cloak knotted around his neck. Moses, peace be upon him, recognized him by the light of God, Mighty and Majestic, greeted him, and said, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Barakh." He said, "You are the one we have been seeking for some time. Come forth and pray for rain for us." So he went forth and said in his discourse: "Is this from Your actions, or is this from Your forbearance? And what has appeared to You? Have Your springs diminished for You, or have the winds rebelled against obeying You, or has what is with You been exhausted, or has Your anger against the sinners intensified? Were You not the Forgiver before the creation of the wrongdoers? You created mercy and commanded compassion. Or do You show us that You are withholding, or do You fear loss and thus hasten the punishment?" He said: He had not ceased until the Children of Israel were soaked by the rain, and God Almighty caused the grass to grow in half a day until it reached the riders. He said: Then Barakh returned, and Moses, peace be upon him, met him and said, "What did you see when you pleaded? How did He grant me justice?" Moses, peace be upon him, intended to approach him, but God Almighty revealed to him: "Indeed, Barakh makes Me laugh three times every day."

From Hasan it is reported: Some huts in Basra burned down, yet one hut in the midst of them remained unburned. Abu Musa was the governor of Basra at that time. When he was informed of this, he sent for the owner of the hut. An elderly man was brought before him, and he asked, "O elder, why is it that your hut did not burn?" The man replied, "I made an oath to my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He would not burn it." Thereupon Abu Musa, may God be pleased with him, said, "I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: 'There will be among my community a people with disheveled hair and soiled garments; if they were to swear by God, He would fulfill their oath.'"

He said: A fire broke out in Basra, and Abu 'Ubaydah al-Khawwas came and began to stride through the flames. The governor of Basra said to him, "Take care, lest you be burned by the fire." He replied, "I have made a covenant with my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, that He would not burn me with fire." The governor said, "Then command the fire to be extinguished." So he commanded it, and it was extinguished.

One day, Abu Hafs was walking when a distressed villager met him. Abu Hafs asked him, "What has befallen you?" He replied, "My donkey is lost, and I possess no other." Abu Hafs then stood and declared, "By Your might, I shall not take a single step until his donkey is returned to him." At that very moment, his donkey appeared, and Abu Hafs, may God have mercy on him, continued on his way.

This and its like occur for those endowed with spiritual intimacy, and it is not for others to imitate them.

Junayd, may God have mercy upon him, said: The people of intimate communion say things in their discourse and their private prayers during their seclusions that would be considered disbelief by the common folk. And on one occasion he said: If the general populace heard them, they would deem them disbelievers, while they themselves find increase in their spiritual states through it. This is acceptable from them and befits them, and it is to this that the speaker alluded:

The servant boasts over his master to the extent of his lord, while a people are inwardly stirred by pride in their master.

How beautiful is their vision of Him, for they are lost in beholding Him. They are exalted in what they are lost, from all besides Him.

And do not deem it improbable that He is pleased with a servant through that which angers Him with another, however much their stations may differ. For in the Qur’an are admonitions concerning these meanings, if you were but aware and understood. Indeed, all the narratives of the Qur’an are admonitions for those possessed of insight and vision, that they may look upon them with the eye of contemplation. For they are, in the sight of those endowed with contemplation, among the [divine] Names.

The first narrative is the story of Adam, peace be upon him, and Iblis. Do you not see how they shared in the name of disobedience and defiance, yet diverged in divine selection and protection? As for Iblis, he was deprived of His mercy, and it is said he is among the banished. But as for Adam, peace be upon him, it is said of him: "And Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray. Then his Lord chose him, turned to him in forgiveness, and guided him."

God reproached His Prophet ﷺ for turning away from one servant and turning toward another, though both are equal in servitude, yet differ in their states. He said: "But as for him who came to you striving earnestly, while he fears God, from him you are distracted." And regarding the other, He said: "But as for him who considers himself self-sufficient, to him you give attention." Likewise, He commanded him to sit with a certain group, as the Almighty said: "When those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: 'Peace be upon you.'" And He commanded him to turn away from others, saying: "When you see those who engage in vain talk about Our signs, turn away from them," until He said: "And do not sit, after the reminder, with the wrongdoing people." And the Exalted said: "And keep yourself patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening."

Likewise, expansiveness and familiarity are permissible for some worshippers but not for others. Among the expressions of intimate familiarity is the statement of Moses, peace be upon him: "It is but Your trial, whereby You lead astray whom You will and guide whom You will." And his statement in explanation and excuse when he was told, "Go to Pharaoh," and he said, "And they have a charge against me." And his saying, "Indeed, I fear that they will deny me, and my breast will tighten, and my tongue will not be fluent." And his saying, "Indeed, we fear that he will hasten against us or transgress." This, from anyone other than Moses, peace be upon him, would be poor etiquette, for the one who is established in the station of intimacy is indulged and borne with. Yet, for Jonah, peace be upon him, less than this was not borne with, for he was established in the station of contraction and awe, so he was punished by imprisonment in the belly of the whale—in threefold darkness—and was called to account until the Day of Resurrection: "Had it not been that a favor from his Lord reached him, he would have been cast upon the barren shore while blameworthy." Al-Hasan said: "The barren shore is the Resurrection." And our Prophet, peace be upon him, was forbidden from being taken as a model in this, and it was said to him: "So be patient for the decree of your Lord and be not like the companion of the whale when he called out while distressed."

These differences arise partly from variations in states and spiritual stations, and partly from what was preordained in eternity—the distinction and disparity in apportionment among the servants. God Almighty has said, "We have favored some prophets above others," and He has said, "Among them are those to whom God spoke, and He raised some of them in rank." Thus, Jesus, peace be upon him, was among the favored ones, and in his intimate confidence, he offered peace upon himself, saying, "And peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I am raised alive." This is an expression of his expansiveness, owing to the tenderness he witnessed in the station of intimate communion.

As for Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon him, he was established in the station of awe and modesty, so he did not speak until his Creator praised him, saying: "And peace be upon him."

And observe how He endured for the brothers of Joseph what they did to Joseph. Some scholars have said: I have enumerated from the beginning of God’s saying, “When they said, ‘Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are,’” up to the head of the twentieth [verse] of His informing about their disdain for him, over forty offenses, some greater than others—and in a single word there may gather three or four—yet He forgave them and pardoned them. But al-ʿAzīz could not endure a single question he was asked concerning divine decree, until it was said he was erased from the register of prophethood! Likewise, Balaam son of Beor was among the greatest of scholars, but he consumed the world by means of religion, and that was not endured for him.

Asaf was among the transgressors, and his sin was in his limbs, yet he was pardoned. It has been related that God, exalted is He, revealed to Solomon, peace be upon him: "O chief of worshippers, O son of the path of the ascetics, how long will your cousin Asaf disobey Me while I forbear with him time after time? By My might and majesty, if I seize him with one seizure of My seizures, I will leave him as a warning example for those with him and a deterrent for those after him." When Asaf entered upon Solomon, peace be upon him, he informed him of what God, exalted is He, had revealed to him. Asaf then went out until he ascended a sandy hillock, raised his head and his hands toward the heaven, and said: "My God and my Master, You are You, and I am I. How can I repent if You do not turn to me in forgiveness? How can I be protected if You do not protect me? I will surely return [to sin]." Then God, exalted is He, revealed to him: "You have spoken truthfully, O Asaf. You are you, and I am I. I have accepted the repentance, and I have turned to you in forgiveness, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful." This is a discourse that is subtle in its indication, from which one flees to Him, and by which one gazes toward Him.

And in the tradition: Verily, God the Exalted revealed to a servant whom He had rescued when he was on the brink of destruction: "How many a sin have you confronted Me with, and I have forgiven you for it, while I have destroyed entire nations for less than that." This is the established way of God the Exalted with His servants—bestowing favor, advancing, and deferring—according to what His eternal Will has predetermined.

These narratives have been conveyed in the Qur'an so that you may recognize through them the established way of God with His servants who have passed before. There is nothing in the Qur'an except that it is guidance and light, and a means by which God, Exalted is He, makes Himself known to His creation. At times, He makes Himself known to them through sanctification, saying: "Say: He is God, the One, God, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent." At other times, He makes Himself known to them through the attributes of His majesty, saying: "The Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of Peace, the Granter of Security, the Overseer, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supreme." And at times, He makes Himself known to them through His awe-inspiring and hopeful acts, recounting to them His established way with His enemies and with His prophets, saying: "Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Aad—[the people of] Iram, who had lofty pillars—Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?"

Nor does the Quran extend beyond these three divisions, which are: guidance to the knowledge of God's essence and His sanctification, or knowledge of His attributes and names, or knowledge of His actions and His established way with His servants. Since Surah al-Ikhlas encompassed one of these three divisions—namely, sanctification—the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, equated it to a third of the Quran, saying: "Whoever recites Surah al-Ikhlas has recited a third of the Quran." For the ultimate degree of sanctification is to be One in three matters: that there be none from Him who is His equal or likeness—indicated by His saying, "He begets not"; that there be none to Him who is His equal or likeness—indicated by His saying, "nor is He begotten"; and that there be none on His level, even if not being an origin for Him or a branch from Him, who is His like—indicated by His saying, "and there is none comparable unto Him." All of this is gathered in His saying, exalted is He: "Say: He is God, the One." Its entirety is a detailed exposition of the statement, "There is no god but God." These are the secrets of the Quran, and the like of these secrets in the Quran are without end: "And there is nothing fresh or dry but it is in a clear Book." Therefore, Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "Illuminate the Quran and seek its wonders, for within it is the knowledge of the ancients and the later ones." And it is as he said. None knows it save one who has prolonged his reflection upon its individual words and purified his understanding for it, until every word of it bears witness to him that it is the speech of a Mighty, Overpowering, Sovereign, and Powerful One, and that it is beyond the limit of human capability. Most of the secrets of the Quran are packed within the folds of its narratives and reports, so be diligent in extracting them, that there may be unveiled to you therein wonders beside which the adorned sciences outside of it seem insignificant. This is what we intended to mention concerning the meaning of intimacy and expansion, which is its fruit, and the clarification of the disparity among God's servants therein. And God, glorified and exalted, knows best.

The Discourse on the Meaning, Reality, and Excellence of Contentment with the Decree of God Almighty

Know that contentment is a fruit from the fruits of love, and it is among the highest stations of those brought near [to God]. Its true reality is obscure to most people, and the ambiguity and obscurity that enter into it are not unveiled except for those whom God, Exalted is He, has taught the interpretation, understanding, and deep comprehension in religion. Indeed, some deniers have rejected the conception of contentment with what opposes [one's own] desire, then they said: "If it is possible to be content with everything because it is the act of God, then one ought to be content with disbelief and sins." A group of people were deceived by this, so they considered contentment with immorality and transgression, and abandoning objection and denial, as part of submitting to the decree of God, Exalted is He. Had these secrets been unveiled to one who confines himself to hearing the outward aspects of the Sacred Law, the Messenger of God ﷺ would not have supplicated for Ibn 'Abbas when he said: "O God, grant him deep comprehension in religion and teach him the interpretation." Therefore, let us begin by clarifying the virtue of contentment, then by narrating the states of the contented, then we will mention the true reality of contentment and how to conceive of it regarding what opposes [one's own] desire, then we will mention what is thought to be part of the perfection of contentment but is not, such as abandoning supplication and remaining silent about sins.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Contentment

As for the verses, there is His saying, exalted is He: "God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him." And He has said, exalted is He: "Is the reward for goodness anything but goodness?" The ultimate goodness is God's pleasure with His servant, and that is the reward for the servant's pleasure with God, exalted is He.
And He said, exalted is He: "And goodly dwellings in the Gardens of Eden, and the greatest of all is the good pleasure of God." Thus God has elevated pleasure above the Gardens of Eden, just as He elevated the remembrance of Him above prayer when He said: "Indeed, prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds, and the remembrance of God is greater." So, just as witnessing the One remembered in prayer is greater than the prayer itself, the pleasure of the Lord of the Garden is higher than the Garden; indeed, it is the ultimate aspiration of the inhabitants of the Gardens.

In the Hadith: "Verily God Almighty reveals Himself to the believers and says, 'Ask of Me.' They say, 'Your pleasure.'" Thus their asking for pleasure after the vision is the ultimate bestowal of grace. As for the servant's pleasure, we shall mention its reality; but as for God's pleasure with the servant, it is another meaning, close to what we mentioned concerning God's love for the servant, and it is not permissible to unveil it, for the understandings of creation fall short of grasping it, and whoever is strong enough for it still falls short of comprehending it by himself. In sum, there is no rank above gazing upon Him, for they asked Him for pleasure only because it is the cause of the permanence of the vision. It is as if they saw it as the ultimate of ultimates and the farthest of aspirations when they attained the bliss of gazing. So when they were commanded to ask, they asked only for its permanence, and they knew that pleasure is the cause of the permanence of the lifting of the veil.

And God Almighty said: "And with Us is more." Some exegetes have said: The inhabitants of Paradise will be brought, at the time of the increase, three gifts from the Lord of the Worlds. The first is a gift from God Almighty, the like of which they do not have in the Gardens; that is His saying, exalted is He: "So no soul knows what delight of the eyes is hidden for them." The second is peace upon them from their Lord, and that surpasses the gift in grace; it is His saying, exalted is He: "Peace—a word from a Merciful Lord." The third is that God Almighty says: "Indeed, I am pleased with you," and that becomes better than the gift and the salutation; that is His saying, exalted is He: "And greater pleasure from God," meaning than the bliss they are in. This, then, is the grace of God's pleasure, and it is the fruit of the servant's pleasure.

As for narrations: It has been related that the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked a group of his Companions, "What are you?" They replied, "Believers." He said, "What is the sign of your faith?" They said, "We are patient in times of tribulation, grateful in times of ease, and content with the decree of fate." He said, "Believers, by the Lord of the Kaaba!"

And in another report, he said: "The wise among the scholars are so close in their profound understanding that they nearly attain the station of prophets."

Blessed is he who is guided to Islam, whose provision is sufficient, and who is content with it.

He said, peace be upon him: "Whoever is content with God the Exalted providing little sustenance, God the Exalted will be content with him for little of his works." And he also said: "When God the Exalted loves a servant, He tests him. If he is patient, He chooses him. If he is content, He selects him." And he also said: "On the Day of Resurrection, God the Exalted will cause wings to sprout for a group from my community, and they will fly from their graves to the Gardens, roaming and delighting therein as they wish. The angels will say to them: 'Have you seen the Reckoning?' They will say: 'We have seen no Reckoning.' They will say: 'Have you crossed the Bridge?' They will say: 'We have seen no Bridge.' They will say: 'Have you seen Hellfire?' They will say: 'We have seen nothing.' The angels will say: 'From which community are you?' They will say: 'From the community of Muhammad, peace be upon him.' They will say: 'We adjure you by God, tell us what your deeds were in the world.' They will say: 'Two traits were within us, and by the grace of God's mercy we attained this station.' They will say: 'And what are they?' They will say: 'When we were in private, we were too ashamed to disobey Him, and we were content with the little that He apportioned for us.' The angels will say: 'You are truly deserving of this.'"

And He, may He be exalted, said: "O company of the poor, give God contentment from your hearts, that you may attain the reward of your poverty; otherwise, you will not."

In the accounts concerning Moses, peace be upon him, the Children of Israel said to him: "Ask your Lord for a command that, if we perform it, He will be pleased with us." Moses, peace be upon him, said: "My God, You have heard what they said." He said: "O Moses, tell them: 'He is pleased with them.'" This is supported by what has been narrated from our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Whoever wishes to know what he has with God, the Almighty and Majestic, let him look at what God, the Almighty and Majestic, has with him. For God, Blessed and Exalted, places the servant from Himself where the servant places Him from himself."

In the accounts of David, peace be upon him: "What have My friends to do with anxiety over the world? Verily, anxiety strips the sweetness of communion with Me from their hearts. O David, My love for My friends is that they be spiritual, not grieved."

It is related that Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, guide me to a matter in which lies Your pleasure, that I may act upon it." So God, the Exalted, revealed to him: "Indeed, My pleasure lies in what you dislike, and you do not have patience for what you dislike." He said: "O Lord, guide me to it." He said: "Then, indeed, My pleasure lies in your being pleased with My decree."

In the intimate discourse of Moses, peace be upon him, he asked: "O Lord, which of Your creatures is most beloved to You?" He said: "The one who, when I take from him what he loves, remains at peace with Me." He said: "And which of Your creatures are You displeased with?" He said: "The one who seeks My counsel in a matter, yet when I decree it for him, he is displeased with My decree."
And there has been narrated something even more severe than that, which is that God, the Exalted, said: "I am God, there is no god but I. Whoever is not patient with My affliction, nor grateful for My blessings, nor content with My decree, let him take for himself a lord other than Me."
Similar in severity is His statement, the Exalted, as reported by our Prophet, peace be upon him, that He said: "God, the Exalted, said: 'I have ordained the destinies and arranged the affairs and perfected the creation. So whoever is content, for him is contentment from Me until he meets Me; and whoever is displeased, for him is displeasure from Me until he meets Me.'"

In the well-known tradition, God Almighty says: "I created good and evil. Blessed is he whom I created for good and caused good to flow through his hands. And woe to him whom I created for evil and caused evil to flow through his hands. And woe, then woe, to him who says 'Why?' and 'How?'"

And in the previous narrations, it is related that a prophet among the prophets complained to God, Mighty and Majestic, of hunger and poverty and lice for ten years, yet he was not granted what he desired. Then God, Exalted is He, revealed to him: "How long do you complain? Thus was your beginning with Me in the Mother of the Book before I created the heavens and the earth, and thus has it been decreed for you from Me, and thus have I ordained for you before I created the world. Do you wish for Me to recreate the world for your sake, or do you wish for Me to change what I have destined for you, so that what you love becomes above what I love, and what you want becomes above what I want? By My might and majesty, if this stirs again in your breast, I shall erase you from the register of prophethood."

It has been related that Adam, peace be upon him, had some of his young children who would climb upon his body and descend—one of them would place his foot on his ribs as if they were steps, climbing up to his head, then descend upon his ribs in the same manner, while he was bowed to the ground, neither speaking nor raising his head. One of his children said to him, "O my father! Do you not see what this one is doing to you? If only you would forbid him from this!" He replied, "O my son, I have seen what you have not seen, and I have known what you have not known. I made a single movement and was cast down from the Abode of Honor to the Abode of Disgrace, and from the Abode of Bliss to the Abode of Misery. Thus, I fear that if I move, something I do not know may befall me."

Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, said: "I served the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, for ten years. He never said to me regarding anything I did, 'Why did you do that?' nor regarding anything I did not do, 'Why did you not do that?' Nor did he ever say of something that happened, 'Would that it had not been,' nor of something that did not happen, 'Would that it had been.' And if someone from his household argued with me, he would say, 'Leave him alone; if something were decreed, it would have been.'"

It is related that God the Exalted revealed to David, peace be upon him: "O David, you desire and I desire, and only what I desire shall come to be. If you submit to what I desire, I will suffice you in what you desire. But if you do not submit to what I desire, I will weary you in pursuing what you desire, and in the end, only what I desire shall come to pass."

As for the narrations: Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "The first to be called to Paradise on the Day of Resurrection are those who praise God, the Exalted, in every circumstance."

Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz said: No joy remains for me except in the decrees of Divine Destiny. He was asked: What do you desire? He replied: What God decrees.
Maimun ibn Mihran said: For one who is not content with Divine Decree, there is no cure for his folly.

Fudayl said: If you cannot endure God's decree, you will not endure your own self's decree.

Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Rawad said: The matter is not in eating barley bread and vinegar, nor in wearing wool and haircloth, but the matter lies in contentment with God, the Mighty and Majestic.

Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said: For indeed, regret is an ember—it has burned what it burned and spared what it spared—and that is more beloved to me than to say of something that was, 'Would that it had not been,' or of something that was not, 'Would that it had been.'

A man looked at a sore on the leg of Muhammad ibn Wasīʿ and said, "I truly pity you because of this sore." He replied, "I am indeed grateful for it, for it emerged in a place other than my eye."

It is narrated in Israelite traditions that a worshipper devotedly served God for a long age. Then it was shown to him in a dream that a certain shepherdess would be his companion in Paradise. He inquired about her until he found her and stayed as her guest for three days to observe her deeds. He would spend the night standing in prayer while she slept, and he would pass the day fasting while she broke her fast. So he said, "Do you have any practice other than what I have seen?" She replied, "By God, it is nothing but what you have seen; I know of nothing else." He kept saying, "Recall," until she said, "There is one trait within me: if I am in hardship, I do not wish to be in ease; if I am in sickness, I do not wish to be in health; and if I am in the sun, I do not wish to be in the shade." The worshipper placed his hand on his head and said, "Is this a mere trait? By God, this is a tremendous quality that the servants of God fall short of attaining."

And from some of the predecessors: Indeed, when Allah the Exalted decrees a decree in the heaven, He loves that the people of the earth be pleased with His decree.

Abu al-Darda said: The pinnacle of faith is patience with divine decree and contentment with destiny.

Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: I care not in what state I find myself at morn or eve, whether in hardship or ease.

One day, Sufyan al-Thawri said concerning Rabi‘a, “O God, be pleased with me.” She replied, “Are you not ashamed before God to ask for His pleasure while you yourself are not pleased?” He said, “I seek God’s forgiveness.” Then Ja‘far ibn Sulayman al-Duba‘i asked, “When is a servant truly pleased with God, exalted be He?” She answered, “When his joy in affliction is like his joy in blessing.”

Fudayl would say: When withholding and giving become equal in one's sight, then one has become content with God, the Exalted.

Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari reported: Abu Sulayman al-Darani said, "By His generosity, God Almighty is pleased with His servants to the same extent that servants are pleased with their masters." I asked, "How is that?" He replied, "Is it not the servant's desire from creation that his master be pleased with him?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Likewise, God's love for His servants is that they be pleased with Him."

Sahl said: The servants' share of certainty is proportionate to their share of contentment, and their share of contentment is proportionate to their life lived with God, the Almighty.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His wisdom and majesty, has placed spirit and joy in contentment and certainty, and has placed grief and sorrow in doubt and displeasure."

Explanation of the True Nature of Contentment and Its Perception in Opposition to Personal Desire

Know that whoever says, "In matters contrary to desire and in various afflictions, there is only patience, whereas contentment is inconceivable," has erred due to a denial of love. However, when love for God Almighty is firmly established and one's heart is wholly absorbed in Him, it becomes evident that love begets contentment with the actions of the Beloved. This occurs in two ways: First, it nullifies the sensation of pain, such that harm may befall one without being felt, and a wound may be inflicted without its pain being perceived. An example is a warrior in battle: in his anger or state of fear, he may sustain a wound yet feel no pain due to his heart's preoccupation. Indeed, even one whose head is incised with a sharp instrument may suffer from it, but if his heart is engrossed in a pressing matter, the barber may finish without him noticing. All this is because when the heart becomes entirely absorbed in one concern, it fails to perceive anything else. Similarly, a lover whose heart is consumed by the vision or love of the beloved may encounter what would normally cause pain or distress were it not for his love, yet he feels no distress or pain due to love's overwhelming dominance over his heart. This is when the harm comes from other than the beloved—so how much more when it comes from the beloved himself? The heart's preoccupation with love and passion is among the greatest of distractions. If this can be conceived for minor pain arising from a slight love, then it is all the more conceivable for great pain arising from a profound love. For love, too, can multiply in strength just as pain multiplies. And just as love for beautiful forms perceived by the sense of sight can intensify, so too can love for the beautiful inner forms perceived by the light of insight. The beauty and majesty of the Divine Presence are beyond all measure of beauty and majesty. Whoever has even a glimpse of it may be so dazzled that he is stunned and faints, unaware of what befalls him. It has been related that a woman from Fath al-Mawsili stumbled and broke her nail, yet she laughed. When asked, "Do you not feel the pain?" she replied, "The delight of its reward has removed from my heart the bitterness of its pain."

Sahl, may God have mercy upon him, was afflicted with an ailment for which he would treat others but not treat himself. When questioned about this, he replied, "O friend, the blow of the Beloved does not pain!"

As for the second aspect: it is that one feels it and perceives its pain, yet is content with it, indeed desirous of it, willing it—I mean with one’s intellect—even if one’s natural disposition is averse to it. Like one who seeks from the phlebotomist the act of bloodletting or cupping: he perceives the pain of that, yet he is content with it, desirous of it, and considers the phlebotomist’s action a favor to him. This is the state of one who is content with the pain that befalls him. Likewise, the traveler in pursuit of profit perceives the hardship of the journey, but his love for the fruit of his travel makes the hardship of the journey pleasant to him and renders him content with it. Whenever a tribulation from God, exalted is He, befalls him, and he has certainty that the reward stored for him surpasses what he has lost, he becomes content with it, desirous of it, loves it, and thanks God for it. This is if he contemplates the reward and the beneficence with which he is recompensed for it. And it is possible that love predominates to such an extent that the lover’s share lies in the will and pleasure of his beloved, not for any other meaning beyond that, so the will and pleasure of his beloved become beloved and sought after by him. All of this is found in observable instances of the love of creation, and those who describe it have recounted it in their poetry and prose. Its meaning is nothing but the contemplation of the beauty of the outward form with the eye. For if one looks at the beauty, it is nothing but skin, flesh, and blood filled with impurities and filth; its beginning is from a despised drop, and its end is a foul corpse, and in between it carries excrement. And if one looks at the perceiver of beauty, it is the base eye that errs greatly in what it sees, seeing the small as large, the large as small, the distant as near, and the ugly as beautiful. So when one imagines the dominance of this love, how could it be impossible in the love of the eternal, everlasting Beauty, whose perfection has no end, perceived with the eye of insight that is not afflicted by error nor encompassed by death, but rather remains after death—alive with God, rejoicing in the provision of God, exalted is He, gaining through death an increase of awakening and discovery? This matter is clear from the perspective of consideration with the eye of reflection, and existence bears witness to it, as do the accounts of the states and sayings of the lovers.

Shakīq al-Balkhī said: "Whoever sees the reward of hardship, would he still desire escape from it?" And Junayd said: "I asked Sarī al-Saqaṭī: 'Does the lover feel the pain of affliction?' He replied: 'No.' I asked: 'Even if struck by a sword?' He said: 'Yes, even if struck by a sword seventy blows—blow upon blow.'"

And one of them said: "I loved everything He loves, so that if He loved the Fire, I would love entering the Fire."

Bishr ibn al-Ḥārith said: "I passed by a man who had been lashed a thousand times in eastern Baghdad and did not utter a word, then he was carried to prison. I followed him and asked: 'Why were you lashed?' He replied: 'Because I am a lover.' I asked: 'Why did you remain silent?' He said: 'Because my Beloved was before me, gazing upon me.' I said: 'What if you gazed upon the Greater Beloved?' He let out a cry and fell down dead."

Yaḥyā ibn Muʿādh al-Rāzī, may God have mercy on him, said: "When the people of Paradise look upon God, exalted is He, their eyes will sink into their hearts from the delight of gazing upon God for three hundred years, not returning to them. So what do you think of hearts that have fallen between His beauty and His majesty? When they behold His majesty, they are awestruck; and when they behold His beauty, they are enraptured!"

Bishr said: "I headed to ʿAbbādān in my early days and came upon a blind, leprous, insane man who had fallen, with ants eating his flesh. I lifted his head and placed it in my lap while repeating words. When he regained consciousness, he said: 'Who is this intruder coming between me and my Lord? Even if I were torn limb from limb, I would only increase in love for Him.'" Bishr said: "Never after that did I see any wrath between a servant and his Lord without rejecting it."

Abū ʿAmr Muḥammad ibn al-Ashʿath said: "The people of Egypt went four months without any food except gazing upon the face of Joseph the Truthful, peace be upon him. When they grew hungry, they would look at his face, and his beauty would distract them from feeling the pain of hunger. Indeed, in the Qurʾān there is what is more profound than that: the women cut their hands, heedless in observing his beauty, to the point that they did not even feel it."

Saʿīd ibn Yaḥyā said: "I saw in Basra, at the inn of ʿAṭāʾ ibn Muslim, a youth with a knife in his hand, calling out in a loud voice with people around him, saying:

'The day of separation is longer than the Resurrection,
And death is more beautiful than the pain of separation.
They said: "Departure," but I said: "I am not departing,"
Though my soul is the one that departs.'"

Then he slit his belly with a knife and fell down dead. I inquired about him and his affair, and it was said to me that he had been in love with a youth belonging to one of the kings, who was veiled from him for a single day.

It is narrated that Yunus, peace be upon him, said to Jibril: "Guide me to the most devout worshipper on earth?" So he guided him to a man whose hands and feet had been severed by leprosy and who had lost his sight. He heard him saying: "My Lord, You gave me enjoyment of them for as long as You willed, and You took from me what You willed, and You have left me with hope in You, O Kind One, O Ever-Responsive."

It is narrated from Abdullah ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, that a son of his fell ill and his grief for him intensified greatly, until some people said, "We truly fear for this elder should something befall this boy." The boy died, and Ibn Umar came out for his funeral procession, and there was no man ever more profoundly joyful than he. When he was questioned about this, Ibn Umar said, "My sorrow was merely a mercy for him. When the decree of God came to pass, we accepted it with contentment."

Masruq said: There was a man in the desert who had a dog, a donkey, and a rooster. The rooster would wake them for prayer, the donkey would carry water for them and transport their tent, and the dog would guard them. He said: Then a fox came and took the rooster, and they grieved for it. The man was righteous and said, "Perhaps it is for the best." Then a wolf came and tore open the donkey's belly, killing it, and they grieved for it. The man said, "Perhaps it is for the best." Then the dog was lost after that, and he said, "Perhaps it is for the best." Then one morning they awoke and looked, and behold, those around them had been taken captive while they remained. He said: They were taken only because of the sounds of the dogs, donkeys, and roosters that were with them. Thus, the better outcome for these people lay in the loss of these animals, as God Almighty had decreed. Therefore, whoever recognizes the subtle grace of God Almighty is content with His decree in every circumstance.

It is narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by a man who was blind, leprous, paralyzed, with a stricken forehead, afflicted with palsy, and whose flesh was falling apart from leprosy. He was saying, "Praise be to God who has preserved me from what He has tested many of His creation with." Jesus said to him, "O this one, what affliction do I see that has been turned away from you?" He replied, "O Spirit of God, I am better than one in whose heart God has not placed what He has placed in my heart of knowledge of Him." Jesus said to him, "You have spoken the truth. Give me your hand." He offered him his hand, and behold, he was the most handsome of people in face and the most excellent in form! God had removed from him what had been upon him, and he accompanied Jesus, peace be upon him, and worshipped with him.

Urwah ibn al-Zubayr had his leg amputated—from the knee—due to a wound that afflicted it. Then he said: Praise be to God, who has taken from me one limb. By God, if He has taken, He has indeed left; and if He has tested, He has indeed spared. Then he did not abandon his nightly prayers that evening.

Ibn Mas'ud used to say: Poverty and wealth are two mounts; I care not which I ride. If it be poverty, then in it is patience; and if it be wealth, then in it is giving.

Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: I said, "I have attained a state in every spiritual station except contentment. I have nothing of it save a whiff of its scent. Upon that, were all of creation to enter Paradise and I were cast into the Fire, I would be content with that."

Another knower [of God] was asked: "Have you attained the ultimate degree of contentment with Him?" He replied: "As for the ultimate, no. But the station of contentment I have attained. Were He to make me a bridge over Hell, over which all of creation would cross to Paradise, and then fill Hell with me—as a fulfillment of His decree and a substitute for His creation—I would love that from His judgment and be content with that from His apportioning."

This is the speech of one who knew that love had consumed his concern to the point that it prevented him from sensing the pain of the Fire. If any sensation remained, it would be overwhelmed by the delight he finds in perceiving the attainment of his Beloved's pleasure by casting him into the Fire. The dominance of this state is not impossible in itself, though it is far from our weak conditions. Yet it is not fitting for the weak, deprived one to deem the states of the strong strange, or to think that what he is incapable of, the saints are also incapable of.

Al-Rudhabari said: I said to Abu 'Abd Allah ibn al-Jalla' al-Dimashqi: "What is the meaning of so-and-so's statement, 'I wish my flesh were cut with scissors and that this creation would obey Him'?" He replied: "O you, if this is from the path of veneration and reverence, I do not know it. But if it is from the path of compassion and sincere counsel for creation, then I know it." Then he fell unconscious.

'Imran ibn al-Husayn had developed dropsy in his abdomen and remained lying on his back for thirty years, unable to stand or sit—a hole had been made for him in his palm-frond bed for relieving himself. Mutarrif and his brother al-'Ala' entered upon him and he began to weep at the sight of his condition. ['Imran] said: "Why do you weep?" He replied: "Because I see you in this tremendous state!" He said: "Do not weep, for what is most beloved to God Almighty is most beloved to me!" Then he said: "Let me tell you something, perhaps God will benefit you by it. Keep it secret for me until I die. The angels visit me; I find solace with them and they greet me. I hear their greeting, and I know by that that this tribulation is not a punishment, since it is the cause of this immense blessing! So how could one who witnesses this in his tribulation not be content with it?"

He said: We entered upon Suwayd ibn Mu'tabah to visit him. We saw a garment thrown down and did not think anything was beneath it until it was uncovered. His wife said to him: "May my family be your ransom! What shall we feed you? What shall we give you to drink?" He replied: "The lying down has grown long, the flanks have wasted away, and I have become emaciated. I have not eaten food nor swallowed drink for such-and-such"—and he mentioned a number of days—"and I would not be pleased to have diminished from this [reward] even the paring of a fingernail."

When Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas came to Mecca—and he had lost his sight—people rushed to him, each one asking him to supplicate for them, and he would supplicate for this one and that one—and his supplication was answered—so said 'Abd Allah ibn al-Sa'ib: I came to him with a boy, and I made myself known to him. He recognized me and said: "Are you the reciter of the people of Mecca?" I said: "Yes." He mentioned a story, at the end of which I said to him: "O uncle, you supplicate for people; if only you would supplicate for yourself, that God might restore your sight to you!" He smiled and said: "My son, the decree of God, glorified be He, is more beautiful to me than my sight!"

A child of one of the Sufis, only three days old, was lost, and no news of him was known. It was said to him: "If only you would ask God Almighty to return him to you." He replied: "My objecting to Him concerning what He has decreed is more severe upon me than the loss of my child."

It is related from one of the worshippers that he said: "I committed a great sin, and I have been weeping over it for sixty years"—and he had striven hard in worship for the sake of repentance from that sin. He was asked: "What is it?" He said: "I once said concerning something that had occurred: 'Would that it had not been.'"

One of the early pious said: "Were my body to be cut with scissors, it would be more beloved to me than to say concerning something God Almighty, glorified be He, has decreed: 'Would that He had not decreed it.'"

It was said to 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zayd: "Here is a man who has devoted himself to worship for fifty years." He sought him out and said to him: "O my beloved, inform me about yourself. Have you been satisfied with Him?" He said: "No." He said: "Have you found intimacy with Him?" He said: "No." He said: "Have you been content with Him?" He said: "No." He said: "Then is your increase from Him [only] fasting and prayer?" He said: "Yes." He said: "Were it not that I feel shame before you, I would inform you that your dealings for fifty years are flawed!" Its meaning is: "The door of the heart has not been opened for you, so that you might ascend to the degrees of nearness through the works of the heart. Rather, you are counted among the ranks of the Companions of the Right Hand, because your increase from Him is in the works of the limbs, which is the increase of the common people."

A group of people entered upon al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, in a hospital where he had been confined. Stones had been gathered before him. He said: "Who are you?" They said: "Your lovers." He turned to them and began throwing stones at them, so they scattered in flight. He said: "What is the matter with you? You claimed love for me; if you were truthful, then be patient with my affliction!"

And of al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, is this:
Love for the All-Merciful has intoxicated me.
And have you ever seen a lover who is not intoxicated?

Some worshippers among the people of Syria said: All of you will meet God, the Mighty and Majestic, as believers, yet perhaps He has already deemed you liars. For if one of you had a finger of gold, he would persist in pointing with it, and if it were afflicted with paralysis, he would persist in concealing it. By this, he means that gold is blameworthy in the sight of God, yet people boast of it; while affliction is an adornment for the people of the Hereafter, yet they disdain it.

It is said that a fire broke out in the marketplace, and it was said to al-Sarī: "The market has burned, yet your shop did not burn!" He replied, "Praise be to God." Then he said, "How could I say 'Praise be to God' for my own safety instead of the safety of the Muslims!" He repented from commerce and abandoned his shop for the rest of his life in repentance and seeking forgiveness for having said, "Praise be to God."

When you reflect upon these accounts, you will know with certainty that contentment with what opposes one's desires is not impossible; rather, it is a great station among the stations of the people of faith. And if this is possible concerning the love of creation and their worldly shares, then it is certainly possible regarding the love of God Almighty and the shares of the Hereafter. Its possibility arises from two aspects: one is contentment with pain in anticipation of the expected reward, like being content with bloodletting, cupping, and drinking medicine while awaiting healing.

The second is contentment with it, not looking beyond it but because it is the beloved's desire and pleasure for Him. Indeed, love may prevail to the extent that the lover's desire is submerged in the desire of the beloved, so that the most delightful thing to him becomes the joy of his beloved's heart, His contentment, and the fulfillment of His will—even if it be in the destruction of his own soul. As it has been said:

What is the wound, then, if your pleasure is my pain?

This is possible while feeling pain, and love may so overpower that it stupefies from perceiving pain. Thus analogy, experience, and observation indicate its existence, so one who lacks it within themselves should not deny it! For they lack it only due to lacking its cause, which is the precedence of love. Whoever has not tasted the flavor of love does not know its wonders, for lovers have wonders greater than what we have described.

It has been narrated from 'Umar ibn al-Harith al-Rafi'i, who said: I was in a gathering in al-Raqqah with a friend of mine, and there was with us a youth who was infatuated with a singing slave-girl. She was with us in the gathering, and she struck the rod and sang:

The sign of love's humiliation upon lovers is weeping, especially when a lover finds none to complain to.

The youth said to her: "By God, you have spoken well, my lady. Will you permit me to die?" She replied: "Die as one rightly guided!" He then laid his head upon the pillow, closed his mouth and shut his eyes. We shook him, and behold, he was dead.

Junayd said: I saw a man clinging to a mute child, beseeching him and displaying affection to him. The child turned to him and said, "How long will this hypocrisy you show me last?" The man replied, "God knows that I am truthful in what I profess, such that if you told me to die, I would die." The child said, "If you are truthful, then die." The man withdrew, closed his eyes, and was found dead.

Sumnun the Lover said: There was among our neighbors a man who had a slave-girl he loved exceedingly. The girl fell ill, so the man sat down to prepare a sweet dish for her. While he was stirring the pot, the girl sighed, "Ah!" The man was so startled that the spoon fell from his hand, and he began stirring the contents of the pot with his own hand until his fingers were scalded! The girl said, "What is this?" He replied, "This is the place of your saying 'Ah'."

And it is related from Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah al-Baghdadi, who said: I saw in Basra a youth upon a high roof, overlooking the people, and he was saying:

He who dies of love, let him die thus—for there is no good in a love without death!

Then he cast himself upon the ground, and they carried him away dead. Such occurrences and their like may indeed be believed in when it comes to love for the created, but believing in them concerning love for the Creator is more fitting, for the inner insight is truer than outward sight, and the beauty of the Divine Presence is more complete than all beauty—indeed, every beauty in the world is but one grace among the graces of that Beauty. Truly, he who lacks sight denies the beauty of forms, and he who lacks hearing denies the delight of melodies and measured harmonies; so too, he who lacks a heart must inevitably deny these delights that have no abode except the heart.

Explanation that supplication does not contradict contentment

Nor does it remove its possessor from the station of contentment. Likewise, aversion to sins, detesting their perpetrators and their causes, and striving to remove them through enjoining good and forbidding evil does not contradict it either. Some idle and deluded individuals have erred in this matter, claiming that sins, immorality, and disbelief are from the decree and determination of God, the Almighty, and thus one must be content with them. This is ignorance of interpretation and heedlessness of the mysteries of the Sacred Law.

As for supplication, we have been commanded to worship through it, and the numerous supplications of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and all the other prophets, upon them be peace—as we have transmitted in the Book of Supplications—indicate this. Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was at the highest stations of contentment. And God, exalted is He, has praised some of His servants by His saying, "And they supplicate Us in hope and fear." As for rejecting sins, abhorring them, and not being content with them, God has commanded His servants to worship by this and censured them for being content with them, saying, "And they are content with the life of this world and feel secure therein," and He, exalted is He, said, "They were content to be with those who remained behind, and their hearts were sealed."

In the well-known tradition: "Whoever witnesses an evil and is pleased with it, it is as if he has committed it."

He who directs to evil is like its doer.

From Ibn Mas'ud: Verily, a servant may be absent from an evil deed, yet bear a sin equivalent to that of its doer. It was asked: How can that be? He replied: It reaches him, and he approves of it.

It is reported in a tradition: "If a servant were killed in the East, and another in the West were pleased with his killing, he would be a partner in his murder."

God Almighty has commanded emulation and competition in good deeds and avoidance of evils, saying: "In that let the competitors compete." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "There is no emulation except in two cases: a man to whom God has granted wisdom, and he disseminates it among people and teaches it; and a man to whom God has granted wealth, and he wields it for its rightful expenditure in truth." In another wording: "And a man to whom God has granted the Qur'an, and he stands with it by night and day, so that a man says, 'If God had granted me the like of this, I would have done as he does.'"

As for hating the disbelievers, rejecting their ways, and despising them, the evidences from the Qur’an and the Prophetic traditions on this matter are beyond count, such as the saying of the Almighty: "Let not the believers take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers."

O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies.

And God Almighty said: "And thus We cause some of the wrongdoers to turn to others."

In the tradition: "Verily, God the Exalted took a covenant from every believer to despise every hypocrite, and from every hypocrite to despise every believer."

He, peace be upon him, said: "A person is with whom he loves." And he said: "Whoever loves a people and allies himself with them will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection."
And he, peace be upon him, said: "The firmest bond of faith is love for the sake of God and hatred for the sake of God."
We have already mentioned the proofs for this in the explanation of love and hatred for the sake of God Almighty from the Book of the Etiquette of Companionship, and in the Book of Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil; thus, we shall not repeat it.

If you say: Verses and reports have indeed come regarding contentment with the decree of God, the Exalted. If sins were not by the decree of God, the Exalted, that is impossible and it undermines divine oneness. Yet if they are by the decree of God, the Exalted, then to detest and abhor them is to detest the decree of God, the Exalted. How then is the path to reconciliation, when it appears contradictory in this manner? How can contentment and aversion be combined in one and the same thing?

Know that this is among the matters that perplex the weak who fall short of grasping the mysteries of the sciences. It has even perplexed some people to the point that they considered silence in the face of evil to be a station among the stations of contentment and called it good character—which is pure ignorance. Rather, we say contentment and aversion are mutually exclusive if they both pertain to one and the same thing, from one and the same aspect, in one and the same respect. There is no contradiction in one and the same thing being disliked from one aspect and being accepted from another. For instance, your enemy—who is also the enemy of some of your enemies and strives for their destruction—may die. You would dislike his death from the aspect that he was the enemy of your enemy, yet you would accept it from the aspect that he was your enemy who died.

Likewise, sin has two aspects: an aspect toward God, the Exalted, in that it is His act, His choice, and His will. From this aspect, one is content with it, submitting that affair to the King, the Owner of Sovereignty, and accepting what He does within His dominion. And an aspect toward the servant, in that it is his acquisition, his attribute, and a sign of his being detested and odious in the sight of God, since He has subjected him to the causes of remoteness and wrath. From this aspect, it is reprehensible and blameworthy. This will not become clear to you except through an example:

Let us suppose a beloved among creation says before his lovers: "I wish to distinguish between those who love me and those who hate me, and to establish in this a truthful criterion and a speaking balance: that I intend to harm so-and-so and strike him with a beating that compels him to revile me. Then, when he reviles me, I will hate him and take him as my enemy. Thus, everyone who loves me will also know he is my enemy, and everyone who hates him will know he is my friend and lover." Then he does that and achieves his aim of the reviling, which is the cause of hatred, and the hatred, which is the cause of enmity.

It is incumbent upon everyone who is sincere in his love and knows the conditions of love to say: "As for your management in harming this person, beating him, distancing him, and exposing him to hatred and enmity—I am a lover of it and pleased with it, for it is your view, your management, your action, and your will! As for his reviling you, that is aggression on his part, for it was his duty to be patient and not revile, but it was what you desired from him; for you intended by his beating to elicit from him the reviling that necessitates loathing. Thus, from the aspect that it occurred in accordance with your desire and the management you devised, I am pleased with it. Had it not occurred, that would have been a deficiency in your management and an obstruction to your desire, and I would dislike the failure of your desire. But from the aspect that it is an attribute of this person and his acquisition, and an aggression and transgression from him against you—contrary to what your beauty demands, for that demands that he endure your beating and not respond with reviling—I dislike it from the aspect of its attribution to him and from the aspect that it is his attribute, not from the aspect that it is your desire and the requirement of your management.

As for your hating him because of his reviling you, I am pleased with it and love it, because it is your desire, and I, in accordance with you, also hate him; for the condition of the lover is that the beloved of the Beloved be beloved to him and the enemy of the Beloved be an enemy to him. As for his hating you, I accept it from the aspect that you desired him to hate you, since you distanced him from yourself and empowered the incitements to hatred upon him. But I hate him from the aspect that he possesses that hatred and acquires it and does it, and I loathe him for that; thus he is loathsome to me for his loathing of you. And his hatred and loathing of you are also detestable to me from the aspect that they are his attribute. Yet all of that, from the aspect that it is your desire, is acceptable.

Contradiction would only be to say: "It is acceptable from the aspect that it is your desire, and detestable from the aspect that it is your desire." But if it is detestable not from the aspect that it is his action and his desire, but from the aspect that it is the attribute of another and his acquisition, then there is no contradiction in that. Everything that is detested from one angle and accepted from another bears witness to this, and its parallels are innumerable.

Therefore, God’s empowering the incitements of appetite and disobedience upon a person—until that draws him to love disobedience, and love draws him to commit disobedience—resembles the beloved’s beating the person we set as an example, to draw him by the beating to anger, and anger to reviling. And God’s loathing of whoever disobeys Him—even though his disobedience occurs by His management—resembles the reviled one’s hatred of whoever reviles him, even though his reviling only occurs by his management and choice of its causes.

And God’s doing that with every servant of His servants—I mean, empowering the incitements to disobedience upon him—indicates that His will preceded in distancing him and loathing him. Thus it is obligatory upon every servant who loves God to hate whom God hates, loathe whom God loathes, and be an enemy to whom God has distanced from His presence—even if He compelled him by His overpowering and decree to enmity and opposition—for he is distant, expelled, cursed from the Presence, even if he is distant by His compelling distance and expelled by His expulsion and compulsion. And the one distanced from the degrees of nearness ought to be loathsome and hateful to all the lovers—in accordance with the Beloved, by manifesting anger upon whom the Beloved has manifested anger by distancing him.

Thus is established all that has been conveyed in the reports concerning hatred for the sake of God and love for the sake of God, and the severity towards the disbelievers and the harshness against them, and the extreme abhorrence of them, while being content with the decree of God Almighty, from the perspective that it is the decree of God, Mighty and Majestic. All of this draws from the secret of Divine Decree—which there is no permission to divulge—which is that evil and good both enter into the Divine Will and Volition, but evil is willed as something detested, and good is willed as something pleasing. So whoever says, "Evil is not from God," is ignorant; and likewise, whoever says, "They are both from Him"—without distinction in terms of [Divine] pleasure and displeasure—is also deficient. Lifting the veil from this is not permitted; therefore, the best course is silence and observing the decorum of the Sacred Law, for He, exalted is He, has said: "Divine Decree is the secret of God, so do not divulge it." This pertains to the knowledge of unveiling. Our aim now is to clarify the possibility of what the creation is commanded to observe: combining contentment with the decree of God Almighty and abhorring sins, even though they are from the decree of God Almighty. The purpose has become clear without need to unveil the secret within it.

From this it is also understood that supplicating for forgiveness, protection from sins, and all other means that aid in religion does not contradict contentment with the decree of God, the Exalted. For God has prescribed supplication for His servants to draw forth from them the purity of remembrance, the humility of the heart, and the tenderness of entreaty. This becomes a polish for the heart, a key to unveiling, and a cause for the continuous flow of the bounties of divine gentleness. Just as carrying a jug and drinking water does not contradict contentment with God's decree regarding thirst—since drinking water to directly remove thirst is utilizing a cause that the Causer of Causes has ordained—so too is supplication a cause that God, the Exalted, has ordained and commanded.

We have previously mentioned that adhering to causes, in accordance with the established way of God, does not contradict reliance on God—we elaborated on this in the Book of Reliance. Therefore, it also does not contradict contentment, for contentment is intimately connected to reliance. However, manifesting one's affliction in the context of complaint, and inwardly objecting to God, the Exalted, regarding it, contradicts contentment. Whereas manifesting the affliction for the sake of gratitude and to reveal the power of God, the Exalted, does not contradict it.

Some of the pious predecessors said: "Part of the excellence of contentment with God's decree is that one does not say, 'This is a hot day,' meaning in the context of complaint—and this is in summer; as for winter, it is gratitude." Complaint contradicts contentment in all circumstances, and disparaging food and finding fault with it contradicts contentment with the decree of God, the Exalted, because criticizing the creation is criticizing the Creator, and everything is from the creation of God, the Exalted.

Saying, "Poverty is an affliction and a trial," or, "Dependents are a worry and a burden," or, "Earning a livelihood is toil and hardship"—all of this impairs contentment. Rather, one should surrender management to its Manager and the kingdom to its King, and say what 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "I do not care whether I wake up rich or poor, for I do not know which of them is better for me."

Explanation that fleeing from lands which are places of sin is recommended

And its blame does not detract from contentment.

Know that the weak may imagine that the Prophet's prohibition against leaving a land where plague has appeared indicates a prohibition against leaving a land where sins have appeared, because each is a flight from the decree of God—and that is impossible. Rather, the reason for prohibiting departure from the land after the appearance of plague is that if this door were opened, the healthy would depart and the sick would remain neglected, with none to care for them, and they would perish from weakness and harm. For this reason, the Prophet likened it in some reports to fleeing from the battlefield. If it were a flight from divine decree, He would not have permitted those on the outskirts of the town to depart—and we have mentioned the ruling on that in the Book of Trust in God. Once the meaning is understood, it becomes clear that fleeing from lands that are breeding grounds of sins is not a flight from divine decree; rather, fleeing from what one must flee from is itself the decree. Likewise, censuring places that invite to sin and the causes that lead to it—for the purpose of deterring from sin—is not blameworthy. The righteous predecessors continually practiced this until a group agreed on censuring Baghdad and openly declaring that and seeking to flee from it. Ibn al-Mubārak said: "I have traveled east and west, and I have seen no land worse than Baghdad!" It was said: "How so?" He replied: "It is a land where God's blessings are despised and His disobedience is belittled." When he arrived in Khurasan, he was asked: "What did you think of Baghdad?" He said: "I saw there only an angry policeman, a greedy merchant, or a bewildered reciter!" One should not think that this is backbiting, for he did not target a specific individual such that the person would be harmed by it; his intention was only to warn the people. He would go out to Mecca—while his residence was in Baghdad—waiting for the caravan's preparation for sixteen days, and he would give in charity sixteen dinars, one dinar for each day as an expiation for his stay. A group censured Iraq, such as 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Azīz and Ka'b al-Aḥbār.

Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said to one of his servants, "Where do you reside?" He replied, "Iraq." He said, "What do you seek there? It has reached me that there is no one who resides in Iraq except that God appoints for him a companion from tribulation."

Ka'b al-Aḥbār once mentioned Iraq and said: "Nine-tenths of evil lie therein, and therein is the incurable malady."

It has been said: Goodness is divided into ten parts; nine-tenths of it are in Syria and one-tenth in Iraq. And evil is divided into ten parts; in the opposite manner.

Some companions of Hadith related: We were one day with Fudayl ibn 'Iyad when a Sufi came to him wearing a cloak. He seated him at his side and turned to him, then asked, "Where do you reside?" He replied, "Baghdad." Fudayl turned away from him and said, "One of them comes to us in the guise of monks, yet when we ask him where he resides, he says, 'In the nest of darkness'?"

Bishr ibn al-Harith would say: "The example of one who practices devotion in Baghdad is like the example of one who practices devotion in a latrine." And he would say: "Do not follow my example in residing there! Whoever wishes to depart, let him depart."

Ahmad ibn Hanbal would say: "Were it not for these children clinging to us, departing from this city would be more desirable to my soul!" He was asked: "And where would you choose to dwell?" He replied: "On the frontier outposts."

Some of them were asked about the people of Baghdad and said: Their ascetic is an ascetic, and their wicked is wicked.

This indicates that one who is afflicted with residing in a land where sins abound and good is scarce has no excuse to remain there; rather, he ought to emigrate. God Almighty has said, "Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" If he is prevented from doing so by dependents or ties, he should not be content with his state nor feel at ease with it. Rather, his heart should be agitated by it, constantly supplicating, "Our Lord, deliver us from this town whose people are wrongdoers." For when injustice becomes widespread, calamity descends and destroys all, encompassing the obedient as well. God Almighty has said, "And fear a trial which will not afflict in particular those who have wronged among you." Therefore, there is absolutely no cause for complete contentment in any of the reasons for religious deficiency, except insofar as they are attributed to the act of God Almighty. As for them in themselves, there is no basis for contentment with them under any circumstance.

Scholars have differed regarding who is most excellent among the people of three stations: a man who loves death out of longing to meet God Almighty, a man who loves to remain in order to serve the Master, and a man who said, "I choose nothing; rather, I am content with what God Almighty has chosen." This question was raised to one of the knowers, and he said: "The possessor of contentment is the most excellent of them, for he is the least given to superfluity."

One day, Wahib ibn al-Ward, Sufyan al-Thawri, and Yusuf ibn Asbat gathered. Al-Thawri said, "I used to dislike sudden death before today, but today I wish I had died." Yusuf asked him, "Why?" He replied, "Because of what I fear from tribulation." Yusuf said, "But I do not dislike a long life." Sufyan asked, "Why?" He said, "So that I might encounter a day in which I repent and do righteous deeds." Then it was said to Wahib, "What do you say?" He replied, "I do not choose anything. What is most beloved to me is what is most beloved to God, the Exalted and Sublime." Al-Thawri kissed him between his eyes and said, "By the Lord of the Ka'bah, this is spirituality."

An Exposition of a Collection of Narrations, Sayings, and Spiritual Unveilings of the Lovers [of God]

It was said to one of the knowers, "You are a lover." He replied, "I am not a lover; rather, I am the Beloved, and the lover is wearied." It was also said to him, "People say you are one of the Seven?" He said, "I am all of the Seven." And he used to say, "If you see me, you have seen forty substitutes." It was asked, "How can that be, when you are a single person?" He said, "Because I have seen forty substitutes and taken from each substitute a character trait from his character." And it was said to him, "We have heard that you see al-Khidr, peace be upon him." He smiled and said, "The wonder is not in one who sees al-Khidr, but the wonder is in one whom al-Khidr wishes to see, yet he veils himself from him!" And it was narrated from al-Khidr, peace be upon him, that he said, "Never has a day passed when I told myself that there remained no friend of God, the Exalted, except whom I knew, except that I saw on that day a friend I did not know."

It was once said to Abu Yazid al-Bistami: "Tell us of what you have witnessed from God, exalted be He." He cried out and then said: "Woe unto you! It is not fitting for you to know that!" It was said: "Then tell us of the most intense struggle you waged against your soul for the sake of God, exalted be He." He said: "This too is not permissible for me to disclose to you." It was said: "Then tell us of the discipline of your soul at your beginning." He said: "Yes, I called my soul to God, but it resisted me. So I resolved against it that I would not drink water for a year and would not taste sleep for a year, and it complied with me in that."

It is recounted that Yahya ibn Mu'adh saw Abu Yazid—during one of his spiritual states, from after the Evening Prayer until the break of dawn—resting on the balls of his feet, with his arches and heels raised from the ground, his chin pressed against his chest, his eyes fixed and unblinking. He said: Then he prostrated at the pre‑dawn hour and prolonged it greatly. Then he sat up and said: “O God, some people sought You and You granted them walking on water and walking in the air, and they were content with that—but I seek refuge in You from that. And some people sought You and You granted them the folding up of the earth, and they were content with that—but I seek refuge in You from that. And some people sought You and You granted them the treasures of the earth, and they were content with that—but I seek refuge in You from that.” He went on enumerating over twenty stations of the saints’ miracles. Then he turned and saw me and said: “Yahya!” I replied: “Yes, my master.” He asked: “How long have you been here?” I said: “For a while.” He fell silent, so I said: “My master, tell me something.” He said: “I will tell you what is fitting for you. He brought me into the lowest celestial sphere and whirled me through the lower dominion, showing me the earths and what lies beneath them down to the moist clay. Then He brought me into the highest celestial sphere and carried me through the heavens, showing me what they contain from the Gardens up to the Throne. He stood me before Him and said: ‘Ask Me for anything you have seen, that I may grant it to you.’ I said: ‘My Lord, I have seen nothing that I admired so as to ask You for it!’ Then He said: ‘You are truly My servant, worshipping Me for My sake in sincerity. I shall indeed do for you—and I shall do…’ and he mentioned many things.” Yahya said: “That overwhelmed me and filled me with awe, and I marveled at it, so I said: ‘My master, why did you not ask Him for knowledge of Him? For the King of Kings said to you: “Ask whatever you wish.”’” He cried out at me with a shout and said: “Be silent, woe to you! You would begrudge Him to me, that I should not love for anyone but Him to know Him.”

It is related that Abu Turab al-Takhshabi was greatly admiring a certain disciple, drawing him near and attending to his affairs, while the disciple was occupied with his worship and spiritual states. One day Abu Turab said to him, "If only you could see Abu Yazid!" He replied, "I am preoccupied from him." When Abu Turab persisted in saying, "If only you could see Abu Yazid," the disciple's spiritual passion stirred, and he said, "Woe to you! What would I do with Abu Yazid? I have seen God Almighty, and He has made me independent of Abu Yazid." Abu Turab said, "My nature was agitated, and I could not restrain myself, so I said, 'Woe to you! You are deluded by God, Mighty and Majestic! If you saw Abu Yazid a single time, it would be more beneficial to you than seeing God seventy times!'" He said, "The youth was stunned by my words and rejected them, saying, 'How can that be?' I said to him, 'Woe to you! Do you not see that God Almighty, when with you, appears to you according to your own measure, while you see Abu Yazid as he is with God, for God has manifested to him according to his measure?' He understood what I said and replied, 'Take me to him.'"

He then narrated the story, saying at its end: "We stood on a hillock waiting for him to come out to us from the thicket—for he used to take refuge in a thicket where there were wild beasts. He passed by us having turned a fur cloak upon his back. I said to the youth, 'This is Abu Yazid; look at him!' The youth looked at him and fell unconscious. We shook him, and he was dead. We cooperated in burying him, and I said to Abu Yazid, 'O my master, his looking at you killed him.' He said, 'No, but your companion was truthful, and a secret had settled in his heart which had not been unveiled to him in its description. When he saw us, the secret of his heart was unveiled to him, but his capacity was too narrow to bear it, for he was in the station of the weak disciples, and that killed him.'"

And when the Zanj entered Basra, killing people and plundering wealth, Sahl's brothers gathered to him and said, "If only you would ask God Almighty to repel them!" He remained silent, then said, "Verily, God has servants in this city who, if they were to call upon Him against the wrongdoers, not a single wrongdoer would remain alive on the face of the earth by morning. But they do not do so." It was asked, "Why not?" He said, "Because they do not love what He does not love." Then he mentioned instances of God Almighty's answering prayers which cannot be recounted, even saying, "And if they asked Him not to establish the Hour, He would not establish it."

These are matters possible in themselves. Whoever does not attain any of them should not be devoid of believing and having faith in their possibility, for the Power is vast, the Grace is abundant, and the wonders of the dominion of the visible and unseen worlds are many. The things God Almighty has power over are without end, and His grace upon His chosen servants has no limit. For this reason, Abu Yazid used to say, "If He grants you the intimate discourse of Moses, the spirituality of Jesus, and the intimate friendship of Abraham, then seek what is beyond that, for with Him is above that manifold multiples. If you become content with that, it will veil you from Him." And this is a trial for the likes of them and for those in a state like theirs, for they are the most excellent of the excellent.

One of the knowers of God said: "I was unveiled to forty houris, whom I saw moving gracefully in the air, wearing garments of gold, silver, and jewels that rustled and swayed with them. I gazed at them a single glance and was punished for forty days. Then I was unveiled to eighty houris, surpassing the former in beauty and loveliness, and it was said to me: 'Look at them.' He said: So I prostrated, closing my eyes in my prostration so as not to look at them, and I said: 'I seek refuge in You from all besides You! I have no need for this.' And I did not cease supplicating until God turned them away from me."

Such spiritual unveilings ought not to be denied by the believer merely due to his own bankruptcy in experiencing them. For if each person were to believe only in what he witnesses from his own darkened soul and hardened heart, the realm of faith would become exceedingly narrow for him. Rather, these are states that appear only after traversing many obstacles, attaining numerous stations, the least of which is sincerity—expelling the selfish interests of the ego and removing concern for creation from all one’s deeds, outwardly and inwardly—and then concealing that state from people by veiling one’s condition, so that one remains fortified in the stronghold of obscurity. These are the beginnings of their spiritual wayfaring and the lowest of their stations, yet they are the most precious realities found among the God‑fearing.

After the heart is purified from the murkiness of turning toward creation, the light of certainty flows upon it, and the principles of Truth become unveiled to it. To deny this without undergoing the experience and treading the path is akin to one who denies the possibility of an image becoming manifest in a piece of iron when it is shaped, purified, polished, and engraved with the form of a woman, while the denier looks only at the dark iron ingot in his hand—overcome by rust and impurity—which reflects no image whatsoever, and so he denies that any visible form could appear in it once its essence is revealed. Such denial is the height of ignorance and misguidance.

This is the judgment upon all who deny the miracles of the saints, for they have no basis except their own deficiency in perceiving it and the deficiency of those they follow. And wretched indeed is such a basis for denying the power of God Almighty. Rather, the fragrances of divine unveiling are only for one who has traversed something, even if only the beginnings of the path. As it was said to Bishr: "By what means did you reach this station?" He replied: "I used to ask God Almighty to conceal my state." That is, he would beseech Him to conceal and hide his affair. And it is related that he saw Al-Khidr (peace be upon him) and said to him: "Supplicate to God Almighty for me." He said: "May God facilitate His obedience for you." I said: "Increase it for me." He said: "And may He conceal it for you." It was said: The meaning is He conceals it from creation. And it was said: The meaning is He conceals it from you so that you do not turn your attention to it. And from one of them it is related that he said: "Longing for Al-Khidr (peace be upon him) disturbed me, so I asked God Almighty once to show him to me so he could teach me something that was the most important of things to me." He said: "I saw him, and my concern and my aspiration overcame me not except that I said to him: 'O Father of Al-'Abbas, teach me something that, when I say it, I will be veiled from the hearts of creation, so that I have no standing among them and no one knows me for piety or religiosity.' He said: 'Say: O God, drape over me the dense curtain of Your veil, and lower over me the canopies of Your screens, and place me within the hidden treasure of Your unseen, and veil me from the hearts of Your creatures.'" He said: "Then he vanished, and I did not see him nor long for him after that. And I have not ceased to say these words every day." And it was narrated that he became such that he was humiliated and demeaned—to the point that the *Dhimmis* would mock him and make use of him on the roads, carrying things for them due to his lowly status in their eyes, and the children would play with him—yet his comfort was the stillness of his heart and the uprightness of his state in his humiliation and obscurity. Thus is the state of the saints of God Almighty. It is among the likes of these that they should be sought, while the deluded seek them only beneath patched garments and cloaks, and among those famous among creation for knowledge, asceticism, and leadership. And God Almighty's protective jealousy for His saints refuses anything but their concealment, as He Almighty has said: "My saints are beneath My domes; none knows them but Me."

And He, may He be exalted, said: "How many a dishevelled, dust-covered man in two worn garments, who is given no regard, yet if he were to swear by God, He would fulfill it for him."

In summary, the hearts farthest from perceiving these meanings are the arrogant hearts, self-admiring, rejoicing in their own deeds and knowledge. The hearts closest to them are the broken hearts, profoundly sensing the lowliness of their own souls—so deeply that when humbled and belittled, they do not feel the humiliation, just as a servant does not feel humiliation when his master elevates him. Thus, he does not feel the humiliation, nor does he even perceive his own inattention to it. Rather, he considers himself of such a low station that he does not regard any form of humiliation as humiliation in his regard; indeed, he sees himself beneath even that, until humility becomes by nature an attribute of his very essence. Such a heart may hope to inhale the beginnings of these fragrances. If we lack such a heart and are deprived of such a spirit, we should not abandon faith in the possibility of this for its people. For whoever cannot be among the friends of God, let him be a lover of the friends of God and a believer in them, so that perhaps he will be resurrected with those he loved. This is supported by what has been related that Jesus, peace be upon him, said to the Children of Israel: "Where does the crop grow?" They said: "In the soil." He said: "By the truth I say to you, wisdom grows only in a heart like soil." Indeed, the seekers of nearness to God Almighty in pursuing its conditions have reached the utmost lowliness and baseness in humbling the soul. It is related that Ibn al-Karībī, who was the teacher of al-Junayd, was invited by a man to a meal three times, and he would refuse, then the man would invite him again and he would return after that, until he admitted him on the fourth occasion. He asked him about that, and he said: "I have trained my soul to accept humiliation for twenty years until it reached the state of a dog: driven away, it retreats; then called, a bone is thrown to it, and it returns. Had you turned me away fifty times and then invited me after that, I would have answered." And from him it is related that he said: "I settled in a neighborhood and became known there for piety, so my heart became troubled. I entered a bathhouse, changed into fine clothes, stole them, put them on, then put my patched garment over them and went out. I walked slowly, and they caught up with me, stripped off my patched garment, took the clothes, slapped me, and beat me painfully. After that, I became known as the thief of the bathhouse, and my soul became calm."

Thus did they discipline their souls until God purified them from gazing upon creation, and then from gazing upon the self. For he who turns his attention to his own soul is veiled from God Almighty, and his preoccupation with himself is a veil upon him. Thereafter, there remains no veil or intervening barrier between the heart and God. The distance of hearts is only due to their preoccupation with other than Him or with themselves, and the greatest of veils is the preoccupation with the self. Therefore, it is related that a witness of great stature among the notables of Bastam never left the gathering of Abu Yazid. One day he said to him, "For thirty years I have fasted continuously without breaking my fast, and stood in prayer at night without sleeping, yet I find in my heart none of this knowledge you speak of—though I believe in it and love it." Abu Yazid replied, "Even if you fasted three hundred years and stood in prayer their nights, you would not find an atom of this!" He asked, "Why?" He said, "Because you are veiled by your own self." He said, "Is there a remedy for this?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Tell me so that I may act upon it." He said, "You will not accept it." He said, "Mention it to me so that I may act." He said, "Go now to the barber, shave your head and beard, remove these garments, wrap yourself in a cloak, hang around your neck a sack filled with walnuts, gather the children around you and say, 'Whoever slaps me, I will give him a walnut.' Then enter the marketplace and wander through all the markets before the witnesses and those who know you, while in that state." The man said, "Glory be to God! You say such a thing to me?" Abu Yazid said, "Your saying 'Glory be to God' is idolatry." He said, "How so?" He said, "Because you have glorified your own self and declared it free from imperfection, not your Lord!" He said, "This I will not do, but guide me to something else!" He said, "Begin with this before all else." He said, "I cannot bear it." He said, "Did I not tell you that you would not accept it?" This which Abu Yazid mentioned is the remedy for one who is afflicted by gazing upon himself and sickened by the gaze of people upon him. There is no cure that delivers from this sickness except this and its like. Whoever cannot endure the remedy should not deny the possibility of healing for one who treated himself after the sickness, or who never fell ill with such a sickness at all. The lowest degree of health is faith in its possibility. So woe to him who is deprived even of this small measure.

These matters are evident in the Sacred Law and clear, yet they remain remote from those who consider themselves among the scholars of the Sacred Law. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said: "A servant's faith is not perfected until he prefers scarcity over abundance, and until he prefers anonymity over being known."

He, peace be upon him, said: "Three traits, whoever possesses them has perfected his faith: he does not fear, for the sake of God, the blame of any blamer; he does not show off with any of his deeds; and when two matters are presented to him, one for this world and the other for the Hereafter, he prefers the matter of the Hereafter over that of this world."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "The faith of a servant is not perfected until he possesses three characteristics: when angry, his anger does not drive him from the truth; when pleased, his pleasure does not lead him into falsehood; and when he has power, he does not take what is not rightfully his."

In another narration: "Three traits, whoever is granted them has been given the equivalent of what was given to the family of David: justice in contentment and anger, moderation in wealth and poverty, and fear of God in private and public." These are conditions mentioned by the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, for the people of faith. So it is astonishing how one can claim knowledge of religion yet not find within himself a single atom of these conditions, and then his share from his knowledge and intellect is to deny that which cannot be attained except after traversing great, lofty stations beyond faith. And in the reports, it is narrated that God Almighty revealed to one of His prophets: "I have only taken as My intimate friend one who does not cease from My remembrance, whose concern is none other than Me, and who prefers nothing of My creation over Me—even if burned by fire, he would not feel the pain of burning, and if sawn with saws, he would not feel the touch of iron." So whoever has not reached the point where love overpowers him to this extent—from where would he know what lies beyond love in terms of honors and unveilings? All of that lies beyond love, and love lies beyond the perfection of faith. The stations of faith and their variation in increase and decrease are beyond enumeration. For this reason, he, peace be upon him, said to the Truthful One, may God be pleased with him: "God Almighty has given you the equivalent of the faith of all who have believed in me from my community, and He has given me the equivalent of the faith of all who have believed in Him from the children of Adam."

In another narration: "Verily Allah the Exalted has three hundred character traits; whoever meets Him with one of them alongside sincere monotheism enters Paradise." Abu Bakr then asked: "O Messenger of Allah, is there any of them within me?" He replied: "All of them are within you, O Abu Bakr, and the most beloved of them to Allah the Exalted is generosity."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "I saw a scale lowered from the heavens. I was placed in one pan and my community was placed in the other pan, and I outweighed them. Then Abu Bakr was placed in a pan and my community was brought and placed in the other pan, and he outweighed them."

Despite all this, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was so utterly absorbed in God, the Exalted, that his heart had no room for intimate friendship with anyone else. He said: "If I were to take a close friend from among people, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend. However, your companion is the close friend of God, the Exalted," meaning himself.

Conclusion of the Book with Scattered Words Concerning Love, from which benefit is derived.

Sufyan said: Love is following the Messenger of God, peace be upon him.

Others have said: it is the persistence of remembrance. Others have said: it is preferring the Beloved. Some have said: it is aversion to remaining in this world. All of this points to the fruits of love, but as for the essence of love itself, they have not addressed it.

Some have said: Love is a reality from the Beloved that overwhelms hearts from comprehending it, and tongues are incapable of expressing it.
Al-Junayd said: God, exalted is He, has made love a sanctuary forbidden to the one who seeks recompense. And he said: Any love that exists for a reward—when the reward vanishes, the love vanishes.

Dhul-Nun said: Say to one who professes love for God: Beware lest you humble yourself before any but God.

It was said to al-Shibli, may God have mercy upon him: "Describe for us the Gnostic and the Lover?" He replied: "The Gnostic, if he speaks, perishes; and the Lover, if he remains silent, perishes." And al-Shibli, may God have mercy upon him, said:

O Noble Master, O Generous One,
Your love is firmly rooted in my innermost being.
O Remover of sleep from my eyelids,
You are fully aware of all that has passed over me.

And for others:

I marvel at one who says, "I remembered," when I have not forgotten to be reminded. My beloved, I have not forgotten. I die when I am reminded, and were it not for my good hope, I would not live. Then I live by longing. How often I live for you, and how often I die of yearning! I drank love as a cup, yet after cup the drinking is not exhausted, nor am I quenched. Would that his phantom were presented to my eyes! For if my sight fell short, I would be blind.

One day, Rabi'a al-Adawiyya said, "Who will guide us to our Beloved?" Her servant girl replied, "Our Beloved is with us, but the world has cut us off from Him."

And Ibn al-Jalla, may God have mercy on him, said: God revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him, "Verily, when I look into the secret of a servant and find therein no love for this world or the next, I fill him with My love and entrust him to My protection."

It is said that Sumnun once spoke of divine love, when suddenly a bird descended before him. It began pecking at the ground with its beak until blood flowed from it, and then it died.

Ibrahim ibn Adham said: "O my Lord, You know that Paradise weighs not even a mosquito's wing to me compared to the honor You have bestowed upon me through Your love, the intimacy You have granted me in remembrance of You, and the freedom You have afforded me to contemplate Your majesty."

Al-Sari, may God have mercy on him, said: Whoever loves God truly lives, and whoever inclines toward the world is bewildered. The fool goes out and returns for nothing, while the wise one is a seeker of his own faults.

It was said to Rabi'a: "How is your love for the Messenger, peace be upon him?" She replied: "By God, I love him with a profound love, yet the love of the Creator has preoccupied me from loving the created."

He, peace be upon him, was asked about the best of deeds, and he said: "Contentment with God, the Exalted, and love for Him."

Abu Yazid said: The lover does not love this world nor the Hereafter; he loves only his Lord from his Lord.

Al-Shibli said: Love is bewilderment in delight and perplexity in reverence.

It is said: Love is that you erase your trace from yourself, until nothing remains in you that returns from you to you.

It is said: Love is the heart drawing near to the Beloved through gladness and joy.

The spiritual elite have said: Love is the effacement of desires, the burning away of attributes and needs.

Sahl was asked about love, and he said: It is God turning the heart of His servant toward witnessing Him, after understanding what is intended from Him.

It is said: The dealings of the lover proceed through four stations: love, awe, modesty, and veneration. The most excellent of these are veneration and love, for these two stations will remain with the people of Paradise in Paradise, while the others will be lifted from them.

Haram ibn Hayyan said: When a believer truly knows his Lord, Mighty and Majestic is He, he loves Him. And when he loves Him, he turns his face toward Him. And when he tastes the sweetness of turning toward Him, he no longer looks upon this world with the eye of desire, nor does he look upon the Hereafter with the eye of weariness; for it grieves him in this world and gives him rest in the Hereafter.

Abdullah ibn Muhammad said: I heard a woman from among the devout worshippers say—while she was weeping, with tears flowing down her cheek—"By God, I have grown so weary of life that if I found death for sale, I would buy it out of longing for God, Exalted is He, and love for meeting Him." I said to her, "Are you so confident in your deeds?" She replied, "No. But because of my love for Him and my good opinion of Him, would He then punish me while I love Him?"

And God, Exalted is He, revealed to David, peace be upon him: "If those who turn away from Me knew how I await them, how gentle I am with them, and how I yearn for them to abandon their disobedience, they would die of longing for Me and their limbs would be severed out of love for Me. O David, this is My will concerning those who turn away from Me—so what then is My will concerning those who turn toward Me? O David, the servant is in greatest need of Me when he feels independent of Me, and I am most merciful to My servant when he turns away from Me, and My servant is most noble when he returns to Me."

Abu Khalid al-Saffar said: A prophet met an ascetic and said to him, "Indeed you, O community of worshippers, labor upon a matter that we, the community of prophets, do not labor upon. You labor upon fear and hope, while we labor upon love and longing."

And al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, said: God Most High revealed to David, peace be upon him: "O David, My remembrance is for those who remember, My Paradise is for the obedient, My visitation is for those who yearn, and I am exclusively for the lovers."

And God the Exalted revealed to Adam, peace be upon him: O Adam, whoever loves a beloved is truthful in his speech; whoever finds intimacy with his Beloved is pleased with his deeds; and whoever yearns for Him strives earnestly in his journey.

And the elect, may God have mercy on him, would strike his chest and say: "Oh, my longing for the One who sees me, yet I do not see Him."

Junayd, may God have mercy upon him, said: Jonah, peace be upon him, wept until he went blind, stood until he became bent, and prayed until he was seated. And he said: By Your might and majesty, if there were between me and You a sea of fire, I would plunge through it to reach You, out of my longing for You.

From Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God honor his countenance, who said: I asked the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, about his way, and he said: "Knowledge is the capital of my wealth, intellect is the foundation of my religion, love is my base, longing is my mount, remembrance of God is my companion, trust is my treasure, sorrow is my comrade, knowledge is my weapon, patience is my cloak, contentment is my gain, incapacity is my pride, asceticism is my craft, certainty is my strength, truthfulness is my intercessor, obedience is my beloved, striving is my character, and the coolness of my eyes is in prayer."

Dhun-Nun said: Glory be to Him who made spirits as marshaled hosts. Thus, the spirits of the knowers are majestic and holy, so they yearn for God, exalted be He. The spirits of the believers are spiritual, so they long for Paradise. And the spirits of the heedless are airy, so they incline toward this world.

And one of the masters said: I saw on Mount Lukam a man of dark complexion and frail body, leaping from rock to rock and saying:

Longing and passion have made me as you see.

It is said that longing is a fire of God, which He kindles in the hearts of His chosen friends, so that it may burn away with it whatever is in their hearts of passing thoughts, desires, incidental concerns, and worldly needs. This measure is sufficient for explaining love, intimate communion, longing, and contentment. Let us therefore confine ourselves to it, and God is the Granter of success to what is correct.

Here ends the Book of Love, Longing, and Intimate Communion. It will be followed by the Book of Intention, Sincerity, and Truthfulness.

[22] The hadith: That he, peace be upon him, did not see God, the Exalted, on the Night of Ascension. In the *Sahih*: This is what the author authenticated. It is the statement of A'ishah, for in the two *Sahihs* she said: Whoever tells you that Muhammad saw his Lord has lied. And Muslim has from the hadith of Abu Dharr: I asked the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: Did you see your Lord? He said: He is Light; how could I see Him? And Ibn Abbas and most scholars held the affirmation of his seeing Him. And A'ishah did not narrate that from the Prophet, peace be upon him. And the hadith of Abu Dharr: Ahmad said about it: I have always considered it problematic.

He said: Happiness, all happiness, is a long life in obedience to God. And the father of al-Muttalib is Abdullah ibn Hatif, and his companionship is disputed. And Ahmad has from the hadith of Jabir: From the happiness of a person is that his life is long and God grants him repentance. And al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Bakrah: A man said: O Messenger of God, which people are best? He said: He whose life is long and his deeds are good. He said: This hadith is hasan sahih.
