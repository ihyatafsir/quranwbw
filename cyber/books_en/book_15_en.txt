The Book of Etiquette in Companionship, Brotherhood, Companionship, and Social Interaction with Various Classes of Creation

This is the fifth book of the second quarter of the "Quarter of Customs" from the books of "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who has immersed the chosen among His servants with the subtleties of special distinction, in grace and favor, and has united their hearts, so that by His bounty they have become brothers. He has removed rancor from their breasts, so they remain in this world as sincere friends and companions, and in the Hereafter as close associates and intimates. And blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, the Chosen One, and upon his family and companions, who followed him and emulated him in word, deed, justice, and excellence.

Now then: Mutual love for the sake of God Almighty and brotherhood in His religion are among the most excellent acts of drawing near [to Him] and the most subtle of what is gained from acts of obedience within the course of customary practices. They have conditions by which those who keep company join the ranks of those who love each other for the sake of God Almighty. And they have rights; by observing them, brotherhood is purified from the impurities of discord and the whisperings of Satan. By fulfilling its rights, one draws near to God in closeness, and by preserving them, the highest degrees are attained.

We shall elucidate the objectives of this book in three chapters:

Chapter One: On the virtue of affection and brotherhood for the sake of God Almighty, its conditions, its degrees, and its benefits.
Chapter Two: On the rights of companionship, its etiquettes, its reality, and its necessities.
Chapter Three: On the rights of the fellow Muslim, kinship, neighbors, and those under one's authority, and the manner of social interaction with those bound by these ties.

**Chapter One: On the Virtue of Affection and Brotherhood, Its Conditions, Degrees, and Benefits**

**The Virtue of Affection and Brotherhood**

Know that affection is the fruit of good character, and disunity is the fruit of bad character. Thus, good character necessitates mutual love, affection, and harmony, while bad character yields mutual hatred, envy, and turning away from one another. Whenever the source is praiseworthy, the fruit is praiseworthy.

The virtue of good character in the religion is not hidden. It is that with which God, glorified be He, praised His Prophet, peace be upon him, when He said: "And indeed, you are of a great moral character" (Quran 68:4). And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The most common thing that admits people into Paradise is piety towards God and good character." (Hadith: "The first thing that admits to Paradise is piety towards God and good character." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, who said it has a sound chain of transmission, as previously mentioned.)

And Usamah ibn Sharik said: We asked, "O Messenger of God, what is the best thing given to a person?" He said, "Good character." (Hadith: Usamah ibn Sharik: "O Messenger of God, what is the best thing given to a person?" He said, "Good character." Reported by Ibn Majah with a sound chain.)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I was sent to perfect noble character." (Hadith: "I was sent to perfect noble character." Reported by Ahmad, al-Bayhaqi, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The heaviest thing to be placed in the Scale [on the Day of Judgment] is good character." (Hadith: "The heaviest thing to be placed in the Scale is good character." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu al-Darda', who said it is *hasan sahih* [good and sound].)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God does not beautify the creation and character of a person and then cast him into the Fire." (Hadith: "God does not beautify the creation and character of a person and then cast him into the Fire." Reported by Ibn 'Adi and al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and in *al-Awsat*, and al-Bayhaqi in *Shu'ab al-Imān* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Ibn 'Adi said there is some obscurity in its chain.)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O Abu Hurayrah, adhere to good character." Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said, "And what is good character, O Messenger of God?" He said, "That you join ties with whoever severs them from you, that you pardon whoever wrongs you, and that you give to whoever deprives you." (Hadith: "O Abu Hurayrah, adhere to good character." He said, "And what is good character?" He said, "That you join ties with whoever severs them from you, that you pardon whoever wrongs you, and that you give to whoever deprives you." Reported by al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of al-Hasan from Abu Hurayrah, though he did not hear it directly from him.)

It is not hidden that the fruit of good character is affection and the removal of estrangement. Whenever the source is good, the fruit is good. How could it be otherwise, when praise for affection itself—especially when the bond is piety, religion, and love for God—has come in sufficient and convincing verses, reports, and traditions?

God Almighty said, manifesting His great favor upon creation with the blessing of affection: "If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but God united them." (Quran 8:63) And He said: "So you became brothers by His grace." (Quran 3:103) meaning, through affection. Then He censured disunity and warned against it, saying, the Almighty: "And hold firmly to the rope of God all together and do not become divided, that you may be guided." (Quran 3:103)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The closest of you to me in seating are the best of you in character, those who are accommodating, who show affection and are shown affection." (Hadith: "The closest of you to me in seating are the best of you in character, those who are accommodating, who show affection and are shown affection." Reported by al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* from the narration of Jabir with a weak chain.)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The believer is affectionate and easily befriended. There is no good in one who does not show affection nor is shown affection." (Hadith:

The believer is sociable and well-liked, and there is no good in one who neither befriends nor is befriended. This was narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabarani from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd, and by al-Hakim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who authenticated it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said in praise of brotherhood in religion: "Whomever Allah intends good for, He provides with a righteous companion who reminds him if he forgets and aids him if he remembers." There is a narration: "Whomever Allah intends good for, He provides with a righteous brother who reminds him if he forgets and aids him if he remembers," though this wording is uncommon. It is well-known that this refers to a ruler. Abu Dawud narrated from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "When Allah intends good for a ruler, He appoints for him a sincere advisor who reminds him if he forgets and aids him if he remembers." Ibn 'Adi weakened this hadith. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami reported in *The Etiquettes of Companionship* from the hadith of 'Ali: "Part of a person's happiness is to have righteous brothers." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The likeness of two brothers when they meet is that of two hands, one washing the other. Never do two believers meet but that Allah benefits one of them through the other." The hadith, "The likeness of two brothers when they meet is that of two hands, one washing the other," was narrated by al-Sulami in *The Etiquettes of Companionship* and Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of Anas, but in its chain is Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ghalib al-Bahili, who is a liar. It is from the saying of Salman al-Farisi in the first of the *Hizbiyyat*. And he, peace be upon him, said, encouraging brotherhood for Allah's sake: "Whoever takes a brother for the sake of Allah, Allah will elevate him a degree in Paradise which he cannot attain by any of his deeds." The hadith, "Whoever takes a brother for the sake of Allah Almighty, Allah will elevate him a degree in Paradise which he cannot attain by any of his deeds," was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *The Book of Brothers* from the hadith of Anas: "No servant takes a brother for the sake of Allah but that Allah creates for him a degree in Paradise," though its chain is weak. Abu Idris al-Khawlani said to Mu'adh, "I love you for the sake of Allah." He replied, "Be glad, then be glad again, for I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'On the Day of Resurrection, chairs will be set up for a group of people around the Throne. Their faces will be like the moon on the night of the full moon. People will be in terror, but they will not be terrified; people will fear, but they will not fear. They are the allies of Allah upon whom there is no fear, nor shall they grieve.' It was asked, 'Who are these, O Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'They are those who love one another for the sake of Allah Almighty.'" The hadith: Abu Idris al-Khawlani said to Mu'adh, "I love you for the sake of Allah." He said, "Be glad, then be glad again, for I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'On the Day of Resurrection, chairs will be set up for a group of people around the Throne...'" This was reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim in a lengthy hadith where Abu Idris said, "By Allah, I love you for the sake of Allah." He said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'Those who love one another for the majesty of Allah will be in the shade of His Throne on a day when there is no shade but His shade.'" Al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. It is in al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Muslim al-Khawlani from Mu'adh with the wording: "Those who love one another for My majesty, for them are pulpits of light, envied by the prophets and the martyrs." He said it is a good, authentic hadith. Ahmad narrated from the hadith of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari: "Allah has servants who are neither prophets nor martyrs, yet the prophets and martyrs envy them for their stations and nearness to Allah." The hadith states: "They loved one another for the sake of Allah and were sincere for His sake. Allah will place for them on the Day of Resurrection pulpits of light, making their faces light and their garments light. People will be in terror on the Day of Resurrection, but they will not be terrified. They are the allies of Allah upon whom there is no fear, nor shall they grieve." In its chain is Shahr ibn Hawshab, who is disputed. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated it and said in it: "Around the Throne are pulpits of light, upon which are people whose garments are light and whose faces are light. They are neither prophets nor martyrs, yet the prophets and martyrs envy them. They said, 'O Messenger of Allah, describe them for us.' He said, 'They are those who love one another for the sake of Allah, who sit together for the sake of Allah, and who visit one another for the sake of Allah.'" The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Around the Throne are pulpits of light, upon which are people whose garments are light and whose faces are light. They are neither prophets nor martyrs..." was reported by al-Nasa'i in his *Great Sunan*, and its narrators are trustworthy. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No two people love one another for the sake of Allah but that the more beloved of them to Allah is the one with the greater love for his companion." The hadith, "No two people love one another for the sake of Allah but that the more beloved of them to Allah is the one with the greater love for his companion," was reported by Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim from the hadith of Anas, and he said its chain is authentic. It is said that when two brothers in Allah are such that one has a higher station than the other, the other is raised with him to his station, and he is joined to him just as offspring are joined to their parents and family members to one another, for brotherhood acquired for Allah's sake is not less than the brotherhood of birth. Almighty Allah said: "And We will join them with their offspring," and "We did not wrong them at all." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Allah Almighty says: 'My love is deserved for those...'"

My love is assured for those who visit one another for My sake. My love is assured for those who love one another for My sake. My love is assured for those who give generously to one another for My sake. My love is assured for those who support one another for My sake. A Hadith states: Verily, Allah says: "My love is assured for those who visit one another for My sake, and My love is assured for those who love one another for My sake." This was narrated by Ahmad from the Hadith of 'Amr ibn 'Abasah and the Hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, and al-Hakim graded it authentic.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, Allah the Exalted will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where are those who loved one another for the sake of My Majesty? Today I shall shade them in My shade on a day when there is no shade except My shade.'" A Hadith states: "Indeed, Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where are those who loved one another for the sake of My Majesty? Today I shall shade them in My shade on a day when there is no shade except My shade.'" This was narrated by Muslim.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Seven are those whom Allah will shade in His shade on a day when there is no shade except His shade: a just ruler; a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the mosques, such that when he leaves it he does so only to return to it; two men who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting for that and parting for that; a man who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes overflow with tears; a man who is invited by a woman of beauty and status, but says, 'I fear Allah, the Exalted'; and a man who gives charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand spends." This is the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Seven are those whom Allah will shade in His shade on a day when there is no shade except His shade: a just ruler..." It is agreed upon from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah and has been mentioned previously.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No man visits another man out of longing for him and desire to meet him for the sake of Allah, except that an angel from His creation calls out to him: 'You are good, and your walk is good, and Paradise is made good for you.'" A Hadith states: "No man visits another man for the sake of Allah, except that an angel from behind him calls out: 'You are good, and Paradise is made good for you.'" This was narrated by Ibn 'Adi from the Hadith of Anas, without the phrase "out of longing for him and desire to meet him." And by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever visits a sick person or visits a brother for the sake of Allah, a caller from the heaven calls out: 'You are good, and your walk is good, and you have taken an abode in Paradise.'" Al-Tirmidhi said it is *gharib*.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A man visited a brother of his for the sake of Allah, so Allah stationed an angel for him. The angel said: 'Where are you intending to go?' He said: 'I intend to visit my brother, so-and-so.' He said: 'For a need you have with him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'For kinship between you and him?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'For a favor he has done for you?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Then for what?' He said: 'I love him for the sake of Allah.' He said: 'Then Allah has sent me to you to inform you that He loves you for your love of Him, and He has made Paradise obligatory for you.'" This Hadith, "A man visited a brother of his for the sake of Allah, so Allah stationed an angel for him..." was narrated by Muslim from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The firmest bond of faith is love for the sake of Allah and hatred for the sake of Allah." The Hadith, "The firmest bond of faith is love for the sake of Allah and hatred for the sake of Allah," was narrated by Ahmad from the Hadith of al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, and in its chain is Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, who is disputed. And al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* from the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain. Therefore, a man must have enemies whom he hates for the sake of Allah, just as he has friends and brothers whom he loves for the sake of Allah.

And it is related that Allah the Exalted revealed to a prophet among the prophets: "As for your asceticism in the world, you have hastened your rest. And as for your devotion to Me, you have sought honor through Me. But have you made an enemy for an enemy of Mine? Or have you befriended for a friend of Mine?"

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O Allah, do not grant a transgressor a favor from me, such that You grant him love for me." The Hadith, "O Allah, do not grant a transgressor a favor from me..." has been mentioned previously in the preceding book.

And it is related that Allah the Exalted revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him: "If you were to worship Me with the worship of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, but without love for the sake of Allah and hatred for the sake of Allah, that would avail you nothing." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Endear yourselves to Allah by hating the people of disobedience. Draw near to Allah by distancing yourselves from them. Seek the pleasure of Allah through their displeasure." They said: "O Spirit of Allah, with whom then should we sit?" He said: "Sit with those whose sight reminds you of Allah, whose speech increases your deeds, and whose works make you yearn for the Hereafter."

And it is related in the previous reports that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "O son of 'Imran, be vigilant and seek out for yourself brothers. Every companion and friend who does not aid you in what pleases Me is an enemy to you."

And Allah the Exalted revealed to David, peace be upon him, saying: "O David, why do I see you isolated and alone?" He said: "My God, I have diminished creation for Your sake." He said: "O David, be vigilant and seek out for yourself companions. Every companion who does not agree with you in what pleases Me, do not accompany him, for he is an enemy to you; he hardens your heart and distances you from Me."

And in the reports of David, peace be upon him, it is said that he said: "O Lord, how can I make all people love me and be safe in what is between You and me?" He said: "Interact with people according to their manners, and be excellent in what is between Me and you." And in some reports: "Interact with the people of the world according to the manners of the world, and interact with the people of the Hereafter according to the manners of the Hereafter."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said...

The most beloved of you to Allah are those who foster affection and are affectionately received, and the most detested of you to Allah are the slanderers who spread tales and cause division between brothers. (Hadith: "The most beloved of you to Allah are those who foster affection..." This was narrated by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat and Al-Saghir from Abu Huraira with a weak chain.)

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, Allah has an angel, half of whom is fire and half of whom is snow, who says: 'O Allah, just as You have joined snow and fire, so join the hearts of Your righteous servants.'" (Hadith: "Verily, Allah has an angel..." This was narrated by Abu Al-Shaykh and Ibn Hibban in Kitab Al-'Azamah from Mu'adh ibn Jabal and Al-'Irbad ibn Sariyah with a weak chain.)

And he also said: "No servant befriends a brother for the sake of Allah except that Allah creates for him a degree in Paradise." (Hadith: "No servant befriends a brother for the sake of Allah..." This was narrated by Ibn Abi Al-Dunya in Kitab Al-Ikhwan from Anas, and it has preceded.)

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Those who love one another for the sake of Allah are upon a pillar of red ruby. At the top of the pillar are seventy thousand chambers; they look out upon the people of Paradise. Their beauty illuminates for the people of Paradise as the sun illuminates for the people of the world. So the people of Paradise say: 'Let us go and look upon those who love one another for the sake of Allah.' Their beauty illuminates for the people of Paradise as the sun illuminates for them. They wear garments of green silk, and written upon their foreheads is: 'Those who love for the sake of Allah.'" (Hadith: "Those who love one another for the sake of Allah are upon a pillar..." This was narrated by Al-Hakim Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Nawadir from Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.)

Narrations:
Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Hold fast to brothers, for they are a provision in this world and the Hereafter. Have you not heard the statement of the people of the Fire: '...So we have no intercessors, nor a sincere friend'?" (Quran 26:100-101)

Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, said: "By Allah, if I were to fast the day without breaking it, and stand in prayer the night without sleeping, and spend my wealth heap after heap in the way of Allah, then die the day I die, but there is not in my heart love for the people of obedience to Allah and hatred for the people of disobedience to Allah, that would avail me nothing."

Ibn Al-Sammak said at his death: "O Allah, You know that when I disobeyed You, I loved those who obey You. Make that a means of nearness to You."

Al-Hasan said, on the contrary: "O son of Adam, let not the saying of one who says, 'A person is with whom he loves,' deceive you, for you will not attain the righteous except by their deeds. Indeed, the Jews and Christians love their prophets, but they are not with them." This is an indication that mere love, without conformity in some or all deeds, is of no benefit.

Al-Fudayl said in some of his discourses: "Here you are, wanting to dwell in Firdaws and be a neighbor to the Most Merciful in His abode, with the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. By what deed have you done it? By what desire have you abandoned it? By what anger have you swallowed? By what kinship have you severed and then joined? By what slip of your brother have you forgiven? By what relative have you distanced for the sake of Allah? By what distant one have you drawn near for the sake of Allah?"

And it is narrated that Allah the Exalted revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "Have you ever done any deed for Me?" He said: "My God, I have prayed for You, fasted, given charity, and paid Zakat." He said: "Indeed, prayer is your proof, fasting is your shield, charity is your shade, and Zakat is your light. So which deed have you done for Me?" Moses said: "My God, guide me to a deed that is for You." He said: "O Moses, have you ever befriended for My sake a friend? And have you ever shown enmity for My sake an enemy?" Thus Moses knew that the best of deeds is love for the sake of Allah and hatred for the sake of Allah.

Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "If a man were to stand between the Corner (of the Ka'bah) and the Station (of Abraham) for seventy years, Allah would resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection with those whom he loves."

Al-Hasan, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Severing ties with the immoral is a means of nearness to Allah."

A man said to Muhammad ibn Wasil: "I love you for the sake of Allah." He said: "You love me? For what have you loved me?" Then he turned his face and said: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from loving for Your sake while You are displeased with me."

A man visited Dawud Al-Ta'i and said to him: "What is your need?" He said: "To visit you." He said: "As for you, you have done good by visiting. But look what befalls me. If it is said to me: 'Who are you, that you are visited? Are you among the ascetics?' No, by Allah. 'Are you among the worshippers?' No, by Allah. 'Are you among the righteous?' No, by Allah." Then he began to rebuke himself, saying: "In my youth I was immoral, and when I grew old I became a hypocrite. By Allah, the hypocrite is worse than the immoral."

'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "If one of you finds affection from his brother, let him hold fast to it, for it is rarely attained."

Mujahid said: "When those who love for the sake of Allah meet and smile at one another, their sins fall away as leaves fall from a tree in winter when they dry."

Al-Fudayl said: "A man looking at the face of his brother with affection and mercy is an act of worship." This clarifies the meaning of brotherhood for the sake of Allah and distinguishes it from other types.

Brotherhood in this world, know that love for the sake of God and hatred for the sake of God is a profound matter, and the veil over it is lifted only by what we mention: that companionship is divided into that which occurs by coincidence—such as companionship due to proximity, or due to gathering in a school, a market, at the door of a ruler, or during travels—and into that which arises by choice and intent, which is what we wish to clarify. For brotherhood in religion undoubtedly falls into this latter category, as there is no reward except for voluntary actions, and no encouragement except for them.

Companionship is an expression for sitting together and neighboring. A person does not intend these with another except if he loves him, for one avoids and distances from the unloved, and does not seek to associate with him. As for the one who loves, he either loves for the beloved's own sake—not to attain through him a beloved or objective beyond him—or he loves to attain through him an objective. That objective is either confined to this world and its shares, or pertains to the Hereafter, or pertains to God Almighty. These are four categories.

As for the first category, which is loving a person for his own self, that is possible. It is that he is beloved to you in his essence, in the sense that you take delight in seeing him, knowing him, and observing his character due to your admiration for him. For every beautiful thing is delightful to one who perceives its beauty, and every delightful thing is beloved. Delight follows admiration, and admiration follows suitability, compatibility, and harmony between temperaments. Then, that which is admired is either the outward form—meaning good physical creation—or the inward form—meaning perfection of intellect and goodness of character. Goodness of character inevitably entails good actions, and perfection of intellect entails abundance of knowledge. All of that is admired by sound nature and upright intellect, and everything admired is thereby delightful and beloved.

Indeed, in the harmony of hearts there is a matter more profound than this. For affection may become firmly established between two persons without any charm in appearance or goodness in character and morals, but due to a suitability that necessitates intimacy and harmony. For the likeness of a thing is naturally drawn to it, and inward matters are subtle, having delicate causes beyond human power to perceive. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, alluded to this when he said: "Souls are conscripted soldiers; those who recognize each other unite, and those who are strangers differ." The narration: "Souls are conscripted soldiers; those who recognize each other unite, and those who are strangers differ" was reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, and by al-Bukhari as a suspended report from the hadith of 'A'ishah. Thus, being strangers is the result of disparity, and harmony is the result of proportionality, which he expressed as 'recognizing each other.' In some wordings: "Souls are conscripted soldiers; they meet and recognize each other in the air." The narration: "Souls meet and recognize each other in the air" was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat with a weak chain from the hadith of 'Ali: "Verily, souls in the air are conscripted soldiers; they meet and recognize each other." Some scholars alluded to this by saying: "God Almighty created the souls and split them into groups, and circulated them around the Throne. So any two souls from two groups that recognized each other there, when they meet in this world, they connect." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, the souls of the believers meet over a day's journey, even if they have never seen each other." The narration: "Verily, the souls of the believers meet over a day's journey, even if they have never seen each other" was reported by Ahmad from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with the wording "we meet," and one of them said—and in it is Ibn Lahi'ah from Diraj—and it is narrated: "A woman in Mecca used to make women laugh... [the anecdote continues about two women from Mecca and Medina meeting and recognizing each other's spirits, leading 'A'ishah to cite the hadith about souls]." Al-Hasan ibn Sufyan reported it in his Musnad with the story via a sound chain, and the hadith of 'A'ishah is in al-Bukhari as a suspended, brief report. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in Shu'ab al-Iman as a statement attributed to Ibn Mas'ud, and the author of al-Firdaws mentioned it from the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal, though his son did not include it in the Musnad: "I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'Souls are conscripted soldiers...'"

The truth in this is that observation and experience testify to harmony when there is proportionality. Proportionality in temperaments and morals, inwardly and outwardly, is a comprehensible matter. As for the causes that necessitated that suitability, they are beyond human power to perceive. The utmost conjecture of an astrologer is to say: if one's ascendant is in sextile or trine to another's ascendant, then this indicates harmony and affection. Thus, proportionality and mutual love necessitate harmony and affection.

If it were in direct opposition or quadrature, it would necessitate mutual aversion and enmity. Even if this were true in the course of God's established way in the creation of the heavens and the earth, the difficulty in it is greater than the difficulty in the principle of affinity itself. Therefore, there is no point in delving into what has not had its secret unveiled to mankind, for we have been given but little knowledge. Sufficient for us in believing this is experience and observation, for reports have come concerning it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If a believer were to enter a gathering containing one hundred hypocrites and one [believer], he would come and sit next to him. And if a hypocrite were to enter a gathering containing one hundred believers and one [hypocrite], he would come and sit next to him." This indicates that the likeness of a thing is naturally drawn to its like, even if it is not consciously aware of it.

Malik ibn Dinar used to say: "Two people do not agree in ten [matters] except that one of them possesses a characteristic of the other." And the kinds of people are like the kinds of birds. Two types of birds do not agree in flight except that there is an affinity between them. He said: "One day he saw a crow with a dove and was astonished at that, saying, 'They have agreed, yet they are not of the same form.' Then they flew, and lo, they were both lame. He said, 'From this point they agreed.'" Therefore, some of the wise have said: "Every person feels at ease with his own likeness, just as every bird flies with its own kind. And if two people accompany each other for a period of time and do not resemble each other in condition, they must inevitably part." This is a subtle meaning which poets have discerned, to the point that one of them said, and a speaker said: "How did you two part?" I said a word of fairness: "He was not of my form, so I parted from him." And people are forms and kinds.

Thus, it has become clear from this that a person may love for the sake of the beloved's own essence, not for a benefit to be attained from him in the present or the future, but merely due to congeniality and affinity in inner dispositions and hidden character traits. Into this category falls the love of beauty, if the intended purpose is not the fulfillment of carnal desire, for beautiful forms are pleasing in themselves. Even if the root of desire is absent, one still takes pleasure in looking at fruits, lights, flowers, apples tinged with red, flowing water, and greenery, with no purpose other than the sight itself. This love does not enter into the love for God; rather, it is a natural love and a desire of the soul. This can be conceived even from one who does not believe in God. However, if a blameworthy purpose becomes connected to it, it becomes blameworthy, like loving a beautiful form to fulfill carnal desire where it is not permissible to fulfill it. If no blameworthy purpose is connected to it, it is permissible, not described as praiseworthy or blameworthy, for love is either praiseworthy, blameworthy, or permissible—neither praised nor blamed.

The second category is that he loves him to attain from his essence something other than his essence, so he becomes a means to something else beloved. The means to the beloved is beloved. Whatever is obligatory for the sake of another, that other is the truly beloved one, but the path to the beloved is beloved. For this reason, people love gold and silver, having no desire in them intrinsically, for they are not eaten nor worn, but they are a means to beloved things. Among people are those who love as one loves gold and silver, in that they are a means to the objective, for one attains through them status, wealth, or knowledge. Just as a man loves a ruler for benefiting from his wealth or status, and loves his close associates for improving his standing with him and smoothing his affair in his heart. If the benefit sought through the means is confined to this world, his love is not from the category of love for the sake of God. Even if the benefit is not confined to this world, but he intends by it only this world—like the love of a student for his teacher—it is also outside the love for God, for he only loves him to acquire knowledge for himself. His beloved is the knowledge. If he does not intend the knowledge to draw nearer to God, but to attain by it status, wealth, and acceptance among people, then his beloved is the status and acceptance, and knowledge is a means to it, and the teacher is a means to the knowledge. There is in none of that any love for God, for all of that can be conceived from one who does not believe in God Almighty at all. This then also divides into blameworthy and permissible. If the intention is to use it to reach blameworthy objectives, such as overpowering peers, seizing the wealth of orphans, or oppressing subjects through a judgeship or other position, then the love is blameworthy. If the intention is to use it to reach permissible objectives, then the means takes its ruling and description from the objective it is used to reach, for it is subordinate to it and not established independently.

The third category is that he loves him not for his own essence, but for the sake of another, and that other does not relate to his share of worldly interests, but rather relates to his share in the Hereafter. This is also clear with no obscurity. That is like one who loves his teacher and his shaykh because through him he attains the acquisition of knowledge and the improvement of deeds, and his objective from knowledge and deeds is success in the Hereafter. This is among the category of those who love for the sake of God. Likewise, one who loves his student because he imbibes knowledge from him, attains through him the rank of teaching, and is elevated by him to a station of honor in the kingdom of heaven, as Jesus said...

He who possesses knowledge, acts upon it, and teaches it is called great in the kingdom of heaven. Learning cannot be achieved except through a learner; thus, the learner is an instrument for attaining this perfection. If one loves him because he is an instrument for him—since he has made his heart a field for cultivating that which is the cause of his elevation to the rank of honor in the kingdom of heaven—then he loves for the sake of God. Indeed, one who gives charity from his wealth for God’s sake, gathers guests, and prepares delicious, exquisite food for them to draw nearer to God, and then finds a cook for his excellent skill in cooking, is among those who love for the sake of God. Similarly, if one loves someone who undertakes to deliver his charity to the deserving, he has loved him for the sake of God. Nay, we go beyond this and say: If one loves someone who serves him personally by washing his clothes, sweeping his house, and cooking his food, thereby freeing him for knowledge or worship, and his intention in employing him for these tasks is to have leisure for devotion, then he loves for the sake of God. Nay, we go further and say: If one loves someone who provides for him from his wealth, assists him with clothing, food, shelter, and all the worldly needs he seeks, and his intention in all of this is to have leisure for knowledge and deeds that draw near to God, then he loves for the sake of God. Indeed, groups among the early generations were supported by people of wealth, and both the supporter and the supported were among those who love one another for the sake of God. Nay, we go beyond this and say: One who marries a righteous woman to guard himself from the whispers of Satan, to protect his religion through her, or to have a righteous child from her who will pray for him, and loves his wife because she is an instrument for these religious purposes, loves for the sake of God. For this reason, reports have come about the abundance of reward and recompense for spending on one’s family—even the morsel a man places in his wife’s mouth. Indeed, we say: Everyone who is immersed in the love of God, the love of His pleasure, and the love of meeting Him in the Abode of the Hereafter, if he loves another, he loves for the sake of God, because it is inconceivable that he would love anything except for its conformity to what is beloved to him, which is the pleasure of God Almighty. Nay, I go beyond this and say: If two loves are combined in his heart—the love of God and the love of the world—and they converge in a single person for two meanings together, such that he is suitable as a means to both God and the world, and one loves him for his suitability for both matters, then he is among those who love for the sake of God. Like one who loves his teacher who teaches him religion and suffices him in worldly matters through financial assistance, and loves him because his nature seeks comfort in this world and happiness in the Hereafter, and he is a means to both, then he loves for the sake of God. It is not a condition of loving God that one must not love any immediate benefit whatsoever, for the supplication that the prophets—peace and blessings of God be upon them—were commanded to make includes both this world and the Hereafter. Among these is their saying: “Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter.” And Jesus—peace be upon him—said in his supplication: “O God, do not let my enemy gloat over me, nor sadden my friend, nor make my trial in my religion, nor make the world my greatest concern.” Thus, warding off the gloating of enemies is among worldly benefits, and he did not say, “nor make the world any concern of mine at all,” but rather said, “do not make it my greatest concern.” And our Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—said in his supplication: “O God, I ask You for mercy through which I may attain the honor of Your grace in this world and the Hereafter.” And he said: “O God, protect me from the trials of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter.” In summary, if loving happiness in the Hereafter is not contradictory to loving God Almighty, then how can loving safety, health, sufficiency, and honor in this world be contradictory to loving God? This world and the Hereafter are expressions of two states, one nearer than the other. How can it be conceived that a person loves the benefits of his soul tomorrow but does not love them today? He only loves them tomorrow because tomorrow will become the present state, so the present state must inevitably be desired as well. However, immediate benefits are divided into those that oppose the benefits of the Hereafter and prevent them—these are what the prophets and the righteous avoided and commanded avoidance of—and those that do not oppose, which they did not abstain from, such as lawful marriage, eating permissible food, and the like. As for what opposes the benefits of the Hereafter, it is right for the wise to dislike it and not love it—I mean to dislike it with his intellect, not his nature—just as one would dislike partaking of delicious food from a king knowing that if he were to approach it, his hand would be cut off or his neck severed.

It means that delicious food becomes such that one would not naturally desire it nor find it pleasing if eaten, for that is impossible. Rather, it is on the meaning that one's intellect deters him from proceeding to eat it, and there arises in him an aversion to the harm associated with it. The intended meaning from this is that if one loved his teacher because he supports him and teaches him, or his student because he learns from him and serves him—one being an immediate benefit and the other a deferred one—he would be among those who love each other for the sake of God. But on one condition: that if, for example, knowledge were withheld from him or it became impossible to attain it from him, his love would diminish because of it. The amount that diminishes due to its loss is for God Almighty, and for that amount he has the reward of love for the sake of God. It is not strange that your love for a person intensifies for a set of purposes connected to you through him. If some of them are prevented, your love diminishes, and if they increase, love increases. Your love for gold is not like your love for silver if their quantities are equal, because gold leads to purposes that are more than what silver leads to. Therefore, love increases with the increase of purpose, and it is not impossible for worldly and otherworldly purposes to combine. This falls within the totality of love for God alone, in that every love whose existence would be inconceivable were it not for faith in God and the Last Day is a love for the sake of God. Likewise, every increase in love that would not have occurred without faith in God—that increase is from love for the sake of God. This, though subtle, is precious. Al-Jurayri said: "People in the first century dealt with one another through religion until religion became scarce. They dealt in the second century through fidelity until fidelity vanished. In the third, through chivalry until chivalry vanished, and nothing remained except fear and desire." The fourth category is to love for God and in God, not to attain from him knowledge or action, nor to use him as a means to something beyond his essence. This is the highest degree, the most subtle and profound. This category is also possible, for among the effects of overwhelming love is that it extends from the beloved to everyone connected to the beloved and suited to him, even remotely. Thus, whoever loves a person intensely loves that person's beloved, loves his beloved, loves whoever serves the one who serves him, loves whoever praises his beloved, and loves whoever hastens to please his beloved. So much so that Baqiyyah ibn al-Walid said: "When a believer loves a believer, he loves his dog." It is as he said, and experience in the states of lovers testifies to it, and the poetry of the poets indicates it. Therefore, one preserves the garment of the beloved and conceals it as a memento from him, and loves his house, his neighborhood, and his neighbors. So much so that Majnun Bani 'Amir said: "I pass by the dwellings, the dwellings of Layla; I kiss this wall and that wall. It is not love for the dwellings that has enthralled my heart, but love for the one who inhabited the dwellings." Therefore, observation and experience indicate that love extends from the essence of the beloved to what surrounds him, is connected to his causes, and is suited to him, even remotely. But that is from the property of excessive love; the root love alone is insufficient for it. The expansion of love in its extension from the beloved to what encompasses him, surrounds him, and is connected to his causes is according to the excess and strength of the love. Likewise, love for God, glorified and exalted, when it becomes strong and overwhelms the heart and dominates it until it reaches the limit of heedlessness, extends to every existent other than Him, for every existent other than Him is an effect from the effects of His power. Whoever loves a person loves his craft, his handwriting, and all his actions. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when the first fruits were brought to him, would rub them on his eyes, honor them, and say: "It is close in time to our Lord." A narration states: "When the first fruits were brought to him, he would rub them on his eyes, honor them, and say: 'It is close in time to its Lord.'" Al-Tabarani transmitted it in *Al-Saghir* from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, and Abu Dawud in *Al-Marasil* and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Da'awat* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "and honor them, etc." He said it is not well-known. The narration of Abu Hurayrah regarding the first fruits is found with the rest of the Sunan compilers without "rubbing his eyes with them" and what follows. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan Sahih." Love for God Almighty is sometimes due to sincere hope in His promises and what is expected in the Hereafter of His bliss, sometimes due to what has preceded from His favors and various blessings, and sometimes for His Essence, not for any other reason. This is the most subtle form of love and the highest. Its verification will come, God willing, in the Book of Love from the Quarter of the Salvations. However love for God occurs, when it becomes strong, it extends to everything connected to Him by any kind of connection, until it extends to what is in itself painful and disliked. But excessive love weakens the sensation of pain, and the joy in the action of the Beloved and His intention in causing pain overwhelms the perception of pain. That is like rejoicing in a strike from the Beloved or a pinch that contains a kind of reproach, for the strength of love arouses a joy that overwhelms the perception of pain within it. The love for God has reached with some people such that they said: "We do not differentiate between tribulation and blessing, for all is from God."

We rejoice only in what pleases Him, to the extent that one of them said, "I do not desire to attain God's forgiveness through disobedience to God." Sumnun said, "I have no share in anything other than You, so test me as You will." The verification of this will come in the Book of Love. The point is that love for God, when it becomes strong, yields love for everyone who fulfills the right of worshipping God, whether in knowledge or deed, and yields love for everyone who possesses a quality pleasing to God, be it a good character or adherence to the manners of the Sacred Law. There is no lover of the Hereafter and lover of God who, upon hearing of the state of two men—one a learned worshipper and the other an ignorant sinner—does not find in himself an inclination toward the learned worshipper. Then that inclination weakens or strengthens according to the weakness or strength of his faith and according to the weakness or strength of his love for God. This inclination exists even if both are absent from him, such that he knows no good or harm will reach him from them in this world or the next. That inclination is love for God's sake and for God, without any personal gain, for he loves him only because God loves him, because he is pleasing to God the Exalted, because he loves God the Exalted, and because he is occupied with the worship of God the Exalted. However, when it is weak, no effect appears, and no reward or recompense is manifested by it. When it becomes strong, it compels loyalty, support, and defense with one's soul, wealth, and tongue. People vary in this according to their variation in love for God, Mighty and Majestic. If love were confined to a benefit obtained from the beloved, either immediately or ultimately, love for the deceased among the scholars, worshippers, Companions, Followers, and even the extinct prophets—may God's prayers and peace be upon them—would be inconceivable. Yet love for all of them is concealed in the heart of every religious Muslim. This becomes evident through his anger when their enemies disparage any one of them and his joy when they are praised and their virtues mentioned. All of that is love for God, for they are the chosen servants of God. Whoever loves a king or a beautiful person loves his chosen ones and servants and loves those who love him. However, love is tested by confronting the soul's desires, and it may prevail to the extent that no share remains for the soul except in what is the share of the Beloved. This is alluded to in the saying of one who said, "I desire union with Him, but He desires my abandonment; so I leave what I desire for what He desires," and in the saying of another, "What is pain to a wound if it pleases You?" Love may also be such that one forsakes some desires but not others, like one whose soul permits him to share half, a third, or a tenth of his wealth with his beloved. The measures of wealth are the scales of love, for the degree of the beloved is not known except by what is forsaken for his sake. Whoever is completely absorbed in love, such that it occupies his entire heart, leaves for himself nothing else, like Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, for he left for himself neither family nor wealth. He surrendered his daughter, who was the apple of his eye, and gave all his wealth. Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, reported: While the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting, and Abu Bakr was with him wearing a cloak he had fastened over his chest with a pin, Gabriel, peace be upon him, descended and conveyed to him greetings from God, saying, "O Messenger of God, why do I see Abu Bakr wearing a cloak fastened over his chest with a pin?" He said, "He spent his wealth on me before the Conquest." He said, "Convey to him greetings from God and say, 'Is your Lord pleased with you in this poverty of yours, or displeased?'" The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, turned to Abu Bakr and said, "O Abu Bakr, this is Gabriel conveying greetings to you from God and saying, 'Is your Lord pleased with you in this poverty of yours, or displeased?'" Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, wept and said, "Upon my Lord would I be displeased? I am pleased with my Lord." The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: While the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting and Abu Bakr was with him wearing a cloak he had fastened over his chest with a pin, Gabriel descended and conveyed greetings from his Lord... Ibn Hibban and al-'Uqayli in al-Du'afa' transmitted it. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Mizan: It is false. It is concluded from this that whoever loves a scholar or a worshipper, or loves a person desiring knowledge or goodness, loves him for God's sake and for God, and for him therein is reward and recompense according to the strength of his love. This is the explanation of love for God's sake and its degrees, and through this, hatred for God's sake also becomes clear. But we shall increase its clarification. Know that everyone who loves for God's sake must necessarily hate for God's sake. For if you love a person because he is obedient to God and beloved to God, then if he disobeys, you must hate him because he is disobedient to God and detested by God. Whoever loves for a reason necessarily hates for its opposite. These two are concomitant; one cannot be separated from the other. This is consistent in love and hatred in customary matters. However, each of love and hatred is a hidden disease in the heart; it only seeps out when it prevails and seeps out through the appearance of the actions of lovers and haters in drawing near and keeping away, and in opposition and agreement. When it appears in action, it is called loyalty and enmity. Therefore...

God Almighty has said, "Have you taken a protector other than Me? And have you taken an enemy other than Me?" as we have transmitted. This is clear regarding one from whom you have witnessed nothing but acts of obedience, so you are able to love him, or from whom you have witnessed nothing but wickedness, transgression, and blameworthy character traits, so you are able to hate him. The difficulty arises when acts of obedience are mixed with acts of disobedience. You may ask: How can I combine hatred and love, when they are opposites? Similarly, their fruits—agreement and disagreement, friendship and enmity—are opposites. I say this is not contradictory in relation to God Almighty, just as it is not contradictory in human interests. Whenever qualities, some of which you love and some of which you hate, are combined in a single person, you love him from one aspect and hate him from another. For example, a beautiful but immoral wife, or an intelligent, dutiful child who is also corrupt: one loves him from one aspect and hates him from another, and one's state with him is between two states. If one were to have three sons—one intelligent and dutiful, another dull and disobedient, and another dull but dutiful or intelligent but disobedient—one would find oneself in three different states with them according to the disparity in their qualities. Similarly, your state should be, in relation to one in whom transgression predominates, one in whom obedience predominates, and one in whom both are combined, varied across three levels. This is by giving each attribute its due portion of hatred and love, turning away and turning towards, companionship and severance, and all other actions emanating from him. If you say: Every Muslim, his Islam is an act of obedience from him, so how can I hate him along with his Islam? I say: You love him for his Islam and hate him for his disobedience, and you are with him in a state which, if you compare it to the state of an unbeliever or a transgressor, you would perceive a distinction between them. That distinction is love for Islam, fulfilling its right, and assessing the crime against God's right and obedience to Him as you would assess a crime against your right and obedience to you. So, whoever agrees with you in one objective and disagrees with you in another, be with him in an intermediate state between restraint and openness, between turning towards and turning away, between showing affection to him and being aloof from him. Do not exaggerate in honoring him as you would exaggerate in honoring one who agrees with you in all your objectives, nor exaggerate in dishonoring him as you would exaggerate in dishonoring one who disagrees with you in all your objectives. Furthermore, this moderation sometimes inclines towards the side of dishonor when the crime predominates, and sometimes towards the side of courtesy and honor when agreement predominates. Thus it should be with one who obeys God Almighty and disobeys Him, exposing himself to His pleasure at one time and to His wrath at another. If you ask: In what ways can hatred be shown? I say: As for speech, sometimes by restraining the tongue from speaking and conversing with him, and at other times by belittling and using harsh speech. As for action, sometimes by ceasing to strive to assist him, and at other times by striving to harm him and spoil his objectives. Some of this is more severe than others, according to the degrees of wickedness and disobedience emanating from him. As for what resembles a slip about which it is known he is remorseful and upon which he does not persist, the preferable course regarding it is concealment and overlooking. As for that upon which he persists, be it a minor or major sin, if he is one with whom a strong bond of affection, companionship, and brotherhood has been established between you and him, that has another ruling, which will come later, and concerning which there is disagreement among the scholars. But if a strong bond of brotherhood and companionship has not been established, then it is necessary to show the effect of hatred, either by turning away and keeping distant from him and paying little attention to him, or by belittling and using harsh speech against him. The latter is more severe than turning away, and it is according to the gravity or lightness of the sin. Similarly, in action there are also two levels: one is cutting off help, kindness, and support from him, which is the lowest degree; and the other is striving to spoil his objectives against him, like the actions of hating enemies. This is necessary, but only in what spoils for him the path of disobedience. As for what has no effect on it, it is not an example. For instance, a man disobeys God by drinking wine, and he has proposed to a woman; if marriage to her were facilitated for him, he would be envied for her wealth, beauty, and status. However, that does not affect preventing him from drinking wine, nor does it incite or urge him towards it. If you are able to assist him to achieve his objective and purpose, and you are able to disrupt it so that his objective is lost, it is not for you to strive to disrupt it. As for assistance, if you were to abandon it to show anger at him for his wickedness, there is no harm, and it is not obligatory to abandon it. For perhaps you have an intention to be gentle in assisting him and to show compassion towards him so that he may believe in your affection and accept your advice; this is good, even if it is not apparent to you. But if you see that you should assist him in his objective to fulfill the right of his Islam, that is not prohibited; rather, it is best if his sin involves a crime against your right or the right of someone connected to you. Concerning this, the saying of God Almighty was revealed: "And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid]..." up to His saying: "...Do you not love that God should forgive you?" when Mistah ibn Uthatha spoke regarding the incident of the slander—the account of Mistah's speech in the slander and Abu Bakr's boycotting of him until "And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid]..." was revealed.

The verse is agreed upon from the narration of Aisha. Abu Bakr swore to withdraw his kindness from him, though he had been supporting him financially. Then the verse was revealed, despite the enormity of Mistah's sin—and what sin is greater than violating the sanctity of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and slandering someone like Aisha, may God be pleased with her? However, al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, was as one personally wronged by that incident. Yet, forgiving the wrongdoer and showing kindness to the one who mistreats you are among the traits of the truthful. Kindness is truly good when shown to one who has wronged you. But as for one who wrongs another and disobeys God thereby, your kindness to him is not good, for kindness to the oppressor is an injustice to the oppressed. The right of the oppressed is more deserving of consideration, and strengthening his heart by shunning the oppressor is more beloved to God than strengthening the heart of the oppressor. However, if you are the one wronged, what is best for you is forgiveness and pardon.

The paths of the predecessors differed regarding showing hatred toward people of sin, but they all agreed on showing hatred toward oppressors and innovators, and anyone who disobeys God with a sin that transgresses against others. As for one who disobeys God concerning himself, some looked upon all sinners with an eye of mercy, while others intensified their disapproval and chose abandonment. Ahmad ibn Hanbal would abandon prominent figures for the slightest word—he abandoned Yahya ibn Ma'in for saying, "I do not ask anyone for anything, and if the authorities brought me something, I would take it," and he abandoned al-Harith al-Muhasibi for his work refuting the Mu'tazilah, saying, "You inevitably present their doubts first and lead people to ponder them, then you refute them." He also abandoned Abu Thawr for his interpretation of the Prophet's saying, peace be upon him, "Indeed, God created Adam in His image"—a hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah.

This matter varies according to intention, and intention varies according to circumstance. If the heart is predominantly inclined to consider the constraint and incapacity of creation, that they are compelled to what they are destined for, this leads to leniency in enmity and hatred—and this has its justification. However, it can be confused with appeasement. Often, the motives for overlooking sins are appeasement, consideration for hearts, and fear of their alienation and aversion. Satan may disguise this for the foolish simpleton as looking with an eye of mercy. The criterion is to look with an eye of mercy if he transgresses against a right specific to you, saying, "He has been compelled, and foreordainment cannot be averted by caution—how could he not do it when it is decreed for him?" Such a one may have a sound intention in overlooking transgression against God's right, but if he becomes angry when his own right is transgressed and shows mercy when God's right is transgressed, this is an appeaser, deluded by one of Satan's plots—let him beware.

If you ask: The minimum degree in showing hatred is abandonment, turning away, and cutting off kindness and assistance. Is this obligatory so that a servant becomes sinful by neglecting it? I say: This does not enter into the outward knowledge under obligation and requirement, for we know that those who drank wine and committed indecencies in the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and the Companions were not completely abandoned. Rather, they were divided regarding them: some would use harsh words and show hatred, some would turn away and avoid them, and some would look upon them with an eye of mercy and not favor boycotting and distancing. These are religious subtleties in which the paths of travelers to the Hereafter differ, and each person's action is according to what his state and time require. The requirements of states in these matters are either disliked or recommended, thus being in the rank of virtues, and do not reach prohibition and obligation. For what falls under obligation is the foundation of knowledge of God Almighty and the foundation of love, and that may not extend from the beloved to others. What extends is excessive love and its domination, and that does not enter into legal verdicts and under outward obligation concerning the common people at all.

An explanation of the ranks of those who hate for God's sake and how to deal with them: If you ask: Showing hatred and enmity in action, if not obligatory, is undoubtedly recommended. Sinners and transgressors are of different ranks—how is virtue attained in dealing with them, and is one path followed for all of them or not? Know that one who opposes God's command is either opposing in belief or in action. One opposing in belief is either an innovator or an unbeliever. The innovator either calls to his innovation or is silent. The silent one is either due to incapacity or by choice. Thus, the categories of corruption in belief are three:

The first is unbelief. The unbeliever, if he is hostile, deserves killing and enslavement—there is no degradation beyond these two. As for the protected non-Muslim, it is not permissible to harm him except by turning away from him and belittling him by forcing him to the narrowest part of the road and by refraining...

Initiating with the greeting of peace, if one says "Peace be upon you," you may reply "And upon you." However, it is preferable to refrain from mixing with him, conducting transactions, or sharing meals. As for being at ease with him and opening up to him as one does with friends, this is strongly disliked, almost reaching the level of prohibition. Allah the Exalted said: "You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons..." [58:22]. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The Muslim and the polytheist should not see each other's fire." (The hadith: "The believer and the polytheist should not see each other's fire" was narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Jarir: "I am free from every Muslim who resides among the polytheists." They said, "O Messenger of Allah, why?" He said, "They should not see each other's fire.") It was narrated by al-Nasa'i as *mursal*, and al-Bukhari said the sound position is that it is *mursal*. And the Almighty said: "O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies..." [60:1].

The second is the innovator who calls to his innovation. If the innovation is of a degree that constitutes disbelief, then his case is more severe than that of the *dhimmi*, for he is not granted protection by a covenant nor is he spared by a contract of security. If he is of those whose innovation does not constitute disbelief, then his affair before Allah is undoubtedly lighter than that of the disbeliever. However, the matter of censuring him is more severe than censuring the disbeliever, because the harm of the disbeliever is not transgressive, for the Muslims have affirmed his disbelief and thus do not heed his speech, as he does not claim Islam and belief in the truth. As for the innovator who calls to innovation and claims that what he calls to is the truth, he is a cause for leading creation astray, so his harm is transgressive. Therefore, the recommendation to show hatred and enmity towards him, cutting off from him, belittling him, exposing his innovation, and warning people away from him is more emphatic. If you are in private, there is no harm in replying to his greeting. But if you know that ignoring him and remaining silent in response to his greeting would make his innovation appear vile to him and have an effect in deterring him, then foregoing the reply is preferable. For although the reply to the greeting of peace is obligatory, it is waived for a purpose that contains a benefit—even to the point of being waived when a person is in the bath or relieving himself—and the purpose of deterrence is more important than these purposes. If you are in a gathering, then foregoing the reply is foremost to warn people away from him and to make his innovation appear vile in their eyes. Likewise, it is preferable to withhold kindness and assistance from him, especially in what is apparent to people. He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever rebukes an innovator, Allah will fill his heart with security and faith. And whoever humiliates an innovator, Allah will grant him security on the Day of Great Terror. Whoever is gentle with him, honors him, or meets him with a cheerful face has taken lightly what Allah revealed to Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him." (The hadith: "Whoever rebukes an innovator, Allah will fill his heart with security and faith" was reported by Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* and al-Harawi in *Dhamm al-Kalam* from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.)

The third is the common innovator who is incapable of calling to it and whose being followed is not feared. His affair is lighter. It is preferable not to confront him with harshness and humiliation, but rather to be gentle with him in giving counsel, for the hearts of the common people are quick to change. If counsel is of no benefit and ignoring him would make his innovation appear vile in his own sight, then the recommendation to ignore him is confirmed. If you know that this will not affect him due to the rigidity of his nature and the firm entrenchment of his belief in his heart, then ignoring him is preferable, for if innovation is not strongly condemned as vile, it spreads among the people and its corruption becomes widespread.

As for the sinner by his action and deed, not by his belief, he is either of a kind that harms others, such as oppression, anger, false testimony, backbiting, sowing discord among people, walking with slander, and the like; or he is of a kind whose harm does not extend to others. This latter divides into that which invites others to corruption, like the keeper of a tavern who brings men and women together and prepares the means of drinking and corruption for the corrupt; or he does not invite others to his action, like one who drinks and fornicates. This one who does not invite others is either sinning with a major sin or a minor sin, and each one is either persistent upon it or not persistent. From these divisions, three categories result, each having its own rank, some more severe than others, and we do not treat them all with a single approach.

The first category, which is the most severe, is that which harms people, such as oppression, usurpation, false testimony, backbiting, and slander. It is preferable to ignore these people, avoid mixing with them, and withdraw from dealing with them, because the sin is severe in what pertains to harming creation. These then are divided into those who oppress concerning blood, those who oppress concerning wealth, and those who oppress concerning honor—some more severe than others. The recommendation to humiliate them and ignore them is very emphatic. Whenever humiliation is expected to deter them or others, the matter becomes more emphatic and severe.

The second is the keeper of the tavern who prepares the means of corruption.

And He facilitates its paths for creation, so this does not harm people in their worldly life, but it steals their religion through its action. And if it is in accordance with their pleasure, it is close to the first type but lighter than it. For the sin between the servant and God Almighty is closer to forgiveness, but from the perspective that it transgresses generally upon others, it is severe. This also necessitates humiliation, turning away, severing ties, and abandoning the return of the greeting of peace if it is thought that in it is a kind of rebuke for him or for others. The third type is one who commits immorality in himself by drinking wine, neglecting an obligation, or committing a prohibition that is specific to him. The matter regarding him is lighter, but at the time of his direct commission, if encountered, he must be prevented by whatever means will deter him, even by striking and showing contempt, for forbidding the wrong is obligatory. When it is finished and it is known that this is from his habit and he is persistent upon it, then if it is confirmed that advising him will prevent him from returning to it, advising is obligatory. And if it is not confirmed, but there is hope, then the best is advice and rebuke with gentleness or with severity if that is more beneficial. As for turning away from returning his greeting of peace and refraining from mixing with him when it is known that he is persistent and that advice will not benefit him, there is consideration in this, and the paths of the scholars regarding it differ. The correct view is that it differs according to the difference in the man's intention. At this point it is said: "Actions are by intentions," for in gentleness and looking upon creation with the eye of mercy is a kind of humility, and in harshness and turning away is a kind of rebuke. The one seeking a ruling in this is the heart. So what it sees as more inclined to its desire and the demand of its nature, the opposite is preferable, for perhaps his contempt and harshness stem from arrogance, self-admiration, and delight in showing superiority and presuming upon righteousness. And perhaps his gentleness stems from flattery and winning over a heart to attain thereby an objective, or fear of the effect of his alienation and aversion upon status or wealth, by a near or distant assumption. All of this is swayed by the suggestions of Satan and far from the works of the people of the Hereafter. Every aspirant to the works of religion strives with himself in scrutinizing these subtleties and observing these states, and the heart is the one who gives the ruling in it. It may hit upon the truth in its striving, or it may err. It may proceed to follow its desire while knowing it, or it may proceed under the rule of delusion, thinking it is acting for God and traversing the path of the Hereafter. The clarification of these subtleties will come in the Book of Delusion from the Quarter of the Destructive Things. What indicates the lightening of the matter in the confined immorality, which is between the servant and God, is what was narrated that a drinker of wine was struck in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he was returning. So one of the Companions said, "May God curse him, how often he drinks!" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not be an aid to Satan against your brother." The hadith: "A drinker of wine was struck in the presence of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him..." and in it: "Do not be an aid to Satan against your brother." Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, or wording to this meaning. This was an indication that gentleness is preferable to harshness and severity. Clarification of the qualities stipulated in one whose companionship is chosen: Know that not every person is suitable for companionship. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A man is upon the religion of his close friend, so let one of you look at whom he takes as a close friend." The hadith: "A man is upon the religion of his close friend..." Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and deemed it good, and al-Hakim transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and said it is sound, God willing. He must be distinguished by characteristics and qualities for which his companionship is desired, and those qualities are stipulated according to the benefits desired from the companionship, for the meaning of a condition is that without which the objective cannot be reached. So in relation to the objective, the conditions become apparent. From companionship, religious and worldly benefits are sought. As for the worldly, such as benefiting from wealth or status, or merely finding comfort in association and proximity, that is not from our objectives. As for the religious, various objectives also come together in it, for from it is benefiting from knowledge and action, and from it is benefiting from status as a protection by it from the harm of one who disturbs the heart and hinders from worship, and from it is benefiting from wealth to be content with it from wasting times in seeking sustenance, and from it is seeking aid in important matters, so he becomes a resource in calamities and a strength in circumstances, and from it is seeking blessings merely through supplication, and from it is awaiting intercession in the Hereafter. For the predecessors said: "Increase in brothers, for every believer has an intercession; perhaps you will enter into the intercession of your brother." And it is narrated in a rare interpretation regarding His saying, Almighty: "And He answers those who believe and do righteous deeds and increases them from His bounty." He said: "He gives them intercession for their brothers, so He admits them into Paradise with them." And it is said: "When God forgives a servant, he intercedes for his brothers." Therefore, a group of the predecessors urged companionship, affection, and mixing, and they disliked isolation and solitude. These benefits each demand conditions without which they are not attained, and we will detail them. Generally, it is necessary that...

In one whose companionship is sought, five traits should be present: he should be intelligent, of good character, not a persistent sinner, not an innovator, and not greedy for this world. As for intelligence, it is the principal capital and the foundation; there is no good in keeping company with a fool, for its outcome, however prolonged, reverts to estrangement and severance. ʿAlī, may God be pleased with him, said: "Do not befriend a brother of ignorance, and beware of him, for how many a fool has ruined a wise man when he took him as a brother. A person is measured by the person if the person is what he accompanies, and for a thing there are measures and likenesses from other things, and the heart has proof upon the heart when it meets it." How so? The fool may harm you while intending your benefit and assistance, without realizing it. Hence the poet said: "I am secure from an intelligent enemy, but I fear a companion overcome by madness. For intelligence is a single art, and its path is known, so be vigilant, while madness is many arts." Therefore, it is said: "Avoiding the fool is an offering to God." And al-Thawrī said: "Looking at the face of a fool is a recorded sin." By "intelligent," we mean one who comprehends matters as they truly are, either by himself or when explained.

As for good character, it is indispensable, for many an intelligent person grasps things as they are, but when overcome by anger, desire, miserliness, or cowardice, he obeys his whim and opposes what he knows to be right, due to his inability to subdue his traits and rectify his character; there is no good in his companionship.

As for the persistent sinner who insists on sin, there is no benefit in his companionship, for one who fears God does not persist in a major sin, and one who does not fear God—his harm is not safe, nor can his friendship be trusted; rather, he changes with changing motives. God Almighty said: "And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire" (18:28). And He said: "So let not those who disbelieve in it and follow their desires turn you away from it" (20:16). And He said: "So turn away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires not except the worldly life" (53:29). And He said: "And follow the way of him who turns to Me" (31:15). Implicit in this is a warning against the sinner.

As for the innovator, in his companionship lies the danger of the innovation spreading and its ill omen transferring to him. The innovator deserves abandonment and avoidance; how then can his companionship be sought? ʿUmar, may God be pleased with him, said concerning the encouragement to seek piety in a friend, as narrated by Saʿīd ibn al-Musayyib: "Adhere to truthful brothers, live under their protection, for they are an adornment in prosperity and a resource in adversity. Assume the best about your brother until something overcomes you from him. Keep away from your enemy, and beware of your friend except the trustworthy among the people, and none is trustworthy except one who fears God. So do not keep company with the wicked, lest you learn from his wickedness, nor obey him concerning your secret, and consult in your affairs those who fear God Almighty."

As for good character, ʿAlqamah al-ʿAṭāradī summarized it in his counsel to his son when death approached him: "O my son, if you have a need to accompany men, accompany one who, if you serve him, protects you; if you accompany him, adorns you; if a burden befalls you, shields you. Accompany one who, if you extend your hand with good, extends his; if he sees a good deed from you, counts it; if he sees a bad deed, covers it. Accompany one who, if you ask him, gives you; if you are silent, initiates; if a calamity befalls you, consoles you. Accompany one who, if you speak, believes your speech; if you attempt a matter, advises you; if you dispute, prefers you." It is as if he gathered with this all the rights of companionship and stipulated that one be established in all of them. Ibn Aktham said: Al-Maʾmūn said: "Explain this." It was said to him: "Do you know why he counseled him thus?" He said: "No." It was said: "Because he intended that he not accompany anyone."

And some men of letters said: "Do not accompany among people except one who conceals your secret, covers your fault, stands with you in calamities, prefers you with desires, spreads your good, and folds your evil. If you do not find him, then accompany only yourself." And ʿAlī, may God be pleased with him, said: "Your true brother is he who is with you, who harms himself to benefit you, and when the times of doubt split you, he scatters his own to gather you."

And some scholars said: "Accompany only one of two men: a man from whom you learn something in the matter of your religion, so he benefits you, or a man whom you teach something in the matter of his religion, so he accepts from you. As for the third, flee from him." And some said: "People are four: one is sweet all through, so one is not satiated with him; another is bitter all through, so he is not consumed; another has sourness, so take from him before he takes from you; and another has saltiness, so take from him only at the time of need."

And Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, may God be pleased with him, said: "Do not accompany five: the liar, for you are in delusion from him, and he is like a mirage, bringing the distant near and making the near distant; the fool, for you gain nothing from him—he intends to benefit you but harms you; the miser, for he cuts you off at your time of greatest need; the coward, for he surrenders you and flees at hardship; and the sinner, for he sells you for a morsel or less." It was said: "What is less than that?" He said: "The greed for it, then not attaining it."

And al-Junayd said: "That a sinner of good character accompany me is more beloved to me than that a reciter of bad character accompany me." And Ibn Abī al-Ḥawārī said: "My teacher Abū Sulaymān said to me: 'O Aḥmad, accompany only one of two men: a man you benefit from in the matter of your worldly life, or a man...'"

It increases with him and benefits you in matters of your Hereafter. To occupy oneself with anything other than these two is great folly. Sahl ibn 'Abd Allah said: Avoid the companionship of three types of people: tyrannical rulers who are heedless, hypocritical reciters, and ignorant ascetics. Know that these words, for the most part, do not encompass all the purposes of companionship. What encompasses them is what we have mentioned regarding observing the intentions and adhering to the conditions in addition to them. For what is stipulated for companionship in worldly aims is not stipulated for companionship in the Hereafter and in brotherhood. As Bishr said: Brothers are of three kinds: a brother for your Hereafter, a brother for your worldly life, and a brother for your companionship. Rarely do these purposes unite in one person; rather, they are distributed among a group, so the conditions are inevitably distributed among them. Al-Ma'mun said: Brothers are of three kinds: one of them is like food—you cannot do without him; another is like medicine—you need him at some times and not at others; and the third is like a disease—you never need him, but a servant may be tested with him. He is the one in whom there is neither companionship nor benefit. It has been said: The entirety of people is like trees and plants. Among them is that which has shade but no fruit, like one who is beneficial in the worldly life but not in the Hereafter, for the benefit of the worldly life is like a swiftly vanishing shade. Among them is that which has fruit but no shade, like one who is suitable for the Hereafter but not for the worldly life. Among them is that which has both fruit and shade. And among them is that which has neither, like Umm Ghaylan, who tears garments but has neither taste nor drink. Its likeness among animals is the mouse and the scorpion, as Allah, Exalted is He, said: "He calls to one whose harm is closer than his benefit. How wretched the protector and how wretched the associate!" And the poet said: People are diverse; when you taste them, they are not equal, just as trees are not equal: this one has sweet, tasty fruit, and that one has neither taste nor fruit. If one does not find a companion to befriend and benefit from in any of these purposes, then solitude is better for him. Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Solitude is better than a bad companion, and a good companion is better than solitude. And it is narrated as elevated: As for religiosity and absence of immorality, Allah, Exalted is He, said: "And follow the way of him who turns to Me." For witnessing immorality and immoral people makes the matter of sin seem light to the heart and nullifies the heart's aversion to it. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: Do not look at the wrongdoers, lest your righteous deeds be rendered vain. Rather, there is no safety in mixing with them; safety is only in cutting off from them. Allah, Exalted is He, said: "And when the ignorant address them, they say, 'Peace,'" meaning safety. The *alif* is substituted for the *ha'*, and its meaning is: We are safe from your sin, and you are safe from our evil. This is what we intended to mention regarding the meanings of brotherhood, its conditions, and its benefits. Let us return to mentioning its rights, necessities, and ways of fulfilling its right. As for one who is greedy for the worldly life, his companionship is a deadly poison, for natures are created to imitate and emulate. Indeed, one nature steals from another without its owner realizing it. Keeping company with one greedy for the worldly life stirs up greed, and keeping company with an ascetic encourages asceticism regarding the worldly life. Therefore, the companionship of seekers of the worldly life is disliked, and the companionship of those desirous of the Hereafter is recommended. 'Ali, upon him be peace, said: Revive acts of obedience by keeping company with one before whom you feel shame. Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Nothing has brought me into calamity except keeping company with one for whom I feel no reverence. Luqman said: O my son, sit with the scholars and press close to them with your knees, for hearts are revived by wisdom just as dead land is revived by abundant rain. Chapter Two: On the Rights of Brotherhood and Companionship. Know that the bond of brotherhood is a tie between two persons, like the marriage contract between two spouses. And just as marriage entails rights that must be fulfilled to uphold the right of marriage, as previously mentioned in the Book of the Etiquettes of Marriage, so too does the bond of brotherhood. Your brother has a right over you regarding wealth, self, tongue, and heart—through forgiveness, supplication, sincerity, fidelity, easing burdens, and avoiding affectation and imposition. This is encompassed by eight rights. The First Right: Regarding Wealth. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The likeness of two brothers is like two hands; one washes the other." The hadith "The likeness of two brothers is like two hands" was mentioned in the preceding chapter. He compared them to two hands, not to a hand and a foot, because they cooperate for a single purpose. Likewise, two brothers only complete their brotherhood when they accompany each other for a single purpose. Thus, from one perspective, they are like a single person. This necessitates sharing in ease and hardship, partnership in outcome and state, the removal of exclusivity and monopolization, and mutual financial support. Brotherhood in terms of financial support has three levels. The lowest is that you place him in the position of your slave or servant, so you fulfill his need from your surplus wealth. If a need arises for him and you have a surplus beyond your own need, you give to him initially without compelling him to ask. If you compel him to ask...

The utmost deficiency in the duty of brotherhood is to place him on the level of yourself and be content with his sharing with you in your wealth and occupying your station, such that you permit him to share in the wealth. Al-Hasan said, "One of them would split his garment between himself and his brother." The third level, which is the highest, is to prefer him over yourself and give precedence to his need over your own need. This is the rank of the sincere friends and the ultimate degree of those who love one another. Among the fruits of this rank is self-sacrifice as well, as it is narrated that a group of Sufis were brought before a caliph, who ordered their necks to be struck. Among them was Abu al-Husayn al-Nuri. The executioner hastened to him to be the first killed. He was asked about that, and he said, "I loved to prefer my brothers with life in this moment." That was the reason for the salvation of all of them in a long story. If you do not find yourself in any of these ranks with your brother, then know that the bond of brotherhood has not yet been truly established inwardly. What is current between you is merely a formal association that has no weight in reason or religion. Maymun ibn Mihran said, "Whoever is content with his brothers leaving excellence, let him take the people of the graves as brothers." As for the lowest degree, it is also not satisfactory to the people of religion. It is narrated that 'Utbah al-Ghulam came to the house of a man with whom he had made brotherhood and said, "I need four thousand from your wealth." He said, "Take two thousand." He turned away from him and said, "You have preferred the world over God. Are you not ashamed to be called brotherhood for God's sake and say this?" Whoever is in the lowest degree of brotherhood should not be dealt with in worldly matters. Abu Hazim said, "If you have a brother for God's sake, do not deal with him in the matters of your world." He meant by that whoever is in this rank. As for the highest rank, it is that which God Almighty described the believers with in His saying, "and their affair is [conducted through] consultation among them, and from what We have provided them, they spend." That is, they were partners in wealth, not distinguishing some of their belongings from others. Among them was one who would not accompany someone who said "mine" because he attributed it to himself. Al-Fath al-Mawsili came to the house of a brother of his who was absent. He ordered his household, and they brought out his chest. He opened it and took what he needed. The slave girl informed her master, and he said, "If you have spoken truthfully, you are free for the sake of God," rejoicing at what he had done. A man came to Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, and said, "I wish to make brotherhood with you for God's sake." He said, "Do you know the right of brotherhood?" He said, "Inform me." He said, "That you have no more right to your dinar and dirham than I do." He said, "I have not reached that station yet." He said, "Then go away from me." 'Ali ibn al-Husayn, may God be pleased with them both, said to a man, "Does one of you put his hand into the sleeve of his brother and his purse and take from it what he wants without his permission?" He said, "No." He said, "Then you are not brothers." A group of people entered upon al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, and said, "O Abu Sa'id, have you prayed?" He said, "Yes." They said, "The people of the market have not prayed yet." He said, "Who takes his religion from the people of the market? It has reached me that one of them withholds a dirham from his brother," saying it as one astonished at it. A man came to Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, while he intended to go to Jerusalem and said, "I wish to accompany you." Ibrahim said to him, "On condition that I have more right to your thing than you do." He said, "No." He said, "Your truthfulness pleases me." It is said that Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, if a man accompanied him, would not oppose him, and he would only accompany one who agreed with him. A man who made sandals accompanied him, and a man presented Ibrahim with a bowl of tharid at one of the stopping places. He opened the bag of his companion and took a bundle of sandal straps and put them in the bowl and returned it to the giver of the gift. When his companion came, he said, "Where are the sandal straps?" He said, "That tharid you ate, what was it?" He said, "You would have given him two or three straps." He said, "Be generous, and generosity will be shown to you." And once he gave a donkey that belonged to his companion without his permission to a man he saw walking. When his companion came, he remained silent and did not dislike that. Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said, "A sheep's head was presented to a man among the companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. He said, 'My brother so-and-so is more in need of it than I am,' so he sent it to him. That person sent it to another, and it continued to be sent from one to another until it returned to the first after seven had passed it around." It is narrated that Masruq incurred a heavy debt, and his brother Khaythamah had a debt. Masruq went and paid Khaythamah's debt without him knowing, and Khaythamah went and paid Masruq's debt without him knowing. When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, established brotherhood between 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf and Sa'd ibn al-Rabi', he preferred him with wealth and self. 'Abd al-Rahman said, "May God bless you in them." A hadith: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, established brotherhood between 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf and Sa'd ibn al-Rabi', he preferred him with wealth and self. 'Abd al-Rahman said, "May God bless you in them." Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Anas. So he preferred him with what he preferred him with, and it is as if he accepted it, then preferred him with it. That is equality, and the beginning is preference, and preference is better than equality. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said, "If only..."

The entire world is mine, yet I placed it in the mouth of a brother among my brethren, for I deemed it too little for him. He also said: Verily, when I place a morsel in the mouth of a brother among my brethren, I taste its flavor in my own throat. Spending upon brethren is superior to giving charity to the poor. ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: Twenty dirhams I give to my brother in God are more beloved to me than giving one hundred dirhams in charity to the needy. He also said: Preparing a *sa‘* of food and gathering my brethren in God for it is more beloved to me than emancipating a slave. All of this follows the example in self-preference set by the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, for he entered a thicket with some of his companions and gathered two tooth-sticks from it, one crooked and the other straight. He gave them to his companion, who said, “O Messenger of God, by God, you were more entitled to the straight one than I.” He replied, “No companion keeps company with another, even for an hour of the day, but that he will be questioned about his companionship: did he fulfill God’s right in it, or did he neglect it?” (This narration of him entering a thicket... I have not found a source for it.) This indicates that self-preference is the fulfillment of God’s right in companionship.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, went out to a well to perform ritual bathing there. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman held the garment and stood screening the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until he had bathed. Then Hudhayfah sat to bathe, so the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, took the garment and stood screening Hudhayfah from the people. Hudhayfah refused, saying, “May my father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of God, do not do it.” But he, peace be upon him, refused until he screened him with the garment while he bathed. (This narration of Hudhayfah screening the Prophet... I have not found it either.)

And he, peace be upon him, said: “Never do two keep company except that the more beloved of them to God is the one who is more gentle with his companion.” (This narration... preceded in the previous chapter with the wording: ‘the one who is more loving to his companion.’)

It is related that Malik ibn Dinar and Muhammad ibn Wasī‘ entered the house of al-Hasan while he was absent. Muhammad ibn Wasī‘ brought out a basket containing food from under al-Hasan’s bed and began to eat. Malik said to him, “Hold your hand until the master of the house comes,” but Muhammad paid no heed to his words and continued eating. Malik was more open and of better character. Al-Hasan entered and said, “O Wā’ilak, thus we were—we did not feel formal restraint with one another—until you and your companions appeared.” This points to the fact that feeling at ease in the houses of brethren is part of the sincerity in brotherhood. How could it be otherwise when God Almighty has said, “...or your close friends...” and “...or [houses] whose keys you possess...”? For a brother would hand over the keys of his house to his brother and delegate to him disposal as he wished, and his brother would feel scruples about eating out of piety, until God Almighty revealed this verse, permitting them to feel at ease regarding the food of brethren and true friends.

The second right is assisting with one’s person in fulfilling needs and undertaking them before being asked, and giving them precedence over one’s own needs. This also has degrees, just as sharing wealth does. The lowest of them is undertaking the need when asked and when capable, but with cheerfulness, gladness, showing joy, and accepting the favor. Some said: If you ask your brother to fulfill a need and he does not fulfill it, remind him a second time, for perhaps he forgot. If he still does not fulfill it, then pronounce the funeral prayer over him and recite this verse: “...and the dead, God will resurrect them...” Ibn Shubrumah fulfilled a major need for one of his brethren, who then came with a gift. He said, “What is this?” He replied, “For what you did for me.” He said, “Take your wealth, may God grant you health. If you ask your brother for a need and he does not exert himself in fulfilling it, perform ablution for prayer and pronounce the funeral prayer over him four times, and count him among the dead.”

Ja‘far ibn Muhammad said: I hasten to fulfill the needs of my enemies, fearing that I might repel them and they become independent of me. This is regarding enemies, so what about friends? Among the predecessors were those who would look after the family and children of his brother after his death for forty years, fulfilling their needs, visiting them every day, and providing for them from his wealth, so they lacked nothing of their father except his sight. Indeed, they saw from him what they had not seen from their father in his lifetime. One of them would come to the door of his brother’s house and ask, “Do you have oil? Do you have salt? Do you have a need?” and he would fulfill it without his brother knowing him. Through this, compassion and brotherhood become manifest. If compassion does not bear fruit until one feels for his brother as he feels for himself, then there is no good in it. Maymūn ibn Mihrān said: He from whose friendship you derive no benefit, his enmity will not harm you.

And he, peace be upon him, said: Verily, God has vessels upon His earth, and they are the hearts. The most beloved vessels to God Almighty are the purest, the firmest, and the most tender: the purest from sins, the firmest in religion, and the most tender towards...

Verily, God has vessels upon His earth, and they are the hearts. The vessels most beloved to God are the purest and firmest. Al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of Abu 'Utbah al-Khawlani, though he said, "the softest and most tender," and its chain is sound. In sum, you should consider your brother's need like your own need, or more important than your own need. You should be attentive to the times of need, not neglectful of his circumstances, just as you are not neglectful of your own. You should spare him from having to ask and show his need for assistance; rather, you undertake his need as if you do not know you have undertaken it. You should not see for yourself any right due to your undertaking it; rather, you take on the favor of his accepting your effort for his sake and your undertaking his affair. You should not limit yourself to fulfilling the need; rather, strive from the outset with honor, in increase, preference, and giving precedence over relatives and children. Al-Hasan used to say, "Our brothers are dearer to us than our family and our children, for our family remind us of this world, and our brothers remind us of the Hereafter." And al-Hasan said, "Whoever escorts his brother for God's sake, God will send angels from beneath His Throne on the Day of Resurrection to escort him to Paradise." And in the tradition: "No man visits a brother for God's sake out of longing to meet him, except that an angel calls out from behind him, 'You are blessed, and Paradise is blessed for you.'" The hadith "No man visits a brother..." preceded in the chapter before it. And 'Ata' said, "Inquire after your brothers after three days; if they are sick, visit them; if they are busy, assist them; or if they have forgotten, remind them." It is related that Ibn 'Umar would look right and left in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he was asked about that. He said, "I loved a man, and I am seeking him, but I do not see him." He said, "When you love someone, ask him his name, his father's name, and his dwelling. If he is sick, visit him; if he is busy, assist him." The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "When you love someone, ask him his name, his father's name, his dwelling, and his tribe..." Al-Khara'iti narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* and al-Bayhaqi in *Shu'ab al-Īmān* with a weak chain. Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Yazid ibn Na'amah and said it is *gharīb*, and Yazid ibn Na'amah's hearing from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is not known. In one narration: "and his grandfather's name and his tribe." And al-Sha'bi said concerning a man who sits with a man and says, 'I know his face but I do not know his name,' that is the knowledge of the foolish." It was said to Ibn 'Abbas, "Who are the most beloved of people to you?" He said, "My sitting companion." And he said, "If a man comes to my gathering three times without a need of his, I know what his reward from the world is." And Sa'id ibn al-'As said to his sitting companion, "You have three rights over me: when you draw near, I welcome you; when you speak, I give you my attention; and when you sit, I make room for you." And God Almighty has said, "Merciful among themselves," pointing to compassion and honor. And from the perfection of compassion is that he does not partake of delicious food alone or be present in a pleasure without him; rather, he feels distressed by separation and feels lonely when isolated from his brother. The third right concerning the tongue is through silence at times and speech at others. As for silence, it is that he remains silent about mentioning his faults in his absence and presence; rather, he feigns ignorance about it and remains silent from rebutting him in what he speaks, and does not argue with him or dispute him. And that he remains silent from spying and inquiring about his circumstances, and if he sees him on a path or with a need, he does not initiate by mentioning the purpose of his coming and going, nor ask him about it, for perhaps mentioning it burdens him or he needs to lie about it. And that he remains silent about his secrets which he confided to him, and does not confide them to anyone else at all, nor to his closest friends, nor disclose anything from them, even after estrangement and alienation, for that is from base character and evil inwardness. And that he remains silent from disparaging his beloved ones, his family, and his children. And that he remains silent from relating the disparagement of others about him, for the one who forged what reached you... And Anas said, "He, peace and blessings be upon him, would not confront anyone with something he disliked." The hadith of Anas: "He would not confront anyone with something he disliked," was narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi in *Al-Shamā'il*, and al-Nasa'i in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* with a weak chain. Hurt occurs first from the conveyer, then from the speaker. However, he should not conceal what he hears of praise for him, for joy in it occurs first from the conveyer of the praise, then from the speaker, and concealing that is from envy. In sum, let him be silent from every speech he dislikes, in general and in detail, except when speech is obligatory in enjoining good or forbidding evil, and he finds no concession in silence. Then, he does not mind his dislike, for that is truly a kindness to him, even if he thinks it is an injury outwardly. As for mentioning his faults and defects and the faults of his family, that is from backbiting, and that is forbidden regarding every Muslim. Two matters should deter you from it: one is that you examine the states of your own soul; if you find in it a single blameworthy thing, then make light upon yourself what you see from your brother, and consider him incapable of subduing his soul in that single trait, just as you are incapable regarding what you are afflicted with, and do not find him heavy due to a single trait.

It is blameworthy, so what man is refined? Whatever you do not find in yourself regarding the rights of God, do not expect from your brother regarding your own rights, for your right over him is no greater than God's right over you. The second matter is that you know if you sought one free from every fault, you would withdraw from all creation and never find anyone to accompany at all. There is no one among people except that he has merits and faults. When merits overcome faults, that is the ultimate goal. The noble believer always brings to mind the merits of his brother, so that reverence, affection, and respect spring from his heart. As for the vile hypocrite, he always observes the faults and defects. Ibn al-Mubarak said: "The believer seeks excuses, and the hypocrite seeks slips." Al-Fudayl said: "Chivalry is forgiving the slips of brothers." Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Seek refuge with God from an evil neighbor who, if he sees good, conceals it, and if he sees evil, reveals it." The hadith "Seek refuge with God from an evil neighbor who, if he sees good, conceals it, and if he sees evil, reveals it" was reported by al-Bukhari in *al-Tarikh* from Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain, and by al-Nasa'i from Abu Hurayrah and Abu Sa'id with a sound chain: "Seek refuge with God from an evil neighbor in the abiding home." There is no person except that his state can be improved by qualities within him, and it can also be made ugly. It is narrated that a man praised another man before the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), then the next day he censured him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Yesterday you praised him, and today you censure him?" He said: "By God, I spoke truthfully about him yesterday and did not lie about him today. He pleased me yesterday, so I said the best I knew of him, and he angered me today, so I said the worst I knew of him." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, in eloquence there is magic." The hadith that a man praised another before the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), then the next day censured him... in it he (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, in eloquence there is magic." Reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and al-Hakim in *al-Mustadrak* from Abu Bakrah, except he mentioned the praise and censure in one sitting, not two days. Al-Hakim reported it from Ibn Abbas at greater length with a weak chain as well. It is as if he disliked that and likened it to magic. Therefore, he said in another report: "Vulgarity and eloquence are two branches of hypocrisy." The hadith "Vulgarity and eloquence are two branches of hypocrisy" was reported by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *hasan gharib*, and by al-Hakim who said it is *sahih* according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs, from Abu Umamah with a weak chain. And in another hadith: "God dislikes for you all eloquence, every bit of it." Likewise, al-Shafi'i (may God have mercy on him) said: "There is no Muslim who obeys God and does not disobey Him, and none who disobeys God and does not obey Him. So whoever's obedience is predominant over his disobedience is just. If such a one is considered just in the sight of God, then it is more fitting that you see him as just regarding your own rights and the demands of your brotherhood." Just as you must silence your tongue from his faults, you must silence your heart, which is by abandoning ill thoughts, for ill thought is backbiting of the heart and is also forbidden. Its limit is that you do not interpret his action in a corrupt way as long as it is possible to interpret it in a good way. As for what is revealed with certainty and observation, you cannot but know it, and you must interpret what you witness as oversight and forgetfulness if possible. This thought divides into what is called physiognomy (*tafarruṣ*), which is based on a sign, for that stirs thought necessarily, unable to be repelled; and into what originates from your ill opinion of him until an action issues from him having two aspects, so your ill opinion of him leads you to interpret it in the worse way without a specific sign for it. That is an injustice against him inwardly, and that is forbidden regarding every believer, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "God has made forbidden for a believer from another believer his blood, his wealth, and his honor, and to think ill of him." The hadith "God has made forbidden from the believer his blood, his wealth, and his honor, and to think ill of him" was reported by al-Hakim in *al-Tarikh* from Ibn Abbas without the phrase "and his honor," and its narrators are trustworthy, except Abu Ali al-Naysaburi said: "This is not, in my view, from the speech of the Prophet (peace be upon him); rather, it is, in my view, from the speech of Ibn Abbas." Ibn Majah has something similar from Ibn Umar, and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah: "Every Muslim is inviolable to another Muslim: his blood, his wealth, and his honor." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech." The hadith "Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech" is agreed upon from Abu Hurayrah. Ill thought leads to spying and prying, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Do not spy, do not pry, do not cut off ties, do not turn away from each other, and be servants of God as brothers." The hadith "Do not spy, do not pry, do not cut off ties, do not turn away from each other, and be servants of God as brothers" is agreed upon from Abu Hurayrah.

This is part of the preceding Hadith. Spying is seeking out news, and *tahassus* is monitoring with the eye. Concealing faults, and being ignorant and heedless of them, is the characteristic of the people of religion. As an alert to the perfection of the rank in concealing the ugly and manifesting the beautiful, it suffices you that God, exalted is He, is described with this in supplication, so it is said: "O You who manifest the beautiful and conceal the ugly." The most beloved to God is he who adopts His character traits, for He is the Veiler of faults, the Forgiver of sins, and the One who overlooks [the faults of] His servants. So how can you not overlook [the faults of] one who is like you or above you, and who is, in all circumstances, your servant and not your creation? And Jesus, peace be upon him, said to the disciples: "What would you do if you saw your brother asleep and the wind had uncovered his garment?" They said: "We would cover him and conceal him." He said: "Rather, you uncover his private parts?" They said: "Glory be to God! Who would do this?" He said: "One of you hears a word about his brother, then adds to it and spreads it with something greater than it." And know that a person's faith is not complete until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself. The lowest degree of brotherhood is that he treats his brother as he loves to be treated. Without doubt, he expects from him the covering of his private parts and silence about his faults and defects. If the opposite of what he expects appears from him, his rage and anger intensify against him. So how far is he, when he expects from him what he does not harbor for him nor resolve to do for his sake? And woe to him, in the explicit text of the Book of God, exalted is He, where He said: "Woe to the defrauders, who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, but when they measure or weigh for them, give less." Everyone who seeks from fairness more than his soul permits, he falls under the requirement of this verse. The origin of deficiency in covering the private parts or striving to uncover them is the hidden disease within, which is rancor and envy. For the rancorous, envious one fills his inner self with malice, but he restrains it within his inner self and conceals it, and does not show it as long as he does not find an opportunity for it. When he finds an opportunity, the bond is dissolved, modesty is lifted, and the inner self exudes its hidden malice. Whenever the inner self harbors rancor and envy, severance is more fitting. Some of the wise said: "The appearance of reproach is better than concealed rancor." The kindness of the rancorous one only increases alienation from him. And whoever has malice in his heart against a Muslim, his faith is weak, his affair is perilous, and his heart is corrupt, unfit for meeting God. It was narrated by 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Jubayr ibn Nufayr from his father that he said: I was in Yemen and I had a Jewish neighbor who would inform me from the Torah. A traveler came to the Jew and I said: "God has sent among us a prophet who called us to Islam, so we accepted Islam, and He has sent down upon us a Book confirming the Torah." The Jew said: "You have spoken the truth, but you will not be able to uphold what has come to you. We find his description and the description of his nation in the Torah: 'It is not lawful for a man to step out from his doorstep while he has malice in his heart against his Muslim brother.'" From that is to remain silent about spreading his secret which was entrusted to him, and he may deny it even if he is lying, for truthfulness is not obligatory in every situation. Just as it is permissible for a man to conceal his own faults and secrets, even if it requires lying, he may do that regarding his brother, for his brother holds his station, and they are like a single person, differing only in body. This is the reality of brotherhood. Likewise, he should not be a show-off in his actions before him, moving from acts of secrecy to acts of publicity, for his brother's knowledge of his action is like his knowledge of himself, without difference. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever conceals the fault of his brother, God will conceal him in this world and the Hereafter." The Hadith: "Whoever conceals the fault of his brother, God will conceal him in this world and the Hereafter" was reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, and he said "on the Day of Resurrection" and did not say "in this world." And in Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever conceals a Muslim, God will conceal him in this world and the Hereafter." And in the Two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever conceals a Muslim, God will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection." And in another report: "It is as if he has given life to a buried infant." The Hadith: "It is as if he has given life to a buried infant from her grave" was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir: "Whoever sees a private part and conceals it, it is as if he has given life to a buried infant." Al-Hakim added "from her grave" and said its chain is authentic. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If a man relates a narration then turns away, it is a trust." The Hadith: "If a man relates a narration then turns away, it is a trust" was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Jabir, and he said it is *hasan*. And he said: "Gatherings are based on trust, except three gatherings: a gathering in which unlawful blood is shed, a gathering in which unlawful private parts are made lawful, and a gathering in which wealth is taken unlawfully." The Hadith: "Gatherings are based on trust except three gatherings..." was reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Jabir, from the narration of his unnamed nephew from him. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Two people who sit together do so based on trust, and it is not lawful for one of them to disclose about his companion what he dislikes." The Hadith: "Two people who sit together..."

Two companions who share a trust must not disclose what the other dislikes. Abu Bakr ibn Lal reported this in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* through a weak chain from Ibn Masʿūd, and Ibn al-Mubārak narrated it in *Al-Zuhd* from the transmission of Abu Bakr ibn Ḥazm as a *mursal* report. Al-Ḥākim authenticated it from the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās: "You sit together in trust." A certain man of refinement was asked, "How do you keep a secret?" He replied, "I am its grave." It has been said: "The breasts of the noble are graves for secrets." And it is said: "The fool’s heart is on his tongue, but the wise man’s tongue is in his heart"—meaning the fool cannot conceal what is within him and so reveals it unknowingly. Therefore, one must avoid fools and be wary of their company, even of seeing them. Another was asked, "How do you guard a secret?" He said, "I deny it to the informer and swear to the inquirer." Another said, "I conceal it as though I were veiling it." Ibn al-Muʿtazz expressed it thus: "A secret entrusted to me, I made its abode concealment, so I deposited it in my breast, and it became its tomb." Another, wishing to go further, said: "And what is a secret in my breast but a corpse in its grave? For I see the buried one awaiting resurrection, but I forget it until it is as though I never knew it existed." Were it permissible to conceal a secret between oneself and it, even the innermost parts would not know the secret. Someone divulged his secret to his brother, then asked, "Have you kept it?" He replied, "Rather, I have forgotten it." Abu Saʿīd al-Thawrī used to say, "If you wish to befriend a man, anger him, then send someone to question him about you and your secrets. If he speaks well and conceals your secret, then keep his company." Abu Yazīd was asked, "Whom do you keep company with?" He said, "One who knows of you what God knows, yet covers you as God covers you." Dhū al-Nūn said, "There is no good in the companionship of one who only wishes to see you faultless." And whoever reveals a secret in anger is base, for concealing it in contentment is demanded by all sound natures. A sage said, "Do not befriend one who changes toward you in four states: in his anger, his contentment, his greed, and his desire. Rather, the truth of brotherhood should remain firm through these varying conditions." Hence it is said: "You see the noble, when his bond is severed, conceal the ugly and display kindness; but you see the base, when his bond is dissolved, hide the good and manifest slander." Al-ʿAbbās said to his son ʿAbd Allāh, "I see this man"—meaning ʿUmar, may God be pleased with him—"advancing you above the elders. So remember five things from me: do not disclose a secret to him, do not backbite anyone in his presence, do not bring him a falsehood, do not disobey his command, and do not let him discover any treachery from you." Al-Shaʿbī said, "Each of these five words is better than a thousand." Among such matters is refraining from contention and dispute in all that your brother says. Ibn ʿAbbās said, "Do not argue with a fool, lest he harm you, nor with a forbearing person, lest he weary of you." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever abandons argument while he is in the wrong, a house is built for him in the suburbs of Paradise; and whoever abandons argument while he is in the right, a house is built for him in the highest part of Paradise." The ḥadīth "Whoever abandons argument while he is in the wrong, a house is built for him in the suburbs of Paradise" has preceded in the chapter on knowledge. This is despite the fact that abandoning it while in the wrong is obligatory, yet the reward for a supererogatory act is made greater because remaining silent when truth is on one’s side is harder on the soul than remaining silent over falsehood. Reward is according to the effort expended. The strongest cause for igniting the fire of resentment between brothers is contention and rivalry, for it is the very essence of turning away and severance. Severance begins first with opinions, then with words, then with physical separation. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not turn away from one another, do not hate one another, do not envy one another, do not sever ties, but be servants of God as brothers. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he does not wrong him, forsake him, or despise him. It is evil enough for a man to hold his Muslim brother in contempt." The ḥadīth "Do not turn away from one another, do not hate one another, do not envy one another, but be servants of God as brothers. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim..." is reported by Muslim from the ḥadīth of Abu Hurayrah, its beginning is agreed upon from his narration and the ḥadīth of Anas; part of it has preceded this by seven ḥadīths. The most severe form of contempt is contention, for whoever rebuts another’s speech has attributed him to ignorance and folly, or to negligence and error in understanding a matter as it truly is. All of that is contempt and provocation of the heart, causing alienation. In the ḥadīth of Abu Umāmah al-Bāhilī, he said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came out to us while we were disputing, and he became angry and said, 'Leave off contention, leave off contention, for its good is little. Leave off contention, for its benefit is scant and it stirs up enmity between brothers.'" The ḥadīth of Abu Umāmah: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came out to us while we were disputing, and he became angry and said, 'Leave off contention, for its good is little. Leave off contention, for its benefit is scant and it stirs up enmity between brothers'" is reported by al-Ṭabarānī in *Al-Kabīr* from the ḥadīth of Abu Umāmah, Abu al-Dardāʾ, Wāthilah, and Anas, without what follows "for its good is little."

Here to the end of the hadith, narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the narration of Abu Umamah. Its chain is weak. Some of the early pious predecessors said: "Whoever reproaches his brothers and does not see them, his chivalry (*muru'ah*) has diminished and his honor has departed." And Abdullah ibn al-Hasan said: "Beware of disputing with men, for you will not escape the cunning of a forbearing man or the sudden attack of a base one." And some of the predecessors said: "The most incapable of people is he who falls short in seeking brothers, and more incapable than him is he who loses one he has gained from among them." Much disputation causes belittlement and severance and bequeaths enmity. Al-Hasan [al-Basri] said: "Do not purchase the enmity of one man with the friendship of a thousand men." In summary, nothing incites disputation except showing distinction through superior intellect and merit, and despising the one rebutted by exposing his ignorance. This comprises arrogance, contempt, harm, and insulting with folly and ignorance. There is no meaning for enmity except this, so how can brotherhood and sincere friendship accommodate it? It is narrated from Ibn Abbas, from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Do not dispute with your brother, do not jest with him, and do not make him a promise and then break it." The hadith of Ibn Abbas, "Do not dispute with your brother..." was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *gharib* (uncommon); we do not know it except from this chain, meaning from the narration of Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, and the majority considered it weak. And the Prophet, upon him be peace, said: "You will not suffice people with your wealth, but let them be sufficed by a cheerful face and good character from you." The hadith, "You will not suffice people..." was reported by Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili, al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and Ibn 'Adi in *al-Kāmil*; it was weakened by some and al-Hakim authenticated it, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Disputation opposes good character. The early predecessors reached such a limit in cautioning against disputation and urging mutual assistance that they did not consider questioning permissible at all. They said: "If you say to your brother, 'Get up,' and he says, 'To where?' then do not accompany him." Rather, they said he should get up without asking. And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "I had a brother in Iraq, and I would come to him in times of need and say, 'Give me something from your wealth,' and he would toss me his purse, and I would take from it what I wanted. I came to him one day and said, 'I need something,' and he said, 'How much do you want?' and the sweetness of his brotherhood departed from my heart." And another said: "If you ask your brother for wealth and he says, 'What will you do with it?' then he has abandoned the right of brotherhood." Know that the foundation of brotherhood lies in speech, action, and compassion. Abu 'Uthman al-Hiri said: "Agreeing with brothers is better than having compassion for them." And it is as he said. The fourth right is upon the tongue through speech, for just as brotherhood necessitates silence about dislikes, it also necessitates speaking of likes; indeed, this is more specific to brotherhood, for whoever is content with silence keeps company with the inhabitants of graves. Brothers are only sought to benefit from them, not to be relieved of their harm. The meaning of silence is refraining from harm. Therefore, one must show affection to him with his tongue and inquire about his conditions in which inquiry is obligatory, such as asking about an affliction that has occurred, showing preoccupation of the heart because of it, and feeling the delay of his well-being. Likewise, regarding all his conditions that he dislikes, one should show with his tongue and actions his dislike for them; and regarding all his conditions that please him, one should show with his tongue his sharing in the joy for them. The meaning of brotherhood is sharing in ease and hardship. The Prophet, upon him be peace, said: "When one of you loves his brother, let him inform him." The hadith, "When one of you loves his brother..." was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan sahih* (good and authentic), and by al-Hakim from the narration of al-Miqdam ibn Ma'dikarib. He commanded informing because that causes an increase in love, for if he knows you love him, he will inevitably love you by nature. And if you know he also loves you, your love will inevitably increase. Thus, love continually increases from both sides and multiplies. Mutual love among believers is required by the Sacred Law and beloved to the Lord. Therefore, the way to it was taught, as he said: "Give gifts, and you will love one another." The hadith, "Give gifts..." was reported by al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it has preceded previously. From this is that you call him by the name he loves most, in his absence and presence. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Three things clarify for you the affection of your brother: that you greet him first when you meet him, that you make room for him in the gathering, and that you call him by the name he loves most." From this is that you praise him with what you know of the good aspects of his states, in the presence of one whose hearing he would appreciate, for that is among the greatest causes for attracting love. Likewise, praising his children, his family, his craft, his action, even his intellect, character, appearance, handwriting, poetry, composition, and all that pleases him—and that without lying or excess, but improving what accepts improvement is necessary. More emphatic than that is that you convey to him the praise of one who praised him, while showing joy, for concealing that is pure envy. From this is thanking him for his favor...

Your right is indeed based on his intention, even if it is not fully realized. Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever does not praise his brother for his good intention does not praise him for his good deed." Greater than this in fostering affection is defending him in his absence, whenever someone intends harm or explicitly or implicitly attacks his honor. The right of brotherhood demands striving for protection and support, rebuking the faultfinder, and speaking harshly to him. Remaining silent about this breeds resentment in the chest, alienates the heart, and is a shortcoming in the duty of brotherhood.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, likened two brothers to two hands, one washing the other, so that one may cleanse the other and stand in for him. The hadith comparing brothers to two hands was mentioned in the preceding chapter. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, also said: "The Muslim is the brother of the Muslim; he does not wrong him, nor betray him, nor let him down." The hadith "The Muslim is the brother of the Muslim" was mentioned earlier in the previous chapter, preceded by seven other hadiths. This is part of letting down and betrayal, for neglecting to defend his honor is like neglecting to defend his flesh. How base is a brother who sees you while dogs tear at and devour your flesh, yet he remains silent, unmoved by compassion or zeal to defend you! Tearing reputations is more grievous to souls than tearing flesh. Therefore, God the Exalted likened it to eating the flesh of a dead brother, saying: "Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?" The angel that represents it in a dream, what the spirit perceives from the Preserved Tablet through tangible symbols, represents backbiting as eating dead flesh. Indeed, whoever sees himself eating the flesh of a corpse is backbiting people, for that angel in its representation observes the correlation and appropriateness between a thing and its symbolic meaning in the spiritual sense conveyed by the symbol, not in the outward form.

Therefore, protecting brotherhood by repelling the censure of enemies and the obstinacy of faultfinders is obligatory in the covenant of brotherhood. Mujahid said: "Do not mention your brother in his absence except as you would love to be mentioned in your absence." Thus, you have two measures for this. First, consider that if what was said about him were said about you, and your brother were present, what would you love for your brother to say about you? You should then treat the one who attacks his honor accordingly. Second, imagine he is present behind a wall, hearing your words and thinking you are unaware of his presence. Whatever impulse of support for him would stir in your heart within his hearing and sight should be the same in his absence.

Some have said: "Whenever a brother of mine was mentioned in his absence, I imagined him sitting there and said about him what I would love for him to hear if he were present." Another said: "Whenever a brother of mine was mentioned, I imagined myself in his place and said about him what I would love to be said about me." This is the sincerity of Islam: to see for your brother only what you see for yourself.

Abu al-Darda' saw two oxen plowing in a field. One stopped to scratch its body, and the other stopped. He wept and said: "Thus are brothers in God, working for God. When one stops, the other concurs." Through this concurrence, sincerity is perfected. Whoever is not sincere in his brotherhood is a hypocrite. Sincerity is the equivalence of the unseen and the seen, the tongue and the heart, the secret and the open, the company and the solitude. Any discrepancy or variance in any of this is a flaw in affection, a blemish in religion, and a deviation from the path of the believers. Whoever cannot achieve this within himself, withdrawal and seclusion are better for him than brotherhood and companionship, for the duty of companionship is heavy, borne only by the sincere. Thus, its reward is immense, attained only by the divinely aided. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Treat well the neighbor who neighbors you, and you will be a Muslim. Treat well the companion who accompanies you, and you will a believer." The hadith "Treat well the neighbor who neighbors you, and you will be a Muslim. Treat well the companion who accompanies you, and you will a believer" was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, with the wording from the narration of Abu Hurayrah containing only the first part. Al-Tirmidhi said: "A believer." And he said: "Love for people what you love for yourself, and you will be a Muslim." Ibn Majah said: "A believer." Al-Daraqutni said the hadith is sound, and al-Quda'i narrated it in *Musnad al-Shihab* with the author's wording. Observe how he made faith the reward for companionship and Islam the reward for neighborliness. The distinction in merit between Islam and faith corresponds to the distinction in the hardship of fulfilling the duty of neighborliness versus the duty of companionship. For companionship entails many duties in closely connected, successive states perpetually, while neighborliness entails only occasional duties at distant intervals, not continuous.

Among these duties are teaching and sincere counsel. Your brother's need for knowledge is no less than his need for wealth. If you are rich in knowledge, it is your duty to share from your abundance and guide him to all that benefits him in religion and worldly life. If you teach and guide him, yet he does not act according to the knowledge, then sincere counsel is your duty. This is by mentioning the harms of that action and the benefits of abandoning it, and warning him of what he dislikes in this world and the Hereafter, so that he may desist.

And alert him to his faults, make the ugly appear ugly in his sight and the beautiful appear beautiful. However, this should be done in secrecy, with no one privy to it. For what is done publicly is rebuke and disgrace, while what is done in secret is compassion and sincere counsel. As the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The believer is a mirror to the believer." This was narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain, meaning he sees from him what he does not see from himself. Thus, a person benefits from his brother by gaining knowledge of his own faults. If he were alone, he would not benefit as he benefits from a mirror in discerning the faults of his apparent form. And Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever admonishes his brother in secret has advised him and adorned him, and whoever admonishes him publicly has disgraced him and blemished him." It was said to Mas'ur: "Do you like someone who informs you of your faults?" He replied: "If he advises me privately, then yes; but if he rebukes me publicly, then no." And he spoke the truth, for public admonition is disgrace. And God Almighty will admonish the believer on the Day of Resurrection under His canopy, in the shade of His covering, and He will make him stand before his sins in secret. And He may hand his sealed record of deeds to the angels who escort him to Paradise. When they near the gate of Paradise, they give him the sealed book to read. As for the people of wrath, they are called out before the witnesses, and their limbs are made to testify to their disgrace, thereby increasing them in humiliation and exposure. We seek refuge in God from disgrace on the Day of the Greatest Presentation. Thus, the difference between rebuke and sincere counsel lies in secrecy and publicity, just as the difference between tactful forbearance and blameworthy flattery lies in the motive prompting the overlooking. If you overlook for the safety of your religion and for what you see as the reform of your brother through overlooking, then you are being tactful. But if you overlook for your own gain, the pursuit of your desires, and the safety of your status, then you are a flatterer. And Dhu al-Nun said: "Do not accompany God except with compliance, nor creation except with sincere counsel, nor the self except with opposition, nor Satan except with enmity." If you say: "Since sincere counsel involves mentioning faults, it causes alienation of the heart, so how can that be part of the right of brotherhood?" Then know that alienation only occurs by mentioning a fault that your brother already knows about himself. But alerting him to what he is unaware of is the very essence of compassion and is a means of winning hearts—I mean the hearts of the wise. As for the foolish, pay them no heed. For one who alerts you to a blameworthy action you have committed or a blameworthy trait you have acquired, so that you may purify yourself from it, is like one who alerts you to a snake or scorpion under your garment that intends to destroy you. If you dislike that, how severe is your foolishness! Blameworthy traits are scorpions and snakes; in the Hereafter they are destroyers, for they sting hearts and spirits, and their pain is more severe than what stings the outer forms and bodies. They are created from the fire of God, kindled. For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to seek guidance in that from his brothers and would say: "May God have mercy on a man who presents to his brother his faults." Thus, 'Umar said to Salman when he came to him: "What has reached you about me that you dislike?" He excused himself, but 'Umar insisted. He said: "It reached me that you have two garments, wearing one by day and the other by night, and that you combine two dishes on one table." 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "As for these two, I have been spared them. Has anything else reached you?" He said: "No." And Hudhayfah al-Mar'ashi wrote to Yusuf ibn Asbat: "It reached me that you sold your religion for two morsels. I came upon a milk seller and said: 'For how much is this?' He said: 'For a sixth.' I said to him: 'No, for an eighth.' He said: 'It is yours,' and he recognized you. Remove from your head the veil of the heedless and awaken from the slumber of the dead. Know that whoever recites the Quran and is not enriched by it, and prefers the world, I fear that he may be among those who mock the signs of God." And God Almighty described the liars with some of them for the sincere advisers when He said: "But you do not love the sincere advisers." This concerns a fault he is heedless of. As for what you know he is aware of from himself, he is merely compelled by his nature, so it is not fitting to uncover his covering if he conceals it. If he reveals it, then gentleness in counsel is necessary, through allusion at times and explicit statement at others, to a degree that does not lead to alienation. If you know that counsel will have no effect on him and that he is compelled by his nature to persist in it, then silence about it is preferable. All of this pertains to what concerns your brother's interests in his religion or his worldly life. As for what pertains to his shortcoming regarding your right, the obligation is to bear it, pardon, overlook, and turn a blind eye. Addressing that is not part of sincere counsel at all. Indeed, if it is such that his persistence in it leads to severance, then admonition in secret is better than severance, and allusion is better than explicit statement, and writing is better than speaking directly, and forbearance is better than all, for your aim regarding your brother should be the reform of yourself by observing his rights, fulfilling his due, and bearing his shortcomings, not seeking his aid and benefit from him. Abu Bakr al-Kattani said: "A man kept company with me, and he was upon my heart."

Heavy was my heart, so I granted him something one day on condition that what was in my heart would depart, but it did not. Then one day I took him by the hand to the house and said to him, “Place your foot upon my cheek.” He refused, but I said, “It must be done.” So he did, and that feeling vanished from my heart.

Abu ‘Ali al-Rabati said: I kept company with ‘Abdullah al-Razi, who would journey into the desert. He said, “Either you must be the leader, or I.” I said, “Rather, you.” He said, “Then obedience is incumbent upon you.” I replied, “Yes.” So he took a saddlebag, placed provisions in it, and carried it on his back. Whenever I said to him, “Give me,” he would say, “Did you not say you are the leader? Then obedience is upon you.” One night the rain fell upon us, and he stood over my head until morning with a cloak over him while I sat, shielding me from the rain. I kept saying to myself, “Would that I had died before saying, ‘You are the leader.’”

The fifth truth: Forgiving slips and lapses. A friend’s lapse is either in his religion, by committing a sin, or in his duty to you, by falling short in brotherhood. As for what occurs in religion by committing a sin and persisting in it, you must be gentle in advising him with what will mend his state, gather his scattered affairs, and restore him to piety and righteousness. If you are unable and he remains persistent, then the paths of the Companions and the Followers differed regarding maintaining the right of affection or cutting ties. Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, inclined toward severance and said, “If your brother turns away from what he was upon, then hate him from the same place you loved him,” seeing this as required by love for God’s sake and hatred for God’s sake.

As for Abu al-Darda’ and a group of the Companions, they took the opposite view. Abu al-Darda’ said, “If your brother changes and shifts from what he was upon, do not abandon him for that, for your brother may go astray at one time and become upright at another.” Ibrahim al-Nakha’i said, “Do not cut off your brother, nor shun him for a sin he commits, for he may commit it today and abandon it tomorrow.” He also said, “Do not spread the slip of a scholar among the people, for a scholar may slip and then abandon it.” In the report: “Beware of the slip of a scholar, do not cut him off, and await his return.” The hadith, “Beware of the slip of a scholar, do not cut him off, and await his return,” was narrated by al-Baghawi in al-Mu‘jam and Ibn ‘Adi in al-Kamil from the hadith of ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf al-Muzani, and they considered it weak.

In a report from ‘Umar, he asked about a brother with whom he had sworn brotherhood, who then departed for Syria. Someone who had come from there was asked about him, and he said, “What has become of my brother?” He replied, “That one is a brother of Satan.” ‘Umar said, “Enough!” He said, “He has committed major sins until he fell into wine.” ‘Umar said, “When you intend to depart, inform me.” So when he was leaving, he wrote to him: “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, Forgiver of sin, Accepter of repentance, Severe in punishment…” Then he reproached and admonished him beneath that. When he read the letter, he wept and said, “God has spoken the truth, and ‘Umar has advised me.” So he repented and returned.

It is related that two brothers were tested, one of them with a passion. His brother became aware of it and said, “I have fallen ill. If you wish not to dissolve our companionship for God’s sake, then do so.” He replied, “I would never dissolve the bond of your brotherhood because of your error.” Then his brother made a covenant between himself and God not to eat or drink until God cured his brother of his passion. He passed forty days, each day asking him about his passion, and he would say, “The heart remains in its state.” He continued to waste away from grief and hunger until the passion departed from his brother’s heart after forty days. He informed him of this, and he ate and drank after nearly perishing from emaciation and weakness.

Likewise, it is related of two brothers from the early generations that one of them turned away from uprightness. It was said to his brother, “Will you not cut him off and shun him?” He replied, “At the time he has fallen into his stumble, he is in the greatest need of me taking him by the hand, being gentle with him in admonition, and supplicating for his return to what he was upon.”

It is narrated in Israelite traditions that two devout brothers were on a mountain. One descended to the city to buy meat for a dirham. He saw a prostitute near the butcher, gazed at her, fell in love with her, drew her to a secluded place, and lay with her. Then he stayed with her for three days, too ashamed to return to his brother out of disgrace for his transgression. His brother missed him and became concerned about him, so he descended to the city and kept asking about him until he was directed to him. He entered to find him sitting with her, embraced him, began kissing and holding him. The other denied even knowing him due to extreme shame. He said, “Rise, my brother, for I know your situation and your story. You have never been more beloved to me nor dearer than at this hour of yours.” When he saw that this did not lower him in his eyes, he rose and departed with him.

This is the way of some people, and it is more gentle and wiser than the way of Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him. And his way is more excellent and safer. If you say, “Why do you say this is more gentle and wiser? One who commits such a sin may not be taken as a brother initially, so cutting ties ultimately becomes obligatory, because if a ruling is established due to a cause, the analogy is that it ceases when the cause ceases. The cause for establishing brotherhood is cooperation in religion, and that does not persist with the commission of sin.” I say: As for it being more gentle, it is due to the gentleness, winning over, and compassion within it.

What leads to repentance and return is the persistence of shame during continued companionship. However, if one is cut off and his hope for companionship is severed, he becomes obstinate and persists. As for why it is more insightful, it is because brotherhood is a covenant that holds the status of kinship. Once established, the right is affirmed and fulfilling the covenant becomes obligatory. Part of fulfilling it is not to neglect the days of his need and poverty, for poverty in religion is more severe than poverty in wealth. If a calamity befalls him and an affliction strikes him, causing him to become impoverished in his faith, he should be watched over and cared for, not neglected. Rather, one should continually be gentle with him to help him escape from that predicament that has afflicted him. Brotherhood is a provision for calamities and the events of time, and this is among the severest of trials. The wicked person, if he accompanies a pious one and observes his fear and constancy, will soon return and feel ashamed of persistence. Even the lazy one, when he accompanies the diligent in work, becomes diligent out of shame. Ja‘far ibn Sulaymān said, “Whenever I slackened in work, I looked at Muḥammad ibn Wāsi‘ and his devotion to obedience, and my enthusiasm for worship would return to me, laziness would leave me, and I would work for a week.” This realization is that friendship is a bond like the bond of kinship, and a relative should not be abandoned due to sin. Therefore, God Almighty said to His Prophet, peace be upon him, regarding his clan, “If they disobey you, say, ‘I am innocent of what you do,’” and He did not say, “I am innocent of you,” out of respect for the right of kinship and the bond of relation. To this, Abū al-Dardā’ alluded when he was told, “Do you not hate your brother for doing such and such?” He replied, “I only hate his deed, otherwise he is my brother.” Brotherhood in faith is stronger than brotherhood in kinship, which is why a wise man was asked, “Who is dearer to you, your brother or your friend?” He said, “I only love my brother if he is my friend.” Al-Ḥasan said, “How many a brother your mother did not bear!” Hence it is said, “Kinship needs affection, but affection does not need kinship.” Ja‘far al-Ṣādiq, may God be pleased with him, said, “Affection of a day is a connection, affection of a month is kinship, affection of a year is a blood tie—whoever severs it, God will sever him.” Therefore, fulfilling the covenant of brotherhood, once established, is obligatory. This is our answer regarding initiating brotherhood with a sinner: if no prior right exists, but if kinship preceded, then certainly he should not be cut off but treated courteously. The proof is that abandoning brotherhood and companionship initially is not blameworthy or disliked; rather, some say solitude is preferable. However, severing brotherhood after its continuity is forbidden and blameworthy in itself, and its relation to abandoning it initially is like the relation of divorce to abandoning marriage. Divorce is more hated by God Almighty than abandoning marriage. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “The worst of God’s servants are those who spread slander and separate between loved ones.” Some predecessors said regarding covering the faults of brothers, “The devil’s wish is to cast something like this upon your brother so that you abandon and cut him off. What have you gained from loving your enemy?” This is because separating between loved ones is among the devil’s delights, just as committing sin is among his delights. If the devil achieves one of his two aims, the second should not be added to it. To this, the Prophet, peace be upon him, alluded regarding the man who insulted another who committed an indecency, saying, “Enough!” and rebuking him, and said, “Do not be helpers of Satan against your brother.” Through all this, the difference between continuity and initiation becomes clear, for associating with the corrupt is cautioned against, and separating from loved ones and brothers is also cautioned against. One who is safe from opposing another is not like one who is not safe. In initiation, one is safe, so we hold that avoidance and distance are preferable. In continuity, they conflict, so fulfilling the right of brotherhood is preferable. All this concerns his slip in his religion; as for his slip regarding your right, causing alienation, there is no disagreement that forgiveness and forbearance are preferable. Indeed, everything that can be interpreted in a good light and for which an excuse, near or far, can be conceived, is obligatory by the right of brotherhood. It has been said, “You should deduce seventy excuses for your brother’s slip; if your heart does not accept them, blame yourself and say to your heart, ‘How harsh you are! Your brother offers you seventy excuses and you do not accept them—you are at fault, not your brother.’” If it becomes apparent that it cannot be interpreted favorably, one should not become angry if able, but that is not possible. Al-Shāfi‘ī, may God have mercy on him, said, “Whoever is provoked and does not get angry is a donkey, and whoever is appeased and is not satisfied is a devil. So do not be a donkey or a devil.” Appease your heart on behalf of your brother, and beware of being a devil if you do not accept. Al-Aḥnaf said, “The right of a friend is that you bear from him three things: the injustice of anger, the injustice of familiarity, and the injustice of error.”

The slip, and another said: I have never insulted anyone, for if a noble person insults me, I am more deserving of forgiving him; or if a base person does so, I will not make my honor a target for him. Then he recited:

And I forgive the noble's fault, preserving him,
And turn away from insulting the base, out of nobility.

And it has been said: Take from your friend what is pure, and leave what is turbid, for life is too short for reproaching a friend over others. And whenever your brother apologizes to you, whether lying or truthful, accept his excuse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever is apologized to by his brother and does not accept his excuse, upon him is the sin of the tax-collector." (Hadith: "Whoever is apologized to by his brother and does not accept his excuse, upon him is the sin of the tax-collector." Reported by Ibn Majah and Abu Dawud in the Marasil from the narration of Jawdan, and there is disagreement about his companionship; Abu Hatim considered him unknown, while the rest of the narrators are trustworthy. Al-Tabarani reported it in Al-Awsat from the narration of Jabir with a weak chain.)

And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The believer is quick to anger and quick to be pleased." (Hadith: "The believer is quick to anger and quick to be pleased." I did not find it exactly like this. Al-Tirmidhi reported and graded it as good from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "Verily, the children of Adam are created in various categories..." and in it: "...and among them is one who is quick to return [to righteousness]." So that corresponds to that, but he did not describe him as not getting angry. Likewise, Allah the Exalted said: "And those who suppress anger," and did not say "those who lack anger." This is because habit does not reach the point where a person is wounded and feels no pain, but rather reaches the point where he is patient and endures it. Just as feeling pain from a wound is a requirement of the body's nature, feeling pain from causes of anger is the heart's nature, and it cannot be uprooted, but it can be controlled, suppressed, and acting contrary to its demand. For it demands retaliation, vengeance, and requital, and abandoning action according to its demand is possible. A poet said:

I will not preserve a brother whom you blame
For a fault—which man is refined?

Abu Sulayman al-Darani said to Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari: "If you befriend someone in this time, do not reproach him for what you dislike, for you cannot be safe from seeing in his response something worse than the first." He said: I tried it and found it so. And some said: "Patience with a brother's annoyance is better than reproaching him, and reproach is better than severance, and severance is better than slander." One should not exaggerate in hatred during slander. Allah the Exalted said: "Perhaps Allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Love your beloved moderately, for perhaps he may become your enemy one day, and hate your enemy moderately, for perhaps he may become your beloved one day." (Hadith: "Love your beloved moderately..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is rare. I say: Its narrators are trustworthy, narrators of Muslim, but the narrator hesitated in attributing it to the Prophet.) And 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "Let not your love be obsessive, nor your hatred destructive," meaning that you love the destruction of your companion along with your own ruin.

The sixth right: Supplicating for your brother during his life and after his death with all that you love for yourself, your family, and everything connected to him. So supplicate for him as you supplicate for yourself, and do not differentiate between yourself and him, for your supplication for him is truly supplication for yourself. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When a man supplicates for his brother in his absence, the angel says: 'And for you the same.'" (Hadith: "When a man supplicates for his brother in his absence, the angel says: 'And for you the same.'" Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu al-Darda'. In another wording: Allah the Exalted says: "And for you always, O My servant." (Hadith: Supplicating for a brother in his absence, and in it: Allah says: "And for you always, O My servant." I did not find this wording.) And in a hadith: "A man's supplication for his brother is answered in a way that is not answered for himself." (Hadith: "A man's supplication for his brother is answered in a way that is not answered for himself." I did not find it with this wording. Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi reported it and weakened it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "The quickest supplication to be answered is the supplication of an absent person for an absent person.") And in a hadith: "The supplication of a man for his brother in his absence is not rejected." (Hadith: "The supplication of a brother for his brother in absence is not rejected." Reported by al-Daraqutni in Al-Zill from the narration of Abu al-Darda', and it is in Muslim except that he said "is answered" instead of "is not rejected.") And Abu al-Darda' used to say: "I supplicate for seventy of my brothers in my prostration, naming them by name." And Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Isfahani said: "And where is the like of a righteous brother? Your family divides your inheritance and enjoys what you left behind, while he is alone in grief for you, concerned about what you forwarded and what you have become, supplicating for you in the darkness of night while you are under layers of earth." It is as if the righteous brother follows the example of the angels, for it came in a report: "When a servant dies, people say: 'What has he left behind?' and the angels say: 'What has he forwarded?'" (Hadith: "When a servant dies, people say: 'What has he left behind?' and the angels say: 'What has he forwarded?'" Reported by al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.) They rejoice for him for what he forwarded, ask about him, and feel compassion for him. And it is said: Whoever hears of the death of his brother and invokes mercy and seeks forgiveness for him, it is recorded.

It is as if he witnessed his funeral and prayed over him. It is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "The likeness of the deceased in his grave is that of a drowning man, clinging to everything, awaiting a supplication from a child, a parent, a brother, or a relative." The hadith: "The likeness of the deceased in his grave is that of a drowning man, clinging to everything, awaiting a supplication from a child or a parent," was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Al-Dhahabi said in *al-Mizan* that it is a very weak report, and that "from the supplication of the living, lights like mountains enter the graves of the dead." Some of the early generations said: "Supplication for the dead is like gifts for the living. An angel enters upon the deceased with a tray of light upon which is a handkerchief of light and says: 'This is a gift for you from your brother so-and-so, from your relative so-and-so.'" He said: "He rejoices at that just as the living rejoice at a gift."

The seventh truth is loyalty and sincerity. The meaning of loyalty is steadfastness in love and its continuation until death with him, and after death with his children and friends. For love is truly intended for the Hereafter. If it is severed before death, the deed is nullified and the effort is wasted. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said concerning the seven whom God will shade in His shade: "...and two men who love each other for the sake of God, meeting for that and parting for that." The hadith of the seven whom God will shade in His shade has been mentioned previously more than once. Some said: "A little loyalty after death is better than much of it in life." For this reason, it is narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, honored an old woman who entered upon him. When he was asked about that, he said: "She used to visit us in the days of Khadijah, and honoring the covenant is part of faith." The hadith about his honoring an old woman who entered upon him and his saying, "She used to visit us in the days of Khadijah, and good fidelity is from faith," was reported by al-Hakim from the narration of 'A'ishah, and he said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs and has no defect.

Part of loyalty to a brother is to care for all his friends, relatives, and those attached to him. Caring for them has a greater impact on the friend's heart than caring for the brother himself, for his joy at the care for those attached to him is greater. Indeed, nothing indicates the strength of compassion and love except their extension from the beloved to everyone attached to him, even the dog at the door of his house—it should be distinguished in the heart from other dogs. Whenever loyalty is severed by the cessation of love, Satan gloats over him, for he does not envy two people cooperating in righteousness as he envies two who are brothers for the sake of God and love each other for His sake. Indeed, he exerts himself to corrupt what is between them. God Almighty said: "And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces [dissension] among them." And He informed about Joseph, after Satan had sown discord between him and his brothers. It is said: "No two become brothers for the sake of God and then are separated except due to a sin one of them commits." Bishr used to say: "When a servant falls short in obeying God, God deprives him of those who would comfort him." This is because brothers are a solace for griefs and an aid in religion. For this reason, Ibn al-Mubarak said: "The most delightful of things is the companionship of brothers." Lasting affection is that which is for the sake of God. Whatever is for a worldly purpose vanishes with the vanishing of that purpose. Among the fruits of affection for the sake of God is that it is not accompanied by envy in religion or worldly matters. How could he envy him when everything that belongs to his brother ultimately returns in benefit to him? With this, God Almighty described those who love for His sake, saying: "And they find not in their breasts any need for what they have been given, but give them preference over themselves." The presence of need is envy.

Part of loyalty is that one's state of humility with his brother does not change, even if his status rises, his authority expands, and his rank becomes great. To become arrogant over brothers due to newly acquired states is base character. A poet said: "When the noble are enriched, they remember those who used to accompany them in the rough abode." One of the early generations advised his son, saying: "O my son, do not keep company with anyone among people except one who, if you are in need of him, draws near to you; if you are independent of him, he does not covet from you; and if his rank becomes high, he does not rise above you." Some of the wise said: "If your brother assumes authority and remains firm on half of his affection for you, that is much." Al-Rabi' narrated that al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, took a man in Baghdad as a brother. Then his brother assumed authority over the distributions, and he changed from how he was towards him. Al-Shafi'i wrote to him these verses: "Go, your love is divorced from my heart forever. Yet the divorce of separation is not the same. If you return, it is one divorce, and your love for me remains upon two. If you refuse, I pair it with its like, making it two divorces in two menstruations. And when the third comes to you from me decisively, authority over the distributions will not avail you."

Know that it is not part of loyalty to agree with a brother in what contradicts the truth in a matter pertaining to religion. Rather, loyalty to him is to oppose him. Indeed, al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, had taken Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Hakam as a brother. He would draw him near and turn to him, saying: "Nothing keeps me in Egypt except him." Muhammad fell ill, and al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, visited him.

The Exalted said: The beloved fell ill, so I visited him, and I fell ill from my anxiety over him. Then the beloved came to visit me, and I was healed by the sight of him. People, believing in the sincerity of their mutual affection, thought he would entrust the leadership of his circle to him after his death. Thus, it was said to Al-Shafi'i, during the illness from which he died, may God be pleased with him: "To whom shall we sit after you, O Abu Abdullah?" Muhammad ibn Abd al-Hakam, who was at his head, leaned forward, expecting to be indicated. But Al-Shafi'i said: "Glory be to God! Does Abu Ya'qub al-Buwayti leave any doubt in this matter?" Muhammad was crestfallen by this, and his companions inclined to al-Buwayti, even though Muhammad had learned his entire school from him. However, al-Buwayti was superior and closer to asceticism and piety. Thus, Al-Shafi'i gave sincere counsel for God and for the Muslims, abandoning flattery and not preferring the pleasure of creation over the pleasure of God, the Exalted. When he passed away, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Hakam turned away from his school and reverted to the school of his father, studying the books of Malik, may God have mercy on him—he being among the great companions of Malik, may God have mercy on him. Al-Buwayti preferred asceticism and obscurity; he disliked gathering and sitting in the teaching circle and busied himself with worship. He authored the book *Al-Umm*, which is now attributed to Rabi' ibn Sulayman and known by him, though it was al-Buwayti who authored it. However, he did not mention himself in it nor attribute it to himself. Rabi' added to it, made changes, and disseminated it. The point is that fidelity in love is perfected by sincere counsel for God. Al-Ahnaf said: "Brotherhood is a delicate jewel; if you do not guard it, it is exposed to ruin. So guard it by swallowing anger until you apologize to the one who wronged you, and by contentment so you do not deem your own virtue too much nor your brother's shortcoming too little." Among the marks of truthfulness, sincerity, and perfect fidelity is to be intensely aggrieved by separation, the nature recoiling from its causes, as it was said: "I found all the calamities of time to be light in gravity, save for the parting of loved ones." Ibn 'Uyaynah recited this verse and said: "I have known people whom I parted from thirty years ago, yet it does not seem to me that my longing for them has left my heart." And from fidelity is not to listen to people's reports about one's friend, especially from one who first appears as a lover of his friend, lest he be suspected, then casts words casually and relays from the friend what stirs rancor in the heart. That is among the subtleties of cunning in sowing discord, and whoever is not wary of it, his affection will not last at all. One said to a sage: "I have come to seek your affection." He said: "If you make its dowry three things, I will." He asked: "What are they?" He said: "Do not listen to reports about me, do not oppose me in a matter, and do not betray me in the dark." And from fidelity is not to befriend the enemy of one's friend. Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said: "If your friend obeys your enemy, they have partnered in hostility against you."

The eighth right is easing burdens and avoiding imposition and burdening. This is by not burdening one's brother with what is difficult for him, but rather relieving his heart of his concerns and needs, and sparing him from bearing any of his loads. Thus, one does not seek from him influence or wealth, nor impose humility upon him, inquiring after his states, and fulfilling his rights. Rather, one intends by his love only God, the Exalted, seeking blessing through his supplication, comfort in his company, assistance through him in his religion, and drawing nearer to God, the Exalted, by fulfilling his rights and bearing his expenses. Some said: "Whoever demands from his brothers what they cannot fulfill has wronged them; whoever demands from them the like of what they demand has wearied them; and whoever does not demand is the one who bestows favor upon them." And some sages said: "Whoever places himself with the brothers above his worth sins, and they sin; whoever places himself at his worth tires and tires them; and whoever places himself below his worth is safe, and they are safe." The completion of easing burdens is rolling up the carpet of imposition, so that one is not shy with him regarding what one is not shy about with oneself. Al-Junayd said: "No two have ever taken brotherhood for God's sake, then one of them felt estranged from his companion or was reserved, except due to a fault in one of them." And 'Ali, peace be upon him, said: "The worst of friends is he who is formal with you, who makes you need to be cautious, and who forces you to make excuses." And Al-Fudayl said: "People only cut ties due to formality. One of them visits his brother and is formal with him, so that cuts him off from him." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The believer is the brother of the believer; he does not deceive him nor is he reserved with him." And Al-Junayd said: "I visited four classes of this group, each class thirty men: Al-Harith al-Muhasibi and his class, Al-Hasan al-Musuhi and his class, Sari al-Saqati and his class, and Ibn al-Karibi and his class. No two had taken brotherhood for God's sake and one of them was reserved with his companion or felt estranged, except due to a fault in one of them." And it was said to one of them: "Whom should we accompany?" He said: "He who lifts from you the weight of formality and drops between you and him the burden of guardedness." And Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq, may God be pleased with them both, used to say: "The heaviest of my brothers upon me is he who is formal with me and whom I must be guarded with; the lightest on my heart is he with whom I am as I am alone." And one of the Sufis said: "Do not keep company with anyone among people except him with whom you are not increased by righteousness nor diminished by sin; that which is for you and against you is equal with him." He said this only to be free from formality and guardedness.

Otherwise, one's nature compels him to guard against it when he knows that it diminishes him in his sight. Some have said: Be with the people of this world through etiquette, with the people of the Hereafter through knowledge, and with the knowers of God as you wish. Another said: Keep company only with one who repents on your behalf when you sin, excuses you when you err, bears your burdens, and spares you his own burdens. The one who said this has narrowed the path of brotherhood for people, but the matter is not so. Rather, one ought to befriend every religious, intelligent person and resolve to fulfill these conditions himself, without imposing them on others, so that his brothers may be many, for thereby he befriends for the sake of God. Otherwise, his brotherhood is merely for his own interests. Hence, a man said to al-Junayd, "Brothers have become rare in this time; where is a brother for me in God?" Al-Junayd turned away until the man repeated it three times. When he persisted, al-Junayd said to him, "If you want a brother who spares you your burdens and endures your harm, then by my life, this is scarce. But if you want a brother in God for whose burdens you bear and whose harm you endure, then I have a group I can introduce to you." The man fell silent.

Know that people are of three kinds: a man whose company benefits you; a man whom you are able to benefit without being harmed by, though you do not benefit from him; and a man whom you cannot benefit and who harms you—he is the fool or the ill-mannered. This third kind you should avoid. As for the second, do not avoid him, for you will benefit in the Hereafter through his intercession, his supplication, and your reward for attending to him. God Almighty revealed to Moses, peace be upon him, "If you obey Me, how many will be your brothers," meaning if you are compassionate with them, endure from them, and do not envy them. Some have said, "I kept company with people for fifty years, and no disagreement occurred between me and them, for I was with them against myself." Whoever possesses this trait will have many brothers.

Among the means of ease and avoiding affectation is not to object in supererogatory acts of worship. A group of Sufis would accompany one another on the condition of equality in four matters: if one of them ate all day, his companion would not say to him, "Fast"; if he fasted perpetually, he would not say to him, "Break your fast"; if he slept all night, he would not say to him, "Get up"; and if he prayed all night, he would not say to him, "Sleep." His states were equal in his companion's sight, without increase or decrease, for if they differed, it would inevitably stir one's nature toward ostentation and guardedness. It has been said, "Whose affectation falls away, his intimacy endures; whose burdens are light, his affection lasts." Some Companions said that God has cursed the affectatious. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "I and the pious of my nation are free from affectation." The hadith, "I and my nation are free from affectation," was narrated by al-Daraqutni in al-Afrad from the hadith of al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam: "Indeed, I am free from affectation, and so are the righteous of my nation," though its chain is weak.

Some have said, "If a man performs four actions in his brother's house, his intimacy with him is complete." The hadith, "If a man performs four actions in his brother's house, his intimacy is complete," I found no basis for. They are: eating there, using the toilet, praying, and sleeping. This was mentioned to some shaykhs, and one said, "A fifth remains: that he be present with the family in his brother's house and have intercourse with her, for the house is made for privacy in the five matters; otherwise, mosques are more comforting to the hearts of worshippers." If he does these five, then brotherhood is complete, formality is lifted, and ease is confirmed. The Arabs' saying in their greetings points to this, as one says to his companion, "Marhaban, ahlan, sahlan"—meaning, "You have with us a *marhab* (welcome), which is spaciousness in heart and place; you have with us *ahl* (family) with whom you feel at ease without estrangement; you have from us and for us ease in all that, meaning what you desire is not difficult for us."

Ease and abandoning affectation are not complete unless one sees himself as less than his brothers, thinks well of them, and thinks ill of himself. If he sees them as better than himself, then he becomes better than them. Abu Mu'awiyah al-Aswad said, "All my brothers are better than me." It was said, "How is that?" He replied, "Each of them sees me as superior to him, and whoever prefers me over himself is better than me." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A man is upon the religion of his close friend, and there is no good in keeping company with one who does not see for you what you see for him." The first part of this was mentioned in the previous chapter, while the second part was narrated by Ibn 'Adi in al-Kamil from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain. This is the lowest degree: looking with the eye of equality. Perfection lies in seeing superiority for one's brother. Hence, Sufyan said, "If it is said to you, 'O worst of people,' and you become angry, then you are the worst of people," meaning you ought to always believe that about yourself. The explanation of this will come in the Book of Arrogance and Vanity.

Regarding the meaning of humility and seeing superiority for brothers, verses have been said: "Humble yourself before one for whom, if you humble yourself, he sees that as superiority, not foolishness. And avoid the friendship of one who always sees superiority for himself over friends." Another said...

How many a companion I have known through a friend who became dearer to me than the old friend, and a fellow traveler I saw upon the path who became, in my sight, the true friend. And whenever one sees merit in himself, he has despised his brother, and this is blameworthy among Muslims in general. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "It is sufficient evil for a believer to despise his Muslim brother." The hadith: "It is sufficient evil for a man to despise his Muslim brother" was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurairah. It was previously mentioned in the course of the hadith "Do not turn away from each other" in this chapter. Among the completion of ease and the abandonment of affectation is that one consults his brothers in all he intends and accepts their indications, for Allah Almighty has said: "And consult them in the matter." And he should not conceal from them anything of his secrets, as it is narrated that Ya'qub ibn Akhi Ma'ruf said: "Aswad ibn Salim came to my uncle Ma'ruf—and he was a sworn brother to him—and said: 'Bishr ibn al-Harith loves to enter into brotherhood with you, but he is too shy to address you directly with that. He has sent me to you asking that you establish for him, between you and him, a brotherhood he can count on and rely upon, except that he stipulates conditions in it: he does not wish it to become famous, and there should be no mutual visiting or meeting between you and him, for he dislikes frequent encounters.' Ma'ruf said: 'As for me, if I were to take someone as a brother, I would not love to be parted from him night or day, and I would visit him at all times and prefer him over myself in every state.' Then he mentioned many hadiths concerning the virtue of brotherhood and love for the sake of Allah. Then he said regarding it: 'And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, took 'Ali as a brother and shared with him in knowledge.' The hadith: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, took 'Ali as a brother and shared with him in knowledge' was narrated by al-Nasa'i in al-Khasa'is from his Sunan al-Kubra from the hadith of 'Ali who said: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, gathered the sons of 'Abd al-Muttalib...' In it: 'So which of you will pledge allegiance to me to be my brother, my companion, and my heir?' No one rose to him except I, so I rose to him...' until when it was the third time, he struck his hand upon my hand.' And for al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas that 'Ali used to say during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: 'By Allah, I am his brother, his close ally, and the heir to his knowledge.' The hadith. And all that has been reported concerning his specific brotherhood is weak; nothing from it is sound. And from al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "And you are my brother in this world and the Hereafter." And for al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "I am the city of knowledge and 'Ali is its gate," and he said its chain is sound. And Ibn Hibban said: "It has no basis." And Ibn Tahir said: "It is fabricated." And from al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of 'Ali: "I am the house of wisdom and 'Ali is its door," and he said it is rare. And his sharing with 'Ali in the sacrificial animal: the hadith of his sharing with 'Ali in the sacrificial animal was narrated by Muslim in the lengthy hadith of Jabir: "Then he gave to 'Ali, so he slaughtered what crossed... and he made him a partner in his sacrifice, and he married him to the best of his daughters and the most beloved to him, and he singled him out for that due to his brotherhood." The hadith: "He married 'Ali to the best of his daughters and the most beloved to him." This is well-known and famous. For in the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'Ali: "When I intended to marry Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, peace be upon him, I appointed a man who was a goldsmith..." The hadith. And for al-Hakim from the hadith of Umm Ayman: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, married his daughter Fatimah to 'Ali," the hadith, and he said its chain is sound. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'A'ishah concerning Fatimah: "O Fatimah, are you not pleased to be the mistress of the believing women?" The hadith. "And I bear witness to you that I have established for him a brotherhood between me and him, and I have established his brotherhood for the sake of Allah, for your message and for his request, on the condition that he does not visit me if he dislikes that, but I will visit him whenever I wish. And command him to meet me in places where we can meet, and command him not to conceal from me anything of his affairs, and to inform me of all his states." So Ibn Salim informed Bishr of that, and he was pleased and content with it. This encompasses the rights of companionship, which we have summarized at one time and detailed at another. And it is not complete except by being for your brothers against your own self, and not being for your own self against them, and by placing yourself in the position of a servant to them, so you are bound by all their rights in your vicinity. As for sight, it is by looking upon them with a look of affection they recognize from you, and looking at their virtues, and turning a blind eye to their faults, and not turning your gaze away from them at the time they turn to you and speak with you. It is narrated that he, peace be upon him, would give everyone who sat with him a share of his face, and no one felt belittled except that he thought he was the most honored of people with him, to the point that his gathering, his listening, his speech, his subtle questioning, and his attention to the one sitting with him—the hadith: "He would give everyone who sat with him his share of his face"—was narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the hadith of 'Ali in the course of a hadith: "He would give each of his sitting companions his share; no one sitting with him thought that anyone was more honored with him than the one sitting with him. And whoever asked him for a need, he would not turn him back except with it or with a kind word." Then he said: "His gathering was a gathering of forbearance, modesty, patience, and trustworthiness. In it, he would laugh at what they laughed at and be amazed at what they were amazed at." And for al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn...

I have never seen anyone smile more than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him—and this is a rare report. His gathering was one of modesty, humility, and trustworthiness. He, peace be upon him, was the most smiling and laughing of people toward the faces of his companions, showing delight in what they related to him. The laughter of his companions in his presence was a smile, following his example and honoring him, peace be upon him.

As for hearing, it is to listen to his speech, taking pleasure in hearing it, believing in it, and showing gladness at it—and not to interrupt their speech with one’s own desire, contention, interference, or objection. If an urgent matter distracts you, apologize to them, and guard your hearing from listening to what they dislike.

As for the tongue, we have already mentioned its duties, for speech on this subject is lengthy. Among them is not to raise one’s voice above theirs and not to address them except with what they understand.

As for the hands, it is not to withhold them from assisting them in everything that is undertaken by hand.

As for the feet, it is to walk with them behind others, walking as a follower, not as one followed, and not to go ahead of them except to the extent they advance, nor to draw near to them except to the extent they draw near. One should stand for them when they approach and not sit except when they sit, sitting humbly wherever one sits.

Whenever unity is complete, the burden of these duties—such as standing, apologizing, and praising—is lightened, for they are among the duties of companionship and contain a degree of formality and affectation. When unity is perfected, the carpet of affectation is entirely rolled up, and one proceeds only as one’s own self proceeds, for these outward manners are a sign of inward manners and purity of heart. Whenever hearts are purified, one is free from the affectation of displaying what is within them.

Whoever looks to the companionship of creation will sometimes deviate and sometimes be upright, but whoever looks to the Creator remains upright outwardly and inwardly, adorning his inward being with love for God and His creation, and adorning his outward being with worship of God and service to His servants—for that is the highest form of service to God, since there is no way to Him except through good character. By his good character, a servant attains the rank of one who fasts and prays.

As a conclusion to this chapter, we mention a collection of manners for companionship and sitting with various kinds of people, gleaned from the speech of some wise ones:

If you desire good companionship, meet your friend and your enemy with a face of contentment—without humiliation toward them or fear of them—and with respect without arrogance, and humility without degradation. In all your affairs, be in the middle course, for both extremes of matters are blameworthy.

Do not look at your sides, nor turn your head frequently, nor stop at crowds. When you sit, do not fidget, and guard against interlacing your fingers, playing with your beard or ring, picking your teeth, putting your finger in your nose, spitting frequently, clearing your throat, swatting flies from your face, and frequent stretching and yawning in the faces of people—whether in prayer or elsewhere.

Let your gathering be guiding and your speech well-ordered and arranged. Listen attentively to good speech from whoever speaks to you, without showing excessive astonishment, and do not ask him to repeat it. Be silent about jokes and tales, and do not speak of your admiration for your child, your slave-girl, your poetry, your composition, or anything else that is specific to you. Do not adorn yourself as a woman adorns herself, nor be coarse as a slave is coarse. Avoid excessive kohl and extravagance in perfume. Do not be insistent in requests, nor encourage anyone to oppression. Do not inform your family and children, let alone others, of the extent of your wealth, for if they see it as little, you will be belittled in their eyes, and if it is much, you will never attain their satisfaction. Admonish them without harshness and be gentle without weakness. Do not jest with your slave-girl or your slave, lest your dignity fall.

If you dispute, be dignified, guard against ignorance, avoid haste, and reflect on your argument. Do not gesture excessively with your hands, nor turn frequently to those behind you, nor kneel on your knees. When your anger subsides, then speak.

If a ruler is close to you, be with him as on the edge of a blade: if he is familiar with you, do not feel safe from his turning against you. Be gentle with him as you are gentle with a child, and speak to him with what he desires, as long as it is not disobedience. Do not let his kindness to you lead you to interfere between him and his family, children, or servants, even if you are deserving of that in his sight, for the slip of one who enters between a king and his family is a fall that cannot be revived and a misstep that cannot be excused.

Beware of the friend in times of ease, for he is the most hostile of enemies. Do not make your wealth more precious than your honor.

When you enter a gathering, its etiquette begins with greeting, not stepping over those who arrived first, sitting where there is space and where it is closest to humility, and greeting with peace those near you when you sit. Do not sit in the road, but if you do sit, its etiquette is lowering the gaze, supporting the oppressed, aiding the distressed, helping the weak, guiding the lost, returning the greeting, giving to the asker, commanding good, forbidding evil, seeking a place for spitting, not spitting toward the qibla nor to your right, but to your left and under your left foot.

Do not sit with kings, but if you do, its etiquette is to refrain...

Backbiting, avoiding falsehood, safeguarding secrets, minimizing needs, refining speech, and articulating clearly in discourse; discussing the manners of kings, minimizing jesting, and being highly cautious of them even if affection appears to you; not belching in their presence nor picking teeth after eating in their company. And it is for the king to endure everything except the divulging of secrets, disparaging the monarchy, and encroaching upon honor. Do not sit with the common folk, but if you do, discipline yourself by refraining from delving into their talk, listening little to their rumors, and overlooking the foul language that proceeds from them; meet with them sparingly even when in need of them. Beware of jesting with the intelligent or the foolish, for the intelligent will harbor resentment against you, and the foolish will become bold toward you, because jesting breaches dignity, diminishes the water of the face, begets rancor, strips away the sweetness of affection, tarnishes the understanding of the learned, emboldens the fool, lowers one's standing in the eyes of the wise, and is detested by the God-fearing. It deadens the heart, distances from the Lord Most High, brings about heedlessness, begets humiliation, darkens the innermost thoughts, kills the insights, multiplies faults, and exposes sins. It has been said that jesting only comes from frivolity or arrogance. And whoever is afflicted with jesting or idle talk in a gathering, let him remember God upon rising. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever sits in a gathering where much idle talk occurs and says before rising from that gathering: 'Glory be to You, O God, and praise be to You, I bear witness that there is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You,' will be forgiven for what occurred in that gathering." This hadith—"Whoever sits in a gathering where much idle talk occurs..."—was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah and he authenticated it.

The Third Chapter: On the Rights of the Muslim, Kinship, Neighbors, and the King, and the Manner of Association with Those Connected by These Bonds. Know that a person is either alone or with others, and since human life is impossible without mixing with those of his own kind, he must necessarily learn the etiquettes of association. Every associate has an etiquette in his association, and the etiquette is according to his right, and his right is according to the strength of the bond through which the association occurs. The bond is either kinship—which is the most specific—or the brotherhood of Islam—which is the most general—and within the meaning of brotherhood is encompassed friendship and companionship; or it is neighborliness; or the companionship of travel, the study circle, or learning; or friendship or brotherhood. Each of these bonds has degrees. Kinship has a right, but the right of the prohibited degree of kinship is more emphatic; and the prohibited kin has a right, but the right of the parents is more emphatic. Likewise, the neighbor has a right, but it varies according to his proximity or distance from the dwelling, and the disparity becomes apparent when compared, such that a fellow countryman in a foreign land takes the place of a relative in the homeland due to his specific right of neighborliness in the country. Similarly, the right of a Muslim becomes more emphatic with the strength of acquaintance, and acquaintances have degrees, for the right of one known by sight is not like the right of one known by hearing—indeed it is more emphatic. And acquaintance, after its occurrence, becomes more emphatic through interaction. Likewise, companionship varies in its degrees: the right of companionship in study and the study circle is more emphatic than the right of companionship in travel. Similarly, friendship varies, for when it strengthens it becomes brotherhood; if it increases further it becomes affection; if it increases further it becomes intimate friendship (khullah). And the intimate friend (khalil) is closer than the beloved (habib), for affection is what takes hold of the core of the heart, while intimate friendship is what permeates the secret of the heart. Thus every intimate friend is a beloved, but not every beloved is an intimate friend. The varying degrees of friendship are not hidden according to observation and experience. As for intimate friendship being above brotherhood, its meaning is that the term "khullah" denotes a state that is more complete than brotherhood. And you know it from his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "If I were to take an intimate friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend, but your companion is the intimate friend of God." This hadith—"If I were to take an intimate friend..."—is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Thus the intimate friend is one whose love permeates all parts of his heart, outwardly and inwardly, and encompasses it. And nothing encompassed the heart of the Prophet, peace be upon him, except the love of God, and intimate friendship prevented him from sharing in it, although he took 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, as a brother, saying: "'Ali is to me as Aaron was to Moses, except for prophethood." This hadith—"'Ali is to me as Aaron was to Moses..."—is agreed upon from the narration of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. Thus he equated 'Ali with prophethood just as he equated Abu Bakr with intimate friendship. So Abu Bakr shared with 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both, in brotherhood, and surpassed him in proximity to intimate friendship and his eligibility for it, had sharing in intimate friendship been possible. For he indicated it by his saying: "I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, was the beloved of God and His intimate friend. It has been narrated that he ascended the pulpit one day, joyful and happy, and said: "God has taken me as an intimate friend just as He took Abraham as an intimate friend, so I am the beloved of God and I am the intimate friend of God Almighty."

God took me as an intimate friend, just as He took Abraham as an intimate friend—a hadith transmitted by al-Tabarani from the narration of Abu Umamah with a weak chain, excluding the phrase “so I am the beloved of God and I am the intimate friend of God.” Therefore, there is no bond before intimate knowledge (ma‘rifah) and no rank beyond intimate friendship (khullah), and whatever other ranks exist lie between them. We have already mentioned the rights of companionship and brotherhood, which encompass what lies beyond them, namely affection and intimate friendship. Ranks in these rights vary, as previously explained, according to the degree of affection and brotherhood, until their utmost extent obliges preference with one’s soul and wealth, as Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, preferred our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and as Talhah preferred him with his body when he made himself a shield for his noble person, peace and blessings be upon him.

Now we wish to mention the rights of Islamic brotherhood, the rights of kinship, the rights of parents, the rights of neighbors, and the rights of ownership—meaning the ownership of the right hand, for the rights of marital ownership we have already mentioned in the Book of the Etiquettes of Marriage.

The rights of a Muslim are that you greet him when you meet him, respond to him when he calls you, bless him when he sneezes, visit him when he is ill, attend his funeral when he dies, fulfill his oath when he adjures you, advise him when he seeks counsel, protect him in his absence when he is away from you, love for him what you love for yourself, and dislike for him what you dislike for yourself. It is to greet him when you meet him—then he mentioned ten traits—narrated by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

The right of a Muslim upon a Muslim is five: returning the greeting, visiting the sick, following funeral processions, accepting invitations, and blessing the sneezer. In a narration of Muslim: The right of a Muslim upon a Muslim is six: when you meet him, greet him—and he added: and when he seeks your counsel, advise him. And in the hadith of ‘Ali from al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah: A Muslim has six rights upon a Muslim—among them he mentioned: and love for him what you love for yourself. And he said: and advise him whether he is absent or present. And from the hadith of Mu‘adh in Ahmad: and that you love for people what you love for yourself and dislike for them what you dislike for yourself. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of al-Bara’: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us with seven—among them he mentioned: fulfilling oaths, aiding the oppressed. All of this is encompassed in reports and traditions.

It has been narrated from Anas, may God be pleased with him, from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: Four are among the rights of Muslims upon you: that you assist the doer of good among them, seek forgiveness for the sinner among them, supplicate for the one who turns away among them, and love the repentant among them—the hadith of Anas: Four are among the rights of Muslims upon you: that you assist the doer of good among them, seek forgiveness for the sinner among them, supplicate for the one who turns away among them, and love the repentant among them. Mentioned by the author of al-Firdaws, but I did not find a chain for it.

And Ibn ‘Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said regarding the meaning of God’s saying, “merciful among themselves” (Qur’an 48:29): The righteous among them supplicate for the wicked, and the wicked supplicate for the righteous. So when the wicked one looks at the righteous one from the community of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, he says: O God, bless him in what You have apportioned for him of good and make him steadfast in it, and benefit us through him. And when the righteous one looks at the wicked one, he says: O God, guide him, accept his repentance, and forgive his misstep.

And among them is that he loves for the believers what he loves for himself and dislikes for them what he dislikes for himself. Al-Nu‘man ibn Bashir said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: The likeness of the believers in their mutual affection, mercy, and compassion is that of a body: when one limb complains, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness—the hadith of al-Nu‘man ibn Bashir: The likeness of the believers in their mutual affection and compassion is that of a body—agreed upon. And Abu Musa narrated from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: The believer to the believer is like a building, each part strengthening the other—the hadith of Abu Musa: The believer to the believer is like a building, each part strengthening the other—agreed upon.

And among them is that he does not harm any Muslim by action or speech. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe—the hadith: The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe—agreed upon from the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in a lengthy hadith in which he commands virtues: If you are unable, then refrain from harming people, for that is a charity you give to yourself—the hadith: If you are unable, then refrain from harming people, for that is a charity you give to yourself—agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Dharr. And he also said: The best of Muslims is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe—the hadith: The best of Muslims is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe—agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Do you know who the Muslim is? They said: God and His Messenger know best. He said: The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. They said: Then who is the believer? He said: He whom the believers trust with their lives and wealth. They said: Then who is the emigrant? He said: He who emigrates from evil and avoids it—the hadith: Do you know who the Muslim is? They said: God and His Messenger know best. He said: The Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand they are safe—transmitted by al-Tabarani and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the hadith of Fadalah ibn ‘Ubayd. Shall I inform you...

The believer is one whom people trust with their wealth and lives. The Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand other Muslims are safe. The striver is one who strives against his own soul in obedience to God. The emigrant is one who abandons sins and transgressions.

Ibn Majah narrated it, limiting it to the believer and the emigrant. Al-Hakim narrated from the hadith of Anas, saying it meets Muslim's conditions: "The emigrant is one who abandons evil." Ahmad narrated with a sound chain from the hadith of 'Umar ibn 'Abasah: A man said, "O Messenger of God, what is Islam?" He said, "That you submit your heart to God, and that Muslims are safe from your tongue and your hand." A man said, "O Messenger of God, what is Islam?" He said, "That you submit your heart to God, and that Muslims are safe from your tongue and your hand."

Mujahid said: Scabies will be set upon the people of the Fire, and they will scratch until the bone of one of them shows through his skin. He will call out, "O so-and-so, does this harm you?" He will say, "Yes." He will say, "This is because of the harm you used to inflict upon the believers."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "I saw a man turning about in Paradise for a tree he had cut from the roadside that was harming Muslims." The hadith: "I saw a man in Paradise turning about for a tree he had cut from the roadside that was harming Muslims." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: "O Messenger of God, teach me something by which I may benefit." He said, "Remove harm from the path of Muslims." The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "O Messenger of God, teach me something by which I may benefit." He said, "Remove harm from the path of Muslims." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Barzah, who said: I said, "O son of God?" and he mentioned it.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever removes from the path of Muslims something that harms them, God records for him a good deed for it. And for whom God records a good deed, He makes Paradise obligatory for him because of it." The hadith: "Whoever removes from the path of Muslims something that harms them, God records for him a good deed for it. And for whom God records a good deed, He makes Paradise obligatory for him because of it." Ahmad narrated it from the hadith of Abu al-Darda' with a weak chain.

He, peace be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for a Muslim to point at his brother with a glance that harms him." And he said: "It is not lawful for a Muslim to frighten a Muslim." The hadith: "It is not lawful for a Muslim to look at his brother with a look that harms him." Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in *Al-Zuhd* from the narration of Hamzah ibn 'Ubayd, *mursal* with a weak chain. In *Al-Birr wa al-Silah* by him, from the additions of al-Husayn al-Marwazi: Hamzah ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abi Sumayyah, and this is correct.

He, peace be upon him, said: "God dislikes harming the believers." The hadith: "God, the Exalted, dislikes harming the believers." Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in *Al-Zuhd* from the narration of 'Ikrimah ibn Khalid, *mursal* with a good chain.

Al-Rabi' ibn Khaytham said: "People are of two kinds: a believer, so do not harm him; and an ignorant one, so do not contend with him."

Among them is that he shows humility to every Muslim and does not act arrogantly toward him, for God does not love every arrogant boaster. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God, the Exalted, revealed to me that you should be humble so that no one boasts over another." The hadith: "God revealed to me that you should be humble so that no one transgresses against another." Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah narrated it, and the wording is his, from the hadith of 'Iyad ibn Jumaz, and its narrators are the narrators of *Sahih*.

Then, if another boasts over him, let him bear it. God, the Exalted, said to His Prophet, peace be upon him: "Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant." From Ibn Abi Awfa: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would show humility to every Muslim. He would not disdain or act arrogantly to walk with a widow or a poor person to fulfill his need. The hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa: "He would not disdain or act arrogantly to walk with a widow or a poor person to fulfill his need." Al-Nasa'i narrated it with a sound chain, and al-Hakim said it meets the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

Among them is that he does not listen to people's reports about one another, nor does he convey to some what he hears from others. He, peace be upon him, said: "The slanderer will not enter Paradise." The hadith: "The slanderer will not enter Paradise." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Ayyub. Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad said: "Whoever backbites to you will backbite about you. Whoever informs you of the good of others will inform others of your news."

Among them is that he does not extend the shunning of someone he knows beyond three days, no matter how angry he is with him. Abu Ayyub al-Ansari said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days. They meet, and this one turns away, and that one turns away. The best of them is the one who initiates the greeting." "It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days." The hadith is agreed upon.

He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever overlooks the stumble of a Muslim, God will overlook his stumble on the Day of Resurrection." The hadith: "Whoever overlooks the stumble of a Muslim, God will overlook his stumble on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Dawud and al-Hakim narrated it, and it has preceded.

'Ikrimah said: God, the Exalted, said to Yusuf ibn Ya'qub: "By your pardoning your brothers, I have raised your mention in both abodes." 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, never took revenge for himself, unless the sanctity of God was violated; then he would take revenge for God."

From Aisha, may God be pleased with her: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, never avenged himself for any wrong, unless a sacred ordinance of God was violated; then he would exact retribution for God." This is agreed upon, with the wording: "unless it was transgressed." And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "No man pardons an injustice but that God increases him in honor thereby." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Wealth is not diminished by charity, and God increases a man in nothing by his pardon except honor, and no one humbles himself for God but that God elevates him." A narration states: "Wealth is not diminished by charity, and God increases a man in nothing by his pardon except honor, and no one humbles himself for God but that God elevates him." This was reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Huraira.

And among them is that one acts with goodness toward everyone over whom one has the capacity, to the best of one's ability, making no distinction between family and non-family. Ali ibn al-Husain reported from his father, from his grandfather, may God be pleased with them, that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Perform acts of kindness to those deserving of it and to those not deserving of it. If you find the deserving one, then he is the rightful recipient. And if you do not find the deserving one, then you yourself are of its people." A narration from Ali ibn al-Husain from his father from his grandfather states: "Perform acts of kindness to its people. If you do not find its people, then you are its people." Al-Daraqutni mentioned it in 'Al-'Ilal, and it is weak. And Al-Quda'i reported it in Musnad al-Shihab from the narration of Ja'far ibn Muhammad from his father from his grandfather as a mursal narration with a weak chain. And from him with his chain, he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The pinnacle of intellect after faith is showing affection to people and performing acts of kindness to every righteous and wicked person." A narration from Ali ibn al-Husain from his father from his grandfather states: "The pinnacle of intellect after faith is showing affection to people and performing acts of kindness to every righteous and wicked person." This was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat and Al-Khattabi in Tarikh al-Talibin, and in Abu Nu'aym's Al-Hilya without the phrase "and performing acts of kindness..." etc. And Al-Tabarani said: "showing affection." Abu Huraira said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would not take anyone's hand and then withdraw his own until the man was the one to release it. And one would not see his knee protruding beyond the knee of his companion. And no one would speak to him but that he would turn his face toward him, and he would not turn it away until the person had finished speaking." A narration from Abu Huraira: "He would not take anyone's hand and then withdraw his hand until the man was the one to release it." The hadith was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat with a good chain. And Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah have something similar from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

And among them is that one does not enter upon any of them except with permission; rather, one seeks permission three times. If permission is not granted, one departs. Abu Huraira, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Seeking permission is three times. The first is for them to become attentive, the second for them to prepare, and the third: they either grant permission or refuse." A narration from Abu Huraira: "Seeking permission is three times. The first is for them to become attentive, the second for them to prepare, and the third: they either grant permission or refuse." This was reported by Al-Daraqutni in Al-Afrad with a weak chain. And in the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Musa: "Seeking permission is three times. If you are granted permission, (enter); otherwise, return."

And among them is that one interacts with all people with good character and treats them according to their disposition, for if one intends to meet the ignorant with knowledge, the unlettered with jurisprudence, and the inarticulate with eloquence, one causes harm and is harmed. And among them is that one honors the elders and shows mercy to the young. Jabir, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "He is not of us who does not honor our elders and does not show mercy to our young." A narration from Jabir: "He is not of us who does not honor our elders and show mercy to our young." Reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat with a weak chain, and it is in Abu Dawud and Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab from the narration of Abdullah ibn Amr with a good chain. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Part of glorifying God is honoring the elderly Muslim." A narration: "Part of glorifying God is honoring the elderly Muslim." Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari with a good chain.

And part of complete honor for elders is that one does not speak in their presence except with permission. And Jabir said: A delegation from Juhaynah came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and a youth stood up to speak. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Be quiet! Where is the elder?" A narration from Jabir: "A delegation from Juhaynah came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and a youth stood up to speak. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Be quiet! Where is the elder?'" Reported by Al-Hakim who graded it authentic. And in the report: "No youth honors an elder for his age but that God appoints for him in his own age one who will honor him." A narration: "No youth honors an elder for his age but that God appoints for him in his own age one who will honor him." Reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Anas with the wording: "No one honors..." and he said it is a rare (gharib) hadith. In some copies it is graded hasan. In it is Abu al-Rijal, who is weak. This is glad tidings of enduring life, so let one be mindful of it, for none is granted success in honoring elders except one for whom God has decreed a long life.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The Hour will not be established until the child becomes a source of rage, and rain becomes scorching heat, and the vile overflow abundantly and the noble diminish, and the young become insolent toward the elder."

The vile person's speech against the noble is baseless. The Hour will not be established until the child becomes a source of wrath and rain becomes scorching heat. This hadith was narrated by Al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq from the narration of 'A'ishah, and by Al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and their chains are weak. Being gentle with children was from the habitual practice of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. The hadith about being gentle with children was reported by Al-Bazzar from the narration of Anas: He was the most playful of people with a child. This has preceded in the chapter on marriage. In the two Sahih collections: "O Abu 'Umayr, what has the little sparrow done?" and other similar instances. He, peace and blessings be upon him, would return from a journey and the children would meet him. He would stop for them, then order that they be lifted up to him. So they would be lifted, and he would carry some in front of him and some behind him, and he would order his companions to carry some of them. The hadith: "He would return from a journey and the children would meet him. He would stop for them, then order that they be lifted up to him..." was narrated by Muslim from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far: "When he returned from a journey, we were taken to meet him." He said: "So I and Al-Hasan were brought, and he said, 'So he carried one of us in front of him and the other behind him.'" In another narration: "The children of his household were brought to meet him, and he returned from a journey. I raced to him ahead of the others, so he carried me in front of him. Then one of Fatimah's sons was brought, and he seated him behind him." In the two Sahih collections, 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far said to Ibn al-Zubayr: "Do you remember when we, you and Ibn 'Abbas, met the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him?" He said: "Yes, he carried us and left you." These are the words of Muslim. Al-Bukhari said that Ibn al-Zubayr said to Ibn Ja'far: "God knows best." Perhaps the children would later boast to one another, some saying to others: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, carried me in front of him and carried you behind him," and some saying: "He ordered his companions to carry you behind them." He would be brought a small child to pray for blessings for him and to name him. He would take him and place him in his lap. Sometimes the child would urinate, and some of those who saw it would shout at him. He would say: "Do not interrupt the child from his urination." He would leave him until he finished urinating, then complete his prayer for him and his naming, and he would convey joy to his family regarding him, lest they think he was bothered by his urine. When they left, he would wash his garment afterward. The hadith: "He would be brought a small child to pray for blessings for him and to name him. He would take him and place him in his lap. Sometimes the child would urinate, and some of those who saw it would shout..." was narrated by Muslim from the narration of 'A'ishah: "Children were brought to him, and he would pray for blessings upon them and perform *tahnik* for them. A baby was brought to him, and he urinated on him. He called for water and followed the trace of his urine with it, and did not wash it." Its origin is agreed upon. In a narration of Ahmad: "And he would pray for them, and in it: 'They poured water on him, a pouring.'" And in Al-Daraqutni: "Ibn al-Zubayr urinated on the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, so he took him with a firm grasp." The hadith contains Al-Hajjaj ibn Artah, who is weak. And in Ahmad ibn Mani' from the narration of Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali from a woman among them: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was reclining on his back, playing with a child, when he urinated. She stood up to take him and strike him. He said: 'Leave him. Bring me a jug of water.'" Its chain is sound. Among them is that he would be with all people cheerful, with a radiant face, gentle. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do you know for whom the Fire is forbidden?" They said: "God and His Messenger know best." He said: "For the gentle, the easygoing, the lenient, the approachable." The hadith: "Do you know for whom the Fire is forbidden? They said: 'God and His Messenger know best.' He said: 'For the easygoing, the gentle, the lenient, the approachable.'" This was reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and he did not mention "the gentle." Al-Khara'iti mentioned it from the narration of Muhammad ibn Abi Mu'ayqib from his mother. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan, gharib." Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, God loves the easygoing, the one with a radiant face." The hadith of Abu Hurayrah that God loves the easygoing, the radiant-faced, was reported by Al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman with a weak chain, and he narrated it from the narration of Mawriq al-'Ijli as *mursal*. Some of them said: "O Messenger of God, guide me to a deed that will admit me to Paradise." He said: "Indeed, among the necessitators of forgiveness are offering peace and speaking kindly." The hadith that among the necessitators of forgiveness are offering peace and speaking kindly was reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah in his *Musannaf*, Al-Tabarani, Al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq—and the wording is his—and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman from the narration of Hani' ibn Yazid with a good chain. And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said: "Righteousness is something easy: a cheerful face and soft speech." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Guard yourselves against the Fire, even with half a date. Whoever does not find that, then with a good word." The hadith "Guard yourselves against the Fire, even with half a date..." is agreed upon from the narration of 'Adi ibn Hatim, and it has preceded in the chapter on Zakat. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, in Paradise there are chambers whose outsides can be seen from their insides and their insides from their outsides." A Bedouin said: "For whom are they, O Messenger of God?" He said: "For him who speaks kindly, feeds food, and prays at night while people are asleep." The hadith "Indeed, in Paradise there are chambers whose outsides can be seen from their insides and their insides from their outsides..." was reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'Ali, and he said...

A rare hadith, which I consider weak, and Mu'adh ibn Jabal reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me, "I enjoin upon you to fear God, to speak truthfully, to fulfill promises, to discharge trusts, to abandon treachery, to protect the neighbor, to show mercy to the orphan, to speak gently, and to offer greetings generously." The hadith of Mu'adh: "I enjoin upon you to fear God and to speak truthfully," was transmitted by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, al-Bayhaqi in *Kitāb al-Zuhd*, and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah*. Al-Bayhaqi did not mention "and to lower the wing," and its chain is weak.

Anas, may God be pleased with him, reported: A woman approached the Prophet of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I have a need with you," while he was with some of his companions. He said, "Sit in whichever part of the streets you wish, and I will sit with you." She did so, and he sat with her until she had fulfilled her need. The hadith of Anas: "A woman approached the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, 'I have a need with you.' He said, 'Sit in whichever part of the streets you wish, and I will sit with you.'" This was narrated by Muslim.

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: A man from the Children of Israel fasted for seventy years, breaking his fast every seven days. He asked God Almighty to show him how Satan misleads people. When it became prolonged for him and he was not answered, he said, "If I were to become aware of my misstep and sin between myself and my Lord, it would be better for me than this matter I have requested." So God sent an angel to him who said, "God has sent me to you, and He says: 'This speech of yours that you have spoken is more beloved to Me than the worship that has passed from you.' And God has opened your sight, so look." He looked and saw the troops of Iblis surrounding the earth, and there was not a single person except that devils were around him like wolves. He said, "O Lord, who is saved from this?" He said, "The pious and the gentle." And among them is that a Muslim should not make a promise except that he fulfills it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A promise is a gift." The hadith "A promise is a gift" was transmitted by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the hadith of Thabit ibn Ashyam with a weak chain. And he said, "A promise is a debt." The hadith "A promise is a debt" was narrated by al-Tabarani in his two compilations, *al-Awsat* and *al-Asghar*, from the hadith of 'Ali and Ibn Mas'ud with an unknown chain, and Abu Dawud narrated it in *al-Marasil*. And he said, "Three traits characterize a hypocrite: when he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks it; and when he is entrusted, he betrays." The hadith "Three traits characterize a hypocrite: when he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks it; and when he is entrusted, he betrays" is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and similar narrations. And he said, "Whoever possesses three traits is a hypocrite, even if he fasts and prays." The hadith "Whoever possesses three traits is a hypocrite, even if he fasts and prays" was narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and its origin is agreed upon. The wording of Muslim is: "even if he fasts and prays and claims to be a Muslim," and this is not in al-Bukhari, but he mentioned that.

And among them is that one deals justly with people regarding himself and does not come to them except with what he loves to be done to him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A servant does not perfect faith until he possesses three traits: spending from scarcity, dealing justly from himself, and offering greetings generously." The hadith "A servant does not perfect faith until he possesses three traits: spending from scarcity, dealing justly from himself, and offering greetings generously" was transmitted by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* from the hadith of 'Ammar ibn Yasir, and al-Bukhari stopped at it. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever is pleased to be removed from the Fire and enter Paradise, let death come to him while he testifies that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and let him come to people with what he loves to be done to him." The hadith "Whoever is pleased to be removed from the Fire, let death come to him while he testifies that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and let him come to people with what he loves to be done to him" was transmitted by Muslim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As in a similar wording, and by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with its exact wording. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "O Abu al-Darda', be a good neighbor to whoever neighbors you, and you will be a believer; and love for people what you love for yourself, and you will be a Muslim." The hadith "O Abu al-Darda', be a good neighbor to whoever neighbors you, and you will be a believer; and love for people what you love for yourself, and you will be a Muslim" was transmitted by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with a weak chain, and it is well-known that he said it to Abu Hurayrah, as previously mentioned.

Al-Hasan said: God Almighty revealed to Adam, peace be upon him, four traits and said, "In them is the totality of the matter for you and your children: one is for Me, one is for you, one is between Me and you, and one is between you and creation. As for the one for Me: that you worship Me and associate nothing with Me. As for the one for you: your deed, I will reward you for it when you are most in need of it. As for the one between Me and you: upon you is supplication and upon Me is response. As for the one between you and people: that you accompany them with what you love for them to accompany you with."

And Moses, peace be upon him, asked God Almighty, saying, "O Lord, which of Your servants is most just?" He said, "The one who is just regarding himself." And among them is that one increases in honoring those whose appearance and clothing indicate a high station, and that one places people in their proper stations. It is narrated that 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, was on a journey and she alighted...

A woman prepared food in her home, and a beggar came. 'A'isha said, "Give this poor man a piece of bread." Then a man on a mount passed by, and she said, "Invite him to the food." It was said to her, "You give to the poor man and invite this rich man?" She replied, "Verily, Allah the Exalted has placed people in ranks, and it is incumbent upon us to place them in those ranks. This poor man is content with a piece of bread, but it would be unbecoming of us to give this rich man, in such a state, a mere piece of bread."

It is narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, entered one of his rooms, and his companions entered upon him until the gathering was crowded and full. Then Jarir ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali came and could not find a place, so he sat by the door. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, folded his cloak and threw it to him, saying, "Sit on this." Jarir took it, placed it on his face, kissed it, and wept. Then he folded it and threw it back to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saying, "I would not sit on your garment. May Allah honor you as you have honored me." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, looked to his right and left, then said, "When a noble person from a people comes to you, honor him." The full narration of Jarir ibn 'Abdullah's arrival is recorded by al-Hakim from the hadith of Jabir, who said its chain is sound. A concise version is also mentioned in the chapter on Zakat. Likewise, whoever has an old right over you, honor him.

It is narrated that the wet-nurse of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, who suckled him, came to him. He spread his cloak for her and said, "Welcome, my mother." Then he seated her upon the cloak and said to her, "Intercede, and your intercession will be accepted. Ask, and you will be given." She said, "My people." He said, "As for my right and the right of Banu Hashim, it is granted." Then the people from every side stood up and said, "And our right, O Messenger of Allah?" He later maintained ties with her, provided her with a servant, and gifted her his share from Hunayn. The hadith about the wet-nurse of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, who suckled him, coming to him and him spreading his cloak for her is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the hadith of Abu al-Tufayl, concisely mentioning the spreading of his cloak for her without what follows. That cloak was later sold from 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, for one hundred thousand dirhams.

Sometimes someone would come to him while he was sitting on a cushion, and there was no room for the visitor to sit with him. He would remove it and place it under the one sitting with him. If the person refused, he would insist until he did so. The hadith about him removing his cushion and placing it under the one sitting with him is narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Ibn 'Amr: He entered upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he threw to him a cushion of leather stuffed with palm fiber. Its chain is sound. Al-Tabarani narrates from the hadith of Salman: I entered upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was reclining on a cushion, and he threw it to me. Its chain is weak. The author of al-Mizan said this report is unreliable.

Among these manners is to reconcile between Muslims whenever one finds a way. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Shall I not inform you of what is better than the rank of prayer, fasting, and charity?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Reconciling between people. And discord is the shaver." The hadith: "Shall I not inform you of what is better than fasting, prayer, and charity?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Reconciling between people. And discord is the shaver," is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it from the hadith of Abu al-Darda'. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The best charity is reconciling between people." The hadith "The best charity is reconciling between people" is narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Kabir and al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr. In it is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Ziyad al-Ifriqi, whom the majority consider weak.

From the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, as narrated by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: While the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting, he laughed until his molars showed. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "O Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what has made you laugh?" He said, "Two men from my nation knelt before the Lord of Might. One of them said, 'O Lord, take my right from this one.' Allah said, 'Return your brother's right to him.' He said, 'O Lord, none of my good deeds remain.' Allah said to the claimant, 'What will you do with your brother when none of his good deeds remain?' He said, 'O Lord, then let him bear some of my burdens.'" Then the eyes of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, overflowed with tears, and he said, "Indeed, that is a tremendous day, a day when people will need others to bear their burdens." He said, "Then Allah says to the claimant, 'Raise your gaze and look into the Gardens.' He said, 'O Lord, I see cities of silver and palaces of gold adorned with pearls. For which prophet is this, or for which truthful one, or for which martyr?' Allah says, 'This is for whoever pays the price.' He said, 'O Lord, and who possesses that?' He said, 'You possess it.' He said, 'With what, O Lord?' He said, 'With your forgiveness of your brother.' He said, 'O Lord, I have forgiven him.' Allah says, 'Take your brother's hand and admit him into Paradise.'" Then the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Fear Allah and reconcile between yourselves, for Allah..."

While the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was seated, he laughed until his molars became visible. Umar said, "O Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what has made you laugh?" He said, "Two men from my nation came before God, Mighty and Majestic, and one of them said, 'O Lord, take my right from this one for the injustice he did me.'" This hadith was reported by Al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* and Al-Hākim, who said its chain is sound, as did Abū Ya'lā al-Mawṣili who reported it at length, though Al-Bukhāri and Ibn Ḥibbān deemed it weak. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "He is not a liar who reconciles between two people by saying something good." The hadith: "He is not a liar who reconciles between two people by saying something good or conveying something good," is agreed upon, from the narration of Umm Kulthūm bint 'Uqbah ibn Abī Mu'ayṭ. This indicates the obligation of reconciliation between people, because avoiding falsehood is obligatory, and an obligation is not overruled except by a more compelling obligation. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "All falsehood is recorded, except when a man lies in war." The hadith: "All falsehood is recorded, except when a man lies in war," was reported by Al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* from the narration of Al-Nawwās ibn Sam'ān, though its chain is interrupted and weak. Muslim has a similar narration from Umm Kulthūm bint 'Uqbah, "For war is deception," or when a man lies between two people to reconcile them, or lies to his wife to please her. Among these is concealing the faults of all Muslims. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever conceals the fault of a Muslim, God, Exalted is He, will conceal his faults in this world and the Hereafter." The hadith: "Whoever conceals the fault of a Muslim, God will conceal his faults in this world and the Hereafter," was reported by Muslim from the narration of Abū Hurayrah. In the two *Ṣaḥīḥ*s, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever conceals a Muslim, God will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection." And he said, "No servant conceals another servant except that God will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection." The hadith: "No servant conceals another servant except that God will conceal him on the Day of Resurrection," was narrated by Muslim also from Abū Hurayrah. And Abū Sa'īd al-Khudrī, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A believer does not see a fault of his brother and conceal it for him except that he will enter Paradise." The hadith of Abū Sa'īd al-Khudrī: "A man does not see a fault of his brother and conceal it for him except that he will enter Paradise," was reported by Al-Ṭabarānī in *Al-Awsaṭ* and *Al-Ṣaghīr*, and Al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with his wording, with a weak chain. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Mā'iz when he informed him, "Had you concealed him with your garment, it would have been better for you." The hadith: "Had you concealed him with your garment, it would have been better for you," was reported by Abū Dāwūd and Al-Nasā'ī from the narration of Nu'aym ibn Hizāl, and by Al-Ḥākim from the narration of Hizāl himself, who said its chain is sound, though Nu'aym's status as a Companion is disputed. Therefore, it is incumbent upon a Muslim to conceal his own fault, for the right of his Islam is obligatory upon him just as the right of another's Islam is. Abū Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said, "If I found a drinker, I would love for God to conceal him, and if I found a thief, I would love for God to conceal him." It is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, was patrolling Medina one night and saw a man and a woman in an act of immorality. In the morning, he said to the people, "What do you think if an Imam saw a man and a woman in an act of immorality and carried out the prescribed punishment on them, what would you do?" They said, "You are the Imam." 'Alī, may God be pleased with him, said, "That is not for you to do, for then the punishment would be carried out on you. God did not deem less than four witnesses sufficient for this matter." Then he left them for as long as God willed, then asked them again. The people repeated their first statement, and 'Alī, may God be pleased with him, repeated his first statement. This indicates that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, was hesitant as to whether a ruler may judge based on his personal knowledge in God's prescribed punishments. Therefore, he consulted them in a hypothetical context, not as an actual report, fearing that he may not have that right and thus become a slanderer by his report. The opinion of 'Alī was that he does not have that right. This is among the greatest proofs of the Sacred Law's demand to conceal immoral acts, for the most heinous of them is fornication, and its proof has been tied to four upright witnesses who witness it from him in a manner like a needle in a kohl container. This almost never coincides. Even if the judge knows it for certain, he may not expose it. Consider the wisdom in sealing the door to immorality by obligating stoning, which is the greatest of punishments, then consider the dense veil of God's concealment—how He has draped it over His disobedient creation by narrowing the path to its exposure. Thus, we hope not to be deprived of this generosity on the day when secrets are tested. For in the hadith: "If God conceals a servant's fault in this world, He is too Noble to expose it in the Hereafter. And if He exposes it in this world, He is too Noble to expose it a second time." The hadith: "If God conceals His servant's fault in this world, He is too Noble to expose him in the Hereafter," was reported by Al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, and Al-Ḥākim from the narration of 'Alī: "Whoever commits a sin in this world and God conceals it for him and pardons him, God is too Noble to go back on something He has pardoned."

If a servant commits a sin in this world and is punished for it, God is more just than to repeat the punishment upon His servant. Al-Hakim said: "It is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs." And from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in Muslim: "God does not conceal a fault for a servant in this world except that He will conceal it on the Day of Resurrection." And from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, may God be pleased with him, who said: "I went out with 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, one night in Medina. While we were walking, a lamp appeared to us, so we headed towards it. When we drew near, there was a closed door behind which were people with voices and clamor. 'Umar took my hand and said, 'Do you know whose house this is?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'This is the house of Rabi'ah ibn Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and they are now drinking. What do you think?' I said, 'I think we have come upon what God has forbidden us.' He recited, 'And do not spy' (Qur'an 49:12). So 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, turned back and left them." This indicates the obligation of concealing faults and refraining from probing.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Mu'awiyah: "If you pursue the faults of people, you will corrupt them, or nearly corrupt them." He said to Mu'awiyah: "If you pursue the faults of people, you will corrupt them, or nearly corrupt them." Abu Dawud transmitted it with a sound chain from Mu'awiyah. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O assembly of those who have believed with their tongues but faith has not entered their hearts! Do not backbite the Muslims, and do not pursue their faults. For whoever pursues the fault of his Muslim brother, God will pursue his fault; and whoever's fault God pursues, He will expose him even if he is inside his house." This hadith was transmitted by Abu Dawud from Abu Barzah with a good chain, and by al-Tirmidhi from Ibn 'Umar, who graded it good.

Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: "If I saw someone at the verge of one of God's limits, I would not seize him nor call anyone against him unless another was with me." And someone said: "I was sitting with 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, when a man came to him with another and said, 'This one is intoxicated.' 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, 'Smell his breath.' They smelled it and found him intoxicated, so he detained him until his intoxication passed. Then he called for a whip and broke its tip. Then he said to the executioner, 'Whip him, and raise your hand, and give each limb its due.' So he whipped him while he wore a cloak or a wrap. When he finished, he said to the one who brought him, 'What is your relation to him?' He said, 'His uncle.' 'Abdullah said, 'You have neither disciplined well nor preserved honor. It is incumbent upon the ruler, when a prescribed punishment reaches him, to carry it out, yet God is Pardoning and loves pardon.' Then he recited, 'Let them pardon and overlook' (Qur'an 24:22). Then he said, 'I recall the first man whose hand the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, cut off. A thief was brought to him and he cut his hand. It was as if his face was saddened.' They said, 'O Messenger of God, it is as if you disliked cutting it.' He said, 'What prevents me? Do not be helpers of the devils against your brother.' They said, 'Why did you not pardon him?' He said, 'It is incumbent upon the ruler, when a prescribed punishment reaches him, to carry it out. God is Pardoning and loves pardon. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving, Merciful.'" This hadith of Ibn Mas'ud was narrated by al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, and by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*: "It was as if ashes were blown in the face of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." In another narration: "It was as if ashes were blown in the face of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, due to the severity of his change." And it is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to patrol Medina at night. He heard a man's voice in a house singing, so he scaled the wall and found him with a woman and with wine. He said, "O enemy of God, did you think God would conceal you while you are in disobedience to Him?" The man said, "And you, O Commander of the Faithful, do not be hasty. If I have disobeyed God in one matter, you have disobeyed God in three. God said, 'And do not spy,' and you have spied. God said, 'It is not righteousness to enter houses from the back,' and you scaled my wall. And God said, 'Do not enter houses other than your own' (Qur'an 24:27), and you have entered my house without permission or greeting." 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Do you have any good if I pardon you?" He said, "Yes, by God, O Commander of the Faithful, if you pardon me, I will never return to the like of it." So he pardoned him, left, and abandoned him.

A man said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "O Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, how did you hear the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, speak about the confidential discourse on the Day of Resurrection?" He said, "I heard him say, 'God will bring the believer close to Him and place His covering over him, shielding him from the people. He will say, "Do you acknowledge such-and-such sin? Do you acknowledge such-and-such sin?" He will say, "Yes, my Lord," until when He has made him acknowledge his sins and he sees in himself that he is ruined, He will say to him, "O My servant, I did not conceal them from you in the world except that I intended to forgive them for you today." Then he will be given the book of his good deeds. As for the disbelievers...'"

And the hypocrites, then the witnesses will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord. Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers." The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will bring the believer close and place His cover over him, shielding him from the people, and will say, 'Do you acknowledge such-and-such sin?'" The hadith is agreed upon. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "All of my nation is forgiven except those who publicize their sins." The hadith "All of my nation is forgiven except those who publicize their sins" is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. And among publicizing is that a man commits an evil deed in secret, then informs others of it. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever eavesdrops on a people's conversation while they dislike it, molten lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection." The hadith "Whoever eavesdrops on a people while they dislike it, molten lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection" is narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, both as a marfu' and mawquf report, and also from Abu Hurayrah. And among them is that one avoids places of suspicion to protect people's hearts from ill thoughts and their tongues from blame, for if they disobey Allah by mentioning him and he was the cause of it, he becomes a partner in it. Allah, the Exalted, said: "And do not insult those they invoke other than Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "What do you think of one who insults his parents?" They said, "Is there anyone who insults his parents?" He said, "Yes, he insults the parents of another, so they insult his parents." The hadith "What do you think of one who insults his parents?" They said, "Is there anyone who insults his parents?" The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and similar to it. It has been narrated from Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was speaking with one of his wives when a man passed by him. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, called him and said, "O so-and-so, this is my wife Safiyyah." He said, "O Messenger of Allah, whom would I suspect? I would not suspect you." He said, "Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like blood." The hadith of Anas: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was speaking with one of his wives when a man passed by him. He called him and said, 'O so-and-so, this is my wife so-and-so.'" In it: "Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like blood." Narrated by Muslim. And in a narration: "I feared that something might be cast into your hearts," and they were two men, so he said, "Wait, this is Safiyyah." The hadith "I feared that evil might be cast into your hearts" and he said, "Wait, this is Safiyyah" is agreed upon from the hadith of Safiyyah, and she had visited him during the last ten nights of Ramadan. And 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Whoever places himself in a position of suspicion, let him not blame the one who thinks ill of him." And he passed by a man speaking with a woman on the side of the road and struck him with his whip. The man said, "O Commander of the Faithful, she is my wife." He said, "Why not where no one from the people sees you?" And among them is that one intercedes for every Muslim who has a need to one who has status with him, and strives to fulfill his need with what he is able. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I am approached and asked, and a need is requested of me, and you are with me, so intercede that you may be rewarded, and Allah will decree through His Prophet what He wills." The hadith "I am approached and asked, and a need is requested of me, and you are with me, so intercede that you may be rewarded" is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa, similar to it. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Intercede to me that you may be rewarded. I desire a matter and delay it so that you may intercede to me and be rewarded." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no charity better than charity of the tongue." It was said, "How is that?" He said, "Intercession by which blood is spared, benefit is brought to one, and harm is repelled from another." The hadith "There is no charity better than charity of the tongue" was reported by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and the wording is his in the large collection from the hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub, which is weak. And 'Ikrimah narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the husband of Barirah was a slave named Mughith. It is as if I see him behind her, weeping, with his tears flowing on his beard. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to al-'Abbas, "Are you not amazed at the intensity of Mughith's love for Barirah and the intensity of her hatred for him?" The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her, "If you were to return to him, for he is the father of your child." She said, "O Messenger of Allah, do you command me, so I do it?" He said, "No, I am only an intercessor." The hadith of 'Ikrimah from Ibn 'Abbas: "The husband of Barirah was a slave named Mughith. It is as if I see him behind her, weeping." The hadith is narrated by al-Bukhari. And among them is that one initiates the greeting of peace to every Muslim before speech and shakes his hand upon greeting. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever begins with speech before the greeting, do not answer him until he begins with the greeting." The hadith "Whoever begins with speech before the greeting, do not answer him" was reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, and the wording is his from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a chain containing weakness. And some of them said: "I entered upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, without greeting and without seeking permission. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Go back and say, "Peace be upon you, may I enter?"'"

Upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and I had not given the greeting of peace nor sought permission. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Go back and say: 'Peace be upon you. May I enter?'" This is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the narration of Kaladah ibn al-Hanbal, who is the companion of the story.

And Jabir, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When you enter your homes, greet your households with peace, for when one of you gives the greeting, Satan does not enter his home." The narration of Jabir: "When you enter your homes, greet your households with peace, for when one of you gives the greeting, Satan does not enter his home," is narrated by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, though there is weakness in its chain.

And Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "I served the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for eight Hajj pilgrimages, and he said to me: 'O Anas, perform ablution thoroughly, it will increase your lifespan; and give the greeting of peace to whomever you meet from my community, it will multiply your good deeds; and when you enter your home, greet your household with peace, it will increase the goodness of your home.'" The narration of Anas: "I served the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for eight Hajj pilgrimages, and he said to me: 'O Anas, perform ablution thoroughly, it will increase from your lifespan; and give the greeting of peace to whomever you meet from my community, it will multiply your good deeds; and when you enter your home, greet your household with peace, it will increase the goodness of your home,'" is narrated by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with this wording, and by al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shuʿab*, and its chain is weak. Al-Tirmidhi narrated and authenticated: "When you enter upon your family, give the greeting of peace, it will be a blessing upon you and upon your household."

And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When two believers meet and shake hands, seventy mercies are apportioned between them, sixty-nine for the one with the better cheerfulness." And God the Exalted said: "When you are greeted with a greeting, greet with a better one or return it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not guide you to a deed which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread peace among yourselves." The narration: "By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another," is narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

And he also said: "When a Muslim greets a Muslim and he returns it, the angels pray for him seventy times." The narration: "When a Muslim greets a Muslim and he returns it, the angels pray for him seventy times," is mentioned by the author of *al-Firdaws* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, though he did not provide a chain, and his son included it in *al-Musnad*.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, the angels are amazed at a Muslim who passes by a Muslim and does not greet him." The narration: "The angels are amazed at a Muslim who passes by a Muslim and does not greet him," I have not found a source for it.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The rider greets the one walking, and if one from a group gives the greeting, it suffices for them." The narration: "The rider greets the one walking, and if one from a group gives the greeting, it suffices for them," is narrated by Malik in *al-Muwatta'* from Zayd ibn Aslam as *mursal*, and by Abu Dawud from the narration of ʿAli: "It suffices for a group when they pass by that one of them gives the greeting, and it suffices for those sitting that one of them returns it." And in the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "The rider greets the one walking," the narration, and the rest will come in the remainder of the chapter.

And Qatadah said: "The greeting of those before you was prostration, but God the Exalted gave this community the greeting of peace, and it is the greeting of the people of Paradise." And Abu Muslim al-Khawlani would pass by people and not greet them, saying: "Nothing prevents me except that I fear they will not return it, and then the angels would curse them."

And shaking hands is also a practice along with the greeting. A man came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: "Peace be upon you." He, peace be upon him, said: "Ten good deeds." Then another came and said: "Peace be upon you and the mercy of God." He said: "Twenty good deeds." Then another came and said: "Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings." He said: "Thirty." The narration: "A man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: 'Peace be upon you.' He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Ten good deeds,'" is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of ʿImran ibn Husayn. Al-Tirmidhi said it is good and rare. Al-Bayhaqi said in *al-Shuʿab* its chain is good.

And Anas, may God be pleased with him, would pass by children and greet them. The narration: "Anas would pass by children and greet them," and its being raised to the Prophet is agreed upon, and it is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he did that.

And ʿAbd al-Hamid ibn Bahrām narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, passed through the mosque one day while a group of people were sitting, and he motioned with his hand in greeting. And ʿAbd al-Hamid indicated with his hand to the narration. The narration of ʿAbd al-Hamid ibn Bahrām: "He, peace and blessings be upon him, passed through the mosque one day while a group of people were sitting, and he waved his hand in greeting," and ʿAbd al-Hamid indicated with his hand, is narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of ʿAbd al-Hamid ibn Bahrām from Shahr ibn Hawshab from Asma' bint Yazid, and he said it is good; and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn Abi Husayn from Shahr; and Abu Dawud narrated it; and Ahmad said there is no harm in it.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not initiate the greeting of peace with Jews or Christians, and if you meet any of them on the road, compel them to its narrowest part." A hadith: "Do not initiate the greeting with Jews and Christians..." narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And from Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not shake hands with the People of the Covenant, and do not initiate the greeting of peace with them. If you meet them on the road, compel them to the narrowest part of the road." Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "A group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: 'As-samu 'alaykum (Death be upon you).' The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'And upon you.' Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: 'So I said: Rather, upon you be death and curse!' He, peace be upon him, said: 'O Aisha, indeed God loves gentleness in all things.' She said: 'Did you not hear what they said?' He said: 'And did I not say: And upon you?'" A hadith of Aisha: "A group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: 'As-samu 'alaykum...'" agreed upon. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The rider greets the walker, the walker greets the one seated, the few greet the many, and the younger greets the elder." A hadith: "The rider greets the walker, and the walker greets the one seated, and the few greet the many, and the younger greets the elder," agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and Muslim did not mention "and the younger greets the elder." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not resemble the Jews and the Christians, for the greeting of the Jews is by gesturing with the fingers, and the greeting of the Christians is by gesturing with the palms." A hadith: "Do not resemble the Jews and the Christians, for the greeting of the Jews is gesturing with the fingers and the greeting of the Christians is gesturing with the palms," reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather, and he said its chain is weak. Abu 'Isa said its chain is weak. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When one of you arrives at a gathering, let him offer the greeting. If it seems fitting to him to sit, let him sit. Then when he rises, let him offer the greeting, for the first is not more deserving than the last." A hadith: "When one of you arrives at a gathering, let him offer the greeting. If it seems fitting to him to sit, let him sit. Then when he rises, let him offer the greeting, for the first is not more deserving than the last," reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When two believers meet and shake hands, seventy mercies are apportioned between them, sixty-nine for the one with the better countenance." A hadith of Anas: "When two Muslims meet and shake hands, seventy mercies are apportioned between them..." reported by al-Khara'iti with a weak chain. And in al-Tabarani's *al-Awsat* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "One hundred mercies, ninety-nine for the one with the more cheerful, more open, more dutiful, and better peaceful conduct toward his brother." And in its chain is al-Hasan ibn Kathir ibn Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, unknown. And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: I heard the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, say: "When two Muslims meet and each of them greets his companion and they shake hands, one hundred mercies descend between them: ninety for the initiator and ten for the one who shakes hands." A hadith of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: "When two Muslims meet and each greets his companion and they shake hands, one hundred mercies descend between them..." reported by al-Bazzar in his *Musnad*, al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* (the wording is his), and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab*, and there is consideration regarding its chain. And al-Hasan said: "Shaking hands increases affection." And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The completion of your greetings among you is shaking hands." A hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The completion of your greetings among you is shaking hands," reported by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and it is found in al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Umamah, and he weakened it. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The Muslim's kiss for his brother is the handshake." A hadith: "The Muslim's kiss for his brother is the handshake," reported by al-Khara'iti and Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Anas, and it was said it is not preserved. There is no harm in kissing the hand of one held in high esteem in religion, seeking blessings from him and honoring him. It is narrated from Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, who said: "We kissed the hand of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him." A hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "We kissed the hand of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him," reported by Abu Dawud with a good chain. And from Ka'b ibn Malik who said: "When my repentance was revealed, I came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and kissed his hand." A hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik: "When my repentance was revealed, I came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and kissed his hand," reported by Abu Bakr ibn al-Maqri in *Kitab al-Rukhsa fi Taqbil al-Yad* with a weak chain. And it is narrated that a Bedouin said: "O Messenger of God, permit me to kiss your head and your hand." He said: "So he permitted him and he did so." A hadith: "That a Bedouin said: 'O Messenger of God, permit me to kiss your head and your hand,' so he permitted him and he did," reported by al-Hakim from the narration of Buraydah, except he said "your feet" in place of "your hand," and he said its chain is sound. And Abu 'Ubayda met 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with them both...

He shook hands with him and kissed his hand, and they withdrew weeping. From Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, may God be pleased with him, that he gave the greeting of peace to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was performing ablution. He did not return the greeting until he had finished his ablution, then he returned it and extended his hand to him, so he shook hands with him. He said, "O Messenger of God, I did not think this was except from the manners of the non-Arabs." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Verily, when two Muslims meet and shake hands, their sins fall away." The narration of Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib that he gave the greeting of peace to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was performing ablution, and he did not return it until he had finished his ablution, and he extended his hand to him, so he shook hands with him—the hadith is narrated by Al-Khara'iti with a weak chain. It is found in Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah in an abbreviated form: "No two Muslims meet and shake hands except that they are forgiven before they part." Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan gharib* from the hadith of Abu Ishaq from Al-Bara'.

And from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: "When a man passes by a group and greets them with peace, and they return his greeting, he has a degree of merit over them because he reminded them of the greeting. And if they do not return it to him, a company better and purer than them—or he said, and superior—will return it to him." The hadith: "When a man passes by a group and greets them with peace, and they return his greeting, he has a degree of merit over them because he reminded them of the greeting. And if they do not return it to him, a company better and purer than them will return it to him"—it was reported by Al-Khara'iti and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud as *marfu'*, and Al-Bayhaqi weakened the *marfu'* narration, and he narrated it as *mawquf* upon him with a sound chain.

Bowing when giving the greeting is prohibited. Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "We said, 'O Messenger of God, should we bow to one another?' He said, 'No.' We said, 'Should we kiss one another?' He said, 'No.' We said, 'Should we shake hands with one another?' He said, 'Yes.'" The hadith of Anas: "We said, 'O Messenger of God, should we bow to one another?' He said, 'No.'"—it was reported by Al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*, and by Ibn Majah, while Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi weakened it.

Embracing and kissing have been reported in the tradition upon returning from a journey. The hadith concerning embracing and kissing upon returning from a journey was reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of 'A'ishah, who said: "Zayd ibn Harithah arrived..."—and in it: "So he embraced him and kissed him"—and he said it is *hasan gharib*.

And Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, said: "I never met him, peace and blessings be upon him, except that he shook hands with me. And one day he sought me, but I was not in the house. When I was informed, I came while he was on a couch, and he embraced me, and it was the most generous and most generous." The hadith of Abu Dharr: "I never met him, peace and blessings be upon him, except that he shook hands with me"—it was reported by Abu Dawud, and in it is a man from 'Uzzah who is unnamed, and Al-Bayhaqi named him in *Al-Shu'ab* as 'Abdullah.

Holding the stirrup out of reverence for scholars has been reported as an established practice. Ibn 'Abbas did that with the stirrup of Zayd ibn Thabit. The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas holding the stirrup of Zayd ibn Thabit has preceded in the chapter on knowledge. And 'Umar took hold, helping Zayd until he lifted him and said, "Thus you should do with Zayd and the companions of Zayd."

Standing up is disliked when intended as a form of veneration, not as a form of honor. Anas said: "There was no person more beloved to us than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and when they saw him, they would not stand up because of what they knew of his dislike for that." The hadith of Anas: "There was no person more beloved to them than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and when they saw him, they would not stand up because of what they knew of his dislike for that"—it was reported by Al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan sahih*. And it is narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said once: "When you see me, do not stand up as the non-Arabs do." The hadith: "When you see me, do not stand up as the non-Arabs do"—it was reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Umamah, and he said, "as the non-Arabs stand," and in it is Abu Al-'Adays, who is unknown. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever is pleased that men stand up for him, let him take his seat in the Fire." The hadith: "Whoever is pleased that men stand up for him, let him take his seat in the Fire"—it was reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Mu'awiyah, and he said it is *hasan*.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A man should not make another man rise from his seat and then sit in it, but rather make room and accommodate one another." The hadith: "A man should not make another man rise from his seat and then sit in it, but rather make room and accommodate one another"—it is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar. And they would refrain from that due to this prohibition.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When people have taken their seats, if one of them calls his brother and makes room for him, let him come, for it is only an honor his brother has bestowed upon him. But if he does not make room for him, then let him look for the widest place he finds and sit there." The hadith: "When people have taken their seats, if a man calls his brother and makes room—meaning for him—then let him sit, for it is an honor from God, Mighty and Majestic"—the hadith was reported by Al-Baghawi in *Mu'jam Al-Sahabah* from the hadith of Ibn Shaybah, and its narrators are trustworthy. This Ibn Shaybah was mentioned by Abu Musa Al-Madini in his supplement among the Companions. And Al-Tabarani narrated it in *Al-Kabir* from the narration of Mus'ab ibn Shaybah from his father from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in a more concise form than this.

Jubayr, the father of Mansur, did not have the companionship (of the Prophet). It is reported that a man greeted the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was urinating, and he did not respond. The hadith that a man greeted the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was urinating and he did not respond, was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with the wording: "He did not reply to him." Therefore, it is disliked to greet one who is relieving himself, and it is disliked to say initially, "Upon you be peace," for a man said it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, 'Upon you be peace' is the greeting for the dead." He said it three times, then said: "When one of you meets his brother, let him say, 'Peace be upon you and the mercy of God.'" The hadith: A man said to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, "Upon you be peace," so he said: "Indeed, 'Upon you be peace' is the greeting for the dead," was narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the narration of Ibn Jura' al-Hujaymi, who is the one of the incident. Al-Tirmidhi said: "It is hasan sahih." It is recommended for one who enters and greets but does not find a place in the row not to turn away, but to sit behind the row. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting in the mosque when three men approached. Two of them came toward the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him; one of them found a gap and sat in it, and the other sat behind them, while the third turned away and left. When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, finished, he said: "Shall I not inform you about the three men? As for one of them, he sought refuge with God, so God gave him refuge; as for the second, he felt shy, so God was shy from him; and as for the third, he turned away, so God turned away from him." The hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting in the mosque when three men approached. Two of them came toward the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him; one of them found a gap and sat in it—the hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Waqid al-Laythi. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There are no two Muslims who meet and shake hands except that they are forgiven before they part." The hadith: "There are no two Muslims who meet and shake hands except that they are forgiven before they part," was narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah from the narration of al-Bara' ibn 'Azib. And Umm Hani' greeted the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: "Who is this?" It was said to him: "Umm Hani'," so he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Welcome, Umm Hani'." The hadith: "Umm Hani' greeted him, and he said: 'Welcome, Umm Hani','" was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Umm Hani'. Among them is that he protects the honor, self, and wealth of his Muslim brother from the injustice of others as much as he is able, and repels it from him, strives in his defense, and supports him, for that is obligatory upon him by the requirement of Islamic brotherhood. Abu al-Darda' reported that a man spoke ill of a man in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and a man defended him, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever defends the honor of his brother, it will be a barrier for him from the Fire." The hadith of Abu al-Darda': "Whoever defends the honor of his brother, it will be a barrier for him from the Fire," was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and he graded it hasan. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no Muslim person who defends the honor of his brother except that it becomes incumbent upon God to shield him from the Fire of Hell on the Day of Resurrection." The hadith: "There is no Muslim person who defends the honor of his brother except that it becomes incumbent upon God to shield him from the Fire of Hell on the Day of Resurrection," was narrated by Ahmad from the narration of Asma' bint Yazid in a similar manner, and al-Khara'iti in "Makārim al-Akhlaq," and it is found in al-Tabarani with this wording from the narration of Abu al-Darda', and in both chains is Shahr ibn Hawshab. And from Anas, may God be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever is mentioned in the presence of his Muslim brother while he is able to support him and does not support him, God will humiliate him with it in this world and the Hereafter. And whoever is mentioned in the presence of his Muslim brother and supports him, God Almighty will support him in this world and the Hereafter." The hadith of Anas: "Whoever is mentioned in the presence of his Muslim brother while he is able to support him and does not support him, even with a word, God Almighty will humiliate him with it in this world and the Hereafter," was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "al-Samt," limited to what is mentioned from it, and its chain is weak. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever protects the honor of his Muslim brother in this world, God Almighty will send an angel to protect him from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection." The hadith: "Whoever protects the honor of his Muslim brother in this world, God will send an angel to protect him from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection," was narrated by Abu Dawud from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas in a similar manner with a weak chain. And Jabir and Abu Talhah reported: We heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: "There is no Muslim person who supports a Muslim in a place where his honor is violated and his sanctity is violated except that God will support him in a place where he loves to be supported. And there is no Muslim person who betrays a Muslim in a place where his sanctity is violated except that God will betray him in a place where he loves to be supported." The hadith of Jabir and Abu Talhah: "There is no person who supports a Muslim in a place where his honor is violated and his sanctity is violated," was narrated by Abu Dawud with some reordering and difference in its chain. And among them is responding to the sneezer.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said regarding the one who sneezes: he says, "All praise is to God in every circumstance," and the one who responds to him says, "May God have mercy on you." The sneezer then replies to him, "May God guide you and set your affairs aright." A narration states: the sneezer says, "All praise is to God in every circumstance," and the one who responds says, "May God have mercy on you," and he (the sneezer) says, "May God guide you and set your affairs aright." This was reported by al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, though al-Bukhari did not mention "in every circumstance."

From Ibn Mas'ud (may God be pleased with him), he said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) taught us to say: when one of you sneezes, let him say, "All praise is to God, Lord of the worlds." When he says that, let the one near him say, "May God have mercy on you." When they say that, let him say, "May God forgive me and you." The hadith of Abu Mas'ud: "When one of you sneezes, let him say, 'All praise is to God, Lord of the worlds'..." the hadith. This was reported by al-Nasa'i in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" and he said it is a munkar (rejected) hadith. It was also narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Salim ibn 'Abd Allah, and there is disagreement regarding its chain of transmission.

The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) responded to one sneezer and did not respond to another. He was asked about that, and he said, "He praised God, and you remained silent." The hadith: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) responded to one sneezer and did not respond to another. He was asked about that, and he said, 'He praised God, and you remained silent.'" This is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas.

And he (peace be upon him) said: "Respond to the Muslim sneezer if he sneezes up to three times. If he exceeds that, it is a cold." The hadith: "Respond to your Muslim brother if he sneezes up to three times. If he exceeds that, it is a cold." This was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Respond to your brother three times..." the hadith, and its chain is good (jayyid). It is narrated that he responded to a sneezer three times, then he sneezed another time, so he said, "You have a cold." The hadith: "He responded to a sneezer, then he sneezed another time, so he said, 'You have a cold.'" This was reported by Muslim from the hadith of Salamah ibn al-Akwa'.

And Abu Hurayrah said: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him), when he sneezed, would lower his voice and cover himself with his garment or his hand." The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When he sneezed, he would lower his voice and cover himself with his garment or his hand." This was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih (good and authentic). In a narration by Abu Nu'aym in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah": "He would veil his face and his mouth." And it is narrated: "He would veil his face."

And Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said: "The Jews would intentionally sneeze in the presence of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), hoping he would say, 'May God have mercy on you,' but he would say, 'May God guide you.'" The hadith of Abu Musa: "The Jews would intentionally sneeze in the presence of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), hoping he would say, 'May God have mercy on you,' but he would say, 'May God guide you.'" This was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih.

And 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah narrated from his father that a man sneezed behind the Prophet (peace be upon him) during prayer and said: "All praise is to God, abundant, good, and blessed praise, as our Lord is pleased with and is worthy of. And all praise is to God in every circumstance." When the Prophet (peace be upon him) concluded the prayer, he said, "Who is the one who said these words?" The man said, "It was I, O Messenger of God. I only intended good by them." He said, "I saw twelve angels, each of them rushing to be the one to record it." The hadith of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah: "A man sneezed behind the Prophet (peace be upon him) during prayer and said, 'All praise is to God, abundant, good, and blessed praise...'" the hadith. This was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah from his father, and its chain is good (jayyid).

And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever sneezes near someone and is preceded in praising (God) will not complain of a pain in his side." The hadith: "Whoever sneezes near someone and is preceded in praising (God) will not complain of a pain in his side." This was reported by al-Tabarani in "al-Awsat" and in "al-Du'a'" from the hadith of 'Ali with a weak chain.

And he (peace be upon him) said: "Sneezing is from God, and yawning is from Satan. So when one of you yawns, let him place his hand over his mouth. If he says 'ha, ha,' then Satan laughs from within him." The hadith: "Sneezing is from God, and yawning is from Satan..." the hadith. This is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, except for the phrase "Sneezing is from God," which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi who graded it hasan (good), and by al-Nasa'i in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah." Al-Bukhari said: "God loves sneezing and dislikes yawning," the hadith.

And Ibrahim al-Nakha'i said: "If one sneezes while relieving himself, there is no harm in remembering God." And al-Hasan said: "He praises God within himself." And Ka'b said: "Moses (peace be upon him) said, 'O Lord, are You near so that I may whisper to You, or are You far so that I may call out to You?' He said, 'I am the companion of whoever remembers Me.' He said, 'But we are sometimes in a state in which we are too shy to remember You upon it, such as being in a state of major impurity or defecation.' He said, 'Remember Me in every state.'"

Among them is that if one is afflicted with something evil, he should bear it and be wary of it. Some of them said: "The sincere believer is sincere, and the dissolute person's character is dissemblance. For the dissolute person is pleased with good character outwardly." And Abu al-Darda' said: "We smile in the faces of some people while our hearts curse them." And this is the meaning of prudent courtesy (mudara'ah), and it is with one whose harm is feared. God Almighty said: "Repel evil with what is better." Ibn 'Abbas said regarding the meaning of His saying, "and they repel..."

By the good deed is meant the bad deed, that is, obscenity and harm, through peace and forbearance. And He said in His statement, exalted is He, "And were it not for Allah's repelling people, some by means of others," meaning by desire and fear, and modesty and forbearance. And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: A man sought permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. He said, "Grant him permission, for how evil a man of the clan he is." Then when he entered, he softened his speech for him, to the point that he had a status with him. When he left, I said to him, "When he entered you said what you said, then you softened your speech for him." He said, "O 'A'ishah, verily the person of worst status with Allah on the Day of Resurrection is he whom people abandon to avoid his obscenity." The hadith of 'A'ishah: A man sought permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, so he said, "Grant him permission, for how evil a man of the clan he is." The hadith is agreed upon. And in the report: "Whatever a man uses to protect his honor, it is charity for him." The hadith: "Whatever a person uses to protect his honor, it is charity for him," was narrated by Abu Ya'la and Ibn 'Adi from the hadith of Jabir, and it is weak. And in the tradition: "Mix with people by your actions, and separate from them by your hearts." And Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "He is not wise who does not associate kindly with one whose association he cannot avoid, until Allah grants him a way out from him." And among them is that one avoids mixing with the wealthy and mixes with the poor, and is good to orphans. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say: "O Allah, give me life as a poor man, cause me to die as a poor man, and gather me in the company of the poor." The hadith: "O Allah, give me life as a poor man, cause me to die as a poor man, and gather me in the company of the poor," was narrated by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of 'A'ishah and said it is *gharib*. And Ka'b al-Ahbar said: "Solomon, peace be upon him, in his kingdom, when he entered the mosque and saw a poor man, he would sit with him and say, 'A poor man sitting with a poor man.'" And it was said: "No word said to Jesus, peace be upon him, was more beloved to him than to be called, 'O poor one.'" And Ka'b al-Ahbar said: "Whatever is in the Qur'an of 'O you who believe,' in the Torah it is 'O you poor ones.'" And 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit said: "Verily, Hell has seven gates; three for the wealthy, three for women, and one for the poor and the needy." And al-Fudayl said: "It reached me that a prophet from among the prophets said, 'O Lord, how can I know Your pleasure with me?' He said, 'Look at how the pleasure of the poor is with you.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Beware of sitting with the dead." It was said, "And who are the dead, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "The wealthy." The hadith: "Beware of sitting with the dead." It was said, "And who are the dead?" He said, "The wealthy," was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and he weakened it, and al-Hakim authenticated its chain from the hadith of 'A'ishah. "Beware of sitting with the wealthy." And Moses said, "My God, where do I seek You?" He said, "At the hearts that are broken." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not envy a wicked person for a blessing, for you do not know what will become of him after death, for behind him is a pursuer, swift." The hadith: "Do not envy a wicked person for a blessing..." was narrated by al-Bukhari in *al-Tarikh*, al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat*, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain. As for the orphan, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever takes care of an orphan from Muslim parents until he becomes self-sufficient, Paradise is assured for him, absolutely." The hadith: "Whoever takes care of an orphan from Muslim parents until he becomes self-sufficient, Paradise is assured for him, absolutely," was narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabarani from the hadith of Malik ibn 'Umar, and in it is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an, who is criticized. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I and the guardian of an orphan will be in Paradise like these two," and he gestured with his two fingers. The hadith: "I and the guardian of an orphan will be like these two in Paradise," was narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever places his hand on the head of an orphan out of mercy, for every hair his hand passes over, he will have a good deed." The hadith: "Whoever places his hand on the head of an orphan out of mercy, for every hair his hand passes over, he will have a good deed," was narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabarani with a weak chain from the hadith of Abu Umamah without the phrase "out of mercy," and by Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa: "Whoever strokes his hand over the head of an orphan out of mercy, he will have mercy..." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best house among the Muslims is a house in which there is an orphan who is treated well, and the worst house among the Muslims is a house in which there is an orphan who is treated badly." The hadith: "The best house among the Muslims is a house in which there is an orphan who is treated well, and the worst house among the Muslims is a house in which there is an orphan who is treated badly," was narrated by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and there is weakness in it. And among them is sincere advice for every Muslim and striving to bring joy to his heart. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The believer loves for the believer what he loves for himself." The hadith: "The believer loves for the believer what he loves for himself," preceded with the wording: "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself," and I have not seen it with this wording. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."

For himself, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Verily, each of you is a mirror to his brother; so if he sees something in him, let him wipe it away from him." (The hadith: "Verily, each of you is a mirror to his brother..." is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, and it has been mentioned previously.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever fulfills a need for his brother, it is as if he has served God for his entire lifetime." (The hadith: "Whoever fulfills a need for his brother, it is as if he has served God for his entire lifetime" is reported by al-Bukhari in al-Tarikh, al-Tabarani, and al-Khara'iti—both in Makarim al-Akhlaq—from a narration of Anas with a weak, interrupted chain.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever gladdens the eye of a believer, God will gladden his eye on the Day of Resurrection." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever walks to fulfill a need of his brother for an hour of the night or day, whether he fulfills it or not, it is better for him than secluding himself in worship for two months." (The hadith: "Whoever walks to fulfill a need of his brother for an hour of the night or day, whether he fulfills it or not, it is better for him than secluding himself in worship for two months" is reported by al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "That one of you walks with his brother to fulfill his need—and he pointed with his finger—is more excellent than secluding himself in this mosque of mine for two months." And al-Tabarani in al-Awsat has: "Whoever walks to fulfill a need of his brother, it is better for him than secluding himself for ten years." Both are weak.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever relieves a believer from grief or aids one wronged, God will forgive him seventy-three times." (The hadith: "Whoever relieves one from grief or aids one wronged, God will forgive him seventy-three times" is reported by al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq, Ibn Hibban in al-Du'afa', and Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Anas with the wording: "Whoever comes to the aid of one in distress.") And he (peace be upon him) said: "Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or oppressed." It was said: "How do we help him if he is an oppressor?" He said: "By preventing him from oppression." (The hadith: "Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or oppressed" is agreed upon from the narration of Anas and has been mentioned previously.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Among the deeds most beloved to God are bringing joy to the heart of a believer, relieving him of a grief, settling a debt on his behalf, or feeding him when hungry." (The hadith: "Among the deeds most beloved to God are bringing joy to the heart of a believer..." is reported by al-Tabarani in al-Saghir and al-Awsat from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever protects a believer from a hypocrite who abuses him, God will send an angel to him on the Day of Resurrection to protect his flesh from the fire of Hell." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Two traits, above which there is nothing in evil: associating partners with God and harming the servants of God. And two traits, above which there is nothing in goodness: faith in God and benefiting the servants of God." (The hadith: "Two traits, above which there is nothing in evil: associating partners with God and harming the servants of God..." is mentioned by the author of al-Firdaws from the narration of 'Ali, but his son did not include it in his Musnad with a chain.) And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever does not concern himself with the affairs of the Muslims is not one of them." (The hadith: "Whoever does not concern himself with the affairs of the Muslims is not one of them" is reported by al-Hakim from the narration of Hudhayfah and al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of Abu Dharr, both of which are weak.) And Ma'ruf al-Karkhi said: "Whoever says every day: 'O God, have mercy on the nation of Muhammad,' God records him among the Substitutes." And in another narration: "'O God, rectify the nation of Muhammad. O God, relieve the nation of Muhammad' three times each day, God records him among the Substitutes." And 'Ali ibn al-Fadl wept one day, and it was said to him: "What makes you weep?" He said: "I weep for the one who wronged me, when he stands tomorrow before God Almighty and is questioned about his wrongdoing, and he has no argument." Among them is visiting their sick. Knowledge and Islam are sufficient to establish this right and attain its virtue. The etiquette of the visitor includes sitting lightly, asking little, showing tenderness, supplicating for wellness, lowering the gaze from the private aspects of the place, and when seeking permission, not facing the door directly, knocking gently, not saying "It is I" when asked "Who is it?", and not saying "O servant," but rather praising and glorifying God. And he (peace be upon him) said: "The completion of visiting the sick is that one of you places his hand on his forehead or his hand and asks him how he is. And the completion of your greetings is shaking hands." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever visits a sick person sits in the orchards of Paradise until, when he rises, seventy thousand angels are entrusted with him, praying for him until evening." (The hadith: "Whoever visits a sick person sits in the orchards of Paradise..." is reported by the authors of the Sunan and al-Hakim from the narration of 'Ali: "Whoever comes to his Muslim brother to visit him walks in the orchards of Paradise until he sits; when he sits, mercy envelops him. If it is in the morning, seventy thousand angels pray for him until evening, and if it is in the evening..." This is the wording of Ibn Majah. Al-Hakim authenticated it and al-Tirmidhi graded it good. Muslim has from the narration of Thawban: "Whoever visits a sick person remains in the orchard of Paradise.") And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "When a man visits the sick, he plunges into mercy, and when he sits with him, it settles within him." (The hadith: "When a man visits the sick, he plunges into mercy, and when he sits with him, it settles within him" is reported by al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Jabir, who said: "He immerses himself in it.")

Al-Hakim authenticated it as sound according to Muslim's conditions, and similarly, Ibn 'Abd al-Barr authenticated it. Malik mentioned it in the *Muwatta'* as a *balagh* report with the wording "qarrat fihi" (his blood settled). Al-Waqidi narrated it with the wording "istaqarra fiha" (it settled in it). Al-Tabarani, in his *al-Saghir*, from the hadith of Anas: "When he sits by him, mercy envelops him." And in his *al-Awsat*, from the hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik and 'Amr ibn Hazm: "istanqa'a fiha" (it pooled in it). And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When a Muslim visits his sick brother, his sins fall away." It is said: Allah the Exalted says: 'You have become pure, and your walking has become pure, and you have taken up an abode in Paradise.'" The hadith: "When a Muslim visits his sick brother..." was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, except that he said: "A caller called out..." Al-Tirmidhi said: "It is *gharib* (uncommon)." I say: In its chain is 'Isa ibn Sinan al-Qasmuli, whom the majority considered weak. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When a servant falls ill, Allah, Blessed and Exalted, sends two angels to him and says: 'See what he says to his visitors.' If, when they come to him, he praises Allah and extols Him, they raise that to Allah, and He is Most Knowing. Then He says regarding His servant: 'It is incumbent upon Me, if I take his soul, to admit him into Paradise, and if I heal him, to replace his flesh with flesh better than his flesh and his blood with blood better than his blood, and to expiate his evil deeds.'" The hadith: "When a servant falls ill..." was transmitted by Malik in the *Muwatta'* as a *mursal* report from the hadith of 'Ata' ibn Yasar, and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr connected its chain in *al-Tamhid* from his narration from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. In its chain is 'Abbad ibn Kathir al-Thaqafi, who is weak in hadith. And al-Bayhaqi, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: Allah the Exalted said: "When I afflict My believing servant and he does not complain about Me to his visitors, I release him from My captivity, then I replace his flesh with flesh better than his flesh and his blood with blood better than his blood, then he resumes his deeds." Its chain is good. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whomever Allah intends good for, He afflicts him." The hadith: "Whomever Allah intends good for..." was transmitted by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. And 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I fell ill and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, visited me and said: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I seek refuge for you with Allah, the One, the Eternal, who begets not nor was begotten, and there is none comparable to Him, from the evil of what you find.'" He said it repeatedly. The hadith of 'Uthman: "I fell ill..." was transmitted by Ibn al-Sunni in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, al-Tabarani, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Ad'iyah* from the hadith of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan with a *hasan* chain. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, while he was ill and said to him: "Say: 'O Allah, I ask You for the hastening of Your pardon, or patience over Your affliction, or departure from the world to Your mercy, for You will grant one of them.'" The hadith: "He entered upon 'Ali while he was ill..." was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *Kitab al-Marad* from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon a man who was complaining, and he did not name 'Ali. And al-Bayhaqi transmitted in *al-Da'awat* from the hadith of 'A'ishah that Jibril taught it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: "Allah commands you to supplicate with these words." It is also recommended for the sick person to say: "I seek refuge with the might of Allah and His power from the evil of what I find and fear." And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "If one of you complains of his stomach, let him ask his wife for something from her dowry, buy honey with it, and drink it with rainwater; thus, pleasure, nourishment, healing, and blessing are combined for him." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O Abu Hurayrah, shall I not inform you of a matter that is true? Whoever speaks it at the beginning of his sickbed, Allah will save him from the Fire." I said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He said: "Let him say: 'There is no god but Allah, He gives life and causes death, and He is the Living who does not die. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the servants and the lands. And praise be to Allah, abundant, good, and blessed praise in every circumstance. Allah is the Greatest, truly great. Indeed, the majesty of our Lord, His splendor, and His power are in every place. O Allah, if You have made me ill to take my soul in this illness of mine, then place my soul among the souls of those for whom goodness from You has preceded, and distance me from the Fire as You have distanced Your allies for whom goodness from You has preceded.'" The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Shall I not inform you..." was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *al-Du'a'* and in *al-Marad wa al-Kaffarat*. And it is narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Visiting the sick is after three *fuwaq* of a she-camel." The hadith: "Visiting the sick is a *fuwaq* of a she-camel" was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *Kitab al-Marad* from the hadith of Anas with a chain containing an unknown narrator. And Tawus said: "The best visit is the lightest." And Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "Visiting the sick once is a confirmed practice (*sunnah*), and anything beyond that is a supererogatory act." And some said: "Visiting..."

The patient after three days, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Visit the sick at intervals, and be moderate in it." A hadith: "Visit the sick at intervals, and be moderate in it," narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya, and in it is Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Jabir, who added: "Unless one is overwhelmed." Its chain is weak. The sum of the etiquette for the sick is good patience, little complaint and impatience, and turning to supplication and reliance after treatment upon the Creator of the cure. Among them is to accompany their funeral processions. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever accompanies a funeral procession will have a qirat of reward. If he stands by until it is buried, he will have two qirats." A hadith: "Whoever follows a funeral procession will have a qirat of reward. If he stands by until it is buried, he will have two qirats," reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. In the report: "The qirat is like Uhud." A hadith: "The qirat is like Mount Uhud," reported by Muslim from the hadith of Thawban and Abu Hurayrah, and its origin is agreed upon. When Abu Hurayrah narrated this hadith and Ibn 'Umar heard it, he said: "We have indeed missed out on many qirats until now." The purpose of accompanying is to fulfill the right of the Muslims and to take admonition. Makhul al-Dimashqi, when he saw a funeral, would say: "Go forth, for we are departing," a profound admonition and a swift heedlessness; the first and the last pass away, he who has no intellect. Malik ibn Dinar went out behind his brother's funeral, weeping and saying: "By Allah, my eye will not be comforted until I know to what I have gone. And by Allah, I will not know as long as I live." Al-A'mash said: "We used to attend funerals and we would not know for whom to offer condolences, due to the grief of all the people." Ibrahim al-Ziyat looked at people invoking mercy upon a deceased and said: "If you were to invoke mercy upon yourselves, it would be more fitting. He has been saved from three terrors: the face of the Angel of Death he has seen, the bitterness of death he has tasted, and the fear of the end he is secure from." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Three things follow the deceased, then two return and one remains: his family, his wealth, and his deeds follow him. Then his family and his wealth return, and his deeds remain." A hadith: "Three things follow the deceased, then two return and one remains," reported by Muslim from the hadith of Anas. Among them is to visit their graves. The purpose of that is supplication, taking admonition, and softening the heart. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "I have not seen any scene except that the grave is more dreadful than it." A hadith: "I was not shown any scene except that the grave is more dreadful than it," reported by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Uthman, and he said its chain is sound. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan gharib. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "We went out with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he came to the graveyards and sat by a grave, and I was the closest of the people to him. He wept, and we wept. He said: 'What makes you weep?' We said: 'We wept because you wept.' He said: 'This is the grave of Aminah bint Wahb. I sought permission from my Lord to visit her, and He permitted me. I sought permission from Him to seek forgiveness for her, but He refused me. Then I was overcome by what overcomes a child from tenderness.'" A hadith of 'Umar: "We went out with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he came to the graveyards and sat by a grave," the hadith concerning his visiting his mother's grave, reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in a concise form, and by Ahmad from the hadith of Buraydah, in which 'Umar stood up to him and ransomed him with his father and mother, saying: "O Messenger of Allah, what is with you?" The hadith. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, when he stood by a grave, would weep until his beard became wet and say: "I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'The grave is the first of the abodes of the Hereafter. If its occupant is saved from it, what comes after is easier. If he is not saved from it, what comes after is more severe.'" A hadith of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan: "The grave is the first of the abodes of the Hereafter," the hadith reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it hasan, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who authenticated its chain. Mujahid said: "The first thing that addresses the son of Adam is his grave. It says: 'I am the house of worms, the house of loneliness, the house of estrangement, the house of darkness. This is what I have prepared for you. So what have you prepared for me?'" Abu Dharr said: "Shall I not inform you of the day of my poverty? The day I am placed in my grave." Abu al-Darda' used to sit by the graves. He was asked about that, and he said: "I sit with people who remind me of my ultimate return, and when I rise from them, they do not backbite me." Hatim al-Asamm said: "Whoever passes by the graves and does not reflect upon himself nor supplicate for them has betrayed himself and betrayed them." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "There is no night except that a caller calls out: 'O inhabitants of the graves, whom do you envy?' They say: 'We envy the people of the mosques, for they fast and we do not fast, they pray and we do not pray, they remember Allah and we do not remember Him.'" A hadith: "There is no night except that a caller calls out: 'O inhabitants of the graves, whom do you envy?' They say: 'We envy the people of the mosques,'" the hadith. I did not find an origin for it. Sufyan said: "Whoever frequently remembers the grave finds it a garden from the gardens of Paradise. And whoever is heedless of its remembrance finds it a pit from the pits of Hell." Al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym had dug a grave in his house, and when he found hardness in his heart, he would enter it and lie down in it for a while, then say: "My Lord, send me back, that I might do righteousness in what I left behind." Then he would say: "O Rabi', you have been sent back, so act now before you are not sent back." Maymun ibn Mihran said: "I went out with..."

Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz went to the graveyard, and when he looked upon the graves, he wept and said, "O Maymun, these are the graves of my forefathers from Banu Umayyah. It is as if they never partook with the people of the world in its pleasures. Do you not see them as slain, whom calamities have taken, and upon whose bodies creeping things have fed?" Then he wept and said, "By God, I know of no one more blessed than he who has gone to these graves and is secure from the punishment of God."

And the etiquettes of the comforter are: lowering the wing, showing grief, speaking little, refraining from smiling. And the etiquettes of accompanying the funeral procession are: maintaining humility, refraining from speech, observing the deceased, reflecting on death and preparing for it, and walking near the front of the bier. Hastening with the funeral procession is a Sunnah; the hadith about hastening with the funeral is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Hasten with the funeral procession." These are a summary of etiquettes that alert one to the manners of social interaction with all of creation.

The comprehensive principle therein is that you do not consider anyone among them as insignificant, whether alive or dead, lest you perish, for you do not know—perhaps he is better than you. For even if he is sinful, perhaps he will conclude with a state like yours, and you will conclude with righteousness. And do not look at them with an eye of veneration for their worldly state, for the world is insignificant in the sight of God; insignificant is what is in it. And whenever you magnify the people of the world in your own soul, you have magnified the world, and thus you fall from the eye of God. And do not trade your religion to attain something of their world, for then you become small in their eyes and are deprived of their world. If you are not deprived, you will have exchanged what is better for what is inferior.

And do not show them enmity to the point of displaying hostility, lest the matter of enmity become prolonged for you, and your religion and your world are lost because of them, and their religion is lost because of you—except if you see an evil in religion, then be an enemy to their ugly actions, and look at them with an eye of mercy for them, for they have exposed themselves to God's wrath and punishment through their disobedience; Hell is enough for them, so why should you hold a grudge against them?

And do not find comfort in their affection for you and their praise of you to your face and their cheerful countenance toward you, for if you seek the reality of that, you will not find in a hundred but one, and perhaps you will not find him at all. And do not confide your circumstances to them, lest God entrust you to them. And do not hope that they will be for you in absence and secrecy as they are in openness, for that is a false hope—and how could you attain it? And do not covet what is in their hands, lest you hasten humiliation and not attain the objective.

And do not hold yourself above them in arrogance due to your independence from them, for God may compel you to them as a punishment for arrogance by displaying self-sufficiency. And if you ask a brother among them for a need and he fulfills it, he is a brother gained; and if he does not fulfill it, do not reproach him, lest he become an enemy whose company becomes long and burdensome for you. And do not occupy yourself with advising one in whom you see no signs of acceptance, lest he not listen to you and become your enemy. And let your advice be incidental and flowing, without explicitly pointing to the person.

And whenever you see from them honor and good, thank God who subjugated them for you, and seek refuge in God from being entrusted to them. And if backbiting reaches you from them, or you see evil from them, or something unpleasant befalls you from them, then refer all their affair to God and seek refuge in God from their evil. And do not occupy yourself with retaliation, lest the harm increase and your life be wasted in its preoccupation. And do not say to them, "You do not know my station," and believe that if you deserved that, God would have placed a station for you in their hearts, for God is the One who endears and the One who makes hated in the hearts.

And be among them one who hears their truth, deaf to their falsehood, speaking their truth, silent to their falsehood. And beware of the companionship of most people, for they do not overlook a stumble, nor forgive a slip, nor cover a fault; they account for the smallest speck, envy over little and much, seek revenge and do not act justly, take to task for error and forgetfulness and do not pardon; they incite brothers against brothers with gossip and slander. The companionship of most of them is loss, and cutting them off is more weighty. If they are pleased, their outward is flattery; if they are displeased, their inward is rancor. They are not safe in their rancor, nor is hope placed in their flattery. Their outward is garments, their inward is wolves. They judge by suspicions and signal behind you with their eyes, and they lie in wait for their friend out of envy, with the doubt of fate. They tally your stumbles during your companionship to confront you with them in their anger and alienation.

And do not rely on the affection of one whom you have not truly known by accompanying him for a period in a house or one place, testing him in his isolation and authority, his wealth and poverty, or traveling with him, or dealing with him in dinar and dirham, or falling into hardship so that you need him. If you are pleased with him in all circumstances, then take him as a father for you if he is older, or a son for you if he is younger, or your brother if he is like you.

These are a summary of the etiquettes of social interaction with all categories of creation.

The Rights of Neighbors: Know that neighborliness entails a right beyond what brotherhood in Islam requires. Thus, the Muslim neighbor deserves what every Muslim deserves and more, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Neighbors are of three types: a neighbor with one right, a neighbor with two rights, and a neighbor with three rights. The neighbor with three rights is the Muslim neighbor who is also a relative..."

The relative has three rights: the right of neighborliness, the right of Islam, and the right of kinship. As for the one who has two rights, it is the Muslim neighbor, who has the right of neighborliness and the right of Islam. As for the one who has one right, it is the polytheist neighbor. The hadith states: "Neighbors are of three types: a neighbor with one right, a neighbor with two rights, and a neighbor with three rights." This hadith was reported by Al-Hasan ibn Sufyan and Al-Bazzar in their Musnads, Abu al-Shaykh in *Kitab al-Thawab*, and Abu Nu'aym in *Al-Hilyah* from the narration of Jabir, and by Ibn 'Adi from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar. Both chains are weak. Consider how a right is affirmed for the polytheist solely on the basis of neighborliness, while the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Behave excellently in neighborliness to whoever lives near you, and you will be a Muslim." The hadith "Behave excellently in neighborliness to whoever lives near you, and you will be a Muslim" has preceded. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Jibril kept enjoining me concerning the neighbor until I thought he would make him an heir." The hadith "Jibril kept enjoining me concerning the neighbor until I thought he would make him an heir" is agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah and Ibn 'Umar. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him honor his neighbor." The hadith "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him honor his neighbor" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Shuraih. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A servant does not believe until his neighbor is safe from his harms." The hadith "A servant does not believe until his neighbor is safe from his harms" was reported by Al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Shuraih as well. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The first two disputants on the Day of Resurrection will be two neighbors." The hadith "The first two disputants on the Day of Resurrection will be two neighbors" was reported by Ahmad and Al-Tabarani from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir with a weak chain. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If you throw a stone at your neighbor's dog, you have harmed him." The hadith "If you throw a stone at your neighbor's dog, you have harmed him" — I have not found a basis for it. It is narrated that a man came to Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and said to him: "I have a neighbor who harms me, insults me, and makes things difficult for me." He said: "Go. If he disobeys Allah regarding you, then obey Allah regarding him." It was said to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him: "Such-and-such a woman fasts during the day and prays at night, but she harms her neighbors." He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "She is in the Fire." The hadith "Such-and-such a woman fasts during the day and prays at night, but she harms her neighbors. He said: 'She is in the Fire.'" was reported by Ahmad and Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said its chain is sound. A man came to him, peace and blessings be upon him, complaining about his neighbor. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: "Be patient." Then he said to him on the third or fourth occasion: "Place your belongings in the road." He said: So people began to pass by him and say: "What is the matter with you?" It would be said: "His neighbor harmed him." He said: So they began to say: "May Allah curse him." His neighbor came to him and said: "Take back your belongings, for by Allah, I will not do it again." The hadith "A man came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, complaining about his neighbor. He said: 'Be patient.' Then he said to him on the third or fourth occasion: 'Place your belongings on the road.'" The hadith was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is sound according to the conditions of Muslim. Al-Zuhri narrated that a man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and began complaining about his neighbor. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, ordered him to call out at the door of the mosque: "Indeed, forty houses constitute a neighbor." The hadith of Al-Zuhri: "Indeed, forty houses constitute a neighbor" was reported by Abu Dawud in *Al-Marasil*, and Al-Tabarani connected its chain from the narration of Al-Zuhri from Ibn Ka'b ibn Malik from his father. Abu Ya'la reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah and said: "Forty forearms' length." Both are weak. Al-Zuhri said: "Forty like this, and forty like this, and forty like this, and forty like this," and he gestured to the four directions. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Good omens and bad omens are in the woman, the dwelling, and the horse. The good omen of the woman is her light dowry, the ease of her marriage, and her good character. Her bad omen is her heavy dowry, the difficulty of her marriage, and her bad character. The good omen of the dwelling is its spaciousness and the good neighborliness of its people. Its bad omen is its narrowness and the bad neighborliness of its people. The good omen of the horse is its gentleness and its good character. Its bad omen is its unruliness and its bad character." The hadith "Good omens and bad omens are in the woman, the dwelling, and the horse. The good omen of the woman is her light dowry..." was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Bad omens are in the dwelling, the woman, and the horse." In another narration of his: "If there is anything in bad omens, it is true." And he has from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "If it exists, it is in the horse, the woman, and the dwelling." And in Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Hakim ibn Mu'awiyah: "There is no bad omen, but there can be good omen in the dwelling, the woman, and the horse." Ibn Majah reported it and named him Muhammad ibn Mu'awiyah. And in Al-Tabarani from the narration of Asma' bint 'Umays, she said: "O Messenger of Allah, what is the badness of a dwelling?" He said: "The narrowness of its courtyard and the wickedness of its neighbors." It was said: "What is the badness of a mount?" He said: "Its refusal to be ridden and its bad character." It was said: "What is the badness of a woman?" He said: "The barrenness of her womb and her bad character." Both are weak. We reported it in *Kitab al-Khayl* by Al-Dimyati from the narration of Salim ibn 'Abdullah: "If the horse is of mixed breeds, it is ill-omened, and if the woman has known a husband before..."

If a woman is married and yearns for her first husband, she is ill-omened. And if a house is far from the mosque, so that the call to prayer and the *iqamah* are not heard in it, it is ill-omened—though its chain is weak, and the compiler of *Musnad al-Firdaws* connected it by mentioning Ibn 'Umar in it.

Know that the right of the neighbor is not merely to refrain from harm, but to bear harm patiently. For the neighbor also refrains from harming you, so that alone does not fulfill his right. Nor is it sufficient to merely bear his harm; rather, one must be gentle, do good, and show kindness. It is said that on the Day of Resurrection, the poor neighbor will cling to his wealthy neighbor and say, "O Lord, ask this one why he withheld his kindness from me and closed his door against me."

It reached Ibn al-Muqaffa' that a neighbor of his was selling his house due to a debt that had befallen him. He used to sit in the shade of his house, so Ibn al-Muqaffa' said, "I have not upheld the sanctity of the shade of his house if I let him sell it in destitution." So he gave him the price of the house and said, "Do not sell it."

Someone complained about the abundance of mice in his house, and it was said to him, "If only you would get a cat." He replied, "I fear that the mice would hear the cat's sound and flee to the neighbors' houses, and thus I would love for them what I do not love for myself."

In summary, the right of the neighbor is to greet him first, not to speak with him at length, not to inquire excessively about his condition, to visit him in illness, to console him in calamity, to stand with him in mourning, to congratulate him in joy, to share in his happiness, to overlook his slips, not to peer from the roof at his private matters, not to trouble him by placing a beam on his wall, nor by directing water into his drainpipe, nor by dumping earth in his courtyard, not to narrow his paths to the house, not to follow with one's gaze what he carries into his house, to conceal what becomes apparent of his private matters, to assist him if a misfortune befalls him, not to neglect watching over his house in his absence, not to eavesdrop on his speech, to lower one's gaze from his womenfolk, not to gaze persistently at his maidservant, to be gentle in speech with his children, and to guide him to what he is ignorant of concerning his religion and worldly affairs—in addition to the general rights we have mentioned for all Muslims.

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do you know what the right of the neighbor is? If he seeks your help, help him. If he seeks your support, support him. If he seeks a loan from you, lend to him. If he becomes poor, look after him. If he falls ill, visit him. If he dies, follow his funeral. If good befalls him, congratulate him. If a calamity befalls him, console him. Do not raise your building high to block the wind from him except with his permission. And if you buy fruit, give him some as a gift. If you do not, then bring it in secretly, and do not let your child take it out to vex his child. And do not harm him with the steam of your cooking pot unless you ladle some out for him." Then he said, "Do you know what the right of the neighbor is? By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, none fulfills the right of the neighbor except one upon whom Allah has mercy."

The hadith of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather: "Do you know what the right of the neighbor is? If he seeks your help, help him. If he seeks a loan from you, lend to him..." Al-Khara'iti narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* and Ibn 'Adi in *Al-Kāmil*, and it is weak. Thus did 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb narrate it from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.

Mujahid said: "I was with 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar while his servant was skinning a sheep. He said, 'O servant, when you finish skinning, begin with our Jewish neighbor.' He repeated that several times. I said to him, 'How often do you say this?' He replied, 'The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, continuously enjoined us concerning the neighbor until we feared he would make him an heir.'"

The hadith of Mujahid: "I was with 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar while his servant was skinning a sheep. He said, 'O servant, when you finish skinning, begin with our Jewish neighbor...'" Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi narrated it, and al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan gharib*. Hisham said: "Al-Hasan saw no harm in feeding your Jewish or Christian neighbor from your sacrifice."

Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "My intimate friend, peace and blessings be upon him, enjoined me, saying, 'When you cook a pot, increase its broth, then look to some members of a household among your neighbors and ladle out for them from it.'" The hadith of Abu Dharr: "My intimate friend, peace and blessings be upon him, enjoined me: 'When you cook, increase the broth, then look to some members of a household among your neighbors and ladle out for them from it.'" Muslim narrated it.

'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I have two neighbors. One of them turns towards my door, and the other's door is distant from me. Sometimes what I have is not enough for both of them, so which of them has a greater right?' He said, 'The one who turns towards your door.'" The hadith of 'A'ishah: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I have two neighbors...'" Al-Bukhari narrated it.

Al-Siddiq saw his son 'Abd al-Rahman whispering with a neighbor of his and said, "Do not whisper with your neighbor, for this remains while people depart."

Al-Hasan ibn 'Isa al-Naysaburi said: "I asked 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak, saying, 'A neighboring man comes to me complaining that my servant did something to him, and the servant denies it. I dislike to beat him, as he may be innocent, and I dislike to leave him, lest my neighbor hold a grudge. What should I do?' He said, 'Perhaps your servant commits an act that warrants discipline. Observe him, and if your neighbor complains about him, discipline him for that act. Thus you will have satisfied your neighbor.'"

And she disciplined him upon that occurrence, and this is a subtlety in combining the two rights. And ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "Among the noble traits are ten that may be in a man and not be in his father, and may be in a slave and not be in his master. God the Exalted apportions them to whom He loves: truthfulness in speech, honesty with people, giving to the asker, recompensing good deeds, maintaining kinship ties, safeguarding trusts, fulfilling the duty to the neighbor, fulfilling the duty to the companion, and hosting the guest. And the foremost of them is modesty."

And Abū Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O company of Muslim women, let not a woman belittle a gift to her neighbor, even if it be a sheep's trotter." (The ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah: "O women of Islam, let not a woman belittle a gift to her neighbor, even if it be a sheep's trotter.") Narrated by al-Bukhārī.

He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Among the happiness of a Muslim man are a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbor, and a comfortable mount." (Ḥadīth: "Among the happiness of a Muslim man are a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbor, and a comfortable mount.") Narrated by Aḥmad from the ḥadīth of Nāfi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Ḥārith and Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ. The ḥadīth of Nāfi‘ was reported by al-Ḥākim, who said its chain is sound.

And ‘Abdullāh said: A man said, "O Messenger of God, how will I know if I have done good or done evil?" He said, "If you hear your neighbors saying, 'You have done good,' then you have done good; and if you hear them saying, 'You have done evil,' then you have done evil." (Ḥadīth of ‘Abdullāh: A man said, "O Messenger of God, how will I know if I have done good or done evil?" He said, "If you hear your neighbors saying, 'You have done good,' then you have done good.") Narrated by Aḥmad and al-Ṭabarānī, and ‘Abdullāh is Ibn Mas‘ūd, and its chain is good.

And Jābir, may God be pleased with him, said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has a neighbor in a wall or a partner, let him not sell it until he offers it to him." (Ḥadīth of Jābir: "Whoever has a neighbor in a wall or a partner, let him not sell it until he offers it to him.") Reported by Ibn Mājah and al-Ḥākim without mention of the neighbor, and he said its chain is sound. It is found in al-Kharā’iṭī in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with the wording of the author. And in Ibn Mājah from the ḥadīth of Ibn ‘Abbās: "Whoever has land and wishes to sell it, let him offer it to his neighbor." And its narrators are men of sound ḥadīth.

And Abū Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, judged that a neighbor may place his beam in his neighbor's wall, whether he wills or refuses. (Ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, judged that a neighbor may place his beam in his neighbor's wall, whether he wills or refuses.") Narrated by al-Kharā’iṭī in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* thus, and it is agreed upon with the wording: "Let not any of you prevent his neighbor from fixing a wooden beam in his wall." Narrated by Ibn Mājah with a weak chain, and the two Shaykhs agreed upon it from the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah.

And Ibn ‘Abbās, may God be pleased with them both, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Let not any of you prevent his neighbor from placing a beam in his wall." And Abū Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "Why do I see you turning away from it? By God, I will cast it among your midst." And some scholars held that this is obligatory.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whomever God intends good for, He sweetens him." It was said, "And what is his sweetening?" He said, "He endears him to his neighbors." (Ḥadīth: "Whomever God intends good for, He sweetens him.") Narrated by Aḥmad from the ḥadīth of Abū ‘Utbah al-Khawlānī, and narrated by al-Kharā’iṭī in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* and al-Bayhaqī in *al-Zuhd* from the ḥadīth of ‘Amr ibn al-Ḥamq. Al-Kharā’iṭī added: It was said, "And what is his sweetening?" He said, "He endears him to his neighbors." And al-Bayhaqī said: "He opens for him a righteous deed before his death, so that those around him are pleased with him." And its chain is good.

**The Rights of Relatives and Kinship Ties**

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: God the Exalted says, "I am al-Raḥmān (the Most Merciful), and this is the womb (raḥm). I have derived a name for it from My Name. So whoever maintains it, I will maintain him; and whoever severs it, I will sever him." (Ḥadīth: "God says, 'I am al-Raḥmān, and this is the womb...'") Agreed upon from the ḥadīth of ‘Ā’ishah.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever is pleased to have his term extended and his provision expanded, let him maintain his kinship ties." (Ḥadīth: "Whoever is pleased to have his term extended and his provision expanded for him, let him fear God and maintain his kinship ties.") Agreed upon from the ḥadīth of Anas without the phrase "let him fear God." It is with this addition in Aḥmad and al-Ḥākim from the ḥadīth of ‘Alī with a good chain. And in another narration: "Whoever is pleased to have his life prolonged and his provision expanded for him, let him fear God and maintain his kinship ties."

And it was said to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, "Which of the people is best?" He said, "The most God-fearing of them, the most maintaining of kinship ties, the most commanding good, and the most forbidding evil." (Ḥadīth: "Which of the people is best?" He said, "The most God-fearing of them and the most maintaining of kinship ties.") Narrated by Aḥmad and al-Ṭabarānī from the ḥadīth of Durrah bint Abī Lahab with a sound chain.

And Abū Dharr, may God be pleased with him, said: "My intimate friend, upon him be peace, enjoined me to maintain kinship ties even if they turn away, and commanded me to speak the truth even if it is bitter." (Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr: "My intimate friend, peace and blessings be upon him, enjoined me to maintain kinship ties even if they turn away, and commanded me to speak the truth even if it is bitter.") Narrated by Aḥmad and Ibn Ḥibbān.

He authenticated it and said, peace be upon him: "Indeed, the womb is suspended from the Throne, and the maintainer of kinship ties is not the one who reciprocates, but the one who, when his ties are severed, joins them." This hadith, "Indeed, the womb is suspended from the Throne..." was narrated by al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr. It is in al-Bukhari without the phrase "the womb is suspended from the Throne," and Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

And he said, peace be upon him: "The obedience whose reward is most hastened is maintaining kinship ties, to the extent that the people of a household may be wicked, yet their wealth increases and their number multiplies if they maintain their kinship ties." This hadith, "The most hastened of obediences in reward..." was narrated by Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Abu Bakrah, and by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf with a weak chain.

And Zayd ibn Aslam said: When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, set out for Mecca, a man met him and said, "If you desire fair-skinned women and dark-colored she-camels, then turn to the tribe of Banu Mudlij." He, peace be upon him, said, "God has prevented me from (harming) Banu Mudlij due to their maintaining kinship ties." This hadith of Zayd ibn Aslam... was narrated by al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*, and he added: "...and their spearing the humps of camels." It is *mursal* with a sound chain.

And Asma' bint Abi Bakr, may God be pleased with them both, said: "My mother came to me, and I said, 'O Messenger of God, my mother has come to me and she is a polytheist. Shall I maintain ties with her?' He said, 'Yes.'" This hadith... is agreed upon (by al-Bukhari and Muslim). In one narration: "Shall I give to her?" He said, "Yes, maintain ties with her."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Charity given to a poor person is charity, but charity given to a relative is two things: charity and maintaining kinship ties." This hadith... was narrated by al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*, and by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Salman ibn 'Amir al-Dabbi.

And when Abu Talhah wanted to give in charity a garden he owned which he liked, acting upon the saying of God, "You will never attain righteousness until you spend from what you love..." This hadith... was narrated by al-Bukhari and has preceded. He said, "O Messenger of God, it is in the way of God, for the poor and the needy." He, peace be upon him, said, "Your reward is incumbent upon God. Distribute it among your relatives."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "The best charity is that given to a resentful relative." This hadith... was narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabarani from the hadith of Abu Ayyub, and in its chain is al-Hajjaj ibn Artah. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of Umm Kaththum bint 'Uqbah. It is in the meaning of his saying: "The best of virtues is that you maintain ties with one who severs them, give to one who deprives you, and pardon one who wrongs you." This hadith... was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Anas with a weak chain. Al-Tabarani has something similar from the hadith of Abu Umamah, and it has preceded.

And it is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, wrote to his governors: "Command relatives to visit one another and not to become neighbors." He said that only because becoming neighbors leads to competition over rights and may lead to estrangement and severing kinship ties.

The rights of parents and children: It is not hidden that when the right of kinship and the womb is emphasized, then the closest of kin and the most binding is that of parentage, so the emphasis of the right therein is multiplied. He, peace be upon him, said: "A child will not repay his parent until he finds him a slave, then buys him and emancipates him." This hadith... was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Righteousness to parents is better than prayer, charity, fasting, Hajj, 'Umrah, and jihad in the way of God." This hadith... I have not found it exactly like this. Abu Ya'la and al-Tabarani in *al-Saghir* and *al-Awsat* narrated from the hadith of Anas: A man came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, "I desire jihad but I am unable." He said, "Is either of your parents alive?" He said, "My mother." He said, "Then fulfill your duty to God by being righteous to her, for if you do that, you are a pilgrim, one performing 'Umrah, and a mujahid." Its chain is *hasan*.

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever wakes in the morning pleasing his two parents, for him are two doors opened to Paradise. And whoever wakes in the evening likewise. If he has only one (parent), then one door. Even if they wrong him, even if they wrong him, even if they wrong him. And whoever wakes in the morning displeasing his two parents, for him are two doors opened to the Fire. And whoever wakes in the evening likewise. If he has only one, then one door. Even if they wrong him, even if they wrong him..."

Injustice, even if it is injustice. A narration states: "Whoever wakes up pleasing his parents, for him two gates of Paradise are opened." This hadith was reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, but it is not authentic. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The fragrance of Paradise can be detected from a distance of five hundred years, but the one who is undutiful to parents or severs kinship ties will not find its fragrance." The hadith: "The fragrance of Paradise can be detected from a distance of five hundred years, but the one who is undutiful to parents or severs kinship ties will not find its fragrance," was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Saghir from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without mentioning "the one who severs kinship ties," and it is in al-Awsat from the narration of Jabir, except that he said: "from a distance of a thousand years," and the chains of both are weak. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Be dutiful to your mother, your father, your sister, your brother, then the next nearest, then the next nearest." The hadith: "Be dutiful to your mother, your father, your sister, your brother, then the next nearest, then the next nearest," was reported by al-Nasa'i from the narration of Tariq al-Muharibi, and reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Ramthah, and Abu Dawud has something similar from the narration of Kulayb ibn Manfa'ah from his grandfather. And he, and al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim who authenticated it, have it from the narration of Bahz ibn Hakim from his father from his grandfather, with the wording: "Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then the nearest relative, then the next nearest." And in the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: A man asked, "Who among people is most deserving of my good companionship?" He said, "Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father," the wording is Muslim's. And it is narrated that Allah the Exalted said to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, indeed whoever is dutiful to his parents but undutiful to Me, I record him as undutiful. And whoever is dutiful to Me but undutiful to his parents, I record him as undutiful." And it is said that when Jacob entered upon Joseph, peace be upon them, he did not stand up for him, so Allah revealed to him: "Do you consider it beneath you to stand for your father? By My Might and Majesty, I will not bring forth a prophet from your loins." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no harm upon anyone who intends to give charity, to give it on behalf of his parents if they are Muslims, so the reward is for his parents, and he receives a reward like theirs without anything being diminished from their rewards." The hadith: "There is no harm upon anyone who intends to give charity, to give it on behalf of his parents if they are Muslims," was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather with a weak chain, without the phrase "if they are Muslims." And Malik ibn Rabi'ah said: "While we were with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, a man from Banu Salamah came and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, is there anything left for me by which I can be dutiful to my parents after their death?' He said, 'Yes: praying for them, seeking forgiveness for them, fulfilling their promises, honoring their friends, and maintaining the ties of kinship that are only maintained through them.'" The hadith of Malik ibn Rabi'ah: "While we were with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, a man from Banu Salamah came and said, 'Is there anything left for me by which I can be dutiful to my parents?'" was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who said its chain is authentic. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Among the best forms of dutifulness is that a man maintains ties with his father's close friends after the father has passed away." The hadith: "Among the best forms of dutifulness is that a man maintains ties with his father's close friends," was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The dutifulness owed to the mother by the child is twice that [owed to the father]." The hadith: "The dutifulness owed to the mother by the child is twice that," is rare with this wording, and it has preceded this by three hadiths from the narration of Bahz ibn Hakim and the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it is the meaning of this hadith. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The supplication of a parent is answered most quickly." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah, why is that?" He said, "She is more merciful than the father, and the supplication of a close relative does not go unanswered." The hadith: "The supplication of a parent is answered most quickly," I have not found a source for it. And a man asked him, saying, "O Messenger of Allah, to whom should I be dutiful?" He said, "Be dutiful to your parents." He said, "I have no parents." He said, "Be dutiful to your child, for just as your parents have a right over you, so too your child has a right over you." The hadith: "A man said, 'O Messenger of Allah, to whom should I be dutiful?' He said, 'Be dutiful to your parents.' He said, 'I have no parents.' He said, 'Your child, for just as your parents have a right over you, so too your child has a right over you,'" was reported by Abu 'Umar al-Nawqati in the book *Mu'asharat al-Ahlin* from the narration of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan without the phrase "for just as your parents..." etc. This portion was narrated by al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. Al-Daraqutni said in *al-'Ilal* that the more correct view is that it stops at Ibn 'Umar (i.e., is his saying, not the Prophet's). And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "May Allah have mercy on a parent who helps his child to be dutiful to him." The hadith: "May Allah have mercy on a parent who helps his child to be dutiful to him," was reported by Abu al-Shaykh, Ibn Hibban in the book *al-Thawab* from the narration of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain, and al-Nawqati reported it from the narration of al-Sha'bi as *mursal* (with a broken chain). It is also said: "Do not burden him with undutifulness due to his own evil action." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Treat your children equally in gifts." And it has been said: "Your child is your sweet basil—you enjoy its scent for seven years, and he is your servant for seven years, then he is either your enemy or your partner." And Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The infant is offered the 'Aqiqah sacrifice on the seventh day, he is named, and harm is removed from him. When he reaches six years, he is disciplined. When he reaches nine years, he is separated (in bedding)."

His bed is then separated. When he reaches thirteen years of age, he is disciplined for prayer. When he reaches sixteen years, his father marries him off. Then he takes him by the hand and says, "I have disciplined you, taught you, and married you. I seek refuge in Allah from your tribulation in this world and your punishment in the Hereafter." A narration from Anas: The boy is offered the 'Aqeeqah on the seventh day, is named, and harm is removed from him. When he reaches six years, he is disciplined. When he reaches seven years, his bed is separated. When he reaches thirteen, he is disciplined for prayer and fasting. When he reaches sixteen, his father marries him off. Then he takes him by the hand and says, "I have disciplined you, taught you, and married you. I seek refuge in Allah from your tribulation in this world and your punishment in the Hereafter." Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban recorded it in the book "Al-Dhahaya wa al-'Aqeeqah," except he said: "Discipline him at seven and marry him off at seventeen," and he did not mention fasting. In its chain is an unnamed narrator. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "From the right of the parent upon the child is that he disciplines him well and gives him a good name." A narration: "From the right of the child upon the parent is that he disciplines him well and gives him a good name." Al-Bayhaqi recorded it in "Al-Shu'ab" from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas and a narration from 'A'ishah, and he deemed them weak. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Every child is pledged by his 'Aqeeqah; it is slaughtered for him on the seventh day and his head is shaved." A narration: "Every child is pledged by his 'Aqeeqah; it is slaughtered for him on the seventh day and his head is shaved." The authors of the Sunan recorded it from the narration of Samurah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan Sahih." And Qatadah said: "When the 'Aqeeqah is slaughtered, a tuft of wool is taken from it, the jugular veins are faced with it, then it is placed on the crown of the child's head until something like a thread flows from it, then his head is washed and shaved afterwards." A man came to 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak and complained to him about one of his children. He said, "Have you supplicated against him?" He said, "Yes." He said, "You have ruined him." Gentleness with the child is recommended. Al-Aqra' ibn Habis saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, kissing his son al-Hasan. He said, "I have ten children and I have never kissed any of them." He, peace be upon him, said: "He who shows no mercy will be shown no mercy." A narration: Al-Aqra' ibn Habis saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, kissing his son al-Hasan. He said, "I have ten children and I have never kissed any of them." He said: "He who shows no mercy will be shown no mercy." Al-Bukhari recorded it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to me one day, 'Wash Usamah's face.' I began to wash it while feeling some aversion. He struck my hand, then took him and washed his face, then kissed him and said, 'He has been good to us by not being a girl.'" A narration from 'Aishah: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to me one day, 'Wash Usamah's face.' I began to wash it while feeling some aversion. He struck my hand, then took him and washed his face, then kissed him and said, 'He has been good to us by not being a girl.'" I did not find it exactly like this. And Ahmad has from the narration of 'A'ishah that Usamah stumbled on the threshold of the door and bled. The Prophet, peace be upon him, began to suck it and said, "If Usamah were a girl, I would have adorned her and clothed her until I spent on her." Its chain is sound. And al-Hasan stumbled while the Prophet, peace be upon him, was on his pulpit. He descended and carried him, and recited His saying: "Your wealth and your children are but a trial." A narration: Al-Hasan stumbled while he, peace be upon him, was on his pulpit. He descended and carried him, and recited His saying, the Exalted: "Your wealth and your children are but a trial." The authors of the Sunan recorded it from the narration of Buraydah concerning al-Hasan and al-Husayn together, walking and stumbling. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan Gharib." And 'Abdullah ibn Shaddad said: "While the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was leading the people in prayer, al-Husayn came and climbed onto his neck while he was prostrating. He prolonged the prostration for the people until they thought something had happened. When he finished his prayer, they said, 'You prolonged the prostration, O Messenger of Allah, until we thought something had happened.' He said, 'My son mounted me, and I disliked to hurry him until he satisfied his need.'" A narration from 'Abdullah ibn Shaddad: "While the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was leading the people in prayer, al-Hasan came and climbed onto his neck." Al-Nasa'i recorded it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Shaddad from his father, and in it he said "al-Hasan or al-Husayn" with uncertainty. Al-Hakim recorded it and said: "Sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs." In that are benefits: one of them is nearness to Allah, the Exalted, for the servant is closest to Allah, the Exalted, when he is prostrating. And in it is gentleness with the child, kindness, and a lesson for his nation. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The scent of the child is from the scent of Paradise." A narration: "The scent of the child is from the scent of Paradise." Al-Tabarani recorded it in "Al-Saghir" and "Al-Awsat," and Ibn Hibban recorded it among the weak narrations from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. In it is Mandal ibn 'Ali, who is weak. And Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah said: "My father sent for al-Ahnaf ibn Qays. When he reached him, he said to him, 'O Abu Bahr, what do you say about children?' He said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, they are the fruits of our hearts, the supports of our backs. We are for them a humble earth and a shading sky. Through them we attain every lofty matter. If they ask, give to them. If they become angry, appease them, so that they may bestow their affection upon you and love you.'"

Exert yourself for them and do not become a heavy burden upon them, lest they grow weary of your life and wish for your death, and come to dislike your proximity." Mu'awiyah said to him, "By God, you are truly Ahnaf. You came to me while I was filled with anger and rage towards Yazid, but when Ahnaf left his presence, he became pleased with Yazid and sent him two hundred thousand dirhams and two hundred garments. Yazid then sent Ahnaf one hundred thousand dirhams and one hundred garments, and he shared them equally with him. These are the reports that indicate the firm obligation of the rights of parents, and the manner of fulfilling their rights is understood from what we have mentioned concerning the rights of siblings, for this bond is more emphatic than that of siblings. Indeed, two additional matters are present here: First, the majority of scholars hold that obedience to parents is obligatory in matters of ambiguity, even if it is not obligatory in purely forbidden matters, to the extent that if they are displeased by your eating separately from them, you must eat with them, because avoiding ambiguity is piety, and pleasing one's parents is an absolute duty. Likewise, you may not travel for a permissible or supererogatory act except with their permission. Hastening to perform the Hajj, which is a pillar of Islam, is considered supererogatory because it can be delayed, and traveling to seek knowledge is supererogatory, unless you are seeking knowledge of obligatory acts such as prayer and fasting, and there is no one in your locality to teach you. This is like one who embraces Islam initially in a land where there is no one to teach him the rulings of Islam; he must emigrate and is not bound by the rights of his parents. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: A man emigrated to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, from Yemen and desired to engage in jihad. The Prophet, peace be upon him, asked, "Do you have parents in Yemen?" He said, "Yes." He asked, "Have they given you permission?" He said, "No." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Then return to your parents and seek their permission. If they grant it, then engage in jihad; otherwise, be dutiful to them as much as you are able, for that is the best thing with which you will meet God after monotheism." Another man came to him, peace be upon him, to seek counsel regarding military expedition. He asked, "Do you have a mother?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Then stay with her, for Paradise lies at her feet." Another came seeking to pledge allegiance for emigration and said, "I did not come to you until I made my parents weep." He said, "Return to them and make them laugh as you made them weep." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The right of the elder sibling upon the younger is like the right of a parent upon his child." He also said, "If any of you finds his mount stubborn, or his wife's character disagreeable, or anyone in his household, let him whisper in its ear." Regarding the rights of slaves: Know that the rights of marriage have preceded in the etiquette of marriage. As for the rights of those whom your right hands possess, they also entail rights in companionship that must be observed. Among the last things the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, enjoined was: "Fear God concerning those whom your right hands possess. Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not burden them with work beyond their capacity. If you are pleased with them, keep them; if you are displeased, sell them. And do not torment God's creation, for God has given you authority over them, and had He willed, He could have given them authority over you."

Death, prayer, prayer, and what your right hands possess. In a narration from Abu Dharr: "Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not burden them with what overwhelms them. If you do burden them, then assist them." This is the wording of Muslim's narration. In a narration from Abu Dawud: "Those among your servants who are suitable for you, feed them from what you eat and clothe them from what you wear. Those who are not suitable, sell them, and do not torment the creation of Allah Almighty." Its chain is sound. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "For the servant is his food and clothing in a reasonable manner, and he is not burdened with work he cannot bear." A narration: "For the servant is his food and clothing in a reasonable manner, and he is not burdened with work he cannot bear." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The deceitful, the arrogant, the treacherous, and the one who is harsh with his dependents will not enter Paradise." A narration: "The deceitful, the arrogant, the treacherous, and the one who is harsh with his dependents will not enter Paradise." Reported by Ahmad collectively, Al-Tirmidhi separately, and Ibn Majah limited to 'harsh with his dependents' from the narration of Abu Bakr. None of them have 'the arrogant,' and Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhi added 'the miser and the one who reminds of his favors,' but it is weak. Al-Tirmidhi graded one of its chains as good. And Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: "O Messenger of Allah, how often should we forgive a servant?" The Messenger of Allah remained silent, then said: "Forgive him seventy times each day." A narration from Ibn Umar: A man came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: "O Messenger of Allah, how often should we forgive a servant?" He remained silent, then said: "Forgive him seventy times each day." Reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi, who said it is good, sound, and rare. And Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, would go to Al-Awali every Saturday, and if he found a servant in work he could not bear, he would relieve him of it. And it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he saw a man on his mount with his servant running behind him. He said to him: "O servant of Allah, let him ride behind you, for he is your brother; his soul is like your soul." So he let him ride. Then he said: "A servant only increases in distance from Allah as long as he walks behind him." And a slave-girl said to Abu al-Darda': "I have been poisoning you for a year, yet nothing has affected you." He said: "Why did you do that?" She said: "I wanted relief from you." He said: "Go, you are free for the sake of Allah." And Al-Zuhri said: "Whenever I said to a servant, 'May Allah disgrace you,' he is free." And Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays was asked: "From whom did you learn forbearance?" He said: "From Qays ibn 'Asim." It was said: "What was the extent of his forbearance?" He said: "While he was sitting in his house, a servant girl came to him with a skewer of roasted meat. The skewer fell from her hand onto one of his sons, injuring him so that he died. The girl was terrified. He said: 'Nothing will calm this girl's fear except emancipation.' So he said to her: 'You are free, no blame is upon you.'" And 'Awn ibn Abdullah, when his servant disobeyed him, would say: "How similar you are to your Master. Your Master disobeys his Master, and you disobey your Master." One day the servant angered him, and he said: "You only want me to strike you. Go, you are free." And Maymun ibn Mihran had a guest. He hurried his servant girl for the evening meal. She came quickly with a full bowl, tripped, and spilled it on the head of her master, Maymun. He said: "O girl, you have burned me!" She said: "O teacher of good and educator of people, return to what Allah Almighty has said." He said: "And what has Allah Almighty said?" She said: "He said: 'And those who restrain anger.'" He said: "I have restrained my anger." She said: "'And those who pardon the people.'" He said: "I have pardoned you." She said: "Add to it, for Allah Almighty says: 'And Allah loves the doers of good.'" He said: "You are free for the sake of Allah Almighty." And Ibn al-Munkadir said: "A man from the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, struck his servant. The servant kept saying: 'I ask you by Allah, I ask you by the face of Allah,' but he did not refrain. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, heard the servant's cry and went to him. When the man saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he stopped his hand. The Messenger of Allah said: 'He asked you by the face of Allah and you did not refrain? When you saw me, you stopped your hand?' He said: 'Then he is free for the sake of Allah, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'If you had not done so, the Fire would have scorched your face.'" A narration from Ibn al-Munkadir: A man from the companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, struck his servant. The servant kept saying: "I ask you by Allah, I ask you by the face of Allah." The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, heard the servant's cry... the narration. Reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in "Al-Zuhd" as mursal. And in a narration of Muslim in the upcoming narration of Abu Mas'ud: He began saying: "I seek refuge in Allah." He continued to strike him. Then he said: "I seek refuge with the Messenger of Allah," so he left him. And in another narration of his: So I said: "He is free for the sake of Allah." He said: "If you had not done so, the Fire would have scorched you or the Fire would have touched you." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The servant who is sincere to his master and excels in the worship of Allah will have a double reward." A narration: "If the servant is sincere to his master and excels in the worship of Allah, he will have a double reward." Agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Umar. And when Abu Rafi' was emancipated, he wept and said: "It was for me..."

Two rewards, and one of them departed. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There were presented before me the first three to enter Paradise and the first three to enter the Fire. As for the first three to enter Paradise: the martyr, a bondsman-slave who worships his Lord well and is sincere to his master, and a chaste, self-restrained man with dependents. And the first three to enter the Fire: a domineering ruler, a wealthy man who does not give the right due to God, and a boastful poor man." A narration: "There were presented before me the first three to enter Paradise and the first three to enter the Fire. So the first three to enter Paradise: the martyr, and a bondsman-slave who worships his Lord well and is sincere to his master..." This was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan* (good), and by Ibn Hibban from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

And from Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari, who said: "While I was striking a servant of mine, I heard a voice from behind me, 'Know, O Abu Mas'ud! Know, O Abu Mas'ud!' twice. I turned and there was the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. I dropped the whip from my hand, and he said, 'By God, God has more power over you than you have over this one.'" A narration of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari: "While I was striking a servant of mine, I heard a voice from behind me, 'Know, O Abu Mas'ud!' twice..." The narration is from Muslim.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When one of you buys a servant, let the first thing he feeds him be something sweet, for it is more pleasing to his soul." A narration of Mu'adh: "When one of you buys a servant, let the first thing he feeds him be something sweet, for it is more pleasing to his soul." This was transmitted by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and al-Khara'iti in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* with a weak chain, narrated by Mu'adh.

And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When one of you is brought his food by his servant, let him seat him and eat with him. If he does not do so, then let him hand him a morsel." A narration of Abu Hurayrah: "...and let him eat with him. If he refuses, then let him hand him a morsel." And in another narration: "When one of you has his bondsman prepare his food..." This is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) with differing wording, and it is in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* of al-Khara'iti with the two wordings mentioned by the author, except that he did not mention its remedy. And this wording is in al-Bukhari. And in a narration: "When one of you has his bondsman undertake the preparation of his food, and he has spared him its heat, its cost, and brought it near to him, then let him seat him and eat with him. If he does not do so, then let him hand him a morsel, or let him take a bite, moisten it"—and he gestured with his hand—"and place it in his hand, and say, 'Eat this.'"

And a man entered upon Salman while he was kneading dough and said, "O Abu 'Abdullah, what is this?" He said, "We sent the servant on an errand, and we disliked to burden him with two tasks."

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has a bondmaid, and he educates her well, treats her kindly, then manumits her and marries her, for him are two rewards." A narration: "Whoever has a bondmaid, and he educates her and treats her kindly, then manumits her and marries her, for him are two rewards." This is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Musa.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, has said: "Every one of you is a shepherd, and every one of you is responsible for his flock." A narration: "Every one of you is a shepherd, and every one of you is responsible for his flock." This is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, and it has preceded.

Thus, the comprehensive right of the bondsman is that you share with him in your food and your clothing, and you do not burden him beyond his capacity, and you do not look upon him with an eye of arrogance and contempt, and that you pardon his slip and reflect, when angered with him, upon your own lapses or your transgressions in sins and your transgressions against the right of God Almighty and your shortcomings in obeying Him, despite the fact that God's power over you is greater than your power over him.

And Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Three about whom no question will be asked: a man who separated from the community, and a man who disobeyed his leader and died disobedient—so no question will be asked about these two—and a woman whose husband was absent, and he had provided her worldly needs, yet she adorned herself (improperly) after him—so no question will be asked about her. And three about whom no question will be asked: a man who contends with God for His cloak—and His cloak is majesty, and His waist-wrapper is might—and a man who is in doubt about God and despairs of God's mercy." A narration of Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd: "Three about whom no question will be asked: a man who separated from the community and disobeyed his leader and died disobedient..." This was transmitted by al-Tabarani and he authenticated it. The book *The Etiquettes of Companionship and Social Interaction with All Classes of Creation* is complete.
