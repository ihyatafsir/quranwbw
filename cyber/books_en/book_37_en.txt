The Book of Intention, Sincerity, and Truthfulness
Which is the Seventh Book of the Quarter of Deliverances from the Book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences"
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

We praise God with the praise of the grateful, and we believe in Him with the faith of the certain, and we affirm His Oneness with the affirmation of the truthful. And we bear witness that there is no god but God, the Lord of all worlds, the Creator of the heavens and the earths, and the One who has charged the jinn, mankind, and the angels brought near to worship Him with the worship of the sincere. So He, the Exalted, said: "And they were not commanded except to worship God, sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth." So what belongs to God is nothing but the sincere, firm religion, for He is the Most Rich of the rich, free from the partnership of associates. And blessings upon His Prophet Muhammad, the master of the messengers, and upon all the prophets, and upon his family and his pure, goodly companions.

Now then, it has become clear to the possessors of hearts, through the insight of faith and the lights of the Quran, that there is no attainment of felicity except through knowledge and worship. For all people are ruined except the knowledgeable, and all the knowledgeable are ruined except those who act, and all those who act are ruined except the sincere, and the sincere are in grave peril. For action without intention is toil, and intention without sincerity is ostentation, and it is a match for hypocrisy and equal to disobedience. And sincerity without truthfulness and verification is futile. And God, the Exalted, has said concerning every deed that was mixed and submerged with a desire other than God's: "And We will proceed to what they have done of deeds and make them as dust scattered." And I wonder, how can one whose intention is sound not know the reality of intention? Or how can one who has corrected his intention be sincere if he does not know the reality of sincerity? Or how can the sincere one demand truthfulness from himself if he has not verified its meaning? Therefore, the primary duty upon every servant who desires obedience to God, the Exalted, is to first learn about intention so that knowledge is attained, then to correct it through action after understanding the reality of truthfulness and sincerity, which are our means as servants to salvation and deliverance. And we will mention the meanings of truthfulness and sincerity in three chapters:

Chapter One: On the reality of intention and its meaning.
Chapter Two: On sincerity and its realities.
Chapter Three: On truthfulness and its reality.

Chapter One: On the reality of intention and its meaning, containing:
An exposition of the virtue of intention.
An exposition of the reality of intention.
An exposition that intention is better than action.
An exposition of the superiority of actions pertaining to the self.
An exposition that intention is beyond choice.

An exposition of the virtue of intention:
God, the Exalted, said: "And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His countenance." And what is meant by that desire is intention. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, actions are but by intentions, and every person shall have only what they intended. So whoever's emigration was for God and His Messenger, then his emigration was for God and His Messenger. And whoever's emigration was for worldly gain or a woman to marry, then his emigration was for that which he emigrated." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The majority of the martyrs of my community are the people of the beds. And many a slain one between the two battle lines—God knows best his intention." And the Exalted said: "If they intend reconciliation, God will cause reconciliation between them." Thus He made intention the cause of reconciliation. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, God, the Exalted, does not look at your forms or your wealth, but He looks at your hearts and your actions." And He looks at the hearts because they are the locus of intention. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, a servant performs good deeds, so the angels ascend with them in sealed scrolls, and they are presented before God, the Exalted. So He says: 'Cast aside this scroll, for he did not desire My countenance with what is in it.' Then He calls to the angels: 'Write for him such and such, write for him such and such.' They say: 'O our Lord, he did not perform any of that.' God says: 'He intended it.'" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "People are of four kinds: A man to whom God, the Mighty and Majestic, has given knowledge and wealth, so he acts upon his knowledge with his wealth. A man says: 'If God, the Exalted, had given me the like of what He gave him, I would have acted as he acts.' So they are equal in reward. And a man to whom God, the Exalted, has given wealth but has not given him knowledge, so he stumbles in ignorance with his wealth. A man says: 'If God had given me the like of what He gave him, I would have acted as he acts.' So they are equal in sin." And in the wording: "The likeness of this community is like four men." Do you not see how he made him a partner through intention in the merits and demerits of his action? Likewise, in the narration of Anas ibn Malik, when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, went out on the expedition of Tabuk, he said: "There are people in Medina; we did not cross a valley nor tread a place that angers the disbelievers, nor did we spend any expenditure, nor did any hardship befall us, except that they shared in that with us, while they are in Medina." They said: "How is that, O Messenger of God, when they are not with us?" He said: "An excuse prevented them, so they shared through their good intention." And in the narration of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whoever emigrates seeking something, it is for him." So a man emigrated and married a woman from among us, and he was called 'The Emigrant of Umm Qays.' Likewise, it came in a report that a man was killed in the path of God and was called 'The slain one of the donkey,' because he fought a man to take his spoils and his donkey, and he was killed for that, so he was ascribed to his intention. And in the narration of 'Ubadah from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever fights and intends nothing but a hobbling rope, he shall have what he intended." And Abu... said: "I sought help from a man to fight with me. He said: 'Not until you give me a reward.' So I gave him one. I mentioned that to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said: 'He shall have nothing from his world or his hereafter except what you gave him.'" And it is narrated in the Isra'iliyat: "A man passed by dunes of sand during a famine and said to himself: 'If this sand were food, I would distribute it among the people.' So God, the Exalted, revealed to their prophet: 'Say to him: Indeed, God, the Exalted, has accepted your charity and has thanked your good intention, and has given you the reward of what you would have given in charity if it were food.'" And it has been reported in many narrations: "Whoever intends a good deed but does not do it, it is written for him as a good deed." And in the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "Whoever's intention is this world, God will place his poverty between his eyes and he will leave it when he is most desirous of it. And whoever's intention is the Hereafter, God, the Exalted, will place his richness in his heart and gather his affairs for him, and he will leave it when he is most detached from it." And in the narration of Umm Salamah, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned an army that would be swallowed by the desert. I said: "O Messenger of God, will there be among them the coerced and the hired?" He said: "They will be resurrected according to their intentions." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: "Indeed, the fighters only fight according to their intentions." And he, peace be upon him, said: "When two ranks meet, the angels descend writing the creation according to their ranks: 'So-and-so fights for the world, so-and-so fights out of zeal, so-and-so fights for tribal loyalty.' Beware, do not say: 'So-and-so was killed in the path of God.' For whoever fights so that the word of God may be supreme, he is in the path of God." And from Jabir from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Every servant will be resurrected upon what he died upon." And in the narration of Al-Ahnaf from Abu Bakrah: "When two Muslims meet with their swords,

Know that it may be thought that the reason for this preference is that intention is a secret known only to God, Exalted is He, while action is apparent, and secret action has merit. This is true, but it is not what is intended. For if one intended to remember God in his heart or to reflect on the welfare of the Muslims, the generality of the hadith would necessitate that the intention to reflect be better than the reflection itself. And it may be thought that the reason for the preference is that intention lasts until the end of the action, while actions do not last. This is weak, because its meaning reverts to the idea that much action is better than little, but it is not so. For the intention for the acts of prayer may last only for a few moments, while the actions last, and the generality necessitates that his intention be better than his action. And it may be said that its meaning is that intention by itself is better than action by itself without intention. This is so, but it is unlikely to be what is intended, for action without intention or in heedlessness has no good in it at all, while intention by itself is good. The apparent preference is for those who share in the root of goodness. Rather, the meaning is that every act of obedience, which comprises intention and action, and the intention was among the good things and the action was among the good things—but the intention, as part of the obedience, is better than the action. That is, each of them has an effect in the intended aim, and the effect of the intention is greater than the effect of the action. So its meaning is: the intention of the believer, as part of his obedience, is better than his action, which is part of his obedience. The purpose is that the servant has a choice in intention and in action. So whenever there are two actions, and the intention is the better of the two in sum, this is its meaning. As for the reason for it being better and preferred over action, none understands it except he who understands the aim of the religion and its path, and the extent of the path's effect in connecting to the aim, and who compares some effects with others until what is more preferable relative to the aim becomes clear to him thereafter. For he who says bread is better than fruit only means that it is better relative to the aim of sustenance and nourishment. None understands that except he who understands that nourishment has an aim, which is health and survival, and that nourishments have different effects therein, and who understands the effect of each and compares some with others. Thus, acts of obedience are nourishment for the hearts, and the aim is their healing, survival, safety in the Hereafter, their happiness, and their bliss in meeting God, Exalted is He. The aim is the delight of happiness in meeting God alone. And none will enjoy meeting God except he who dies loving God, Exalted is He, knowing God. And none will love Him except he who knows Him. And none will find intimacy with his Lord except he who prolongs his remembrance of Him. Thus, intimacy is attained through constant remembrance, and knowledge is attained through constant reflection, and love necessarily follows knowledge. And the heart will not be free for constant remembrance and reflection except if it is free from the preoccupations of the world. And it will not be free from its preoccupations except if its desires are cut off from it, until it becomes inclined to good, desiring it, and averse to evil, detesting it. And it only inclines to good deeds and acts of obedience if it knows that its happiness in the Hereafter is tied to them, just as the rational person inclines to cupping and bloodletting, knowing that his well-being lies in them. And when the root of inclination is attained through knowledge, it is only strengthened by acting in accordance with the inclination and persisting in it. For persistence in acting in accordance with the attributes of the heart and its will runs the course of nourishment and sustenance for that attribute, until the attribute is refined and strengthened because of it. Thus, he who is inclined to seek knowledge or seek leadership, his inclination at the beginning is only weak. If he follows according to his inclination and occupies himself with knowledge and cultivating leadership and the actions required for that, his inclination is confirmed, becomes firm, and it becomes difficult for him to turn away. And if he opposes the requirement of his inclination, his inclination weakens and breaks, and perhaps vanishes. And indeed, he who looks at a beautiful face, for example, and is naturally inclined to it—not weakly—if he follows it and acts according to it, and persists in looking, companionship, mixing, and conversing, his inclination is confirmed until his affair goes beyond his choice, and he is unable to turn away from it. And if he weaned himself initially and opposed the requirement of his inclination, that would be like cutting off sustenance and nourishment from the attribute of inclination, and it would be a rebuke and a push in his face, until it weakens and breaks because of it, and is suppressed and erased. And thus all attributes, good deeds, and acts of obedience—all of them are what the Hereafter is desired by. And all evils are what the world is desired by, not the Hereafter. And the soul's inclination to the good deeds of the Hereafter and its turning away from the worldly ones is what empties it for remembrance and reflection. And that will not be confirmed except by persistence in acts of obedience and abandoning sins with the limbs, because between the limbs and the heart there is a connection such that each of them is affected by the other. Thus, you see if a limb is wounded, the heart is pained by it. And you see if the heart is pained by knowledge of the death of a dear one or the assault of a fearful matter, the limbs are affected by it, the limbs tremble, and the color changes. Except that the heart is the followed origin, so it is as if it is the commander, the shepherd, and the limbs are like servants, subjects, and followers. Thus, the limbs serve the heart by confirming its attributes within it. So the heart is the intended aim, and the limbs are instruments leading to the aim. And for that reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Verily, in the body there is a morsel; if it is sound, the whole body is sound." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "O God, rectify the shepherd and the flock," intending by the shepherd the heart. And God, Exalted is He, said, "Their flesh will not reach God, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you," and it is an attribute of the heart. So from this perspective, it necessarily must be that the actions of the heart in sum are better than the movements of the limbs. Then it necessarily must be that intention from among them is better, because it is an expression of the heart's inclination to good and its will for it. And our purpose from actions with the limbs is that the heart returns to willing good and that inclination to it is confirmed within it, so that it is emptied of worldly desires and plunges into remembrance and reflection. So necessarily, it is better relative to the purpose because it is established in the very aim. This is like if the stomach is pained, it may be treated by placing a plaster on the chest and treated by drinking and medicine that reaches the stomach. So drinking is better than plastering the chest, because plastering the chest is also only intended so that its effect spreads from it to the stomach. So what reaches the stomach itself is better and more beneficial. Thus, you should understand the effect of all acts of obedience in this way, for what is required from them is changing the hearts and altering their attributes only, not the limbs. So do not think that in placing the forehead on the ground there is a purpose in that it brings together the forehead and the earth, but rather in that by habitual practice it confirms the attribute of humility in the heart. For he who finds humility in himself, if he humbles his limbs and forms them in the form of humility, his humility is confirmed. And he who finds tenderness in his heart for an orphan, if he strokes his head and kisses him, tenderness is confirmed in his heart. And for this reason, action without intention is not beneficial at all, because he who strokes the head of an orphan while his heart is heedless or thinking he is stroking a garment, no effect spreads from his limbs to his heart to confirm tenderness. Likewise, he who prostrates heedlessly, his concern preoccupied with worldly appearances, no effect spreads from his forehead and its placement on the ground to his heart to confirm humility by it. So the existence of that is like its non-existence. And what equates its existence to its non-existence relative to the required purpose is called invalid. Thus, it is said: worship without intention is invalid. This is its meaning if done in heedlessness. But if it is intended for show or glorifying another person, its existence is not like its non-existence; rather, it increases him in evil, for he did not confirm the required attribute by confirming it; rather, he confirmed the attribute that is required to be suppressed, which is the attribute of show, which is from inclination to the world. This is the aspect of intention being better than action. And by this also is known the meaning of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Whoever intends a good deed but does not do it, it is written for him as a good deed." For

The Second Division: Acts of Obedience

It is connected to intentions in terms of the foundation of its validity and the multiplication of its merit. As for the foundation, it is that one intends by it the worship of God Almighty, nothing else. If one intends ostentation, it becomes a sin. As for the multiplication of merit, it is through the abundance of good intentions. For a single act of obedience can be intended with many good purposes, and he will have a reward for each intention, for each one of them is a good deed. Then each good deed is multiplied tenfold, as has come in the report. An example is sitting in the mosque, for it is an act of obedience, and one can intend many intentions within it, such that it becomes from the virtuous deeds of the God-fearing and attains by it the degrees of those brought near.

The first is that he believes it is the House of God and that its occupant is a visitor to God, so he intends by it visiting his Lord, hoping for what His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, promised where he said, "Whoever sits in the mosque has indeed visited God Almighty, and it is incumbent upon the One visited to honor His visitor."

The second is that he awaits the prayer after the prayer, so he is among those awaiting the prayer, and this is the meaning of His saying, the Exalted, "And maintain the ties of prayer."

The third is monastic devotion by restraining the hearing, sight, and limbs from movements and comings and goings, for seclusion is restraint, and it is in the meaning of fasting, which is a type of monastic devotion. Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The monasticism of my community is sitting in the mosques."

The fourth is the focusing of concern upon God and adhering the inner self to contemplation of the Hereafter, and repelling distracting preoccupations by secluding oneself to the mosque.

The fifth is dedicating oneself to the remembrance of God, or to listening to His remembrance, and to being reminded by it, as is reported in the tradition: "Whoever goes to the mosque to remember God Almighty or to be reminded of Him is like a warrior in the cause of God Almighty."

The sixth is to intend imparting knowledge through enjoining good and forbidding evil, for the mosque is never devoid of one who performs his prayer poorly or engages in what is unlawful for him, so he enjoins him with good and guides him to the religion, thus becoming a partner with him in the good he learns from it, whereby his good deeds multiply.

The seventh is to gain a brother in God, for that is a gain and a provision for the Abode of the Hereafter, and the mosque is the nesting place of the people of religion who love for God and in God.

The eighth is to abandon sins out of shame before God Almighty and shame before engaging in the House of God in what necessitates the violation of sanctity. Al-Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them both, said: “Whoever persists in frequenting the mosque, God grants him one of seven traits: a brother gained in God, a mercy sent down, knowledge made delightful, a word that points to guidance, a turning away from ruin, or abandoning sins out of fear or shame.” This is the way to multiply intentions, and judge by this all other acts of obedience and permissible matters, for there is no act of obedience except that it admits many intentions. They only become present in the heart of the believing servant to the extent of his earnestness in seeking good, his rolling up his sleeves for it, and his reflection upon it. Through this, deeds are purified and good deeds are multiplied.

The Third Division: Permissible Matters

There is nothing among permissible matters that does not admit of an intention or intentions, whereby it may become among the virtuous acts of drawing near [to God] and through which the highest degrees are attained. How great, then, is the loss of one who is heedless of them and undertakes them as beasts do, neglected out of inadvertence and heedlessness. The servant should not deem insignificant anything of his fleeting thoughts, his steps, or his glances, for all of that will be questioned about on the Day of Resurrection: why did he do it, and what did he intend by it? This is in a purely permissible matter, untainted by any dislike. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Its lawful [deeds] entail reckoning, and its unlawful [deeds] entail punishment." In the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, the servant will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about everything, even about the kohl of his eyes, and about the crumbs of clay on his fingers, and about touching his brother's garment." In another report: "Whoever applies perfume for the sake of God Almighty will come on the Day of Resurrection with a fragrance more pleasant than musk; and whoever applies perfume for other than God will come on the Day of Resurrection with a stench more foul than a carcass." Thus, using perfume is permissible, but it necessarily requires an intention. If you ask: "What intention can one have regarding perfume, which is a share of the soul's desires, and how can one apply perfume for God's sake?" Know that one who applies perfume, for example, on Friday or at other times, may intend to indulge in worldly pleasures, or to display pride in abundant wealth so that his peers envy him, or to show off to people so that status is established for him in their hearts and he is remembered for his pleasant scent, or to endear himself to the hearts of strange women if he deems looking at them permissible, and for other countless reasons. All of this makes applying perfume a sin, and thereby it becomes more foul than a carcass on the Day of Resurrection—except for the first intention, which is seeking pleasure and enjoyment, for that is not a sin, but he will be questioned about it, "and whoever is subjected to a detailed reckoning will be punished." Whoever does something from the permissible matters of this world will not be punished for it in the Hereafter, but his bliss in the Hereafter will be diminished proportionately. And sufficient is the loss in hastening what perishes and forfeiting an increase in bliss that does not perish. As for the good intention, he intends by it to follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, on Friday, and he also intends by it to honor the mosque and respect the House of God, so he does not deem it fitting to enter it as a visitor to God except with a pleasant scent; and to intend by it to give comfort to his neighbors so they may find rest in the mosque from the proximity of his fragrance; and to intend by it to repel foul odors from himself which would lead to harming those around him; and to intend to close the door of backbiting for backbiters if they backbite him for foul odors, thus disobeying God because of him—for whoever exposes himself to backbiting while capable of avoiding it is a partner in that sin, as it is said: "If you depart from a people when they were able that you not leave them, then the departers are they." And God Almighty said: "And do not insult those they invoke other than God, lest they insult God in enmity without knowledge." He indicated by this that being a cause for evil is evil. And to intend by it to treat his brain so that his acumen and intelligence increase, facilitating for him the comprehension of important matters of his religion through thought, for al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said: "Whoever's scent becomes pleasant, his intellect increases." These and similar intentions are not beyond the capability of the discerning person if the trade of the Hereafter and the pursuit of good predominate in his heart. If nothing predominates in his heart except the bliss of this world, these intentions do not occur to him, and if they are mentioned to him, his heart is not inclined to them, so he gains from them nothing but the whisperings of the soul, and that is not considered an intention at all. Permissible matters are many, and it is not possible to enumerate the intentions for them; so judge other matters by this one.

For this reason, some of the knowers among the predecessors said: "I love to have an intention in everything, even in my eating, drinking, sleeping, and entering the privy." All of that is from what can be intended for drawing near to God Almighty, because everything that is a cause for the body's survival and the heart's freedom from bodily concerns is an aid to religion. So whoever intends by eating to gain strength for worship, and by intercourse to protect his religion, please his family's hearts, and attain through it righteous offspring who worship God Almighty after him, thus increasing the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him—he is obedient through his eating and intercourse. The predominant shares of the soul are eating and intercourse, and intending good through them is not impossible for one in whose heart concern for the Hereafter predominates. Therefore, he should make his intention good, no matter how much wealth he loses, and say: "It is in the path of God." And if news of others backbiting him reaches him, let him gladden his heart that he will bear their evil deeds and his good deeds will be transferred to his record, and let him intend that by his silence from responding. For in the report: "Verily, the servant will be brought to account, and his deeds will be invalidated due to a flaw entering them, until he becomes deserving of the Fire. Then good deeds will be unfolded for him by which he becomes deserving of Paradise. He will be astonished and say: 'O Lord, these are deeds I never did!' It will be said: 'These are the deeds of those who backbit you, harmed you, and wronged you.'" And in the report: "Verily, the servant will come on the Day of Resurrection with good deeds like mountains; if they were pure for him, he would enter Paradise. But he comes having wronged this one, insulted that one, and struck this one, so his good deeds are taken for this one and that one from his good deeds, until no good deed remains for him. The angels will say: 'His good deeds have perished, and claimants remain.' God Almighty will say: 'Cast upon him from their evil deeds,' then issue a writ for him to the Fire." In summary, beware, then beware, of deeming any of your movements insignificant, so that you do not guard against their deception and evils, nor prepare an answer for them on the Day of Questioning and Reckoning, for God Almighty is All-Seeing of you and Witness. "Not a word does he utter but there is a ready observer beside him."

One of the predecessors said: "I wrote a book and wanted to take some dust from my neighbor's wall. I felt scruples, then I said: 'It is dust, and what is dust?' So I took it. Then a caller called out to me: 'He will know tomorrow, he who took lightly the dust of his neighbor, what he will meet of the evil reckoning.'" A man prayed with al-Thawri and saw that his garment was inside out. He recognized it, extended his hand to fix it, then withdrew it and did not straighten it. He was asked about that, and he said: "I wore it for the sake of God Almighty, and I do not want to straighten it for other than God." Al-Hasan said: "Verily, a man will cling to another on the Day of Resurrection and say: 'Between me and you is God!' He will say: 'By God, I do not know you.' He will say: 'Yes, you took a brick from my wall and took a thread from my garment.'" These and similar reports cut the hearts of the fearful. If you are among those of firm resolve and forbearance and are not among the deluded, then look to yourself now and scrutinize the account of yourself before it is scrutinized for you. Watch over your states, and do not settle nor move unless you first reflect: Why did you move? What do you intend? What do you gain from this world by it? What do you miss from the Hereafter? And by what do you prefer this world over the Hereafter? If you know that the motivator is nothing but religion, then proceed with your resolve and what occurs to you; otherwise, hold back. Then also watch your heart in your holding back and refraining, for abandoning an action is an action, and it necessarily requires a sound intention. The motivator should not be a hidden desire that is not disclosed. Do not be deceived by the outward appearances of matters and the well-known good deeds. Be alert to the depths and secrets, so that you may emerge from the ranks of the deluded.

It is narrated from Zechariah, peace be upon him, that he was working on a wall with clay, and he was a hired worker for some people. They brought him a loaf of

Now we speak of one who is motivated by the intention of drawing near [to God], yet this motive is mingled with another incentive—be it ostentation or some other personal interest. An example is fasting to benefit from the dietary regimen that results from fasting, while also intending nearness to God; or freeing a slave to be relieved of his expenses and bad character; or performing the pilgrimage to improve one’s temperament through the movement of travel, or to escape some harm that befalls him in his homeland, or to flee from an enemy in his household, or because he is weary of his family and children or of a task he is engaged in and wishes to rest from it for some days; or to go on a military expedition in order to practice warfare, learn its methods, and thereby become capable of mobilizing and leading armies; or to pray at night with the aim of warding off sleep from himself so that he may watch over his family or his caravan; or to seek knowledge so that it becomes easier for him to acquire sufficient wealth, or so that he may be honored among his tribe, or so that his property or wealth may be safeguarded by the prestige of knowledge from covetous desires; or to occupy himself with study and preaching in order to be relieved of the distress of silence and to find diversion in the pleasure of speech; or to undertake service to the Sufi masters so that his sanctity may be abundant in their eyes and in the eyes of people; or to attain through it companionship in this world; or to copy a Qur’an so that his handwriting may improve through constant practice of writing; or to perform the pilgrimage on foot to spare himself the fare; or to perform ablution to become clean or to cool himself; or to bathe so that his scent may become pleasant; or to relate hadith to be known for having elevated chains of transmission; or to seclude himself in the mosque to save the rent of a dwelling; or to fast to spare himself the trouble of repeatedly preparing food, or to free himself for his tasks so that eating does not distract him from them; or to give charity to a beggar to cut short his persistence in asking; or to visit a sick person so that he may be visited when he falls ill; or to accompany a funeral so that his own family’s funerals may be accompanied; or to do any of these things to be known for goodness, mentioned for it, and regarded with eyes of piety and dignity.

Whenever his motive is drawing near to God Most High, but there is joined to it a thought from these thoughts such that the act becomes lighter for him because of these matters, then his deed has departed from the boundary of sincerity and has ceased to be purely for the sake of God Most High, and partnership has entered into it. God Most High has said, “I am the most independent of partners from any partnership.” In sum, every worldly interest that the soul finds comfort in and the heart inclines toward, whether little or much, if it enters into an act, it clouds its purity and removes its sincerity. Man is bound to his interests, immersed in his desires; rarely is any of his actions or any act of worship free from immediate interests and aims of these kinds. Therefore it has been said, “Whoever is granted a single moment in his life purely for the sake of God is saved.” That is due to the rarity of sincerity and the difficulty of purifying the heart from these impurities. Indeed, the sincere one is he who has no motive except seeking nearness to God Most High.

If these interests are the sole motive, the severity of the matter for its possessor is not hidden. Our consideration here is when the original intention is drawing near, and these matters are added to it. Then these impurities are either at the level of conformity, or at the level of partnership, or at the level of assistance, as preceded concerning intention. In sum, the personal motive may be equal to the religious motive, or stronger than it, or weaker, and each has a different ruling, as we shall mention.

Sincerity is purifying the deed from all these impurities, little and much, until the intention of drawing near is isolated in it, so that there is no motive besides it. This is inconceivable except from one who loves God, is absorbed in God, and whose concern is wholly absorbed in the Hereafter, such that no place remains in his heart for love of this world—to the extent that he does not even love eating and drinking; rather, his desire for it is like his desire to relieve himself, in that it is a necessity of nature. He does not crave food because it is food, but because it strengthens him for the worship of God Most High, and he wishes that he could be spared the evil of hunger so that he would not need to eat. Thus there remains in his heart no share of superfluity beyond necessity.

The measure of necessity is sought by him because it is a necessity for his religion. He has no concern except God Most High. Such a person, if he eats or drinks or relieves himself, his deed is sincere and his intention sound in all his movements and stillness. If he sleeps, for example, to rest himself so that he may be strengthened for worship afterward, his sleep is worship, and he attains the degree of the sincere in it. Whoever is not like this, the door of sincerity in deeds is closed to him, except rarely.

And just as one who is dominated by love of God and love of the Hereafter, so that his habitual movements acquire the quality of his concern and become sincere, so too one who is dominated by this world, status, and leadership—in sum, by other than God—has caused all his movements to acquire that quality, and his acts of worship—fasting, prayer, and others—are not safe from it except rarely. Therefore, the remedy for sincerity is breaking the interests of the self, cutting off hope in this world, and devoting oneself to the Hereafter such that it dominates the heart. Then sincerity becomes easy.

How many deeds a person toils in, thinking they are purely for the sake of God, while he is deceived in them because he does not see the point of corruption in them! It is related that one of them said, “I completed thirty years of prayer that I had prayed in the mosque in the first row, because one day I was delayed for a reason and prayed in the second row, and I was overcome with shame before the people when they saw me in the second row. Then I knew that the people’s looking at me in the first row had been my joy and the cause of my heart’s comfort, without my being aware.” This is subtle and obscure; deeds are rarely safe from its like, and few are alert to it except whom God Most High grants success. The heedless see all their good deeds as evil deeds in the Hereafter, and they are those intended by His saying, “And there will appear to them from God what they had not taken into account, and there will appear to them the evils of what they earned,” and by His saying, “Say, ‘Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds? [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work.’”

The most exposed of creation to this trial are the scholars, for the motive of most of them in spreading knowledge is the pleasure of mastery, delight in being followed, and rejoicing in praise and commendation. Satan makes this appear to them and says, “Your aim is to spread the religion of God and to defend the law that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, has legislated.” And you see the preacher boasting to God Most High of his advising creation and his admonition to rulers, and rejoicing at the people’s acceptance of his words and their turning to him, while he claims that he rejoices at what pleases him of supporting the religion. If one of his peers appears who is better than him in preaching, and the people turn away from him and turn to that one, it grieves and saddens him. If his motive were religion, he would thank God Most High that God has relieved him of this responsibility through another. Yet Satan does not leave him and says, “Your sadness is only because reward is cut off from you, not because people’s faces have turned from you to another, for if they were admonished by your words, you would be the one rewarded, and your grief at missing reward is praiseworthy.” The poor wretch does not know that his submission to the truth and his entrusting the matter [to another] is better, more abundant in reward, and safer for him in the Hereafter than his being singled out.

I wonder, if ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, had been saddened by Abu Bakr’s, may God be pleased with him, undertaking the leadership, would his sadness have been praiseworthy or blameworthy? No person of religion doubts that if that had occurred, it would have been blameworthy, for his submission to the truth and entrusting the matter to one more suitable than him is more beneficial for him in religion than his undertaking the welfare of creation, along with the immense reward it contains. Indeed, ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, rejoiced at the independence of one more deserving than him of the matter. So why do scholars not rejoice at the like of that?

Some people of knowledge may be deceived by Satan’s deception, so he tells himself that if one more deserving than him of the matter appeared, he would rejoice at

An Exposition of the Degrees of Impurities and Afflictions that Cloud Sincerity

Know that the afflictions that disturb sincerity are some manifest, some hidden, some weak despite being manifest, and some strong despite being hidden. The difference in their degrees of concealment and manifestation can only be understood through an example. The most apparent disturber of sincerity is ostentation (riya'). Let us mention an example of it. We say: Satan introduces an affliction upon the worshipper, no matter how sincere he was in his prayer, then a group looks at him or someone enters upon him, and he says to him, "Your prayer is excellent," so that this present onlooker may look at him with an eye of reverence and piety, and neither despise him nor backbite him. Consequently, his limbs become humble and his extremities become still, and his prayer improves. This is the manifest ostentation, and it is not hidden from the beginners among the seekers.

The second degree: The seeker has understood this affliction and taken caution from it, so he no longer obeys Satan in it nor pays attention to him, and he continues in his prayer as he was. Then Satan comes to him in the guise of goodness and says, "You are followed, emulated, and looked upon. What you do is reported from you, and others follow your example. Thus, you will have the reward of their deeds if you do well, and upon you is the burden if you do wrong. So improve your deed before him, perhaps he will emulate you in humility and improving worship." This is more subtle than the first, and one who is not deceived by the first may be deceived by this. It is also the very essence of ostentation and invalidates sincerity. For if he sees humility and excellence in worship as good, and is not pleased for others to abandon it, then why did he not approve of that for himself in seclusion? It is not possible that the soul of another is more precious to him than his own soul. This is pure deception. Rather, the one who is emulated is he who has become upright in himself and his heart illuminated, so his light spreads to others, and thus he has reward for that. As for this, it is pure hypocrisy and deception. Whoever emulates him is rewarded for it, but he is held accountable for his deception and punished for displaying from himself what he is not truly characterized by.

The third degree: It is more subtle than the preceding. It is that the servant tests himself in that, becomes alert to Satan's guile, and knows that his differing between seclusion and being observed by others is pure ostentation. He knows that sincerity lies in his prayer in seclusion being like his prayer in public. He feels ashamed before himself and before his Lord to show humility due to the observation of His creation, a humility exceeding his usual habit. So he turns to himself in seclusion and improves his prayer in the manner he would approve of in public, and he prays in public likewise. This is also from the subtle ostentation, because he improved his prayer in seclusion so that it would be good in public. Thus, he has not differentiated between them. His attention, in both seclusion and public, is to the creation. Rather, sincerity is that the observation of beasts of his prayer and the observation of creation be on the same level. It is as if this very soul does not permit performing prayer poorly in the presence of people, then he feels ashamed of himself to be in the image of the ostentatious. He thinks that this is removed by making his prayer equal in seclusion and public. Far from it! Its removal is by not paying attention to the creation, just as he does not pay attention to inanimate objects in both seclusion and public. This is from one whose concern is preoccupied with creation in both public and seclusion. This is from the hidden guiles of Satan.

The fourth degree: It is more subtle and hidden. People look at him while he is in prayer, and Satan is unable to say to him, "Be humble for their sake," for he knows that he has become aware of that. So Satan says to him, "Reflect on the majesty of God Almighty and His grandeur, and on who you are standing before Him. Feel ashamed that God should look at your heart while it is heedless of Him." Thereby, his heart becomes present, his limbs humble, and he thinks that this is the very essence of sincerity, while it is the very essence of cunning and deception. For if his humility were due to his gaze upon His grandeur, this thought would accompany him in seclusion and would not be specifically present due to the presence of others.

The sign of safety from this affliction is that this thought be something he is accustomed to in seclusion just as he is accustomed to it in public, and that the presence of others not be the cause for the presence of the thought, just as the presence of a beast is not a cause. As long as he differentiates in his states between the observation of a human and the observation of a beast, he is still outside the purity of sincerity, his inner being sullied by the hidden shirk of ostentation. This shirk is more hidden in the heart of the son of Adam than the crawling of a black ant on a solid rock in a dark night, as has come in the report. None is safe from Satan except one whose insight is refined and who is fortunate with the protection, success, and guidance of God Almighty. Otherwise, Satan accompanies those who assume the character of worshipping God Almighty; he is not heedless of them for a moment until he carries them to ostentation in every movement, even in applying kohl to the eye, trimming the mustache, wearing perfume on Friday, and wearing clothes. For these are practices at specific times, and the soul has in them a hidden share due to the connection of people's gaze to them and the soul's natural inclination towards them. So Satan calls him to do that and says, "This is a practice that should not be abandoned." The heart's inner motivation for it is for the sake of that hidden desire or is mixed with it by a mixture that causes it to depart from the limit of sincerity.

Whoever is not safe from all these afflictions is not sincere. For example, one who secludes himself in a frequented mosque, clean and of good construction, to which the soul is inclined—Satan makes it desirable to him and multiplies for him the virtues of seclusion. The hidden motivator in his secret may be the inclination towards the beauty of the mosque's form and the soul's rest in it. This becomes clear in his inclination towards one of two mosques or one of two places if one is better than the other. All of that is an admixture with the impurities of natural disposition and the turbidities of the soul, and it invalidates the reality of sincerity. By my life, the adulteration that is mixed with pure gold has varying degrees: some predominate, some are little but easily detected, and some are so subtle that only the discerning assayer detects it. The adulteration of the heart, the deceit of Satan, and the wickedness of the soul are more subtle and far finer than that.

Thus it is said: Two rak'ahs from a scholar are better than a year's worship from an ignorant person. What is meant is the scholar with insight into the subtleties of the afflictions of deeds, so that he is purified from them. For the ignorant looks at the outward aspect of worship and is deluded by it, like a color-blind person looking at the redness of a gilded, counterfeit dinar that appears round, while it is adulterated and false in itself. A carat of pure gold that the discerning assayer approves is better than a dinar that the deluded fool approves. Thus the matter of acts of worship varies, indeed more severely and greatly. The avenues of afflictions that enter into the varieties of deeds cannot be enumerated or counted. So let one benefit from what we have mentioned as an example. The intelligent is enriched by a little over much, and the dull is not enriched by elaboration either, so there is no benefit in detailed exposition.

**Clarification of the Ruling on the Mixed Deed and Deserving Reward for It**

Know that if a deed is not purely for the sake of God Almighty but is mixed with an admixture of ostentation or personal interests, people have differed regarding whether that necessitates reward, necessitates punishment, or necessitates nothing at all, so there is neither for him nor against him. As for that which was intended only for ostentation, it is certainly against him and is a cause for wrath and punishment. As for that which is purely for the sake of God Almighty, it is a cause for reward. The consideration is regarding the mixed deed. The apparent reports indicate that there is no reward for it, yet the reports are not free from contradiction in it. What occurs to me regarding it—and knowledge is with God—is to look at the strength of the motivator. If the religious motivator is equal to the personal motivator, they counterbalance and nullify each other, and the deed becomes neither for him nor against him. If the motivator of ostentation is predominant and stronger, it is not beneficial and is moreover harmful and leads to punishment. Yes, the punishment in it is lighter than the punishment for the deed that was purely for ostentation and not mixed with any admixture of seeking nearness. If the intention of seeking nearness is predominant relative to the other motivator, then he has reward according to the amount by which the strength of the religious motivator exceeded. This is due to His saying, exalted is

How many among the eminent Companions performed the prayer and followed funeral processions, yet did not attain this station. These, then, are the degrees and meanings of sincerity, and the transmitted sayings of the masters concerning the reality of sincerity mostly address only individual aspects of these meanings. Indeed, Abu Bakr al-Warraq said: "Sincerity is of three kinds: the sincerity of monotheism, the sincerity of obedience, and the sincerity of gnosis. The sincerity of monotheism is for the generality of believers—Allah, the Exalted, says: 'And those who believe in Allah and His messengers—it is they who are the truthful' (Qur'an 57:19). The sincerity of obedience is for the people of knowledge and piety, and the sincerity of gnosis is for the people of divine friendship, who are the pegs of the earth." All this revolves around what we have mentioned concerning the sixth type of sincerity, but he enumerated the categories in which sincerity is manifested, though his division does not encompass all categories.

Ja'far al-Sadiq said: "Sincerity is striving and that you choose nothing over Allah, just as He did not choose another over you, for He, the Exalted, said: 'He has chosen you' (Qur'an 22:78)." And it is said: "Allah, the Exalted, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: 'When I love a servant, I test him with afflictions that mountains could not bear, to see how sincere he is. If I find him patient, I take him as a friend and beloved. But if I find him impatient, complaining of Me to My creation, I abandon him and care not.'" Therefore, among the signs of sincerity is concealing both calamities and acts of obedience, and disliking that creation become aware of them. Here ends the Book of Sincerity and Purity of Intention. To be followed by the Book of Vigilance and Self-Reckoning. And praise be to Allah.
