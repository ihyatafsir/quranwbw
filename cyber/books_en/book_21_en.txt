In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, before Whose majesty hearts and thoughts are bewildered, incapable of comprehension, and at the dawning radiance of His lights, pupils and gazes are awestruck. He is the One aware of the hidden secrets, the Knower of what is concealed within the consciences, Self-Sufficient in managing His dominion, needing no counselor or assistant. He is the Turner of hearts, the Forgiver of sins, the Coverer of faults, the Reliever of distresses. And blessings be upon the master of the messengers, the unifier of the community of faith, the severer of the root of the atheists, and upon his pure and immaculate family, with abundant salutations.

To proceed: The honor and virtue of man, by which he surpasses the totality of created kinds, lies in his preparedness for knowing God, exalted is He—a knowledge which is, in this world, his beauty, his perfection, and his pride, and in the Hereafter, his provision and his treasure. This preparedness for knowledge is through his heart, not through any limb of his limbs. Thus, the heart is that which knows God, it is that which draws near to God, it is that which acts for God, it is that which strives towards God, and it is that which is disclosed to concerning what is with God and in His presence. The limbs are but followers, servants, and instruments which the heart employs and uses, as a master uses his slave, a shepherd his flock, or a craftsman his tool.

The heart is that which is accepted by God when it is free from all but God, and it is that which is veiled from God when it becomes engrossed in other than God. It is the one held accountable, the one addressed, the one reproached. It is that which attains felicity through proximity to God and succeeds when it is purified, and it is that which fails and is wretched when it is defiled and corrupted. It is, in truth, the obedient one to God, exalted is He, for the lights of worship that spread upon the limbs are from it. And it is the disobedient rebel against God, exalted is He, for the traces of abominations that flow to the limbs are its effects. Through its darkness or its illumination, the merits and demerits of the outward self become manifest, for every vessel exudes what is within it.

It is that which, when a person knows it, he knows himself; and when he knows himself, he knows his Lord. It is that which, when a person is ignorant of it, he is ignorant of himself; and when he is ignorant of himself, he is ignorant of his Lord. Whoever is ignorant of his own heart is more ignorant of anything else, for most of creation are ignorant of their hearts and their own selves. A barrier has been placed between them and their selves, for God places a barrier between a man and his heart. This barrier is by preventing him from witnessing it, observing it, and knowing its attributes and how it is turned between two fingers from among the fingers of the Most Gracious—how it sometimes plunges to the lowest of the low and sinks to the horizon of the devils, and how at other times it ascends to the highest high and rises to the realm of the angels brought near.

Whoever does not know his own heart in order to observe it, guard it, and watch for what appears upon it and within it from the treasuries of the divine kingdom, he is among those of whom God, exalted is He, said: "They forgot God, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient." Therefore, knowledge of the heart and the reality of its attributes is the foundation of the religion and the basis of the path of the wayfarers.

Since we have completed the first part of this book concerning what pertains to the limbs in terms of acts of worship and customary practices—which is the outward knowledge—and we promised to explain in the second part what pertains to the heart in terms of destructive and salvific attributes—which is the inward knowledge—it is necessary to preface it with two books: a book explaining the wondrous attributes and characteristics of the heart, and a book on the method of disciplining the heart and refining its characteristics. Then, thereafter, we will proceed to detail the destructive and salvific attributes.

Let us now mention, by way of analogies to bring it closer to understanding, from the explanation of the wonders of the heart. For to state plainly its wonders and its secrets, which are among the totality of the unseen kingdom, is something that most understandings are too weak to grasp.

**Clarifying the Meaning of the Self (Nafs), the Spirit (Ruh), the Heart (Qalb), and the Intellect (Aql), and What is Intended by These Names**

Know that these four names are used in these chapters, and it is rare among the leading scholars to find one who comprehends these names, their differing meanings, their definitions, and their referents. Most errors originate from ignorance of the meaning of these names and their shared application to different referents. We will explain concerning the meaning of these names what relates to our purpose.

The first term is the term "Heart" (Qalb). It is applied with two meanings. The first is the pinecone-shaped flesh placed in the left side of the chest. It is a specific flesh, within it is a cavity, and within that cavity is black blood which is the source and mine of the spirit. We do not intend now to explain its shape and nature, for that pertains to the aim of physicians and does not pertain to religious aims. This heart exists in animals; indeed, it exists even in the dead. When we use the term "heart" in this book, we do not mean this, for it is a piece of flesh of no inherent worth; it belongs to the realm of the visible, physical world, perceivable by animals through the sense of sight, let alone by humans.

The second meaning is a subtle, divine, spiritual reality...

This subtle essence has a connection with this corporeal heart, and that subtlety is the true reality of man. It is the perceiving, knowing, and aware aspect of man, the one who is addressed, held accountable, admonished, and required. It has a relationship with the corporeal heart, and the intellects of most people are bewildered in comprehending the nature of this relationship. For its attachment to it resembles the attachment of accidents to bodies, or descriptions to the described, or the attachment of a user to his tool, or the attachment of one settled to a place. Elucidating this is something we refrain from for two reasons: first, it pertains to the sciences of unveiling, and our aim in this book is solely the sciences of conduct; second, its verification necessitates disclosing the secret of the spirit, and that is something about which the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not speak, so it is not for anyone else to speak of it. The intended meaning is that when we use the term 'heart' in this book, we mean by it this subtle essence, and our aim is to mention its attributes and states, not to mention its reality in itself. The science of conduct requires knowledge of its attributes and states but does not require mentioning its essential reality.

The second term is the *spirit* (ruh). It is also used in a sense relevant to our purpose in two meanings. The first is a subtle body whose source is the cavity of the corporeal heart, spreading via the pulsating veins to all parts of the body. Its flow within the body and the effusion of the lights of life, sensation, sight, hearing, and smell from it upon its limbs resembles the effusion of light from a lamp moved around the corners of a house, for no part of the house is reached except that it is illuminated by it. Life is like the light occurring on the walls, the spirit is like the lamp, and the flow and movement of the spirit within is like the movement of the lamp around the sides of the house by the one moving it. When physicians use the term 'spirit,' they intend this meaning—a subtle vapor refined by the heart's heat. Its explanation is not our aim, for what pertains to it is the aim of physicians who treat bodies. As for the aim of the physicians of religion, who treat the heart so that it may be drawn near to the Lord of the Worlds, it is not connected to explaining this spirit at all. The second meaning is the subtle, knowing, perceiving essence of man, which we explained as one of the meanings of the heart. It is what God Almighty intended by His saying, "Say, 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord.'" It is a wondrous, divine command, beyond the grasp of most intellects and understandings to comprehend its reality.

The third term is the *self* (nafs). It is also shared between meanings, and two meanings relate to our purpose. The first is that it is intended as the meaning that encompasses the forces of anger and desire in man, as will be explained. This usage is predominant among the people of Sufism, for by 'the self' they mean the root that gathers the blameworthy attributes in man. Thus they say one must struggle against the self and break it. This is alluded to in his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Your most formidable enemy is your self that is between your two sides." The second meaning is the subtle essence we mentioned, which is the true man—it is the self of man and his essence. However, it is described with different attributes according to the variation of its states. When it is tranquil under the Command and disturbance leaves it due to the opposition of desires, it is called the *Self at Peace* (al-nafs al-mutma'innah). God Almighty says regarding its like, "O soul at peace, return to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing." The self in the first meaning cannot be conceived as returning to God Almighty, for it is distanced from God and is from the party of Satan. When its tranquility is not complete, but it has become one that contends with the desiring self and objects to it, it is called the *Self-Reproaching Soul* (al-nafs al-lawwamah) because it reproaches its owner for his shortcoming in the worship of his Master. God Almighty says, "And I swear by the self-reproaching soul." And if it abandons objection and submits and obeys the demands of desires and the incitements of Satan, it is called the *Soul that Enjoins Evil* (al-nafs al-ammarah bi al-su'). God Almighty says, informing about Joseph, peace be upon him, [and the wife of al-'Aziz said], "Nor do I absolve myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil." It may also be said that what is meant by 'the enjoiner of evil' is the self in the first meaning. Thus, the self in the first meaning is utterly blameworthy, and in the second meaning it is praiseworthy, for it is the self of man—that is, his essence and his true reality, which knows God Almighty and all other objects of knowledge.

The fourth term is the *intellect* ('aql). It is also shared between different meanings, which we mentioned in the Book of Knowledge. Among those relevant to our purpose are two meanings. First, it may be used and intended to mean the knowledge of the realities of things, thus being an expression for the attribute of knowledge whose locus is the heart. Second, it may be used and intended to mean the perceiver of knowledges, in which case it is the heart—meaning that subtle essence. We know that every knower has within himself an existence that is an established principle subsisting in itself, and knowledge is an attribute subsisting in it, and the attribute is other than the qualified.

The term "intellect" may be used to refer to the attribute of the knowledgeable one, and it may also be used to refer to the seat of perception—meaning the perceiver itself. This latter meaning is intended in the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him: "The first thing God created was the intellect." For knowledge is an attribute; it is inconceivable for it to be the first created thing. Rather, its seat must have been created either before it or simultaneously with it. Furthermore, discourse cannot be directed towards an attribute. In the report, it is said that God, exalted is He, said to it: "Come forward," and it came forward; then He said: "Turn back," and it turned back—as per the hadith. Thus, it has become clear to you that the referents of these names exist: they are the corporeal heart, the corporeal spirit, the appetitive soul, and the sciences. These are four meanings upon which the four terms are applied. There is a fifth meaning, which is the subtle, knowing, perceiving essence within the human being. The four terms collectively converge upon it. Thus, the meanings are five, and the terms are four, with each term applied to two meanings or more. Most scholars have been confused by the variance and convergence of these terms, so you see them speaking about thoughts and saying, "This is a thought of the intellect," "This is a thought of the spirit," "This is a thought of the heart," and "This is a thought of the soul," while the observer does not know the differing meanings of these names. To lift the veil on this matter, we have prefaced our discussion with an explanation of these terms. Wherever the term "heart" occurs in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, what is intended by it is the meaning within the human being that comprehends and recognizes the reality of things. It may be metaphorically referred to as the heart within the chest because there is a special relationship between that subtle essence and the physical heart. Although it is connected to the entire body and utilizes it, its connection is mediated through the heart; its primary attachment is to the heart, as if the heart were its abode, its kingdom, its realm, and its mount. For this reason, Sahl al-Tustari likened the heart to the Throne and the chest to the Footstool, saying, "The heart is the Throne, and the chest is the Footstool." Do not think that he believed it to be the Throne of God and His Footstool, for that is impossible. Rather, he meant that it is the kingdom of the human being and the primary locus for the management of his affairs and his control, so they are to him as the Throne and the Footstool are to God, exalted is He. This analogy is also only sound from certain aspects, and elaborating on that is not suited to our purpose, so let us pass over it.

**Clarification of the Troops of the Heart**

God, exalted is He, says: "And none knows the hosts of your Lord but He." For God, glorified is He, has in the hearts, spirits, and other realms troops mustered whose true reality and detailed number none knows but He. We now point to some of the troops of the heart, for that is what pertains to our purpose. It has two kinds of troops: a troop seen with the eyes, and a troop seen only with the inner vision. It is in the position of a king, and the troops are in the position of servants and aides. This is the meaning of "troops." As for its troop witnessed by the eye, it is the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear, the tongue, and the rest of the outward and inward limbs, for all of them are servants to the heart and subjugated to it. It is the one that controls them and directs them. They were created naturally disposed to obey it, incapable of opposing it or rebelling against it. If it commands the eye to open, it opens; if it commands the foot to move, it moves; if it commands the tongue to speak and decisively judges for it to do so, it speaks, and likewise for the rest of the limbs. The subjugation of the limbs and senses to the heart resembles, in one respect, the subjugation of the angels to God, exalted is He, for they are created naturally disposed to obedience, incapable of opposing Him. Rather, "they do not disobey God in what He commands them but do as they are commanded." They differ only in one thing: the angels, peace be upon them, are aware of their obedience and compliance, whereas the eyelids obey the heart in opening and closing by way of subjugation, having no awareness in themselves of their obedience to the heart. The heart only needed these troops due to its need for a mount and provision for the journey for which it was created—the journey to God, glorified is He, and traversing the waystations to meet Him. For this purpose, hearts were created. God, exalted is He, says: "I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." Its mount is the body, and its provision is knowledge. The means that bring it to the provision and enable it to take provision from it are righteous deeds. The servant cannot reach God, glorified is He, unless he resides in the body and traverses this world, for the lower waystation must be crossed to reach the furthest waystation. This world is the planting field for the Hereafter and is a waystation among the waystations of guidance. It is called "the lower world" because it is the lower of the two abodes. Thus, the heart was compelled to take provision from this world. The body is its mount by which it reaches this world, so it needed to tend to and preserve the body. The body is only preserved by bringing to it what agrees with it, such as nourishment and the like, and by repelling from it what harms it, the causes of destruction. Therefore, for the purpose of bringing nourishment, it needed two troops: an inward one, which is appetite, and an outward one, which is the hand and the limbs.

To attract nourishment, He created within the heart the appetites it requires, and fashioned the limbs which are the instruments of these appetites. Thus, to ward off destructive things, it became dependent upon two armies: an inner one, which is anger, by which destructive things are repelled and vengeance is taken upon enemies; and an outer one, which are the hand and the leg, by which the dictates of anger are carried out. All of this is through external matters, so the bodily limbs are like weapons and the like. Then, the one in need of nourishment, if he does not know the nourishment, his appetite for it and his familiarity with it will not benefit him. Thus, he became dependent for knowledge upon two armies: an inner one, which is the perception of hearing, sight, smell, touch, and taste; and an outer one, which are the eye, the ear, the nose, and others. Detailing the aspect of need for them and the aspect of wisdom in them would be lengthy, not contained by many volumes. We have alluded to a small portion of this in the Book of Gratitude, so let one be content with that.

In summary, the armies of the heart are encompassed by three kinds: a kind that incites and urges, either to attract beneficial, agreeable things like appetite, or to repel harmful, opposing things like anger. This inciter may be expressed as 'will'. The second is what moves the limbs to achieve these objectives, and this second is expressed as 'capability'. These are armies dispersed throughout all the limbs, especially the muscles, tendons, and the like. The third is what perceives and recognizes things, like spies. These are the powers of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, dispersed in specific limbs. This is expressed as 'knowledge' and 'perception'. With each of these inner armies are outer armies, which are the limbs composed of fat, flesh, nerves, blood, and bone, which have been prepared as instruments for these armies. For the power of grip is only through the fingers, and the power of sight is only through the eye, and likewise for the rest of the powers. We are not speaking here of the outer armies, meaning the limbs, for they belong to the visible, tangible world. Rather, we are speaking now of what has been supported by armies you have not seen.

This third kind from this totality, the perceiver, is divided into what has been settled in the outer abodes, which are the five senses—meaning hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch—and into what has been settled in inner abodes, which are the cavities of the brain. These are also five. For after a person sees a thing, he closes his eye and perceives its form within himself—this is imagination. Then that image remains with him due to something that preserves it—this is the preserving army. Then he reflects upon what he has preserved, combining some of it with others. Then he remembers what he had forgotten and returns to it. Then he gathers the totality of meanings of perceptible things in his imagination through the common sense shared among perceptible things. Thus, inwardly there is common sense, imagination, reflection, recollection, and retention. Were it not for God creating the power of retention, reflection, recollection, and imagination, the brain would be empty of them just as the hand and foot are empty of them. So those powers are also inner armies, and their places are also inner. These are the divisions of the armies of the heart. Explaining this in a way the understanding of the weak can grasp, by giving examples, would be lengthy. The aim of a book like this is for the strong and the masters among the scholars to benefit from it. But we strive to make the weak understand by giving examples, to bring it closer to their comprehension.

**Clarification of Examples of the Heart with its Inner Armies**

Know that the two armies of anger and appetite may submit to the heart in complete submission, thus aiding it on the path it treads, and their companionship on the journey it is undertaking becomes good. Or they may rebel against it with insolent and mutinous rebellion until they master it and lead it astray, and in that lies its destruction and its severance from the journey by which it reaches eternal happiness. The heart has another army, which is knowledge, wisdom, and reflection, as its explanation will come. Its right is to seek aid from this army, for it is the party of God Almighty against the other two armies, for they may join the party of Satan. If one abandons seeking aid and lets the armies of anger and appetite dominate his soul, he is certainly destroyed and suffers a manifest loss. This is the condition of most of creation, for their intellects have become subservient to their appetites in devising stratagems to fulfill appetite, whereas it was incumbent that appetite be subservient to their intellects for what the intellect requires. We shall bring this closer to your understanding with three examples.

The first example is that we say: The likeness of a person's soul in his body—meaning by 'soul' the subtle entity mentioned—is like a king in his city and his kingdom. For the body is the kingdom of the soul, its world, its abode, and its city. Its limbs and powers are like craftsmen and workers. Its rational, reflective power is like the advising counselor and the wise minister. Its appetite is like a wicked servant who brings food and provisions to the city. Its anger and zeal are like the chief of police. The servant who brings the provisions is a lying, deceitful, cunning, wicked one who assumes the guise of a counselor, beneath whose counsel lies immense evil and deadly poison. His habit and custom...

The contention of the sincere minister in his opinions and management, such that he is never free from challenge and opposition for a moment, is like the ruler in his kingdom who, if he is self-sufficient in his management through his minister, consulting him and turning away from the prompting of this vile servant, relying on his minister's counsel that correctness lies in the opposite of the vile servant's view, then the ruler disciplines him through his chief of police, manages him through his minister, and makes the minister his counselor, empowered from his side over this vile servant and his followers and supporters. Thus the servant becomes managed, not a manager; a commanded administrator, not a commanding administrator. Thereby the affairs of his land become upright and justice is established. Similarly, the soul, whenever it seeks aid from the intellect, disciplines itself with the zeal of anger and empowers it over desire, and seeks aid from one over the other at times—by diminishing the rank of anger and its excess through opposing desire and luring it, and at times by suppressing desire and overpowering it by unleashing anger and zeal upon it and vilifying its demands—then its faculties become balanced and its character becomes good. Whoever deviates from this method is like one about whom Allah, the Exalted, said: "Have you seen he who has taken his desire as his god?" and "Allah led him astray despite knowledge," and He said: "And he followed his desire, so his likeness is as the likeness of a dog: if you drive it away, it pants, or if you leave it, it pants." And He, the Mighty and Majestic, said concerning one who forbids the soul from desire: "But as for he who feared the standing before his Lord and forbade the soul from desire, then indeed Paradise is the refuge." The method of striving against these armies and empowering some over others will come, Allah willing, in the Book of Disciplining the Soul.

The second example: Know that the body is like a city, and the intellect—I mean the perceiving faculty of man—is like a wise king governing it. Its perceptive faculties from the outward and inward senses are like his soldiers and aides, and its limbs are like his subjects. The soul that commands evil, which is desire and anger, is like an enemy contending with him in his kingdom and striving to destroy his subjects. Thus his body becomes like a frontier post and his soul like one residing therein as a guardian. If he strives against his enemy, defeats him, and overpowers him as he wishes, his outcome is praiseworthy, and when he returns to the presence, as Allah said: "And those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives—Allah has preferred the strivers with their wealth and their lives over the sedentary by a degree." But if he neglects his frontier and ignores his subjects, his outcome is blameworthy, and vengeance is taken from him before Allah, the Exalted. It will be said to him on the Day of Resurrection: "O evil shepherd, you ate the flesh and drank the milk, but you did not shelter the lost nor mend the broken; today I take vengeance from you," as related in the report. To this striving is the allusion in his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "We have returned from the lesser struggle to the greater struggle."

The third example: The likeness of the intellect is that of a hunting horseman, his desire is like his horse, and his anger is like his dog. Whenever the horseman is skilled, his horse well-trained, and his dog disciplined and taught, he is worthy of success. But whenever he is himself inept, and the horse is unruly and the dog vicious, then his horse does not move under him obediently, nor does his dog comply with his signal willingly. He is then likely to perish, let alone attain what he seeks. The ineptitude of the horseman is like the ignorance of man and his lack of wisdom and dullness of insight. The unruliness of the horse is like the dominance of desire, especially the desire of the stomach and private parts. The viciousness of the dog is like the dominance of anger and its mastery. We ask Allah for good success through His gentleness.

Explanation of the Distinctive Quality of the Human Heart

Know that the totality of what we have mentioned is a bounty Allah has bestowed upon all animals except the human. For the animal possesses desire, anger, and outward and inward senses as well—even the sheep sees the wolf with its eye and knows its enmity with its heart, so it flees from it; that is the inward perception. So let us mention what is specific to the human heart, for which its honor is magnified and it merits closeness to Allah, the Exalted. It pertains to knowledge and will. As for knowledge, it is knowledge of worldly and otherworldly matters and intellectual realities, for these are matters beyond the perceptible, and animals do not share in them. Rather, universal necessary sciences are among the specific properties of the intellect, for man judges that a single individual cannot be conceived to be in two places in one state. This is a judgment from him concerning every individual, and it is known that he has not perceived through the senses except some individuals. Thus his judgment concerning all individuals is beyond what the senses have perceived. If you understand this concerning apparent necessary knowledge, it is even more evident in other theoretical matters. As for the will: when he perceives through the intellect the consequence of a matter and the path of rectitude therein, a longing is stirred from his essence toward the direction of benefit and toward undertaking its means, and the will is for that. This is other than the will of desire and the will of animals; rather, it can be contrary to desire. For desire recoils from bloodletting and cupping, while the intellect wills them, seeks them, and spends wealth on them. Desire inclines toward the pleasures of foods during illness, while the discerning person finds within himself...

A deterrent against it, yet that is not a deterrent against passion. Had God created the intellect that knows the consequences of matters but did not create this motive that moves the limbs in accordance with the intellect’s judgment, the judgment of the intellect would indeed be lost. Thus, the human heart is distinguished by knowledge and will, from which all other animals are free—indeed, even the child in the initial state of innocence is free from it, for that only occurs in him after puberty. As for passion, anger, and the outward and inward senses, they exist in the child. Now, the child in acquiring these sciences has two degrees: the first is that his heart encompasses all the primary necessary sciences, such as knowing the impossibility of impossibilities and the permissibility of apparent permissible matters, so that theoretical sciences are not yet attained, but they have become possible and near to possibility and attainment. His state in relation to the sciences is like that of a scribe who knows nothing of writing except the inkwell, the pen, and the individual letters, not the combined ones; he has approached writing but has not yet reached it. The second is that acquired sciences obtained through experience and reflection become as if stored within him, so that when he wishes, he returns to them. His state is that of one skilled in writing, for he is called a scribe even if he is not actively writing, due to his capability. This is the ultimate degree of humanity, but within this degree are countless ranks due to differences among creation in the abundance or scarcity of knowledge, the nobility or baseness of knowledge, and the manner of its acquisition. For some hearts attain it through divine inspiration by way of initiation and unveiling, while others through learning and acquisition; it may be attained quickly or slowly. At this station, the ranks of scholars, sages, prophets, and saints diverge, and the degrees of ascent therein are boundless, for the knowledge of God, glorified and exalted, is endless. The highest rank is that of the prophet, to whom all or most truths are unveiled without acquisition or effort, through divine disclosure in the shortest time. Through this felicity, the servant draws near to God, exalted is He, with a nearness in meaning, reality, and attribute, not in place or distance. The ascents to these degrees are the stations of those journeying to God, exalted is He, and those stations are beyond enumeration. Each wayfarer knows only the station he has reached in his journey; he knows it and knows what lies behind him, but as for what lies ahead, he does not comprehend its reality with knowledge, though he may believe in it with faith in the unseen, just as we believe in prophethood and the prophet and affirm his existence, yet none knows the reality of prophethood except the prophet. Just as the fetus does not know the state of the child, nor the child the state of the discerning one and the necessary sciences opened to him, nor the discerning one the state of the rational being and the theoretical sciences he has acquired, so too the rational being does not know what God has opened for His saints and prophets of the subtleties of His grace and mercy. What God opens for people of mercy, none can withhold, and this mercy is bestowed by the decree of God’s generosity and bounty, glorified and exalted, not withheld from anyone. Yet it only appears in hearts that expose themselves to the breezes of God’s mercy, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Indeed, your Lord has breezes among the days of your time; so expose yourselves to them.” Exposure to them is by purifying the heart and cleansing it of the filth and turbidity resulting from blameworthy traits, as will be explained. To this generosity alludes his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: “God descends every night to the lowest heaven and says: ‘Is there any supplicant that I may answer him?’” and his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, narrating from his Lord, mighty and majestic: “Long have the righteous yearned for My meeting, and I am more eager for their meeting,” and His saying, exalted is He: “Whoever draws near to Me by a span, I draw near to him by a cubit.” All this indicates that the lights of knowledge have not been veiled from hearts due to stinginess or withholding on the part of the Bestower—exalted is He above stinginess and withholding, supremely exalted—but are veiled due to filth, turbidity, and preoccupation on the part of hearts. For hearts are like vessels: as long as they are filled with water, air cannot enter them. Thus, hearts preoccupied with other than God do not admit knowledge of God, exalted is He. To this alludes his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: “Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would behold the kingdom of the heavens.” From this totality, it becomes clear that the distinctive feature of the human being is knowledge and wisdom, and the noblest type of knowledge is knowledge of God, His attributes, and His acts, for therein lies the perfection of the human being, and in his perfection lies his felicity and suitability for the proximity of the Presence of Majesty and Perfection. The body is a vehicle for the soul, and the soul is the locus of knowledge, and knowledge is the aim of the human being and his distinctive feature for which he was created. Just as the horse shares with the donkey in the strength of bearing loads but is distinguished from it by the special traits of charging and retreating and comely form, so too...

The horse was created for that specific characteristic; if it becomes deficient in it, it descends to the lowly rank of the donkey. Likewise, man shares with the donkey and the horse in certain matters and differs from them in others—those that are his specific characteristic, and that characteristic is among the attributes of the angels brought near to the Lord of the worlds. Man occupies a rank between the beasts and the angels. For man, inasmuch as he nourishes himself and procreates, is like a plant; inasmuch as he senses and moves by choice, he is an animal; and inasmuch as his form and stature, he is like a picture engraved on a wall. His specific characteristic, however, is knowing the realities of things. Whoever employs all his limbs and faculties in the manner of seeking aid through them for knowledge and action has indeed resembled the angels, and is truly worthy of being joined with them and deserves to be called an angelic and lordly being, as God, exalted is He, informed about the women companions of Joseph, peace be upon him, in His saying: "This is not a human being; this is none but a noble angel." But whoever directs his aspiration to pursuing bodily pleasures, eating as the cattle eat, has indeed sunk to the lowly horizon of the beasts, thus becoming either a glutton like an ox, or a voracious one like a swine, or a striker like a dog or a cat, or a grudge-holder like a camel, or an arrogant one like a leopard, or a deceitful one like a fox, or combining all of that like a rebellious devil. There is no limb among the limbs nor sense among the senses except that it is possible to seek aid through it on the path of arrival to God, exalted is He, as a portion of its explanation will come in the Book of Gratitude. So whoever employs it therein has succeeded, and whoever turns away from it has lost and failed. The totality of felicity in that is to make meeting God, exalted is He, his objective, the Abode of the Hereafter his settlement, the world his waystation, the body his mount, and the limbs his servants. Thus he—I mean the perceiving faculty of man—resides in the heart, which is the center of his kingdom like a king. He makes the imaginative faculty deposited in the front of the brain function like a courier-master, for reports of sensed things gather with it. He makes the retentive faculty, whose dwelling is the rear of the brain, function like his treasurer. He makes the tongue function like his interpreter. He makes the moving limbs function like his scribes. He makes the five senses function like his spies, entrusting each one of them with reports from a region among the regions: entrusting the eye with the world of colors, hearing with the world of sounds, smell with the world of scents, and likewise the rest. For they are possessors of reports which they gather from these worlds and deliver to the imaginative faculty, which is like the courier-master. The courier-master delivers them to the treasurer, which is the retentive faculty. The treasurer presents them to the king, and the king selects from them what he needs for managing his kingdom, completing the journey he is undertaking, suppressing the enemy he is afflicted with, and repelling the highway robbers upon his path. If he does that, he is successful, felicitous, grateful for the blessing of God. But if he neglects this totality, or employs it, yet in attending to his enemies—which are passion, anger, and other immediate desires—or in building up his path instead of his abode—since the world is his path upon which he passes, and his homeland and settlement is the Hereafter—then he is forsaken, wretched, ungrateful for the blessing of God, exalted is He, squandering the soldiers of God, exalted is He, aiding the enemies of God, forsaking the party of God. Thus he deserves wrath and banishment in the return and the final destination—we seek refuge in God from that. To the example we have given, Ka'b al-Ahbar alluded when he said: "I entered upon 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, and said: 'Man—his two eyes are a guide, his two ears are funnels, his tongue is an interpreter, his two hands are wings, his two feet are couriers, and the heart within him is a king. If the king is good, his soldiers are good.' She said: 'Thus I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, say.'" And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said in illustrating the hearts: "Verily, God, exalted is He, has in His earth vessels, and they are the hearts. The most beloved of them to God, exalted is He, are the most tender, the purest, and the firmest." Then he explained it, saying: "The firmest in religion, the purest in certainty, and the tenderest towards the brethren." This is an allusion to His saying, exalted is He: "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves," and His saying, exalted is He: "The likeness of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp." Ubayy ibn Ka'b, may God be pleased with him, said its meaning is: "The likeness of the believer's light and his heart." And His saying, exalted is He: "Or like darknesses in a vast deep sea"—the likeness of the hypocrite's heart. And Zayd ibn Aslam said concerning His saying, exalted is He: "In a Preserved Tablet"—and it is the heart of the believer. And Sahl said: "The likeness of the heart and the breast is like the Throne and the Footstool." These are the examples of the heart.

Explanation of the Gatherings of the Heart's Attributes and Its Examples

Know that man, in his creation and composition, has been accompanied by four admixtures; therefore, four types of attributes have gathered upon him: the attributes of predatory beasts, of animals, of devils, and of the Lordly. Thus, inasmuch as anger is given mastery over him, he undertakes the actions of predatory beasts—enmity, hatred, and assaulting people with striking and abuse. And inasmuch as passion is given mastery over him, he undertakes the actions of animals—voraciousness.

Greed and lust, among other traits, are inherently divine matters, as God Almighty says, "Say, the Spirit is from the command of my Lord." Yet, they claim lordship for themselves, desiring domination, supremacy, exclusivity, and autocracy in all affairs, seeking to monopolize leadership, slip from the bonds of servitude and humility, and crave knowledge of all sciences—indeed, they claim for themselves knowledge, awareness, and comprehension of the realities of things. They rejoice when attributed with knowledge and grieve when ascribed ignorance. Comprehending all truths and dominating all creation by force are attributes of divinity, and in humans, there is an avidity for this. Since humans are distinguished from beasts by discernment, while sharing with them in anger and desire, a satanic quality arises within them, making them wicked, employing discernment to devise forms of evil and achieving aims through cunning, stratagem, and deceit, presenting evil in the guise of good—these are the traits of devils. Every human contains a mixture of these four foundations: the divine, the satanic, the predatory, and the bestial, all gathered in the heart, as if assembled within the human skin are a pig, a dog, a devil, and a sage. The pig represents lust, for the pig is not condemned for its color, form, or shape, but for its greed, avidity, and covetousness. The dog represents anger, for the ravenous beast and the biting dog are not such by virtue of appearance, color, or form, but by the spirit of predation—ferocity, aggression, and biting. Within humans lies the ferocity of the beast and its wrath, and the greed and lust of the pig. The pig summons through gluttony to indecency and abomination; the beast through anger to injustice and harm. The devil constantly incites the pig's lust and the beast's fury, enticing one with the other, making pleasing to them what they are naturally inclined toward. The sage, who is the exemplar of intellect, is commanded to repel the devil's guile and deception by unveiling its illusions with penetrating insight and shining, clear light, and to break the pig's evil by setting the dog upon it, for through anger, the surge of lust is broken, and to curb the dog's ferocity by setting the pig upon it, keeping the dog subdued under its governance. If one does this and prevails, matters become balanced, justice appears in the kingdom of the body, and all proceeds on the straight path. But if one fails to subdue them and they subdue and employ him, he will constantly devise schemes and ponder deeply to satiate the pig and satisfy the dog, thus perpetually in servitude to a dog and a pig—this is the condition of most people, whose primary concerns are the belly, the private parts, and rivalry with enemies. It is astonishing that they denounce idol-worshippers for worshipping stones; if the veil were lifted from them and the truth of their state revealed, as is shown to those granted insight in sleep or wakefulness, they would see themselves standing before a pig, prostrating to it at times, bowing at others, awaiting its signal and command. Whenever the pig stirs in pursuit of some desire, they immediately rush to serve it and procure its lust. Or they would see themselves standing before a biting dog, worshipping it, obedient, heeding what it demands and seeks, meticulously devising means to obey it—thereby striving to please their devil, for it is he who incites the pig and provokes the dog, rousing them to employ him. Thus, from this perspective, he worships the devil by worshipping them. Let every servant observe his movements, stillness, silence, speech, standing, and sitting, and look with the eye of insight—he will see, if he is fair to himself, that he spends his entire day striving in worship of these. This is the height of injustice, making the master a slave, the lord a vassal, the sovereign a servant, and the dominator dominated, for the intellect is deserving of sovereignty, domination, and control, yet he has subjugated it to serve these three. No wonder that from obedience to these three, qualities spread to his heart, accumulating until they become a seal and rust, destroying and deadening the heart. Obedience to the pig of lust produces qualities such as impudence, malice, extravagance, stinginess, hypocrisy, shamelessness, frivolity, folly, greed, avarice, flattery, envy, rancor, gloating, and others. Obedience to the dog of anger spreads to the heart qualities like recklessness, baseness, arrogance, haughtiness, rage, pride, vanity, mockery, contempt, belittling others, desiring evil, craving injustice, and others. Obedience to the devil through obeying lust and anger yields qualities such as cunning, deceit, stratagem, shrewdness, audacity, deception, instigation, fraud, wickedness, obscenity, and the like. If the matter were reversed and all were subdued under the governance of the divine quality, the heart would find tranquility.

Among the divine attributes are knowledge, wisdom, certainty, encompassing the realities of things, and knowing matters as they truly are; mastery over all through the power of knowledge and insight; and deserving precedence over creation due to the perfection and majesty of knowledge, and due to independence from the worship of desire and anger. From restraining the swine of desire and returning it to the limit of moderation, noble qualities emerge, such as chastity, contentment, tranquility, asceticism, scrupulousness, piety, cheerfulness, good demeanor, modesty, gracefulness, and helpfulness, and the like. And from restraining the force of anger, subduing it, and returning it to the required limit, the quality of courage emerges, along with generosity, gallantry, self-restraint, patience, forbearance, endurance, forgiveness, steadfastness, nobility, magnanimity, dignity, and others. The heart, in its nature, is like a mirror that has been surrounded by these influencing matters, and these effects continuously reach the heart. As for the praiseworthy effects we have mentioned, they increase the mirror of the heart in clarity, radiance, light, and illumination, until the clarity of truth gleams within it and the reality of the matter sought in religion is unveiled within it. It is to such a heart that the allusion is made in his saying, peace be upon him: "When Allah intends good for a servant, He places for him an admonisher from his heart," and in his saying, peace be upon him: "Whoever has an admonisher from his heart, has from Allah a protector." This is the heart in which remembrance finds stability. Allah the Exalted said: "Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured." As for the blameworthy effects, they are like dark smoke rising to the mirror of the heart, accumulating upon it time after time until it blackens and darkens and becomes entirely veiled from Allah the Exalted. This is the sealing, the stain. Allah the Exalted said: "No! Rather, what they have earned has stained their hearts." And He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: "If We willed, We could strike them for their sins and seal over their hearts, and they would not hear." He linked the lack of hearing to the sealing due to sins, just as He linked hearing to piety, saying: "And fear Allah and listen," and "And fear Allah, and Allah teaches you." Whenever sins accumulate, the hearts are sealed, and at that point the heart becomes blind to perceiving truth and the rectitude of religion, belittles the matter of the Hereafter, magnifies the matter of the world, and becomes confined in its concern to it. So when something concerning the Hereafter and its perils strikes its hearing, it enters one ear and exits the other, does not settle in the heart, and does not move it to repentance and rectification. Those are the ones who despair of the Hereafter, as the disbelievers despair of the companions of the graves. This is the meaning of the heart blackening with sins, as stated by the Quran and the Sunnah. Maymun ibn Mihran said: "When a servant commits a sin, a black spot is marked on his heart. If he desists and repents, it is polished away. But if he returns, it is increased in it until it covers his heart. That is the stain." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The heart of the believer is bare, within it is a shining lamp; and the heart of the disbeliever is black, inverted." Obedience to Allah, glorified be He, by opposing desires, polishes the heart, and His disobediences blacken it. So whoever inclines toward disobediences, his heart blackens. And whoever follows a bad deed with a good one and erases its trace, his heart does not darken, but its light diminishes, like a mirror upon which one breathes, then it is wiped, then one breathes again, then it is wiped again; it is not free from some cloudiness." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Hearts are of four kinds: a bare heart with a shining lamp within it—that is the heart of the believer; a black, inverted heart—that is the heart of the disbeliever; a heart that is covered, bound upon its covering—that is the heart of the hypocrite; and a heart that is layered, containing faith and hypocrisy. The likeness of faith within it is like a plant nourished by pure water, and the likeness of hypocrisy within it is like an ulcer nourished by pus and discharge. Whichever of the two nourishments overcomes it, he is judged by it." In another narration: "it prevails over him." Allah the Exalted said: "Indeed, those who fear Allah—when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight." He informed that the clarity of the heart and its insight are attained through remembrance, and that none are firmly established in it except those who fear Allah. Thus, piety is the gate to remembrance, remembrance is the gate to unveiling, and unveiling is the gate to the greatest success, which is success in meeting Allah the Exalted.

**Explanation of the Similitude of the Heart in Relation to Knowledge Specifically**

Know that the seat of knowledge is the heart—I mean the subtle essence that governs all the limbs, which is obeyed and served by all the organs. In relation to the realities of known things, it is like a mirror in relation to the images of colored objects. Just as a colored object has an image, and a likeness of that image is imprinted in the mirror and comes to exist within it, so too does every known thing have a reality, and that reality has an image that is imprinted in the mirror of the heart and becomes clear within it. And just as the mirror is one thing, the images of the persons are another, and the occurrence of their likeness in the mirror is yet another—these are three matters—so too here are three matters: the heart, the realities of things, and the occurrence of the very realities within the heart.

The heart and its presence within it, so the knower is an expression for the heart in which the form of the realities of things resides. The known is an expression for the realities of things themselves, and knowledge is an expression for the acquisition of that form in the mirror. Just as, for example, grasping necessitates a grasper like the hand, a grasped object like the sword, and a connection between the sword and the hand by the sword coming to be in the hand, and this is called grasping, similarly, the arrival of the form of the known to the heart is called knowledge. The reality existed and the heart existed, yet knowledge was not acquired because knowledge is an expression for the reality reaching the heart, just as the sword existed and the hand existed, yet the name 'grasping' and 'taking' were not realized due to the sword not falling into the hand. Indeed, grasping is an expression for the sword itself coming to be in the hand, but the known itself does not come to be in the heart. For one who knows fire, the essence of fire does not come to be in his heart; rather, what is acquired is its definition and its reality corresponding to its image. Thus, its analogy with a mirror is more fitting, for the essence of a person does not come to be in the mirror; rather, what comes to be is a corresponding form. Likewise, the acquisition of a form corresponding to the reality of the known in the heart is called knowledge.

And just as the image does not become manifest in a mirror for five reasons: first, a deficiency in its form, like the substance of iron before it is turned, shaped, and polished; second, for its tarnish, rust, and dirt, even if its shape is perfect; third, for it being turned away from the direction of the image to another, as when the image is behind the mirror; fourth, for a veil sent between the mirror and the image; and fifth, for ignorance of the direction in which the desired image lies, such that it becomes impossible thereby to align the mirror with the aspect and orientation of the image—so too is the heart a mirror prepared for the truth of the Real to become manifest in it regarding all matters. The hearts are devoid of the sciences they lack only due to these five reasons.

The first is a deficiency in its essence, like the heart of a child, for knowledge does not become manifest to him due to his deficiency. The second is for the tarnish of sins and the foulness that accumulates on the surface of the heart from the abundance of desires, for that prevents the clarity and polish of the heart, so the manifestation of truth within it is impeded due to its darkness and accumulation. To this is the allusion in his saying, peace be upon him: "Whoever commits a sin, intellect departs from him and never returns to him," meaning that a tarnish occurs in his heart whose effect does not vanish, for at best he follows it with a good deed by which he erases it. Had he come with the good deed without the evil deed preceding it, the illumination of the heart would have undoubtedly increased. But when the evil deed preceded, the benefit of the good deed was lost; rather, the heart returned by it to what it was before the evil deed and did not gain increased light by it. This is a clear loss and an irremediable deficiency. For a mirror that becomes soiled and then is wiped with a polishing cloth is not like one that is wiped with a polishing cloth to increase its polish without prior soiling. Turning to obedience to God and turning away from the demands of desires is what polishes and clarifies the heart. Therefore, God Almighty said: "And those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our paths." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever acts upon what he knows, God will bequeath to him knowledge of what he did not know."

The third is that it is turned away from the direction of the desired reality. For the heart of the obedient, righteous person, even if it is clear, the clarity of truth does not become apparent in it because he is not seeking the truth and is not aligning his mirror with the aspect of the sought. Rather, perhaps his concern is preoccupied with detailing bodily acts of worship or preparing the means of livelihood, and he does not direct his thought to contemplation in the presence of divine lordship and the hidden divine realities. Thus, nothing is unveiled to him except what he is reflecting upon, be it the subtleties of the defects of deeds and the hidden faults of the self if he is reflecting upon them, or the affairs of livelihood if he is reflecting upon them. If restricting concern to deeds and detailing acts of worship prevents the unveiling of the clarity of truth, then what do you suppose of one who directs his concern to worldly desires, their pleasures, and their attachments? How could it not prevent true unveiling?

The fourth is the veil. For the obedient one who subdues his desires, with thought devoted to a reality among realities, that may not be unveiled to him because he is veiled from it by a belief that came to him since childhood by way of blind following and acceptance due to good opinion, for that stands between him and the truth of the Real and prevents from being unveiled in his heart anything contrary to what he imbibed from the outward aspect of blind following. This too is a great veil by which most theologians and those fanatical for schools of thought are veiled, indeed most of the righteous who reflect upon the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, for they are veiled by imitative beliefs that have congealed in their souls, taken root in their hearts, and become a veil between them and the apprehension of realities.

The fifth is ignorance of the direction from which the sought is encountered. For the seeker of knowledge cannot acquire knowledge of the unknown except by recalling the sciences that correspond to his objective, until...

When one reflects upon them and arranges them in his soul in a specific order known to the scholars through methods of consideration, then at that point he has stumbled upon the manner of what is sought, and the reality of the sought object becomes unveiled to his heart. For the desired sciences that are not innate cannot be captured except with the net of acquired sciences. Indeed, every science is only attained from two preceding sciences that combine and couple in a specific manner, and from their coupling a third science is produced, analogous to how offspring is produced from the coupling of a male and a female. Then, just as one who wishes to breed a mule cannot do so from a donkey and a camel and a man, but rather from a specific stock—the male and female horse—and that is when a specific coupling occurs between them, so too every science has two specific origins, and between them is a way of coupling from which the desired, acquired science is produced. Ignorance of those origins and of the manner of coupling is what prevents knowledge. Its example is what we mentioned regarding ignorance of the aspect in which the image lies. Or its example is that a person wishes to see the back of his head, for instance, with a mirror. If he raises the mirror opposite his face, he has not aligned it with the direction of the back of the head, so the back of the head does not appear in it. And if he raises it behind the back of the head and aligns it, he has turned the mirror away from his eye, so he does not see the mirror nor the image of the back of the head within it. He thus needs another mirror, which he places behind the back of the head, and this one is positioned opposite it such that he can see it, and he must observe a suitable arrangement between the positions of the two mirrors until the image of the back of the head is imprinted on the mirror aligned with the back of the head, then the image of this mirror is imprinted on the other mirror which is opposite the eye, then the eye perceives the image of the back of the head. Likewise, in capturing the sciences there are wondrous ways involving deviations and distortions; the most wondrous of what we mentioned concerning the mirror is such that it is difficult for anyone on the face of the earth to be guided to the method of ingenuity in those deviations. These, then, are the causes that prevent hearts from knowing the realities of matters. Otherwise, every heart is by nature fit to know realities, for it is a noble, divine matter distinguished from all other substances of the world by this characteristic and nobility. To this is the allusion in His Exalted Word: "Indeed, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and feared it; but man undertook it"—an allusion that he has a characteristic by which he is distinguished from the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, and by which he became capable of bearing the Trust of God Almighty. And that Trust is knowledge and divine unity. The heart of every human is originally prepared to bear the Trust and capable of it, but what holds it back from shouldering its burdens and attaining its realization are the causes we have mentioned. For that reason, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Every child is born upon the natural disposition; it is his parents who make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Zoroastrian." And the saying of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze upon the kingdom of the heavens"—an allusion to some of these causes which are the veil between hearts and the Unseen Realm. To this is the allusion in what is narrated from Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, who said: It was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "O Messenger of God, where is God? On the earth or in the heavens?" He said: "In the hearts of His believing servants." And in the report: God Almighty said: "Neither My earth nor My heaven contains Me, but the heart of My gentle, humble believing servant contains Me." And in the report it was said: "O Messenger of God, who are the best of people?" He said: "Every believer with a sound heart." It was said: "And what is a sound heart?" He said: "It is the pious, pure heart in which there is no deceit, no oppression, no treachery, no rancor, and no envy." For that reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "My heart saw my Lord," for the veil had been lifted through piety. And for whom the veil between him and God is lifted, the image of the Sovereign and the Unseen Realm is unveiled in his heart, so he sees a Paradise the breadth of which is as the heavens and the earth. As for its entirety, it is vaster than the heavens and the earth, for the heavens and the earth are an expression of the world of Sovereignty and the Visible, and although it is vast in expanse and far-reaching in boundaries, it is finite in sum. As for the world of the Unseen Realm, which are the hidden mysteries concealed from the sight of eyes, specific to the perception of inner vision, it has no end. Indeed, what is revealed to the heart of it is a finite measure, but in itself and in relation to the knowledge of God it has no end. The totality of the world of Sovereignty and the Unseen Realm, when taken all at once, is called the Divine Presence, for the Divine Presence encompasses all existent things, since there is nothing in existence except God Almighty and His acts, His kingdom, and His servants from among His acts. What is unveiled of that to the heart is Paradise itself according to some, and it is the cause of deserving Paradise according to the people of truth. And the expanse of his dominion in Paradise will be according to the expanse of his knowledge and in proportion to what has been unveiled to him of God, His attributes, and His acts.

The purpose of all acts of obedience and physical deeds is the purification, refinement, and cleansing of the heart. "He has succeeded who purifies it." The purpose of its refinement is the attainment of the lights of faith within it—I mean the illumination of the light of divine knowledge. This is what is intended by the words of the Almighty: "So whoever Allah wants to guide, He expands his breast to Islam. Is he whose breast Allah has expanded to Islam, so he is upon a light from his Lord?" Yes, this divine manifestation and this faith have three levels.

The first level is the faith of the common people, which is faith based purely on imitation. The second is the faith of the theologians, which is mixed with a kind of reasoning, and its degree is close to that of the common people's faith. The third is the faith of the Gnostics, which is witnessed by the light of certainty. We shall explain these levels to you with an example: your belief that Zayd, for instance, is in the house has three degrees.

The first is that someone you have found to be truthful, and whom you do not know to lie nor suspect in speech, informs you of it. Your heart finds rest and tranquility in his report merely upon hearing it. This is faith based purely on imitation, like the faith of the common people. For when they reached the age of discernment, they heard from their fathers and mothers about the existence of God Almighty, His knowledge, will, power, and all His attributes, the sending of the messengers, their truthfulness, and what they brought. As they heard it, they accepted it, remained steadfast upon it, and found tranquility in it. It did not occur to their minds to oppose what was told to them due to their good opinion of their fathers, mothers, and teachers. This faith is the cause of salvation in the Hereafter, and its people are among the foremost ranks of the Companions of the Right. However, they are not among those brought near, for there is in it no unveiling, insight, or expansion of the breast by the light of certainty, since error is possible in what is heard from individuals—indeed, from multitudes—in matters pertaining to beliefs. The hearts of the Jews and Christians are also tranquil with what they hear from their fathers and mothers, except that they believed what they believed in error, for falsehood was cast to them, while the Muslims believed the truth not because they had insight into it, but because the word of truth was cast to them.

The second rank is that you hear Zayd's speech and voice from inside the house, but from behind a wall. You thereby infer his presence in the house. Your faith, belief, and certainty of his being in the house becomes stronger than your belief based on mere hearing. For if you were told he is in the house and then you heard his voice, your certainty would increase because voices indicate form and image to one who hears the voice while witnessing the image, so his heart judges that this is the voice of that person. This is faith mixed with evidence. Error is also possible to intrude here, for a voice may resemble a voice, and imitation through artifice is possible. However, that may not occur to the listener's mind because he gives no place to suspicion and perceives no purpose in this deception and imitation.

The third rank is that you enter the house and look at him with your own eye and witness him. This is true knowledge and certain witnessing. It resembles the knowledge of those brought near and the truthful, for they believe through witnessing. Enfolded within their faith is the faith of the common people and the theologians, and they are distinguished by a clear merit which makes the possibility of error impossible. Indeed, they also vary in the measures of their knowledge and the degrees of their unveiling.

As for the degrees of unveiling, an example is that one sees Zayd in the house from nearby, in the courtyard of the house, at the time of the sun's rising, so his perception is complete. Another perceives him in a room, or from a distance, or at twilight, so his form appears to him in a way that makes him certain it is him, but the subtleties and hidden aspects of his form do not fully manifest to him. Such a thing is conceivable in the variation of witnessing divine matters.

As for the measures of knowledge, it is that one sees in the house Zayd, 'Amr, Bakr, and others, while another sees only Zayd. Knowledge of that undoubtedly increases with the abundance of what is known. This is the state of the heart in relation to the sciences. And God Almighty knows best what is correct.

Explanation of the State of the Heart in Relation to the Categories of Intellectual, Religious, Worldly, and Otherworldly Sciences

Know that the heart, by its innate disposition, is prepared to accept the realities of knowledge, as previously mentioned. However, the sciences that reside within it are divided into intellectual and revealed. The intellectual are divided into necessary and acquired, and the acquired into worldly and otherworldly.

By "intellectual," we mean that which is dictated by the innate disposition of the intellect and is not attained through imitation or hearing. It is divided into necessary sciences, whose origin and manner of attainment one does not know—such as a person's knowledge that one individual cannot be in two places, or that one thing cannot be simultaneously originated and eternal, existent and non-existent. For these are sciences that a person finds himself inherently endowed with since childhood, and he does not know when this knowledge came to him nor from where it came—meaning he does not...

He knows a proximate cause for it, otherwise it is not hidden from him that God is the One who created him and guided him. And to acquired sciences, which are gained through learning and inference, and both types may be called 'aql (intellect). 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "I saw the intellect as two intellects: one innate and one heard. And the heard one is of no benefit if it is not innate, just as the sun is of no benefit when the eye's light is prevented." The first is intended by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, to 'Ali: "God has not created a creature more honorable to Him than the intellect." The second is intended by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, to 'Ali, may God be pleased with him: "When people draw near to God Almighty with various acts of piety, you draw near with your intellect." For drawing near is not possible through innate instinct nor through necessary sciences, but rather through acquired ones. However, the like of 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, is he who is capable of drawing near by employing the intellect in capturing the sciences through which nearness to the Lord of the worlds is attained. The heart runs the course of the eye, and the instinct of intellect within it runs the course of the power of sight in the eye. And the power of sight is a subtle faculty lost in blindness and present in sight, even if one closes his eyes or night befalls him. The knowledge obtained from it in the heart runs the course of the power of visual perception in the eye and its seeing the essences of things. The delay of sciences from the eye of the intellect during the period of childhood until the time of discernment or puberty resembles the delay of vision from sight until the time of the sun's shining and its light flooding upon visible things. And the pen with which God inscribed the sciences upon the pages of hearts runs the course of the disc of the sun. Knowledge does not occur in the heart of a child before discernment only because the tablet of his heart has not yet prepared to receive the essence of knowledge. The pen is an expression for a creation from the creations of God Almighty, which He made a cause for the inscription of sciences in the hearts of humans. God Almighty said: "Who taught by the pen, taught man what he knew not." And the pen of God Almighty does not resemble the pen of His creation, just as His description does not resemble the description of His creation. His pen is not of reed nor wood, just as He, exalted, is not of substance nor accident. The analogy between the inner insight and the outer sight is valid from these aspects, except that there is no comparison between them in nobility. For the inner insight is the eye of the soul, which is the subtle perceiving essence, and it is like the rider, and the body is like the horse. The blindness of the rider is more harmful to the rider than the blindness of the horse; indeed, there is no proportion between the two harms. And due to the analogy of the inner insight to the outer sight, God Almighty named it with its name, saying: "The heart did not lie about what it saw." He called the perception of the heart 'seeing.' Likewise His saying: "And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth." He did not intend by it the apparent sight, for that is not specific to Abraham, peace be upon him, so as to be presented in the context of favor. Therefore, He named the opposite of its perception 'blindness,' saying: "For indeed, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts within the breasts that grow blind." And He said: "And whoever is blind in this [world] will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray in way." This is the explanation of intellectual sciences. As for religious sciences, they are taken by way of emulation from the prophets, prayers and peace of God be upon them. That is attained by learning the Book of God Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, and understanding their meanings after hearing. Through this is the perfection of the heart's attribute and its soundness from ailments and diseases. Intellectual sciences are insufficient for the soundness of the heart, even though it needs them, just as intellect is insufficient for maintaining the health of the body's means; rather, it needs knowledge of the properties of medicines and drugs by way of learning from physicians, for mere intellect does not guide to it. But it cannot be understood after hearing it except through intellect. Thus, intellect is indispensable without hearing, and hearing is indispensable without intellect. So the caller to pure emulation while completely isolating intellect is ignorant, and he who is content with mere intellect apart from the lights of the Qur'an and Sunnah is deluded. Beware of being from either group, and be one who combines the two foundations. For intellectual sciences are like nourishment, and religious sciences are like medicines. A sick person is harmed by nourishment whenever he misses the medicine. Likewise, the diseases of hearts have no remedy except through medicines derived from the Sacred Law, which are the duties of worship and works that the prophets, prayers of God be upon them, composed for the rectification of hearts. So whoever does not treat his sick heart with the treatments of prescribed worship and is content with intellectual sciences is harmed by them, just as a sick person is harmed by nourishment. He who thinks that intellectual sciences contradict religious sciences and that combining them is impossible, that thought arises from blindness in the eye of insight—we seek refuge in God from it. Rather, this speaker may find some sciences contradictory within himself.

When the legal rulings for some matters become difficult for a person to reconcile, he may imagine a contradiction in religion, leading him to confusion, and he thus slips out of religion as a hair slips out of dough. This is only because his own incapacity has made him imagine a flaw in religion—far be it! His likeness is that of a blind man who entered a people’s house and stumbled over the vessels of the house. He said to them, “Why are these vessels left on the path? Why are they not returned to their places?” They said to him, “Those vessels are in their places; it is you who, due to your blindness, do not find the way. The wonder is that you do not attribute your stumbling to your blindness, but rather attribute it to the negligence of others.” This is the relation of the religious sciences to the rational sciences.

The rational sciences are divided into worldly and otherworldly. The worldly are like the sciences of medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all crafts and industries. The otherworldly are like the knowledge of the states of the heart, the defects of deeds, and the knowledge of God Most High, His attributes, and His actions, as we have detailed in the Book of Knowledge. These are two conflicting sciences; I mean that whoever directs his attention to one of them until he becomes deeply engrossed in it will, for the most part, have his insight fall short regarding the other. For this reason, ‘Ali—may God be pleased with him—gave three parables for this world and the Hereafter. He said they are like the two pans of a scale, like the east and the west, and like two co-wives: if you please one, you anger the other. Therefore, you see the intelligent in worldly matters and in the sciences of medicine, arithmetic, geometry, and philosophy to be ignorant in matters of the Hereafter, and the intelligent in the subtleties of the sciences of the Hereafter to be ignorant in most of the worldly sciences, because the power of the intellect is generally insufficient for both matters together, so one becomes a hindrance to perfection in the other. For this reason, the Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—said, “Most of the people of Paradise are the simple-minded,” meaning simple-minded in worldly matters. And al-Hasan said in some of his sermons, “We have encountered people whom, if you saw them, you would say they are madmen, and if they saw you, they would say you are devils.” So whenever you hear something strange from the matters of religion that the intelligent in other sciences deny, do not let their denial deceive you into rejecting it, for it is impossible for one traveling the path of the east to find what exists in the west. Thus runs the affair of this world and the Hereafter. For this reason, God Most High said, “Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein…” [Qur’an 10:7] and He said, “They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.” [Qur’an 30:7] And He, the Almighty, said, “So turn away from whoever turns away from Our remembrance and desires not except the worldly life. That is their sum of knowledge.” [Qur’an 53:29-30] Thus, combining perfect insight into the benefits of this world and religion scarcely becomes easy except for those whom God has firmly established to manage His servants in their livelihood and their ultimate return, and they are the prophets, supported by the Spirit of Holiness, drawing from the divine power that expands to encompass all matters and does not constrict from them. As for the hearts of the rest of creation, when they become preoccupied with the affair of this world, they turn away from the Hereafter and fall short of attaining perfection in it.

**Clarifying the Difference Between Inspiration and Learning, and the Difference Between the Way of the Sufis in Discerning Truth and the Way of the Speculative Thinkers**

Know that the sciences which are not necessary but are acquired in the heart under certain conditions differ in the manner of their acquisition. Sometimes they assault the heart as if cast into it from where one does not know, and sometimes they are acquired through the path of reasoning and learning. That which is acquired not through acquisition and the device of proof is called inspiration, and that which is acquired through reasoning is called consideration and insight. Then, that which occurs in the heart without any device, learning, or striving from the servant is divided into that which the servant does not know how it came to him or from where it came, and into that which he becomes aware of the cause from which he obtained that knowledge, which is the witnessing of the angel cast into the heart. The first is called inspiration and a whispering into the heart, and the second is called revelation, specific to the prophets. The first is specific to the saints and the purified, and that which precedes it—which is acquired through the path of reasoning—is specific to the scholars. The truth of the matter concerning it is that the heart is inherently prepared for the reality of truth in all things to be unveiled within it, but it is only veiled from it by the five causes previously mentioned. They are like a curtain drawn as a barrier between the mirror of the heart and the Preserved Tablet, which is inscribed with all that God has decreed until the Day of Resurrection. The unveiling of the realities of the sciences from the mirror of the Tablet onto the mirror of the heart resembles the imprint of an image from one mirror onto another mirror facing it. The curtain between the two mirrors is sometimes removed by hand, and at other times it is removed by the blowing of winds that move it. Likewise, the winds of divine graces may blow, and the veils are lifted from the eyes of the hearts, so there is unveiled within them some of what is inscribed on the Preserved Tablet. This sometimes occurs during sleep, so one thereby knows what will be in the future, and the complete lifting...

The veil is lifted through death, whereby the covering is removed. It is also lifted during wakefulness, until the barrier is raised by a subtle grace from God, Exalted is He. Then there gleams in the hearts, from behind the curtain of the unseen, something of the marvels of knowledge—at times like a fleeting flash of lightning, and at others in succession to a certain degree, though its permanence is exceedingly rare. Inspiration does not differ from acquired knowledge in the essence of the knowledge itself, nor in its place, nor in its cause; rather, it differs in the removal of the veil, for that is not by the servant's choice. Nor does revelation differ from inspiration in any of that, but in the witnessing of the angel who conveys the knowledge. For knowledge only reaches our hearts through the mediation of angels, alluded to in His saying, Exalted is He: "It is not for any human that God should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil, or that He sends a messenger who reveals by His permission what He wills." When you understand this, know that the inclination of the people of Sufism is toward inspired sciences rather than instructional ones. Therefore, they do not strive to study knowledge, acquire what authors have compiled, or investigate the mentioned opinions and proofs. Instead, they say: "The path is to prioritize spiritual struggle, erase blameworthy traits, sever all attachments, and turn with the core of one's aspiration toward God, Exalted is He. Whenever that is achieved, God becomes the Guardian of His servant's heart, undertaking to illuminate it with the lights of knowledge." When God takes charge of the heart, mercy overflows upon it, light shines in the heart, the breast expands, the secret of the dominion is unveiled to it, and the veil of heedlessness is lifted from the heart's face by the subtlety of mercy. Then the realities of divine matters gleam within it. Nothing remains for the servant but preparation through pure purification, bringing forth aspiration with sincere intention, complete thirst, and constant watchful waiting for what God, Exalted is He, opens of mercy. For the prophets and the saints, the matter was unveiled and light overflowed upon their breasts—not through learning, study, or writing books, but through renouncing the world, disengaging from its attachments, emptying the heart of its distractions, and turning with the core of aspiration toward God, Exalted is He. Thus, whoever is for God, God is for him. They assert that the path to this is, first, by completely cutting off worldly attachments, emptying the heart of them, and diverting aspiration from family, wealth, children, homeland, and even from knowledge, authority, and status—until the heart reaches a state where the existence or non-existence of everything becomes equal. Then one secludes oneself in a corner, contenting oneself with obligatory and regular prayers, sitting with an empty heart and gathered aspiration, not dispersing thought by reciting the Qur'an, pondering interpretation, reading books of hadith, or anything else. Rather, one strives that nothing crosses the mind except God, Exalted is He. After sitting in seclusion, one continually says with the tongue, "Allah, Allah," with the heart present, until one reaches a state where moving the tongue is abandoned, and it is as if the word flows upon the tongue. Then one perseveres until its trace is erased from the tongue, and the heart is found steadfast in remembrance. One continues until the form of the word, its letters, and the shape of the utterance are erased from the heart, and the meaning of the word remains alone in the heart, present within it, as if inseparable from it. One has choice up to this point, and choice in maintaining this state by repelling whispers, but one has no choice in attracting the mercy of God, Exalted is He. Rather, by what one has done, one has exposed oneself to the breezes of God's mercy, leaving only waiting for what God opens of mercy, as He opened it for the prophets and saints by this path. At that point, if one's intention is sincere, one's aspiration purified, and one's perseverance good—not pulled by desires nor preoccupied by the soul's chatter with worldly attachments—flashes of truth gleam in the heart. In the beginning, it is like a fleeting flash, not stable; then it may return, though it may be delayed. If it returns, it may become stable or may be snatched away. If stable, its stability may be prolonged or not; its like may appear in succession or be limited to a single kind. The stations of the saints of God, Exalted is He, in this are innumerable, just as the variation in their creation and character is innumerable. This path ultimately returns to pure purification from your side, and refinement and clarity, then preparation and waiting only. As for the speculative theologians and people of reflection, they do not deny the existence of this path, its possibility, or that it leads to this goal—though rarely, for it is the predominant state of the prophets and saints. However, they find this path difficult, consider its fruit slow, and deem the gathering of its conditions remote. They assert that erasing attachments to that extent is nearly impossible, and if attained momentarily, its permanence is even more remote, since the slightest whisper or thought disturbs the heart. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The heart of the believer is more fluctuating than a pot at boiling point." Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim. And he, upon him the best prayers and peace, said: "The heart..."

The believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the Most Merciful. During this spiritual struggle, the temperament may become corrupted, the mind may become disordered, and the body may fall ill. If the soul is not first trained and refined through the truths of knowledge, corrupt imaginings will take root in the heart, to which the soul may become attached for a long time until life passes and ends before success is achieved. How many a Sufi has trodden this path, only to remain in a single delusion for twenty years! Had he previously mastered knowledge, the point of confusion in that delusion would have been immediately revealed to him. Therefore, occupying oneself with the path of learning is more reliable and closer to the goal. They have likened this to a person who abandons learning jurisprudence, claiming that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not learn it but became a jurist through revelation and inspiration without repetition and study. I, too, might reach it through spiritual discipline and perseverance. Whoever thinks this has wronged himself and wasted his life. Rather, he is like one who abandons the path of earning and cultivation, hoping to stumble upon a treasure. While that is possible, it is exceedingly rare. So too is this. They said: One must first acquire what the scholars have acquired and understand what they have said. Then, after that, there is no harm in awaiting what has not been revealed to other scholars, for perhaps it will be revealed later through spiritual struggle.

An Explanation of the Difference Between the Two Stations with a Tangible Example

Know that the wonders of the heart are beyond the perceptions of the senses, for the heart itself is beyond sensory perception. That which is not perceived by the senses, weak intellects struggle to grasp except through a tangible example. We shall bring this closer to weak intellects with two examples. The first is that if we imagine a basin dug in the ground, it is possible for water to be channeled into it from above via opened rivers. It is also possible to dig beneath the basin and remove the earth until nearing the source of pure water, whereupon water gushes forth from beneath the basin. That water is purer and more lasting, and may be more abundant and plentiful. Thus, the heart is like the basin, knowledge is like the water, and the five senses are like the rivers. It is possible for knowledge to be conveyed to the heart via the rivers of the senses and reflection upon observations until it is filled with knowledge. It is also possible to block these rivers through seclusion, isolation, and lowering the gaze, and to aim for the depth of the heart by purifying it and lifting the veils from it until springs of knowledge gush forth from within it. If you ask: How can knowledge gush forth from the essence of the heart when it is devoid of it? Know that this is among the wonders of the secrets of the heart, not permitted to be mentioned in the science of spiritual practice. Rather, the extent that can be mentioned is that the realities of things are inscribed in the Preserved Tablet, indeed in the hearts of the angels brought near. Just as an architect draws the plans of a house on a blank surface and then brings it into existence according to that copy, so too the Originator of the heavens and the earth wrote a copy of the world from its beginning to its end in the Preserved Tablet, then brought it into existence according to that copy. The world that has come into existence in its form conveys another form to the senses and imagination. For whoever looks at the sky and the earth, then closes his eyes, sees the image of the sky and the earth in his imagination as if he were looking at them. Even if the sky and the earth ceased to exist and he remained in himself, he would find the image of the sky and the earth in his self as if he were witnessing and looking at them. Then, an impression is conveyed from his imagination to the heart, wherein the realities of the things that entered the senses and imagination are realized. What is realized in the heart corresponds to the world realized in the imagination, and what is realized in the imagination corresponds to the world existing in itself, external to a person's imagination and heart. The existing world corresponds to the copy existing in the Preserved Tablet. Thus, it is as if the world has four levels of existence: existence in the Preserved Tablet, which precedes its corporeal existence; followed by its true existence; followed by its imaginary existence—meaning the existence of its image in the imagination; followed by its intellectual existence—meaning the existence of its image in the heart. Some of these existences are spiritual, some corporeal, and the spiritual vary in their degree of spirituality. This subtlety is from divine wisdom, for He made your pupil, despite its small size, such that the image of the world, the heavens, and the earth, with all their vast expanse, is imprinted upon it. Then, from its existence in the senses, an existence flows to the imagination, and from it, an existence in the heart. For you never perceive except what reaches you. Had He not placed a likeness of the entire world within your very essence, you would have no awareness of what lies beyond your self. Glory be to Him who ordained these wonders in hearts and sights, then blinded hearts and sights from perceiving them, to the point that the hearts of most of creation are ignorant of themselves and their own wonders.

Let us return to the intended purpose and say: The heart may conceive that it receives the reality of the world and its form, sometimes from the senses and sometimes from the Preserved Tablet, just as the eye may conceive that it receives the image of the sun, sometimes by looking at it directly and sometimes by looking at the water that faces the sun and reflects its image. Whenever the veil between it and the Preserved Tablet is lifted, it sees things therein and knowledge gushes forth to it from it, thus dispensing with the need to borrow from the inner senses. This is like water gushing from the depths of the earth. And whenever it turns to the imaginings arising from the sensible things, that becomes a veil for it from contemplating the Preserved Tablet, just as when water gathers in rivers, it prevents gushing from the earth, and just as one who looks at the water reflecting the image of the sun is not looking at the sun itself. Therefore, the heart has two doors: a door opened to the world of the Dominion—which is the Preserved Tablet and the world of the angels—and a door opened to the five senses, which cling to the world of sovereignty and the visible realm. The world of the visible and sovereignty also mirrors the world of the Dominion in a kind of reflection. As for the opening of the heart's door to borrowing from the senses, that is not hidden from you. As for the opening of its inner door to the world of the Dominion and contemplating the Preserved Tablet, you know it with certain knowledge by reflecting on the wonders of dreams and the heart's awareness during sleep of what will be in the future or what was in the past, without borrowing from the direction of the senses. That door only opens for one who isolates himself in the remembrance of God Almighty. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The isolated ones have surpassed." It was asked: "Who are the isolated ones, O Messenger of God?" He said: "Those who are absorbed in the remembrance of God Almighty; remembrance lifts burdens from them, so they will come to the Resurrection light." Then he described them, informing from God Almighty, saying: "Then I turn My face to them. Do you see anyone I turn My face to? Does anyone know what I wish to give him?" Then God Almighty said: "The first thing I give them is that I cast light into their hearts, so they inform about Me as I have informed about them." The entrance for these reports is the inner door. Thus, the difference between the knowledge of the saints and the prophets and the knowledge of the scholars and the wise is this: their knowledge comes from within the heart, from the door opened to the world of the Dominion, while the knowledge of wisdom is attained from the doors of the senses opened to the world of sovereignty. The wonders of the heart's world and its fluctuation between the realms of the visible and the unseen cannot be exhaustively treated in the science of conduct. This is an example to teach you the difference between the entrances of the two worlds. The second example acquaints you with the difference between the two works—I mean the work of the scholars and the work of the saints. For the scholars work in acquiring the knowledge itself and drawing it to the heart, while the saints of the Sufis work in polishing the hearts, purifying them, refining them, and burnishing them only. It has been related that the people of China and the people of Byzantium boasted before a certain king about the excellence of their engraving and painting. The king resolved to give them a panel so that the people of China would engrave one side and the people of Byzantium the other, and he hung a veil between them to prevent each group from seeing the other. This was done. The Byzantines gathered rare pigments without limit, while the Chinese entered without any pigment and set about polishing their side and burnishing it. When the Byzantines finished, the Chinese claimed they had also finished. The king was amazed at their statement and how they finished engraving without pigment. It was said: "How did you finish without pigment?" They said: "It is not your concern; raise the veil." They raised it, and behold, their side shone with the wonders of Byzantine craftsmanship with increased radiance and brilliance, for it had become like a polished mirror due to much burnishing. Thus, the beauty of their side increased with the additional polishing. Likewise, the concern of the saints is with purifying the heart, polishing it, purifying it, and refining it until the clarity of Truth shines in it with ultimate radiance, like the action of the people of China. And the concern of the wise and the scholars is with acquisition and engraving knowledge and attaining its engraving in the heart, like the action of the people of Byzantium. However the matter may be, the heart of the believer does not die, and his knowledge at death is not erased, and its clarity is not clouded. Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, alluded to this with his saying: "Dust does not consume the place of faith; rather, it becomes a means and a nearness to God Almighty." As for what he has attained of knowledge itself and what he has attained of clarity and preparedness to receive knowledge itself, he cannot do without it, and no one has happiness except through knowledge and gnosis. Some felicities are more noble than others, just as there is no sufficiency except with wealth: the possessor of a dirham is rich, and the possessor of overflowing treasuries is rich. The degrees of the felicitous vary according to the variation in gnosis and faith, just as the degrees of the rich vary according to the abundance or scarcity of wealth.

Wealth and its abundance are but means, while spiritual knowledge are lights. The believers do not strive to meet God Almighty except by their lights. God Almighty said: "Their light runs before them and on their right hands." It has been narrated in a report that some are given a light like a mountain, and some smaller, until the last of them is a man given a light upon the tip of his toe, which shines once and is extinguished another. When it shines, he places his foot and walks; when it is extinguished, he stands. Their crossing over the Path is according to the measure of their light. Among them are those who pass like the blink of an eye, and among them are those who pass like lightning, and among them are those who pass like clouds, and among them are those who pass like the shooting of stars, and among them are those who pass like a horse when it charges in its course. And he who was given a light upon the tip of his toe crawls upon his face, his hands, and his legs, dragging one hand and lifting another, and the sides of his body are struck by the Fire. He remains thus until he is delivered. [28] A sound hadith according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. By this, the disparity among people in faith becomes clear. If the faith of Abu Bakr were weighed against the faith of all worlds besides the Prophets and Messengers, it would outweigh them. This also resembles the saying of one who said: If the light of the sun were weighed against the light of all lamps, it would outweigh them. For indeed, the light of the common folk is like the light of a lamp, and some of them have a light like the light of a candle. The faith of the truthful ones has a light like the light of the moon and the stars, and the faith of the Prophets is like the sun. And just as the image of the horizons is revealed in the light of the sun with the vastness of their expanses, while in the light of a lamp only the narrow corner of a house is revealed, so too is the disparity in the expansion of the breast through spiritual knowledge and the revelation of the vastness of the dominion to the hearts of the knowers. Therefore, it has come in a report that it will be said on the Day of Resurrection: "Bring out from the Fire whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of faith, and half an atom's weight, and a quarter of an atom's weight, and a barley grain, and an atom." [29] All of this points to the disparity in the degrees of faith and that these measures of faith do not prevent entry into the Fire. Its implication is that whoever has faith exceeding an atom's weight does not enter the Fire, for if he entered, he would be commanded to be brought out first. And that whoever has an atom's weight in his heart does not deserve eternity in the Fire, even if he enters it. Likewise, his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "There is nothing better than a thousand of its like except the believing human," [30] is a good indication of the superiority of the heart of the knower of God Almighty, the one of certainty, for it is better than a thousand hearts of the common folk. And He Almighty has said: "And you are the superior ones if you are believers," giving superiority to the believers over the Muslims, and the intended here is the knowing believer, not the imitator. And He, Mighty and Majestic, said: "God will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees." Here, He intended by "those who have believed" those who affirmed truth without knowledge, and distinguished them from "those who were given knowledge." This indicates that the name 'believer' applies to the imitator, even if his affirmation is not based on insight and unveiling. Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, interpreted His saying, Almighty: "and those who were given knowledge by degrees," saying: "God raises the knower above the believer by seven hundred degrees, between every two degrees is as between the heaven and the earth." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The majority of the people of Paradise are the simple-minded, and the highest levels are for the people of intellect." [31] And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The superiority of the knower over the worshiper is like my superiority over the lowest of my Companions." [32] In another narration: "Like the superiority of the moon on the night of the full moon over the rest of the stars." By these evidences, it becomes clear to you the disparity in the degrees of the people of Paradise according to the disparity in their hearts and their knowledge. For this reason, the Day of Resurrection is the Day of Loss, for the one deprived of God's mercy suffers immense loss and ruin. The deprived one sees above his degree great degrees, so his looking at them is like the look of a rich man who possesses ten dirhams at a rich man who possesses the earth from east to west. Each of them is rich, but how great is the difference between them, and how great is the loss upon him who forfeits his share of that. And for the Hereafter are the greatest degrees and the greatest superiority.

**Clarification of the Evidences from the Sacred Law on the Validity of the Path of the People of Sufism in Acquiring Knowledge, Not from Learning Nor from the Customary Path**

Know that whoever has something unveiled to him, even the slightest thing, through the path of inspiration and what occurs in the heart from where he does not know, has indeed become a knower of the soundness of the path. And whoever has never attained that from himself should believe in it, for the degree of knowledge therein is very precious. This is attested to by evidences from the Sacred Law, experiences, and narratives. As for the evidences, His saying, Almighty: "And those who strive in Our cause – We will surely guide them to Our ways." Thus, every wisdom that appears in the heart through perseverance in worship without learning is through the path of unveiling and inspiration. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever acts upon what he knows, God will bequeath to him knowledge of what he does not know and grant him success in what he does, until he becomes deserving of Paradise. And whoever does not act upon what he knows will be lost in what he knows and will not..."

He is guided in what he does until he becomes deserving of the Fire. And God Almighty said: "And whoever fears God, He will make for him a way out [from every difficulty], and provide for him from where he does not expect." He grants him knowledge without learning, and grants him insight without experience. And God Almighty said: "O you who have believed, if you fear God, He will grant you a criterion." It is said: a light by which to distinguish between truth and falsehood and by which to emerge from doubts. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, frequently asked for light in his supplications, saying: "O God, grant me light, increase me in light, and place light in my heart, in my grave, in my hearing, in my sight," until he said, "in my hair, in my skin, in my flesh, my blood, and my bones." He was asked, peace and blessings be upon him, about God's saying: "So is one whose breast God has expanded to Islam, then he is upon a light from his Lord?" He said: "It is expansion. For when light is cast into the heart, the breast expands and becomes wide." And he said to Ibn Abbas, peace and blessings be upon him: "O God, grant him understanding in religion and teach him the interpretation." And Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "We have nothing that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, confided to us except that God Almighty grants a servant understanding of His Book, and this is not by learning." It is said in the interpretation of His saying: "He grants wisdom to whom He wills," that it is understanding of the Book of God. And He said: "So We enabled Solomon to understand it," specifying what was unveiled with the name 'understanding.' And Abu al-Darda' used to say: "The believer is one who sees by the light of God from behind a thin veil. By God, it is the truth that God casts into their hearts and causes to flow upon their tongues." And some of the early generations said: "The believer's intuition is like divination." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Beware of the insight of the believer, for he sees by the light of God Almighty." To this points His saying: "Indeed in that are signs for those who discern," and His saying: "We have detailed the signs for a people who are certain." Al-Hasan reported from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Knowledge is of two kinds: knowledge within the heart—that is the beneficial knowledge." A scholar was asked about the inner knowledge: what is it? He said: "It is a secret from the secrets of God Almighty that He casts into the hearts of His beloved ones, which no angel nor human has been made aware of." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Among my community are those who are spoken to, and those who are taught, and those who are addressed, and indeed 'Umar is among them." Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, recited: "And We sent not before you any messenger or prophet or *muhaddath*," meaning the truthful ones, and the *muhaddath* is the inspired one, and the inspired one is he to whom is unveiled in the inner core of his heart from the inward direction, not from the outward perceptible senses. The Quran declares that God-consciousness is the key to guidance and unveiling, and that is knowledge without learning. And God Almighty said: "And We have not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term. But those who disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turning away." He specified it for them. And He said: "This is a clear statement to the people and a guidance and instruction for the God-conscious." And Abu Yazid and others would say: "The scholar is not the one who memorizes from a book, so that if he forgets what he memorized he becomes ignorant. Rather, the scholar is the one who takes his knowledge from his Lord at any time he wishes, without memorization or study. This is the divine knowledge, and to it points His saying: 'And We taught him from Us knowledge.' Although all knowledge is from Him, some of it is through the intermediaries of created teachers, so that is not called divine knowledge. Rather, the divine is that which opens up in the secret of the heart without any familiar external cause." These are the textual evidences. If all that has come regarding it from verses, reports, and narrations were gathered, it would be beyond enumeration. As for witnessing it through experiences, that too is beyond enumeration, and this became manifest among the Companions, the Successors, and those after them. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said to 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, at the time of his death: "They are only your two brothers and your two sisters," and his wife was pregnant, and she gave birth to a girl, for he had known before the birth that it was a girl. And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said during his sermon: "O Sariyah, the mountain, the mountain!" when it was unveiled to him that the enemy had gained the high ground, so he warned him due to his knowledge of that. Then his voice reaching him was among the great miracles. And from Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, he said: "I entered upon 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him, and I had met a woman on my way and looked at her askance and contemplated her beauty. So 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him, said when I entered: 'One of you enters upon me while the trace of fornication is apparent in his eyes? Do you not know that the fornication of the eyes is looking? Either you repent or I will punish you.' I said: 'Has revelation come after the Prophet?' He said: 'No, but insight, evidence, and truthful intuition.'" And from Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz, he said: "I entered the Sacred Mosque and saw a poor man wearing two ragged garments. I said to myself: 'This one and his like are a burden upon the people.' He called out to me and said: 'And God knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him.' So I sought God's forgiveness in my heart. He called out to me and said: 'And He is the One who accepts repentance.'"

From His servants, then He vanished from me and I did not see Him. And Zakariya ibn Dawud said: Abu al-‘Abbas ibn Masruq entered upon Abu al-Fadl al-Hashimi while he was ill, and he had dependents, and no known means of livelihood was known for him. He said: When I rose, I said to myself, ‘From where does this man eat?’ He said: Then he called out to me, ‘O Abu al-‘Abbas, reject this base concern, for indeed God Almighty has subtle kindnesses.’ And Ahmad al-Naqib said: I entered upon al-Shibli and he said, perplexed, ‘O Ahmad.’ I said, ‘What is the news?’ He said, ‘I was sitting and it occurred to my mind that you are miserly. I said, ‘I am not miserly.’ Then the thought returned to me and said, ‘Rather, you are miserly.’ I said, ‘Nothing has been opened for me today except that I will give it to the first needy person I meet.’ He said, ‘The thought had not even been completed when a companion of al-Mu’nis the servant entered upon me with fifty dinars and said, ‘Use them for your needs.’ He said, ‘I rose and took them and went out, and there was a blind needy person before a barber who was shaving his head. I approached him and handed him the dinars. He said, ‘Give them to the barber.’ I said, ‘The total is such and such.’ He said, ‘Did we not tell you that you are miserly?’ He said, ‘So I gave them to the barber. The barber said, ‘We had resolved when this needy person sat before us that we would not take a fee from him.’ He said, ‘So I threw them into the Tigris and said, ‘Whoever honors you, God Almighty will humble him.’ And Hamzah ibn ‘Abd Allah al-‘Alawi said: I entered upon Abu al-Khayr al-Ninani and resolved in myself to greet him and not eat food in his house. When I left him, behold, he had caught up with me carrying a platter with food and said, ‘O young man, eat, for you have just now left your resolve.’ This Abu al-Khayr al-Ninani was famous for spiritual graces. And Ibrahim al-Raqqi said: I intended to visit him to greet him. The Maghrib prayer time arrived, and he could hardly recite al-Fatihah properly. I said to myself, ‘My journey is wasted.’ When he concluded the prayer, I went out to relieve myself, and a lion approached me. I returned to Abu al-Khayr and said, ‘A lion approached me.’ He went out and shouted at it, saying, ‘Did I not tell you not to approach my guests?’ The lion withdrew. I relieved myself, and when I returned he said to me, ‘You busied yourselves with rectifying the outward, so you feared the lion. We busied ourselves with rectifying the inward, so the lion feared us.’ What has been narrated of the insight of the shaykhs and their informing of people’s beliefs and inner thoughts is beyond enumeration. Rather, what has been narrated from them of witnessing al-Khidr (upon him be peace) and asking him, and of hearing the voice of the caller, and of various kinds of spiritual graces, is beyond enumeration. The narration does not benefit the denier unless he witnesses it himself. Whoever denies the principle denies the detail. The decisive proof which no one is capable of denying is two matters. First, the wonders of true dreams, for through them the unseen is unveiled. If that is possible in sleep, then it is not impossible in wakefulness, for sleep does not differ from wakefulness except in the stillness of the senses and their lack of engagement with perceptible things. How many a wakeful person is submerged, not hearing nor seeing, due to his engagement with his own self. Second, the informing of the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) about the unseen and matters in the future, as contained in the Qur’an. If that is possible for the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), it is possible for others, for the Prophet is an expression for a person who is unveiled to the realities of matters and is occupied with reforming creation. It is not impossible that there exist in existence a person who is unveiled to the realities and is not occupied with reforming creation. This is not called a prophet, but rather is called a saint. So whoever believes in the prophets and affirms true dreams, it necessarily follows that he must acknowledge that the heart has two doors: a door to the outside, which is the senses, and a door to the dominion from within the heart, which is the door of inspiration, whispering in the mind, and revelation. If he closes them both, he cannot confine knowledge to learning and engaging with customary means. Rather, it is possible that spiritual struggle is a path to it. This is what alerts to the reality of what we have mentioned of the wondrous fluctuation of the heart between the world of testimony and the world of the dominion. As for the reason for the unveiling of matters in dreams through symbols requiring interpretation, and likewise the appearance of angels to the prophets and saints in different forms, that too is from the secrets of the wonders of the heart, and that is only fitting for the science of unveiling. So let us confine ourselves to what we have mentioned, for it is sufficient to urge towards spiritual struggle and seeking unveiling from it. Indeed, one of those granted unveiling said: The angel appeared to me and asked me, ‘Dictate to me something from my hidden remembrance of what I have witnessed of Divine Oneness.’ And he said, ‘What work shall we write for you, for we love to ascend for you a work by which you draw near to God Almighty?’ I said, ‘Do you not both write the obligatory deeds?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Then that suffices you.’ This is an indication that the noble recording angels do not have access to the secrets of the heart; they only have access to the outward deeds. And one of the knowers said: I asked one of the substitutes about a matter concerning the witnessing of certainty. He turned to his left and said, ‘What do you say, may God have mercy on you?’ Then he turned...

He turned to his right and said, "What do you say, may God have mercy on you?" Then he bowed his head to his chest and said, "What do you say, may God have mercy on you?" Then he gave the most remarkable answer I had ever heard. I asked him about his turning [to the sides]. He replied, "I had no ready answer for the question, so I asked the companion on the left, and he said, 'I do not know.' I asked the companion on the right, who is more knowledgeable than him, and he said, 'I do not know.' So I looked to my heart and asked it, and it informed me of what I answered you. Indeed, it is more knowledgeable than both of them." It is as if this is the meaning of his saying, peace be upon him, "There are among my community those who are spoken to [by angels], and 'Umar is among them." And in the tradition: "God Almighty says, 'Whichever servant I look upon his heart and see that clinging to My remembrance predominates over him, I take charge of his governance, and I become his intimate companion, his confidant, and his solace.'" And Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, said, "The heart is like a pitched tent around which are closed doors. Whichever door is opened for it, it works therein." Thus, it becomes apparent that a door from the doors of the heart opens towards the realm of the sovereignty and the highest assembly. That door opens through spiritual struggle, piety, and turning away from the desires of this world. For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, wrote to the commanders of the armies, "Preserve what you hear from the obedient ones, for truthful matters are unveiled to them." And some scholars said, "God's hand is upon the mouths of the wise; they speak only of the truth that God has prepared for them." Another said, "If I wished, I could say that God Almighty reveals to the humble some of His secret."

**Explanation of Satan's Dominance Over the Heart Through Whisperings, the Meaning of Whispering, and the Reason for Its Prevalence**

Know that the heart, as we have mentioned, is like a pitched tent with doors. States pour into it from every door. Its likeness is also that of a target at which arrows are shot from all sides. Or it is like a mirror set up, upon which pass various kinds of different images, so one image after another appears in it, and it is never devoid of them. Or it is like a basin into which different waters flow from rivers opened to it. The entrances for these ever-renewing traces into the heart in every state are, from the outward aspect, the five senses; and from the inward aspect, the imagination, desire, anger, and the traits compounded from a person's temperament. For when he perceives something with the senses, an effect from it occurs in the heart. Likewise, if desire stirs, for example due to excessive eating or due to a strength in the temperament, an effect from it occurs in the heart. And if sensation is restrained, the imaginings occurring in the soul remain, and the imagination shifts from one thing to another. According to the shifting of the imagination, the heart shifts from one state to another. The point is that the heart is constantly changing and being affected by these causes. The most specific of the traces occurring in the heart are the *khawatir* (thoughts/impulses). By *khawatir*, I mean what occurs within it of thoughts and remembrances; I mean its perceptions of knowledge, whether on the path of new occurrence or on the path of recollection. For they are called *khawatir* (lit. 'that which occurs') from the perspective that they occur after the heart was heedless of them. These *khawatir* are what move the intentions. For resolve, determination, and intention only come after the object of intention has occurred to the mind, without doubt. Thus, the origin of actions is the *khawatir*. Then a *khatira* (thought/impulse) moves desire, desire moves determination, determination moves intention, and intention moves the limbs. The *khawatir* that move desire are divided into that which calls to evil—I mean, that which harms in the ultimate end—and that which calls to good—I mean, that which benefits in the Hereafter. They are two different *khawatir*, so they require two different names. The praiseworthy *khatira* is called *ilham* (inspiration), and the blameworthy *khatira*—I mean, that which calls to evil—is called *waswas* (whispering/insinuation). Then, you know that these *khawatir* are occurrences. Every occurrence necessarily has an originator. Whenever occurrences differ, that indicates a difference in their causes. This is known from the established way of God Almighty in arranging effects according to causes. Whenever the walls of a house are illuminated by the light of a fire and its ceiling is darkened and blackened by smoke, you know that the cause of the blackness is other than the cause of the illumination. Likewise, the illumination of the heart and its darkness have two different causes. The cause of the *khatira* calling to good is called an angel, and the cause of the *khatira* calling to evil is called a devil. The subtle facilitation by which the heart is prepared to accept the inspiration of good is called *tawfiq* (divine facilitation/success), and that by which it is prepared to accept the devil's whispering is called *ighwa'* (misleading) and *khidhlan* (abandonment). For different meanings require different names. The angel is an expression for a creature God Almighty created, its function being the effusion of good, the imparting of knowledge, the unveiling of truth, the promise of good, and the enjoining of what is right. He created it and subjugated it for that. The devil is an expression for a creature whose function is the opposite of that: it is the promise of evil, the enjoining of indecency, and the intimidation with poverty when one intends good. Thus, whispering (*waswasa*) is in opposition to inspiration (*ilham*), the devil is in opposition to the angel, and divine facilitation (*tawfiq*) is in opposition to abandonment (*khidhlan*). And to Him...

The indication in God’s saying, “And of all things We created pairs,” is that all existent things are opposites, paired—except God, exalted is He, for He is the Singular, having no opposite; rather, He is the One True Reality, the Creator of all pairs. Thus, the heart is pulled between the devil and the angel. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said concerning the heart: “There are two promptings in the heart: a prompting from the angel, which promises good, affirms truth, and whoever finds that, let him know it is from God, glorified is He, and let him praise God; and a prompting from the enemy, which promises evil, denies truth, and forbids good—whoever finds that, let him seek refuge in God from the accursed devil.” Then he recited God’s saying: “Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to indecency.” Al-Hasan said: “They are but two promptings that roam in the heart: one from God, exalted is He, and one from the enemy. May God have mercy on a servant who pauses at his prompting: if it is from God, exalted is He, he acts upon it; if it is from his enemy, he struggles against it.” Regarding the heart’s being pulled between these two forces, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the Merciful.” God is exalted above having a finger composed of flesh, blood, and nerves, divided into joints; rather, the spirit of “finger” is swift turning and the power to move and change. For you do not desire your finger for its essence, but for its action in turning and repeating—just as you perform actions with your fingers. God, exalted is He, does what He does by employing the angel and the devil, and both are employed by His power in turning hearts, just as your fingers are employed by you in turning objects, for example. The heart, by its primordial nature, is fit to receive the traces of the angel and the traces of the devil equally; neither outweighs the other. Rather, one side gains preponderance by following caprice and indulging in desires, or by turning away from them and opposing them. If a person follows the demands of anger and desire, the domination of Satan becomes apparent through the medium of caprice, and the heart becomes the devil’s nest and mine, for caprice is the devil’s pasture and grazing ground. If one struggles against desires, does not let them dominate him, and adopts the character of the angels, peace be upon them, his heart becomes the dwelling and descent-place of the angels. Since no heart is free from desire, anger, greed, covetousness, extended hope, and other such human qualities branching from caprice, it is inevitable that no heart is free from the devil’s roaming through whisperings. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “There is none among you but has a devil.” They said: “Even you, O Messenger of God?” He said: “Even me, except that God has helped me against him, so he has submitted and only commands good.” This is because the devil operates only through the medium of desire. Whoever God helps against his desire, so that it expands only where and to the extent it should, his desire does not call to evil, and the devil who is armed with it only commands good. Whenever remembrance of this world, prompted by caprice, overcomes the heart, the devil finds scope and whispers; whenever the heart turns to remembrance of God, exalted is He, the devil departs, his scope narrows, and the angel draws near and inspires. The chasing between the troops of angels and devils in the battlefield of the heart is constant until the heart opens to one of them, so that he settles and becomes established, and the passing of the second becomes a snatching. Most hearts have been opened by the troops of devils and taken possession of, so they are filled with whisperings urging preference for the immediate and abandonment of the Hereafter. The beginning of their mastery is following desires and caprice. After that, they cannot be opened except by emptying the heart of the devil’s sustenance—which is caprice and desires—and building it up with remembrance of God, exalted is He, which is the place for the traces of the angels. Jabir ibn ‘Ubaydah al-‘Adawi said: “I complained to al-‘Ala’ ibn Ziyad about the whisperings I find in my chest.” He said: “That is like a house that thieves pass by: if there is something in it, they struggle for it; otherwise, they pass on and leave it.” Meaning, the heart empty of caprice is not entered by the devil. Therefore, God, exalted is He, said: “Indeed, over My servants you have no authority.” So whoever follows caprice is a slave of caprice, not a slave of God, and therefore God gives the devil authority over him. And He said: “Have you seen him who takes his desire as his god?” This indicates that whoever makes his caprice his god and object of worship is a slave of caprice, not a slave of God. Therefore, ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: “O Messenger of God, the devil comes between me and my prayer and recitation.” He said: “That is a devil called Khanzab. When you sense him, seek refuge in God from him and spit to your left three times.” He said: “I did that, and God removed him from me.” In a report: “For ablution there is a devil called al-Walhan, so seek refuge in God from him.” Nothing erases the devil’s whisperings from the heart except remembrance of other than what he whispers, for when remembrance of God occurs in the heart, the devil’s whisperings are effaced.

Anything that loses what it previously contained can become a playground for Satan. The remembrance of God is what safeguards one's side, making it known that Satan has no access there. Nothing is treated except by its opposite, and the opposite of all Satan's whisperings is the remembrance of God through seeking refuge and disavowing any power or strength—this is the meaning of saying, "I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan," and "There is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Most Great." This can only be achieved by the God-fearing, those dominated by the remembrance of God Almighty. Satan only circles them during moments of lapses, by stealth. God Almighty says: "Indeed, those who are conscious of God—when a suggestion from Satan touches them, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight." Mujahid said regarding the meaning of God's saying, "from the evil of the retreating whisperer": He spreads over the heart, so when God is remembered, he retreats and withdraws; but when one is heedless, he spreads over his heart. The chasing away between the remembrance of God and the whisperings of Satan is like the chasing away between light and darkness, between night and day. Due to their opposition, God says: "Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of God." Anas reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, Satan places his snout upon the heart of the son of Adam. If he remembers God, he withdraws; but if he forgets God, he swallows his heart." Ibn Waddah mentioned in a narration: "When a man reaches forty years and has not repented, Satan wipes his face with his hand and says, 'Woe to a face that will not succeed.'" Just as desires are mixed with the flesh and blood of the son of Adam, so too is Satan's dominion pervasive in his flesh and blood, surrounding the heart from all sides. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like blood. So constrict his passages with hunger." This is because hunger breaks desire, and Satan's passage is through desires. Due to desires encompassing the heart from all sides, God says, reporting from Iblis: "I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path. Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, Satan sat for the son of Adam on paths. He sat for him on the path of Islam and said, 'Will you submit and abandon your religion and the religion of your forefathers?' But he disobeyed him and submitted. Then he sat for him on the path of emigration and said, 'Will you emigrate, leaving your land and sky?' But he disobeyed him and emigrated. Then he sat for him on the path of jihad and said, 'Will you fight? It is the loss of soul and wealth. You will fight and be killed, your women will be married, and your wealth divided.' But he disobeyed him and fought." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever does that and dies, it is a right upon God to admit him into Paradise." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned the meaning of whisperings—these are the thoughts that occur to the warrior that he will be killed, his women married, and other things that divert him from jihad. These thoughts are known, so whisperings are known by observation. Every thought has a cause and requires a name to identify it; the name of its cause is Satan. It is inconceivable that any human be free from him; they only differ in disobeying or following him. Therefore, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "There is no one except that he has a Satan." Thus, through this type of insight, the meaning of whispering, inspiration, the angel, Satan, divine facilitation, and abandonment has become clear. After this, whoever looks into the essence of Satan—whether he is a subtle body or not, and if he is a body, how does he enter the human body, which is also a body—this is now unnecessary in the science of spiritual practice. Rather, the example of one who researches this is like one into whose clothes a snake has entered, needing to remove it and ward off its harm, yet busies himself investigating its color, shape, length, and width—that is sheer ignorance. Confronting thoughts that incite evil is known, and that indicates it is from a cause without doubt. Knowing that the caller to evil, which is feared in the future, is an enemy, the enemy is inevitably recognized. One should therefore busy himself with striving against him. God, glorified be He, has made known his enmity in many places in His Book so that one may believe in it and guard against it. He says: "Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze." And He says: "Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan—[for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy?" Thus, the servant should busy himself with repelling the enemy from himself, not with asking about his origin, lineage, or dwelling. Yes, he should ask about his weapon to repel him from himself, and Satan's weapon is caprice and desires—and that is sufficient for the worlds. As for knowing his essence, attributes, and reality—we seek refuge in God from him—and the reality of the angels, that is the field of the knowers deeply immersed in the sciences of unveilings. In the science of spiritual practice, there is no need to know it. Yes, one should know that thoughts are divided into what is known...

It is certain that what calls to evil is unmistakably a whisper, and what calls to good is undoubtedly an inspiration. As for that which is ambiguous, where one does not know whether it is from the prompting of an angel or from the prompting of Satan, then indeed among the stratagems of Satan is that he presents evil in the guise of good, and distinguishing between them is obscure. Most worshippers perish because of this, for Satan cannot call them to blatant evil, so he portrays evil in the image of good. For instance, he says to the scholar, by way of admonition: "Do you not see the creation, dead in ignorance, perishing in heedlessness, on the brink of the Fire? Do you not have mercy upon the servants of God to rescue them from perils through your counsel and admonition? God has bestowed upon you an insightful heart, an eloquent tongue, and an acceptable manner of speech. How can you be ungrateful for the favor of God Almighty, expose yourself to His wrath, and remain silent about spreading knowledge and calling creation to the Straight Path?" He continually affirms this within himself and draws him, with subtle guile, until he becomes occupied with admonishing people. Then he calls him thereafter to adorn himself before them and affect refinement in speech and display of piety, saying to him: "If you do not do this, your words will fall from their hearts and they will not be guided to the truth." He keeps affirming this to him, while in the midst of it, he implants within him impurities of ostentation, seeking people's acceptance, delight in status, pride in numerous followers, knowledge, and looking upon creation with contempt. Thus, he gradually leads the wretched one, through sincere advice, to destruction. So he speaks while believing his intention is good, yet his true intention is status and acceptance, and he perishes because of it while thinking he holds a station with God. He is among those concerning whom the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, God supports this religion through a people who have no share (in the Hereafter)," and "Indeed, God supports this religion through a sinful man." For this reason, it is narrated that Iblis—may God curse him—appeared to Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, and said to him: "Say, 'There is no god but God.'" He replied: "It is a word of truth, but I will not say it because you said it," for he also has deceptions beneath good. The deceptions of Satan of this kind are endless, and through them perish the scholars, the worshippers, the ascetics, the poor, the wealthy, and all types of creation who detest apparent evil and are not content to plunge into open sins. We shall mention a number of Satan's stratagems in the Book of Delusion at the end of this quarter, and perhaps, if time permits, we will compose a specific book on it which we shall call "The Deception of Iblis," for his deception has now spread in the lands and among the worshippers, especially in doctrines and beliefs, until nothing remains of good deeds except their outward form—all of this in submission to the deceptions and stratagems of Satan. It is incumbent upon the servant to pause at every thought that occurs to him, to know whether it is from the prompting of an angel or from the prompting of Satan, and to scrutinize it with the eye of insight, not with the desire of his nature, and to perceive it only by the light of piety, insight, and abundant knowledge, as God Almighty said: "Indeed, those who fear God—when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight." That is, they return to the light of knowledge, and then the confusion is unveiled for them. As for one who does not discipline himself with piety, his nature inclines to submit to deception by following desire, so his errors multiply and his destruction is hastened, while he is unaware. Concerning their like, God Almighty said: "And there will appear to them from God that which they had not taken into account." It is said these are deeds they thought were good deeds, but they are evil deeds. The most subtle type of knowledge concerning spiritual conduct is discerning the deceptions of the self and the stratagems of Satan, and this is an individual obligation upon every servant. Yet people have neglected it and occupied themselves with sciences that draw whispers to them, empower Satan over them, and make them forget his enmity and the way to guard against him. Nothing saves from the abundance of whispers except blocking the doors of thoughts, and their doors are the five senses, and their inner doors are the desires and attachments of this world. Seclusion in a dark house blocks the door of the senses, and detachment from family and wealth reduces the avenues of whispers from within. Yet inner avenues remain in the imaginings that flow in the heart, and these cannot be repelled except by occupying the heart with the remembrance of God Almighty. Then, it continually wrestles with the heart, contends with it, and distracts it from the remembrance of God Almighty, so striving against it is unavoidable. This is a struggle that has no end except death, for no one is freed from Satan as long as he lives. Indeed, one may become strong such that he does not yield to him and wards off his harm through striving, but he can never dispense with striving and resistance as long as blood flows in his body. Thus, as long as he lives, the doors of Satan are open to his heart and do not close—they are desire, anger, envy, greed, avarice, and others, as will be explained. Whenever the door is open and the enemy is not heedless, he cannot be repelled except by vigilance and striving. A man said...

For Hasan, O Abu Sa'id, does Satan sleep? He smiled and said, "If he slept, we would find rest. Therefore, there is no deliverance for the believer from him." Yes, there is a way to repel him and weaken his strength. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The believer wears out his Satan just as one of you wears out his camel on a journey." Ibn Mas'ud said, "The believer's Satan is emaciated." And Qays ibn al-Hajjaj said, "My Satan said to me, 'I entered you while I was like a camel, and now I am like a sparrow.' I said, 'Why is that?' He said, 'You melt me with the remembrance of God, the Exalted.'" Thus, the people of God-consciousness do not find it difficult to block Satan's doors and guard them with vigilance—I mean the apparent doors and clear paths that lead to manifest sins. Rather, they stumble in his obscure paths, for they do not find guidance to them so as to guard them, as we alluded to in the deception of scholars, preachers, and the problematic matter that the doors open to the heart for Satan are many, while the door for the angels is but one. That single door has become confused with these numerous doors. The servant therein is like a traveler who remains in a vast desert with many obscure paths on a dark night; he scarcely knows the way except with a discerning eye and the rising of a radiant sun. The discerning eye here is the heart purified by God-consciousness, and the radiant sun is the abundant knowledge gained from the Book of God, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace be upon him, which guides to the intricacies of his paths. Otherwise, his paths are many and obscure. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, once drew a line for us and said, 'This is the path of God.' Then he drew lines to its right and left and said, 'These are paths; upon every path is a Satan calling to it.' Then he recited, 'And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths, lest they divert you from His way.'" Thus, he, peace be upon him, clarified the multitude of his paths. We have mentioned an example of an obscure path among his paths—the one by which he deceives scholars and worshippers who control their desires and abstain from manifest sins. Let us now mention an example of his clear path, which is not hidden except that a human is compelled to tread it. This is as narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said, "There was a monk among the Children of Israel. Satan approached a young girl, strangled her, and cast into the hearts of her family that her cure was with the monk. They brought her to him, but he refused to accept her. They persisted until he accepted her. When she was with him for treatment, Satan came to him, beautified for him approaching her, and persisted until he had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant by him. Then Satan whispered to him, saying, 'Now you will be exposed; her family will come to you. Kill her. If they ask you, say she died.' So he killed her and buried her. Satan then came to her family, whispered to them, and cast into their hearts that he had impregnated her, then killed and buried her. They came to him and asked about her. He said, 'She died.' They seized him to kill her in retaliation. Satan came to him and said, 'I am the one who strangled her, and I am the one who cast it into the hearts of her family. Obey me, and you will be saved, and I will deliver you from them.' He said, 'With what?' He said, 'Prostrate to me twice.' So he prostrated to him twice. Satan then said to him, 'I am free of you.' He is the one about whom God, the Exalted, said, 'Like Satan when he says to man, "Disbelieve." But when he disbelieves, he says, "I am free of you."'" Consider now his cunning and how he compelled the monk to these major sins, all for obeying him in accepting the girl for treatment—a seemingly trivial matter, which its doer might think is good and virtuous, so it appears pleasing in his heart through hidden desire, and he proceeds with it like one eager for good. Then the matter later escapes his control, and one part drags him to another until he finds no escape. We seek refuge in God from neglecting the beginnings of matters. This is alluded to in his saying, peace be upon him, "Whoever hovers around a forbidden zone is likely to fall into it."

Detailed Explanation of Satan's Entrances to the Heart

Know that the heart is like a fortress, and Satan is an enemy who wishes to enter the fortress to possess and dominate it. One cannot protect the fortress from the enemy except by guarding the fortress's doors, entrances, and points of breach. One cannot guard its doors who does not know its doors. Protecting the heart from Satan's whispers is obligatory; it is an individual duty upon every accountable servant. That without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is also obligatory. One cannot achieve repelling Satan except by knowing his entrances. Thus, knowing his entrances becomes obligatory. Satan's entrances and doors are the attributes of the servant, and they are many. But we will point to the great doors that function like wide roads, not narrow for the multitude of Satan's troops. Among his great doors are anger and lust, for anger is the destroyer of intellect. When the troops of intellect weaken, the troops of Satan assault. Whenever a person becomes angry, Satan plays with him as a boy plays with a ball. It has been narrated...

That Moses, peace be upon him, was met by Iblis, who said to him: "O Moses, you are the one whom God has chosen for His message and spoken to directly. I am a creature from among God's creatures. I have sinned and wish to repent. Intercede for me with my Lord that He may accept my repentance." Moses said: "Yes." When Moses ascended the mountain, spoke with his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, and was about to descend, his Lord said to him: "Fulfill the trust." Moses said: "O Lord, your servant Iblis wishes for You to accept his repentance." Then God, exalted is He, revealed to Moses: "O Moses, I have already decreed concerning your request once: that he prostrate to the grave of Adam so that his repentance may be accepted." Moses met Iblis and said to him: "I have fulfilled your request. I have been commanded that you prostrate to the grave of Adam so that your repentance may be accepted." He became angry and arrogant, saying: "I did not prostrate to him when he was alive; shall I prostrate to him when he is dead?" Then he said to him: "O Moses, you have a right over me for interceding for me with my Lord. So remember me at three times, and I will not destroy you therein. Remember me when you are angry, for my spirit is in your heart and my eye is in your eye, and I flow through you like blood. Remember me when you are angry, for when a person becomes angry, his nostrils flare and he knows not what he does. And remember me when you face the battle ranks, for I come to the son of Adam when he faces the battle ranks and remind him of his wife, his children, and his family until he flees. And beware of sitting with a woman who is not a lawful relative, for I am her messenger to you and your messenger to her, and I do not cease until I tempt you with her and tempt her with you." He thus pointed to desire, anger, and greed. For fleeing from the battle ranks is greed for this world, and his refusal to prostrate to Adam when dead is envy, which is among his greatest avenues of entry. It is mentioned that one of the saints said to Iblis: "Show me how you overcome the son of Adam." He replied: "I seize him during anger and during passion." It is narrated that Iblis appeared to a monk, and the monk said to him: "Which of the traits of the children of Adam is most helpful to you?" He said: "Quick temper, for when a servant is quick-tempered, we turn him over as children turn over a ball." It is said that Satan says: "How can the son of Adam overcome me? When he is pleased, I come until I am in his heart, and when he is angry, I fly until I am in his head." Among his great doors are envy and greed. Whenever a servant is greedy for everything, his greed blinds him and deafens him, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Your love for something blinds and deafens." The light of insight is what recognizes the avenues of Satan. When the veil of envy and greed is present, he does not see, and then Satan finds an opportunity and makes everything that leads to his desire appear good to the greedy one, even if it is reprehensible and obscene. It is narrated that Noah, peace be upon him, when he boarded the Ark, carried in it two of every kind, as God, exalted is He, commanded him. He saw an old man in the Ark whom he did not recognize and said to him: "What brought you in?" He replied: "I entered to capture the hearts of your companions, so that their hearts would be with me and their bodies with you." Noah said to him: "Get out of it, O enemy of God, for you are indeed a source of affliction." Iblis said to him: "Five things destroy people, and I will tell you of three of them, but I will not tell you of two." Then God, exalted is He, revealed to Noah that he had no need for the three; let him tell him of the two. Noah said to him: "What are the two?" He replied: "They are the two about which you will not find me lying; they are the two with which I do not fail to destroy people: greed and envy. Through envy I was cursed and made a rejected devil. As for greed, Adam was permitted all of Paradise except the tree, and I attained my need from him through greed." Among his great doors is satiety from food, even if it is lawful and pure, for satiety strengthens desires, and desires are the weapons of Satan. It is narrated that Iblis appeared to Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon them, and he saw upon him pendants of every kind. He said to him: "O Iblis, what are these pendants?" He said: "These are the desires with which I seize the son of Adam." He said: "Is there anything among them for me?" He said: "Perhaps you eat your fill and I make you too heavy for prayer and remembrance." He said: "Is there anything else?" He said: "No." He said: "By God, I shall never fill my stomach with food." Iblis said to him: "And by God, I shall never advise a Muslim." It is said concerning excessive eating that it has six blameworthy traits: The first is that it removes the fear of God from his heart. The second is that it removes mercy for creation from his heart, for he thinks they are all satiated. The third is that it makes him too heavy for obedience. The fourth is that when he hears words of wisdom, he finds no tenderness for it. The fifth is that when he speaks admonition and wisdom, it does not settle in the hearts of people. The sixth is that it stirs up diseases within him. Among his doors is love of adornment in furnishings, clothes, and dwellings, for when Satan sees that dominating a person's heart, he lays eggs in it and hatches them, and he does not cease calling him to building up the dwelling, adorning its ceilings and walls, expanding its structures, and calling him to adornment with clothes and mounts, enslaving him to them for his entire life. If he entraps him in that, he has no need to return to him again, for some of that leads him to more, and he does not cease leading him from one thing to another until his appointed time is driven to him and he dies while on that path.

Satan and following base desires, and one fears from that the evil outcome of disbelief—we seek refuge in God from it and from its great gateways. Among its great gateways is greed for people, for when greed overcomes the heart, Satan ceaselessly makes pretension and adornment appealing to one, toward those from whom something is desired, through various forms of hypocrisy and deception, until the object of greed becomes as if an idol. Thus, one constantly schemes to win favor and affection toward them, entering every avenue to achieve that. At the very least, this involves praising them for what is not in them and flattering them by abandoning enjoining good and forbidding evil. It is narrated that Safwan ibn Salim said: Iblis appeared to ‘Abdullah ibn Hanzhalah and said to him, “O son of Hanzhalah, preserve something I will teach you.” He replied, “I have no need for it.” Iblis said, “Look, if it is good you take it, and if it is evil you reject it. O son of Hanzhalah, do not ask anyone but God with a request of desire. And observe how you are when angry, for I possess you when you are angry.” Among its great gateways is haste and abandoning careful consideration in matters. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Haste is from Satan, and deliberation is from God, the Exalted.” The Almighty said, “Man was created of haste,” and He said, “And man is ever hasty.” And He said to His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, “And do not hasten with the Qur’an before its revelation to you is completed.” This is because actions should follow insight and knowledge, and insight requires contemplation and deliberation, while haste prevents that. In hastiness, Satan promotes his evil upon a person from where they do not realize. It is narrated that when Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, was born, the devils came to Iblis and said, “The idols have been cast down, their heads lowered.” He said, “This is an event; stay in your places.” Then he flew until he reached the two extremities of the earth but found nothing. Then he found Jesus, peace be upon him, had been born, with angels encircling him. He returned to them and said, “A prophet was born last night. No female ever conceived or gave birth but that I was present, except this one. So despair of idols being worshiped after this night. But approach the children of Adam through haste and frivolity.” Among its great gateways are dirhams, dinars, and all other kinds of wealth, such as goods, livestock, and property. For whatever exceeds the measure of sustenance and need is a dwelling place for Satan. Whoever possesses his sustenance has an empty heart. If, for example, he found a hundred dinars on the road, desires would surge from his heart, each desire requiring another hundred dinars, so what he found would not suffice him; rather, he would need nine hundred more. Before finding the hundred, he was content, but now that he has found a hundred, he thinks he has become wealthy by it, yet he has become in need of nine hundred to buy a house to furnish, a slave-girl, household furnishings, luxurious garments, and each of those things demands something else suitable for it, and that has no end. Thus, he falls into an abyss whose end is the depth of Hell, and it has no end but that. Thabit al-Bunani said: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was sent, Iblis said to his devils, “Indeed, an event has occurred; see what it is.” They went until they grew weary, then came and said, “We do not know.” He said, “I will bring you the news.” He went and then came and said, “God has sent Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.” Then he began sending his devils to the companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, but they would return disappointed, saying, “We have never accompanied a people like these; we gain nothing from them, then they rise for their prayer and it erases that.” Iblis said to them, “Be patient with them; perhaps God will open the world to them, and then we will gain from them what we need.” It is narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, one day rested his head upon a stone. Iblis passed by him and said, “O Jesus, you have desired the world.” Jesus, peace be upon him, took it and threw it from under his head, saying, “This is for you along with the world.” In truth, whoever possesses a stone to rest his head upon when sleeping has possessed from the world what can become a tool for Satan against him. For example, one who stands at night for prayer, whenever there is a stone near him that he can rest his head upon, it incessantly calls him to sleep and to rest upon it. Were it not for that, it would not cross his mind, nor would his desire for sleep be stirred. This is regarding a stone, so what of one who possesses soft beds, comfortable furnishings, and pleasant retreats? When will he be energized for the worship of God, the Exalted? Among its great gateways is stinginess and fear of poverty, for that is what prevents spending and charity and calls to hoarding and amassing wealth, and the painful punishment that is promised for those who amass wealth in rivalry, as the Noble Qur’an has declared. Khaythamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: Satan says, “If I am overcome by a son of Adam, he will not overcome me in three things: I command him to take wealth unlawfully, spend it unlawfully, and withhold it from its rightful due.” Sufyan said...

Satan possesses a weapon like the fear of poverty. When this is accepted from him, he seizes upon falsehood and obstructs the truth, speaking from desire and harboring evil suspicions about his Lord. Among the afflictions of miserliness is the greed to frequent marketplaces to amass wealth, and marketplaces are the nesting places of devils. Abu Umamah reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When Iblis was sent down to earth, he said, 'O Lord, You have sent me down to earth and made me accursed, so grant me a house.' He said, 'The dovecote.' He said, 'Grant me a gathering place.' He said, 'The marketplaces and crossroads.' He said, 'Grant me food.' He said, 'Your food is that over which the name of God has not been mentioned.' He said, 'Grant me drink.' He said, 'Every intoxicant.' He said, 'Grant me a caller to prayer.' He said, 'The reed pipes.' He said, 'Grant me a recitation.' He said, 'Poetry.' He said, 'Grant me a scripture.' He said, 'Tattooing.' He said, 'Grant me discourse.' He said, 'Falsehood.' He said, 'Grant me snares.' He said, 'Women.'"

Among his great gateways is partisanship for schools of thought, desires, harboring malice against opponents, and viewing them with contempt and disdain. This is something that destroys both the devout and the wicked alike. For disparaging people and busying oneself with mentioning their faults is a trait ingrained in the nature from the bestial qualities. When Satan deludes him into believing that this is the truth, and it conforms to his nature, its sweetness overcomes his heart, so he engages in it with all his zeal, rejoicing and pleased, thinking he is striving in religion while he is striving in following the devils. Thus you see one of them showing partisanship for Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, while he consumes the unlawful, is loose-tongued with superfluities and falsehood, and indulges in various forms of corruption. If Abu Bakr were to see him, he would be his first enemy, for the allies of Abu Bakr are those who take his path, follow his conduct, and guard what is between his jaws. It was from his conduct, may God be pleased with him, that he would place a pebble in his mouth to restrain his tongue from speaking about what does not concern him. So how can this meddler claim allegiance to him and love for him without following his conduct? And you see another meddler showing partisanship for Ali, may God be pleased with him. It was from the asceticism and conduct of Ali that during his caliphate he wore a garment he bought for three dirhams and cut the ends of the sleeves to the wrists. Yet we see the immoral person wearing silk garments and adorning himself with wealth acquired unlawfully, while he claims love for Ali, may God be pleased with him, and professes it, though he will be among his foremost adversaries on the Day of Resurrection. I wonder, if someone took a beloved child of a man, the apple of his eye and the life of his heart, and began to beat him, tear him apart, pluck his hair, and cut him with shears, all the while claiming love and allegiance to his father, what would his standing be with him? It is known that religion and the Sacred Law were more beloved to Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, and the rest of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, than family and children, indeed more than their own selves. Those who plunge into violations of the Sacred Law are the ones who tear the Sacred Law apart and cut it with the shears of desires, and with it they befriend the enemy of God, Iblis, and the enemy of His allies. So consider what their state will be on the Day of Resurrection before the Companions and before the allies of God Almighty. Nay, if the veil were lifted and these people knew what the Companions love for the community of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, they would be ashamed to let their tongues mention them alongside the ugliness of their deeds.

Then Satan deludes them into believing that whoever dies loving Abu Bakr and Umar, the Fire will not circle around him, and he deludes the other that if he dies loving Ali, he will have no fear. Yet this is the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saying to Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, who is a part of him: "Work, for I cannot avail you anything against God." This is an example we have presented from the category of desires, and such is the ruling regarding the partisans of al-Shafi'i, Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ahmad, and others among the Imams. Whoever claims the school of an Imam while not following his conduct, that Imam will be his adversary on the Day of Resurrection, saying to him: "My school was action, not mere speech with the tongue. Speech with the tongue was for the sake of action, not for the sake of babbling. So why did you oppose me in action and conduct, which is my school and my path that I traversed and by which I went to God Almighty? Then you falsely claimed my school." This is a great entrance among the entrances of Satan, by which he has destroyed most of the world. The schools have been entrusted to people in whom the fear of God is little, their insight in religion is weak, their desire for the world is strong, and their eagerness to gain followers is intense. They could not achieve followership and establish prestige except through partisanship, so they imprisoned that in their breasts and did not alert them to Satan's stratagems therein. Rather, they acted on behalf of Satan in executing his scheme, so people persisted upon it and forgot the fundamentals of their religion. Thus they have perished and caused others to perish. May God Almighty grant us and them repentance.

Al-Hasan reported: It reached us that Iblis said: "I made sins appear enticing to the community of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and they broke my back with seeking forgiveness. So I made sins enticing to them for which they do not seek forgiveness."

From these, God the Exalted is free—namely, the caprices—and the accursed one has spoken truly, for they do not know that this is among the causes that lead to sins, so how could they seek forgiveness for it? Among the great stratagems of Satan is that he distracts a person from himself through the disagreements occurring among people concerning schools of thought and disputes. ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: “A group of people sat remembering God the Exalted, so Satan came to them to make them rise from their gathering and scatter them, but he was unable. Then he came to another group conversing about worldly matters, and he sowed discord among them until they stood up fighting one another—though it was not them he intended. Then those who were remembering God the Exalted rose and busied themselves with them, separating them, and so they dispersed from their gathering. That was what Satan desired from them.” Among his gateways is inciting the common folk, who have not practiced knowledge nor delved deeply into it, to reflect upon the essence of God the Exalted and His attributes, and upon matters that their intellects cannot reach, until he makes them doubt the very foundation of religion or causes illusions about God the Exalted—far exalted is He above what they ascribe—to occur to them, so that one of them becomes a disbeliever or an innovator, while Satan is joyful, delighted, and exulting at what has settled in his heart. He imagines that to be knowledge and insight, and that it has been unveiled to him due to his cleverness and superior intellect. Thus, the most foolish of people is the one strongest in confidence in his own intellect, and the soundest of people in intellect is the one most severe in accusing himself and the most frequent in asking the scholars. ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Indeed, Satan comes to one of you and says, ‘Who created you?’ So he says, ‘God, Blessed and Exalted.’ Then he says, ‘So who created God?’ If any of you experiences that, let him say, ‘I believe in God and His Messenger,’ for that will dispel it from him.” The narration from ‘Ā’ishah is that Satan comes to one of you and says, “Who created you?” and he says, “God…” The hadith was transmitted by Aḥmad, al-Bazzār, and Abū Ya‘lā in their Musnads, and its narrators are trustworthy. It is agreed upon from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not command investigating a remedy for this whispering, for this is a whispering that the common folk experience, not the scholars. The duty of the common folk is to believe, submit, occupy themselves with their worship and livelihoods, and leave knowledge to the scholars. For if a common person were to fornicate and steal, it would be better for him than to speak about knowledge, for whoever speaks about God and His religion without mastering knowledge falls into disbelief without realizing it, like one who plunges into the depths of the sea while not knowing how to swim. The snares of Satan concerning beliefs and schools of thought are innumerable; we have only intended by what we have mentioned to provide an example. Among his gateways is having evil suspicions about Muslims. God the Exalted said: “O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, for indeed some suspicion is sin.” Whoever judges evil about another based on suspicion, Satan prompts him to lengthen his tongue in backbiting, so he is ruined, or to fall short in fulfilling his rights, or to be negligent in honoring him, and to look at him with an eye of contempt, seeing himself as better than him—all of that is among the destructive matters. For that reason, the Sacred Law prohibited exposing oneself to suspicions. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Beware of places of suspicion,” to the extent that he himself, peace and blessings be upon him, was cautious of it. It is narrated from ‘Alī ibn Ḥusayn that Ṣafiyyah bint Ḥuyayy ibn Akhṭab informed him that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was in retreat in the mosque. She said: “I came to him and conversed with him. When evening came, I departed, and he stood to walk with me. Two men from the Anṣār passed by, greeted him, and then went on. He called them and said, ‘She is Ṣafiyyah bint Ḥuyayy.’ They said, ‘O Messenger of God, we think nothing but good of you.’ He said, ‘Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like blood flows in the body, and I feared that he might cast something into your hearts.’” See how he, peace and blessings be upon him, showed compassion for their religion and guarded them, and how he showed compassion for his community by teaching them the way of caution from suspicion, so that the pious scholar known for his religiosity in his states does not become negligent and say, “One like me is only thought good of,” out of admiration for himself. For the most pious, God-fearing, and knowledgeable of people are not viewed by everyone with a single eye; rather, some look at them with an eye of approval and some with an eye of displeasure. Therefore, the poet said: “The eye of approval is blind to every fault, but the eye of displeasure reveals the defects.” One must be cautious of evil suspicion and the suspicion of the wicked, for the wicked think nothing but evil of all people. Whenever you see a person who thinks ill of people, seeking out faults, know that his inner self is corrupt and that his corruption exudes from him; he sees others only from his own perspective. For the believer seeks excuses, and the hypocrite seeks faults. The believer is sound of heart toward all creation. These are some of Satan’s entrances to the heart. If I wished to enumerate all of them, I would not be able. In this amount, there is what alerts to the rest. There is no blameworthy trait in a human being except that it is a weapon of Satan and an entrance among his entrances. If you ask, “What is the remedy?”

In repelling Satan, and whether the remembrance of God Almighty and a person's utterance of "There is no power nor strength except by God" suffices for that, know that the treatment of the heart in this matter is to block these entrances by purifying the heart of these blameworthy traits. This is something whose discussion would be lengthy. Our aim in this quarter of the book is to explain the treatment of the destructive traits, and each trait requires a separate book, as will be explained later. Indeed, when the roots of these traits are severed from the heart, Satan will have passages and fleeting thoughts into the heart, but will have no settled abode. What prevents him from passing through is the remembrance of God Almighty, for the reality of remembrance does not become firmly established in the heart except after building the heart with God-consciousness and purifying it from blameworthy traits. Otherwise, the remembrance becomes a mere whisper of the soul, having no authority over the heart, and thus does not repel the authority of Satan. For this reason, God Almighty said: "Indeed, those who are conscious of God—when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight." He specified the God-conscious with that. The likeness of Satan is that of a hungry dog that draws near to you. If you have no bread or meat before you, it is repelled by your saying to it, "Be gone!" The mere sound drives it away. But if you have meat before you and it is hungry, it will pounce upon the meat and is not repelled by mere words. So the heart empty of Satan's sustenance is repelled from by mere remembrance. As for when desire overpowers the heart, it pushes the reality of remembrance to the peripheries of the heart, so it does not reach its core, and Satan settles in the heart's core. As for the hearts of the God-conscious, empty of caprice and blameworthy traits, Satan approaches them not for desires, but because they are empty due to heedlessness of remembrance. When they return to remembrance, Satan slinks away. The proof for this is His saying: "So seek refuge with God from the accursed Satan," and all the other reports and verses concerning remembrance. Abu Hurairah said: The satan of the believer and the satan of the disbeliever met. The satan of the disbeliever was sleek, fat, and well-groomed, while the satan of the believer was emaciated, disheveled, dusty, and naked. The satan of the disbeliever said to the satan of the believer, "Why are you so emaciated?" He said, "I am with a man who, when he eats, mentions God's name, so I remain hungry; when he drinks, he mentions God's name, so I remain thirsty; when he dresses, he mentions God's name, so I remain naked; when he anoints himself, he mentions God's name, so I remain disheveled." The other said, "But I am with a man who does none of that, so I share in his food, drink, and clothing." Muhammad ibn Wasīʿ used to say every day after the dawn prayer: "O God, You have given authority over us an enemy who is keenly aware of our faults, who sees us—he and his tribe—from where we do not see them. O God, make him despair of us as You have made him despair of Your mercy, make him hopeless of us as You have made him hopeless of Your pardon, and distance between us and him as You have distanced between him and Your mercy, for You have power over all things." He said: Then Iblis appeared to him one day on the way to the mosque and said, "O son of Wasīʿ, do you know me?" He said, "And who are you?" He said, "I am Iblis." He said, "What do you want?" He said, "I want you not to teach anyone this supplication for refuge, and I will not approach you." He said, "By God, I will not withhold it from anyone who wants it, so do as you wish." And from ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Laylā, he said: A satan used to come to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, with a flame of fire in his hand, and would stand before him while he was praying. He would recite and seek refuge, but it would not go away. Then Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to him and said, "Say: 'I seek refuge in the perfect words of God, which no righteous or wicked person can surpass, from the evil of what enters the earth and what emerges from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein, and from the trials of night and day, and from every visitor of night and day, except a visitor who comes with good, O Most Merciful.'" So he said that, and its flame was extinguished, and it fell on its face. And al-Ḥasan said: I was informed that Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "Indeed, a powerful one from the jinn is plotting against you. So when you retire to your bed, recite the Verse of the Throne." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Satan came to me and wrestled with me, then wrestled with me again. I seized him by his throat, and by the One who sent me with the truth, I did not release him until I felt the coolness of his tongue's water on my hand. Were it not for the supplication of my brother Solomon, peace be upon him, he would have been left bound in the mosque." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "ʿUmar did not take a path except that Satan took a path other than the one ʿUmar took." This is because the hearts were purified from Satan's pasture and his strength, which are the desires. Therefore, if you hope that Satan will be repelled from you by mere remembrance as he was repelled from ʿUmar, may God be pleased with him, it is impossible. You would be like one who hopes to drink medicine before preparing the body and while the stomach is occupied with coarse foods, and hopes it will benefit him as it benefited the one who drank it after preparing the body and emptying the stomach. Remembrance is the medicine, and God-consciousness is the preparation; it empties the heart of desires. So when remembrance descends upon a heart empty of all but remembrance, Satan is repelled, just as an ailment is repelled by the descent of medicine into a stomach empty of food. He said—

Indeed, in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart. And God Almighty has decreed: "Whoever takes him as an ally—He will mislead him and guide him to the punishment of the Blaze." And whoever aids Satan through his actions is his ally, even if he remembers God with his tongue. And though you may say that a hadith has come unrestricted, stating that remembrance repels Satan, you have not understood that most of the general principles of the Sacred Law are specified by conditions transmitted by the scholars of religion. So look to yourself, for a report is not like eyewitnessing. And reflect that the ultimate of your remembrance and worship is the prayer. Therefore, observe your heart when you are in your prayer—how Satan pulls it towards the marketplaces, the accounting of the worlds, and the replies to the disputants, and how he takes you through the valleys of the world and its perils, until you do not remember what you had forgotten of the vanities of the world except in your prayer, and Satan does not crowd upon your heart except when you pray. For prayer is the crucible of hearts; through it their virtues and vices become apparent. Thus, prayer is not accepted from hearts laden with worldly desires. No wonder Satan is not repelled from you; rather, perhaps the whisperings increase upon you, just as medicine before taking precautions may increase the harm upon you. If you desire deliverance from Satan, then precede with the precaution of God-consciousness, then follow it with the medicine of remembrance; Satan will flee from you as he fled from 'Umar, may God be pleased with him. For that reason, Wahb ibn Munabbih said: "Be conscious of God and do not revile Satan openly while you are his friend in secret"—meaning you are obedient to him. And some said: "How astonishing is one who disobeys the Benefactor after knowing His beneficence, and obeys the accursed one after knowing his rebellion." And just as God Almighty has said: "Call upon Me; I will respond to you," and you call upon Him but He does not respond to you, likewise you remember God but Satan does not flee from you due to the absence of the conditions of remembrance and supplication. It was said to Ibrahim ibn Adham: "Why is it that we supplicate but it is not answered for us, when He Almighty has said: 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you'?" He said: "Because your hearts are dead." It was said: "And what has killed them?" He said: "Eight traits: You recognized the right of God but did not fulfill it; you recited the Quran but did not act by its limits; you said we love the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, but did not act by his Sunnah; you said we fear death but did not prepare for it; and He Almighty said: 'Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy,' yet you agreed with him in sins; you said we fear the Fire but burdened your bodies in it; you said we love Paradise but did not work for it; and when you rose from your beds, you cast your faults behind your backs and spread the faults of others before you, thus angering your Lord—so how should He respond to you?" If you say: "Is the caller to various sins a single Satan or different Satans?" Then know that you have no need to know that in your dealings; occupy yourself with repelling the enemy and do not ask about his description. All vegetables come from where they are brought, and do not ask about the vegetable garden. But what becomes clear by the light of insight in the evidences of the reports is that they are marshalled troops, and that for every type of sin there is a Satan specific to it who calls to it. As for the path of insight, its mention is lengthy, and what we have mentioned suffices you: that the difference in effects indicates a difference in causes, as we mentioned regarding the light of fire and the blackness of smoke. As for the reports, Mujahid said: "Iblis has five sons; he has placed each one of them over an aspect of his affair: Thabir, al-A'war, Mabsut, Dasim, and Zalanbur. As for Thabir, he is the companion of calamities who commands wailing, tearing garments, slapping cheeks, and the claims of ignorance. As for al-A'war, he is the companion of fornication who commands it and beautifies it. As for Mabsut, he is the companion of falsehood. As for Dasim, he enters with a man to his family, casting faults upon them in his sight and angering him against them. As for Zalanbur, he is the companion of the marketplace; because of him they are ever in mutual complaint." And the Satan of prayer is named Khanzab, and the Satan of ablution is named al-Walhan. Many reports have come regarding that. And just as the Satans are numerous, so too are the angels. We have mentioned in the Book of Gratitude the secret behind the multitude of angels and the specialization of each one of them with a distinct work. And Abu Umamah al-Bahili reported that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Each believer is attended by one hundred and sixty angels who ward off from him what he cannot manage. From that, for the sight are seven angels who ward off from it as flies are warded off from a bowl of honey on a hot day. And if it were unveiled to you, you would see on every plain and mountain every one of them with his hand outstretched and his mouth agape. And if the servant were left to himself for the blink of an eye, the Satans would snatch him away." And Ayyub ibn Yunus ibn Yazid reported: "It has reached us that from the children of humans are born children of the jinn, then they grow up with them." And Jabir ibn 'Abdullah reported that when Adam, peace be upon him, descended to the earth, he said: "O Lord, this is the one between whom and me You have placed enmity. If You do not aid me against him, I cannot prevail over him." He said: "No child will be born to you except that one is appointed over him."

A king said, "O Lord, increase me." He said, "I recompense an evil deed with one like it, and a good deed with ten times its like, up to what I will." He said, "Lord, increase me." He said, "The gate of repentance is open as long as the spirit is in the body." Satan said, "O Lord, this servant whom You have honored over me, if You do not aid me against him, I have no power over him." He said, "No child is born to him except that a child is born for you." He said, "O Lord, increase me." He said, "You flow among them like blood, and you take their breasts as homes." He said, "Lord, increase me." He said, "I will send against them My horsemen and My foot soldiers," up to His saying, "deception."

And from Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God created the jinn in three kinds: a kind of snakes, scorpions, and creeping things of the earth; a kind like the wind in the air; and a kind upon whom is reward and punishment. And God, exalted is He, created humankind in three kinds: a kind like cattle, as He, exalted is He, said: 'They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like cattle; nay, they are more astray.' And a kind whose bodies are the bodies of the children of Adam, but their spirits are the spirits of devils. And a kind who will be in the shade of God, exalted is He, on the Day of Resurrection, the day when there is no shade except His shade."

And Wahb ibn al-Ward said: It reached us that Iblis appeared to Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon them both, and said, "I wish to advise you." He said, "I have no need for your advice, but inform me about the children of Adam." He said, "They are, in our view, of three kinds. As for one kind among them—and they are the most severe of the kinds upon us—we attend to one of them until we tempt him and gain mastery over him, then he flees to seeking forgiveness and repentance, and it ruins for us everything we had attained from him. Then we return to him, and he returns [to sin], so we neither despair of him nor do we attain from him what we need. Thus, we are in distress concerning him. As for the other kind, they are in our hands like a ball in the hands of your children; we turn them however we wish. They have spared us [the effort of subduing] themselves. As for the third kind, they are like you, protected; we have no power over them at all."

If it is said: How does the devil appear to some people and not others? And if one sees a form, is it his true form, or is it an image he assumes for him? If it is his true form, how is he seen in different forms, and how is he seen at one time in two places and in two forms, such that two people see him in two different forms? Then know that the angel and the devil have two forms which are the reality of their forms, and the reality of their forms is not perceived by sight except by the lights of prophethood. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, only saw Gabriel, peace be upon him, in his [true] form twice. That is because he asked him to show himself in his form, so he appointed a meeting at al-Baqi' and appeared to him at Hira', filling the horizon from east to west. And he saw him another time in his form on the Night of the Ascension at the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary. He would mostly see him in human form. He would see him in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, and he was a man of handsome face.

Mostly, he discloses himself to the people of spiritual unveiling from the possessors of hearts through an image of his form. Thus, the devil appears to him while awake, and he sees him with his eye and hears his speech with his ear. That takes the place of the reality of his form, just as he is unveiled in dreams to most of the righteous. The one who experiences unveiling while awake is he who has reached a rank where the occupation of the senses with the world does not prevent him from the unveiling that occurs in dreams. Thus, he sees while awake what others see in dreams.

As is narrated from 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy on him, that a man asked his Lord to show him the place of the devil in the heart of a son of Adam. He saw in a dream the body of a man like crystal, seeing its inside from its outside, and he saw the devil in the form of a frog sitting on his left shoulder, between his shoulder and his ear, with a long, thin snout which he had inserted from his left shoulder into his heart, whispering to him. When he remembered God, exalted is He, he would shrink back. The like of this may be witnessed with the eye while awake. Indeed, one of those granted unveiling saw him in the form of a dog crouching on a carcass, calling people to it—and the carcass was a symbol of the world. This proceeds in the manner of witnessing his true form.

For the heart must inevitably manifest a reality from the aspect that faces the world of the dominion. At that point, its trace shines upon its face that faces the world of sovereignty and the visible realm, for one is connected to the other. We have clarified that the heart has two faces: a face toward the unseen world, which is the entry point of inspiration and revelation, and a face toward the visible world. That which appears from it on the face adjacent to the side of the visible world can only be an imagined form, because the entire visible world is imaginings. However, imagination sometimes arises from looking at the outward aspect of the visible world through the senses. Thus, it is possible that the form does not correspond to the inner meaning, such that one sees a person beautiful in form while he is vile in inner nature, ugly in secret, because the visible world is a world of much deception. As for the form that arises in the imagination from the shining of the world of the dominion upon the inner secret of hearts, it does not...

It can only be an imitation of the attribute and in conformity with it, for Satan appears in the form of a dog and a frog in conformity with the attribute. Thus, inevitably, the ugly meaning is only seen in an ugly form, so Satan is seen in the form of a dog, frog, pig, and the like, while the angel is seen in a beautiful form. That form becomes the title of the meanings and imitates them truthfully. Therefore, the monkey and pig in a dream indicate a wicked person, and the sheep indicates a person with a sound heart, and so on for all the chapters of visions and their interpretation. These are wondrous secrets, among the secrets of the heart's marvels, and it is not fitting to mention them in the science of spiritual conduct. The intended purpose is only that you believe truly that Satan is unveiled to the possessors of hearts, and likewise the angel, sometimes by way of representation and imitation—as occurs in dreams—and sometimes by way of reality. The more common is representation through a form imitating the meaning; it is an example of the meaning, not the essence of the meaning, except that it is witnessed with the eye as a verified witnessing, and the one granted spiritual unveiling alone witnesses it, unlike those around him, like the sleeper.

Clarification of what the servant is held accountable for from the whisperings of the hearts, their thoughts, their impulses, and their intentions, and what is pardoned and not held accountable for.

Know that this is an obscure matter, and contradictory verses and reports have come regarding it. The way to reconcile them is perplexing except for the seasoned scholars of the Sacred Law. It has been narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "My nation has been pardoned for what their souls whisper to them, as long as they do not speak it or act upon it." And Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Allah the Exalted says to the recording angels: 'If My servant intends a bad deed, do not record it. If he does it, then record it as one bad deed. If he intends a good deed but does not do it, record it as one good deed. If he does it, then record it as ten.'" Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded it in their Sahih collections. This is evidence for the pardon regarding the heart's action and its intention towards a bad deed. In another wording: "Whoever intends a good deed but does not do it, one good deed is written for him. Whoever intends a good deed and does it, it is written for him up to seven hundredfold. Whoever intends a bad deed but does not do it, it is not written against him. If he does it, it is written." And in another wording: "And if he considers doing a bad deed, I forgive it for him as long as he does not do it." All of this indicates pardon. As for what indicates accountability, there is His saying, exalted is He: "Whether you show what is in your souls or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills," and His saying, exalted is He: "And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight, and the heart—all of those will be questioned." This indicates that the action of the heart is like the action of hearing and sight, and is not pardoned. And His saying, exalted is He: "And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it—his heart is sinful," and His saying, exalted is He: "Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for what your hearts have earned." The truth in our view regarding this issue cannot be ascertained without encompassing the details of the heart's actions from the beginning of their appearance until the action manifests upon the limbs. We say: The first thing that occurs to the heart is the fleeting thought (khātir), as if, for example, the image of a woman occurs to it, and that she is behind him on the road—if he turned to her, he would see her. The second is the stirring of desire to look, which is the movement of appetite in the natural disposition. This is generated from the first fleeting thought, and we call it the inclination of the natural disposition. The first is called the whisper of the soul (hadīth al-nafs). The third is the heart's judgment that this ought to be done, meaning he ought to look at her. For when the natural disposition inclines, resolve and intention do not arise unless the deterrents are removed. He might be prevented by shyness or fear from turning. The absence of these deterrents might be due to contemplation. In any case, it is a judgment from the side of the intellect, and this is called belief (iʿtiqād), and it follows the fleeting thought and the inclination. The fourth is the determination to turn and the firm resolve of intention therein. This we call actual resolve (hamm) and intention and purpose. This resolve may have a weak beginning, but if the heart inclines to the first fleeting thought until its attraction for the soul becomes prolonged, this resolve becomes confirmed and becomes a decisive will (irādah). If the will becomes decisive, perhaps regret occurs after the decision, and he abandons the action. Perhaps he is distracted by an occurrence, so he does not act upon it and does not turn to it. Perhaps an obstacle hinders him, so the action becomes impossible for him. Here, then, are four states of the heart before action with the limb: the fleeting thought, which is the whisper of the soul; then the inclination; then the belief; then the resolve. We say: As for the fleeting thought, one is not held accountable for it because it does not fall under free choice. Likewise, the inclination and the stirring of appetite, because they also do not fall under free choice. These two are what is intended by his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "My nation has been pardoned for what their souls whisper to them." For "whisper of the soul" is an expression for the fleeting thoughts that occur to the soul and are not followed by a resolve to act. As for resolve and determination, it is not called "whisper of the soul." Rather, the whisper of the soul, as narrated from 'Uthman...

Ibn Ma'zun said to the Prophet, peace be upon him, "O Messenger of God, my soul suggests to me that I divorce Khawlah." He said, "Gently. Marriage is from my tradition." He said, "My soul suggests to me that I castrate myself." He said, "Gently. The monasticism of my community is constant fasting." He said, "My soul suggests to me that I become a monk." He said, "Gently. The monasticism of my community is jihad and pilgrimage." He said, "My soul suggests to me that I abandon meat." He said, "Gently, for I love it. If I found it, I would eat it, and if I asked God, He would feed it to me." These are the thoughts that are not accompanied by a firm resolve to act; this is the whispering of the soul. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was consulted, as there was no firm resolve with him, nor an intention to act.

As for the third type, which is the belief and conviction of the heart that something should be done, this is a hesitation between being compelled or chosen, and the states differ in this. The chosen part of it is held accountable, while the compelled is not. As for the fourth, which is the intention to act, one is held accountable for it. However, if one does not act, then consider: if he abandoned it out of fear of God, the Exalted, and remorse for his intention, a good deed is recorded for him, because his intention was an evil deed, and his abstention and struggle against his soul are a good deed. An intention in accordance with one's base nature indicates complete heedlessness of God, the Exalted, while abstention through struggle against one's nature requires great strength. His striving in opposing his nature is an act for God, the Exalted, and acting for God is more intense than his striving in following Satan by following his nature. Thus, a good deed is recorded for him because his striving in abstention and his intention for it outweighed his intention to act. If the action is prevented by an obstacle or he leaves it for an excuse, not out of fear of God, an evil deed is recorded against him, for his intention to act is a choice from the heart.

The proof for this detailed explanation is what is authentically narrated in the wording of the hadith: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The angels, peace be upon them, said, 'O Lord, this servant of Yours intends to commit an evil deed, and You are more knowing of him.' He said, 'Observe him. If he commits it, write it for him as its like. If he abandons it, write it for him as a good deed, for he abandoned it only for My sake.'" Where He said, "If he does not do it," He meant abandoning it for God. As for when one resolves upon an abomination and it is prevented by a cause or heedlessness, how can a good deed be recorded for him? He, peace be upon him, said, "People will only be resurrected according to their intentions." We know that whoever resolves at night to wake up and kill a Muslim or fornicate with a woman, and dies that night, dies persisting and will be resurrected according to his intention. He intended an evil deed but did not do it. The decisive proof in this is what is narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said, "When two Muslims meet with their swords, both the killer and the killed are in the Fire." It was said, "O Messenger of God, this is the killer, but what about the killed?" He said, "Because he intended to kill his companion." This is a clear text that he became among the people of the Fire merely by the intention, even though he was killed unjustly. So how can one think that God does not hold one accountable for intention and resolve? Rather, every resolve that falls under the choice of the servant is held accountable for it, unless it is expiated by a good deed, and breaking the resolve with remorse is a good deed. For that reason, a good deed is recorded for him. As for the loss of the intended goal due to an obstacle, it is not a good deed.

As for the thoughts, the whispering of the soul, and the stirring of desire, all of that does not fall under choice. Holding accountable for it is a demand for what is beyond capacity. For this reason, when His saying, the Exalted, was revealed, "Whether you reveal what is in yourselves or conceal it, God will call you to account for it," some of the Companions came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, "We have been tasked with what we cannot bear. One of us thinks to himself what he would not like to be established in his heart, then is held accountable for it." He, peace be upon him, said, "Perhaps you say as the Jews said, 'We hear and disobey.' Say, 'We hear and obey.'" They said, "We hear and obey." Then God sent relief after a year with His saying, "God does not burden a soul beyond its capacity." Thus, it became clear that everything that does not fall within one's capacity from the actions of the heart is that for which one is not held accountable. This is the removal of the veil from this confusion.

Whoever thinks that everything that occurs to the heart is called the whispering of the soul and does not differentiate between these three categories will inevitably err. How can one not be held accountable for the actions of the heart, such as arrogance, pride, ostentation, hypocrisy, envy, and all the vile traits from the actions of the heart? Indeed, the hearing, the sight, and the heart—all of those will be questioned, meaning what falls under choice. If the sight falls without choice upon something not forbidden, one is not held accountable. If he follows it with a second look, he is held accountable because he chose. Likewise, the thoughts of the heart follow this course. Rather, the heart is more deserving of being held accountable, for it is the origin. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "God-consciousness is here," and he pointed to his heart. God, the Exalted, said, "Their flesh and their blood do not reach God, but your God-consciousness reaches Him." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Sin is what wavers in your heart."

The hearts... And righteousness is what brings tranquility to the heart, even if they give you legal rulings and give you rulings. Indeed, we say: when the heart of the one seeking a ruling judges something to be obligatory, even if he is mistaken in it, he becomes rewarded for it. Rather, whoever thought he had performed ablution, then he must pray. If he prays, then remembers he did not perform ablution, he has the reward for his action. If he remembers, then abandons it, he is punished for it. And whoever finds a woman on his bed and thinks she is his wife, he does not sin by having intercourse with her, even if she is a stranger. But if he thinks she is a stranger, then has intercourse with her, he sins by having intercourse with her, even if she is his wife. And all of that looks to the heart, not the limbs.

Clarification on whether whispering doubts can be conceived to cease entirely during remembrance or not.

Know that the scholars who observe the hearts and examine their attributes and wonders differed on this matter into five groups. One group said: The whispering ceases by the remembrance of God, Mighty and Majestic, because the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "So when he remembers God, it slinks away." And 'slinking away' is silence, so it is as if it becomes silent. Another group said: Its origin is not eliminated, but it flows in the heart without having an effect, because when the heart becomes fully occupied with remembrance, it is veiled from being affected by the whispering, like one preoccupied with his concern, for he may speak and not understand, even though the sound passes by his hearing. Another group said: The whispering does not cease, nor its effect, but its dominance over the heart ceases, so it is as if it whispers from afar and with weakness. Another group said: It ceases during remembrance for a moment, and remembrance ceases for a moment, and they alternate in close intervals; due to their closeness, one thinks they are concurrent. They are like a sphere with scattered dots; if you rotate it swiftly, you perceive them as connected in motion. These argued by the fact that 'slinking away' has been reported, and we witness whispering alongside remembrance, and there is no explanation for this except this. Another group said: The whispering and remembrance flow concurrently in continuity upon the heart, a concurrency that does not cease. Just as a person can see two things with his eyes in one state, so too the heart can be a conduit for two things. For the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "There is no servant except that he has four eyes: two eyes in his head with which he sees the matters of his worldly life, and two eyes in his heart with which he sees the matters of his religion." Al-Muhasibi inclined to this.

The correct position according to us is that all these schools are correct, but all are insufficient in encompassing the types of whispering. Rather, each one of them looked at only one type of whispering and informed about it. And whispering is of types.

The first is that which comes from the side of confusing with truth. For Satan may confuse with truth, saying to a person: "You abandon enjoyment of pleasures, for life is long, and abstaining from desires throughout a long life, its pain is immense." At this, when the servant remembers the immense right of God, Mighty and Majestic, and the immensity of His reward and punishment, and says to himself: "Abstaining from desires is severe, but enduring the Fire is more severe than it, and one of the two is inevitable." So when the servant remembers God's promise and threat, and renews his faith and certainty, Satan slinks away and flees, for he cannot say to him: "The Fire is easier than abstaining from sins," nor can he say: "Sin does not lead to the Fire," for his faith in the Book of God, Mighty and Majestic, repels him from that. Thus his whispering ceases. Similarly, he whispers to him with pride in his deed, saying: "What servant knows God as you know Him and worships Him as you worship Him? How great is your station with God, Mighty and Majestic!" Then the servant remembers at that time that his knowledge, his heart, his limbs with which he acts, and his understanding are all from the creation of God, Mighty and Majestic, so from where does he feel pride in it? Thus Satan slinks away, for he cannot say: "This is not from God," for knowledge and faith repel him. This is a type of whispering that ceases entirely for the knowers, those endowed with insight by the light of faith and knowledge.

The second type is that his whispering is by stirring up desire and inciting it. This divides into what the servant knows with certainty to be a sin, and into what he supposes with predominant assumption. If he knows it with certainty, Satan slinks away from incitement that would affect the stirring of desire, but he does not slink away from the incitement itself. If it is a matter of assumption, it may remain effective to the extent that one needs striving to repel it. Thus the whispering exists, but it is repelled, not dominant.

The third type is whispering by mere thoughts and remembering predominant states, and reflecting on matters other than prayer, for example. When he turns to remembrance, it is conceivable that it is repelled for a moment and returns, and is repelled and returns, so remembrance and whispering alternate. And it is conceivable that they flow concurrently together, until the comprehension encompasses understanding the meaning of the recitation and those thoughts, as if they are in two places of the heart. And it is very remote that this slinking away ceases entirely such that no thought occurs, but it is not impossible, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs without conversing with himself about anything from the matters of the world, his previous sins are forgiven." If it were not conceivable, he would not have mentioned it, except that it is not...

This can only be conceived of in a heart that has been so overpowered by love that it becomes as one heedless. For we indeed see that a person whose heart is consumed by an enemy who has harmed him may contemplate, for the duration of two or several prayer cycles, in disputing with his enemy, to the extent that nothing but the discourse of his enemy crosses his mind. Similarly, one who is utterly absorbed in love may contemplate, in his heart, conversing with his beloved and dive deep in thought such that nothing but the discourse of his beloved crosses his mind. If another were to speak to him, he would not hear, and if someone passed before him, it would be as if he did not see him. If this can be conceived of in the fear of an enemy and in the coveting of wealth and status, then how can it not be conceived of in the fear of the Fire and the coveting of Paradise? Yet, that is rare due to the weakness of faith in God, the Exalted, and the Last Day.

And if you contemplate the totality of these categories and the varieties of whisperings, you will know that for every school of thought there is a valid point in a specific context. In summary, deliverance from Satan for a moment or an hour is not far-fetched, but deliverance from him for a long lifetime is very far-fetched and impossible in existence. Even if someone were to be delivered from the whisperings of Satan through passing thoughts and the stirring of desire, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would have been delivered. Yet it has been narrated that he looked at the embroidered border of his garment during prayer, and when he concluded the prayer, he cast that garment aside and said, "It distracted me from the prayer." And he said, "Take this to Abu Jahm and bring me his *anbijaniyyah* (a plain garment)." And he had a gold ring on his hand, and he looked at it while on the pulpit, then cast it away, saying, "A glance at it and a glance at you." And that was due to the whispering of Satan, inciting the pleasure of looking at the gold ring and the embroidered border of the garment. That was before the prohibition of gold, which is why he wore it and then cast it away. Thus, the whisperings concerning the fleeting and tangible aspects of this world do not cease except by casting away and parting with them. For as long as one possesses something beyond his need, even a single dinar, Satan does not leave him alone in his prayer from whispering thoughts about his dinar: how to safeguard it, on what to spend it, how to conceal it so no one knows of it, and how to display it to boast with it, and other such whisperings. So whoever sinks his claws into this world and hopes to be delivered from Satan is like one who immerses himself in honey and thinks flies will not land on him—that is impossible. The world is a great door for the whisperings of Satan, and it is not one door but many doors. A sage among the wise said: Satan comes to the son of Adam from the direction of sins. If he resists, he comes to him from the direction of sincere advice until he casts him into innovation. If he refuses, he commands him to be overly scrupulous and strict until he prohibits what is not prohibited. If he refuses, he casts doubt upon his ablution and his prayer until he leads him out of knowledge. If he refuses, he makes acts of piety seem light to him until people see him as patient and chaste, so their hearts incline to him, and he becomes self-admiring, and by that he is destroyed. And at that point, his insistence intensifies, for it is the final degree, and he knows that if he passes beyond it, he will have escaped from him to Paradise.

**Explanation of the Swiftness of the Heart's Changes and the Division of Hearts in Inconstancy and Steadfastness**

Know that the heart, as we have mentioned, is surrounded by the attributes we described, and effects and states assail it from the doors we have depicted. It is as if it is a target constantly struck from every side. If something strikes it and it is affected by it, something opposing it strikes it from another side, so its state changes. If Satan descends upon it and calls it to caprice, an angel descends and turns it away from it. If one devil pulls it towards an evil, another devil pulls it towards another. If one angel pulls it towards a good, another pulls it towards another. At times it is contested between two angels, at times between two devils, and at times between an angel and a devil. It is never neglected. This is alluded to in His saying, the Exalted, "And We turn their hearts and their vision..." And due to the Messenger of God's, peace and blessings be upon him, insight into the wondrous work of God, the Exalted, in the marvels of the heart and its changes, he would swear by it, saying, "No, by the Turner of hearts." And he would often say, "O Turner of hearts, make my heart firm upon Your religion." They said, "Do you fear, O Messenger of God?" He said, "And what assures me? The heart is between two fingers of the fingers of the Most Merciful; He turns it as He wills." In another wording, "If He wills to establish it, He establishes it, and if He wills to make it deviate, He makes it deviate." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, gave three examples for it. He said, "The example of the heart is like a sparrow, turning about every hour." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The example of the heart in its changes is like a cooking pot when it reaches a full boil." And he said, "The example of the heart is like a feather in a desolate land, which the wind turns over and over." These changes and the wonders of God's work, the Exalted, in their turning from a direction which knowledge does not guide to, are not known except by those who are vigilant and observant of their states with God, the Exalted. And hearts, in steadfastness upon good or evil and in vacillation between them, are of three kinds: a heart made prosperous by God-consciousness, purified by spiritual discipline, and cleansed of the foulness of character, in which sparks of good thoughts ignite from the treasuries of the Unseen and the entrances of the Sovereign Realm, so it turns...

The intellect turns to contemplate what occurs to it, in order to recognize the subtleties of the good within it and become aware of the secrets of its benefits. Thus, its aspect is unveiled to him by the light of insight, and he judges that it must be done, so he urges himself to it and calls himself to act upon it. The angel looks upon the heart and finds it pure in its essence, cleansed by its piety, illuminated by the radiance of intellect, and inhabited by the lights of knowledge. He sees it fit to be a dwelling and a descent for him. At that point, he reinforces it with unseen hosts and guides it to other goodnesses, until good leads to good, and so it continues perpetually, and his reinforcement through encouragement to good and facilitation of the matter for him does not cease. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "As for him who gives and is righteous and confirms the best, We will ease his way unto ease."

In such a heart, the light of the lamp shines from the niche of Lordship, so that the hidden polytheism, which is more hidden than the crawling of a black ant on a dark night, is not concealed within it. No hidden thing is concealed from this light, nor does any of Satan's guiles succeed with it. Rather, Satan is halted, and he whispers embellished speech as deception, but it is not heeded. This heart, after being purified from destructive traits, becomes, in proximity [to God], inhabited by the saving traits which we shall mention: gratitude, patience, fear, hope, poverty, asceticism, love, contentment, longing, reliance, contemplation, self-reckoning, and others. It is the heart upon which God, mighty and majestic, has turned His face, and it is the contented heart intended by His saying, exalted is He: "Unquestionably, by the remembrance of God hearts are assured," and by His saying, mighty and majestic: "O reassured soul."

The second heart is the forsaken heart, filled with caprice, defiled by blameworthy traits and foul things, its gates opened to the devils and its gates to the angels closed. The origin of evil within it is that a thought from caprice sparks within it and stirs. The heart then looks to the governor, the intellect, to seek a ruling from it and to discover the aspect of correctness therein. But the intellect has grown accustomed to serving caprice, become familiar with it, and persisted in devising stratagems for it and in assisting caprice. Thus, the soul gains mastery and assists it, the breast expands with caprice, and its darknesses spread within it due to the withholding of the intellect's hosts from repelling it. The authority of Satan strengthens due to the expanse of his place caused by the spread of caprice. He turns to it with adornment, deception, and false hopes, and whispers that as embellished speech, a deception. The authority of faith in the promise and the threat weakens, and the light of certainty regarding the fear of the Hereafter dims, as a dark smoke from caprice rises to the heart, filling its corners until its lights are extinguished. The intellect becomes like an eye whose eyelids are filled with smoke, so it cannot see. Thus does the dominance of desire act upon the heart, until there remains no possibility for the heart to pause and gain insight. Even if an admonisher gave it insight and made it hear what is the truth therein, it would be blind to understanding and deaf to hearing. Desire rages within it, Satan prevails, and the limbs move in accordance with caprice, so disobedience appears from the unseen realm into the visible realm by the decree and destiny of God, exalted is He. To such a heart is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Have you seen he who has taken his desire as his god? Then would you be responsible for him? Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are more astray in [their] way," and in His saying, mighty and majestic: "The word has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe," and in His saying: "It is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them—they will not believe."

And perhaps a heart in this state, relative to some desires, is like one who abstains from some things, but when he sees a beautiful face, he cannot control his eye and his heart, his intellect becomes confused, and the reins of his heart slip. Or like one who cannot control himself concerning matters of status, leadership, and arrogance, and no restraint for careful consideration remains with him when its causes appear. Or like one who cannot control himself when angry, however slight the matter, if a fault of his is mentioned. Or like one who cannot control himself when able to take a dirham or a dinar, but rather covets it with the covetousness of the infatuated and reckless, forgetting in it chivalry and piety. All of that is due to the rising smoke of caprice to the heart until it becomes dark and its lights are extinguished from it, so the light of modesty, chivalry, and faith is extinguished, and he strives to achieve what Satan desires.

The third heart is one in which thoughts of caprice appear, calling it to evil, then a thought of faith reaches it, calling it to good. The soul surges with its desire to support the thought of evil, so desire strengthens and the enjoyment and indulgence seem pleasing. The intellect then surges to the thought of good and pushes against the face of desire, deeming its action ugly, attributing it to ignorance, and likening it to a beast or a predator in its rushing upon evil and its scant regard for consequences. The soul then inclines to the counsel of the intellect. Satan then launches an assault upon the intellect, strengthens the call of caprice, and says, "What is this cold hesitation, and why...?"

You restrain yourself from your desires, thus harming your own soul. Yet do you see anyone in your time opposing his own whim or abandoning his aim? Would you then leave for them the pleasures of this world to enjoy, while you restrict yourself so that you remain deprived and wretched, toiling while the people of the age laugh at you? Do you wish your rank to exceed that of so-and-so and so-and-so, when they have done what you desired and did not restrain themselves? Do you not see that such-and-such a scholar does not refrain from the like of that? If it were an evil, he would have refrained from it. Thus the soul inclines toward Satan and turns to him, so the angel launches an assault against Satan and says: "Have you anyone except one who follows the pleasure of the moment and forgets the consequence? Are you content with a slight pleasure and abandon the pleasure of Paradise and its everlasting bliss? Or do you deem the pain of restraining your passion heavy, yet not deem the pain of the Fire heavy? Are you deceived by the people's negligence of themselves, their following their desires, and their aiding Satan, when the punishment of the Fire will not be lightened for you by the disobedience of another? Suppose you were on a scorching summer day of intense heat, and all the people stood in the sun, while you had a cool house—would you aid the people or seek deliverance for yourself? How then can you oppose people for fear of the heat of the sun, yet not oppose them for fear of the heat of the Fire?"

At that, the soul complies with the angel's saying. Thus it remains oscillating between the two hosts, pulled between the two parties, until what is most fitting for the heart prevails. If the qualities predominant in the heart are the satanic qualities we have mentioned, Satan prevails and the heart inclines to its kind from the parties of Satan, turning away from the party of God Almighty and His allies, and aiding the party of Satan and His enemies. What is a cause of its distance from God Almighty then flows upon its limbs by the decree of prior destiny. If the qualities predominant in the heart are the angelic qualities, the heart does not listen to Satan's misguidance and his incitement toward the immediate, nor to his making light of the matter of the Hereafter. Rather, it inclines to the party of God Almighty, and obedience appears in accordance with what has been decreed upon its limbs. Thus the heart of the believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the All-Merciful—that is, between the pull of these two hosts—and it is the prevailing one, meaning the turning and shifting from one party to another. As for constant permanence with the party of the angels or with the party of Satan, it is rare from both sides.

These acts of obedience and disobedience appear from the treasuries of the Unseen into the world of testimony by means of the treasury of the heart, for it is among the treasuries of the dominion. And when they appear, they are signs by which the possessors of hearts know the prior decree. For whom is created for Paradise, the means of obedience are made easy; and for whom is created for the Fire, the means of disobedience are made easy, and evil companions are given authority over him, and the rule of Satan is cast into his heart. For he deceives the foolish with various rulings, saying: "God is Merciful, so do not worry; and all the people do not fear God, so do not oppose them; and life is long, so be patient until you repent tomorrow." He makes them promises and gives them false hopes, but Satan promises them nothing except delusion. He promises them repentance and gives them hope of forgiveness, thus destroying them by God's leave through these tricks and what resembles them, expanding their hearts to accept delusion and constricting them from accepting the truth. All of that is by a decree and destiny from God. Whomever God wills to guide, He expands his breast for Islam; and whomever He wills to lead astray, He makes his breast tight and constricted, as if he were climbing into the sky. "If God helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there that can help you after Him?" He is the Guide and the Misguider; He does what He wills and decrees what He desires. None can repel His decree, and none can reverse His destiny. He created Paradise and created its people, then employed them through obedience. He created the Fire and created its people, then employed them through disobedience. And He made known to creation the sign of the people of Paradise and the people of the Fire, saying: "Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss, and indeed, the wicked will be in a Blazing Fire." Then Almighty God said, as narrated from His Prophet (peace be upon him): "These are in Paradise, and I do not care; and these are in the Fire, and I do not care." So exalted is God, the True Sovereign; He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.

Let us limit ourselves to this small amount regarding the marvels of the heart, for its exhaustive treatment is not fitting for the science of spiritual practice. We have only mentioned from it what is needed for knowing the depths and secrets of the sciences of spiritual practice, so that those who are not content with outward appearances, nor satisfied with the shell instead of the core, but yearn to know the subtleties of the realities of causes may benefit from it. In what we have mentioned is sufficiency and satisfaction for him, God willing. God is the Grantor of success. Here ends the Book of the Marvels of the Heart. Praise and favor belong to God. It will be followed by the Book of Disciplining the Soul and Refining Character. Praise be to God alone, and may God bless every chosen servant.

Al-Bayhaqi added in al-Shu'ab, "The remembrance lifts their burdens, and they will come on the Day of Resurrection light." Al-Tabarani reported it thus in al-Mu'jam al-Kabir from the narration of Abu al-Darda', without the addition mentioned by the author at its end, and both are weak.

[65] Hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla: Satan would come to the Prophet (peace be upon him) with a flame of fire in his hand... Ibn Abi al-Dunya recorded it in *Makayid al-Shaytan* thus as a *mursal* report. Malik recorded something similar in *al-Muwatta'* from Yahya ibn Sa'id as a *mursal* report. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr connected its chain in *al-Tamhid* from the narration of Yahya ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'd ibn Zurarah from 'Iyash al-Shami from Ibn Mas'ud.

Ibn Abi al-Dunya recorded it in *Makayid al-Shaytan*, and Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa'* in the biography of Yazid ibn Sinan, and he deemed it weak. Al-Hakim recorded something similar, abbreviated, concerning the jinn only: "Three kinds," from the hadith of Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani, and he said its chain is sound.

[74] Hadith: "He (peace be upon him) did not see Gabriel in his true form except twice." The two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] recorded it from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "She was asked, 'Did Muhammad see his Lord?' In it [the narration] is: 'But he saw Gabriel in his true form twice.'"

[76] Hadith: "He would see Gabriel in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi." The two Shaykhs recorded it from the hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd: "Gabriel came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) while Umm Salamah was with him, and he began to converse, then he left.

[78] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: God says, "When My servant intends to commit an evil deed, do not record it against him..." The author said: Muslim and al-Bukhari recorded it in the two *Sahih* collections. I say: It is as he said, and the wording is Muslim's. Therefore—and God knows best—he placed it earlier in the chapter on remembrance.

[79] Hadith: 'Uthman ibn Maz'un said, "O Messenger of God, my soul whispers to me to divorce Khawlah." He said, "Gently. Indeed, marriage is from my tradition..." Al-Tirmidhi al-Hakim recorded it in *Nawadir al-Usul* from the narration of 'Ali ibn Zayd from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib as a *mursal* report, something similar. In its chain is al-Qasim ibn 'Ubayd Allah al-'Umari, whom Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma'in declared a liar. Al-Darimi recorded from the hadith of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas concerning the matter of 'Uthman ibn Maz'un, who was from those who abandoned women, so the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) sent for him...

And he said, "O 'Uthman, I was not commanded with monasticism." In the hadith, which includes the phrase, "Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me," it is narrated with you in the wording: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, responded to 'Uthman ibn Maz'un regarding celibacy, and had he given him permission, he would have castrated himself. Al-Baghawi and Al-Tabarani, in their compilations of the Companions, narrate with a *hasan* chain from the hadith of 'Uthman ibn Maz'un that he said, "O Messenger of Allah, I am a man for whom this abstinence in military campaigns is difficult. So permit me, O Messenger of Allah, to be castrated, that I may castrate myself." He said, "No, but upon you, O Ibn Maz'un, is fasting, for it is an expiation." Ahmad and Al-Tabarani narrate with a *jayyid* chain from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "The castration of my nation is fasting and night prayer." And he has from the hadith of Sa'id ibn al-'As with a chain containing *da'f* (weakness) that 'Uthman ibn Maz'un said, "O Messenger of Allah, permit me to be castrated." The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "Indeed, Allah has replaced monasticism for us with the upright, easy religion and proclaiming the greatness of Allah upon every elevated place..." The hadith. And Ibn Majah with a weak chain from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Marriage is from my Sunnah." And Ahmad and Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Anas: "For every prophet..." and Abu Ya'la said, "For every nation there is a monasticism, and the monasticism of this nation is jihad in the cause of Allah." And in it is Zayd al-'Ama, and he is weak. And Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Umamah: "The asceticism of my nation is jihad in the cause of Allah," and its chain is *jayyid*.

[80] Hadith: The angels said, "Lord, that servant of Yours intends to commit a sin, and He is All-Seeing..." The author said it is in the *Sahih*, and it is as he said in the *Sahih* of Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[81] Hadith: "Indeed, people will be resurrected according to their intentions." Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of Jabir without the word "indeed." And he has from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Indeed, people will be raised according to their intentions," and their chains are *hasan*. And Muslim from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Allah will raise them according to their intentions." And he has from the hadith of Umm Salamah: "They will be raised according to their intentions."

[82] Hadith: "When two meet with their swords, the killer and the killed are in the Fire." The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Bakrah.

[83] Hadith: When the verse was revealed, "Whether you disclose what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it," some people from the Companions came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "We have been tasked with what we cannot bear..." The hadith was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and Ibn 'Abbas narrated something similar.

[84] Hadith: "God-consciousness is here," and he pointed to his heart. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he said, "to his chest."

[85] Hadith: "Sin is that which wavers in the hearts." It preceded in the Book of Knowledge.
