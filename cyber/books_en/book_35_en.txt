The Book of Divine Unity and Reliance

This is the fifth book of the quarter on the means of salvation from the work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

All praise belongs to Allah, the Director of the dominion and the sovereignty, the One singular in might and omnipotence. He who raised the heavens without pillars, and apportioned therein the provisions for His servants. He who turned the gaze of those possessing hearts and intellects away from observing the intermediaries and means, to the Originator of all means; and He who elevated their aspirations from turning to what is other than Him and from preoccupation with any director besides Him. Thus, they worshipped none but Him, knowing that He is the One, the Unique, the Eternal, the God; and realizing that all categories of creation are servants like themselves, from whom provision is not sought, and that there is not a single atom except that its creation is unto Allah, nor a creature except that its provision is upon Allah. So when they became certain that He is the Guarantor and the Surety for the provision of His servants, they placed their trust in Him and said: "Allah is sufficient for us, and what an excellent Trustee."

And blessings upon Muhammad, the suppressor of falsehoods, the guide to the straight path, and upon his family, with abundant peace.

Now then, reliance upon God is a station among the stations of religion and a rank among the ranks of those who possess certainty. Indeed, it is among the lofty degrees of those brought near, yet in itself it is obscure in terms of understanding, and then it is arduous in terms of practice. The reason for its obscurity in terms of comprehension is that observing secondary causes and depending upon them is a form of associating partners with God in matters of divine unity, while being entirely negligent of them is a criticism of divine wisdom and a disparagement of the revealed law. Depending upon causes without perceiving a Causer is a perversion of the intellect and an immersion in the depths of ignorance. To realize the true meaning of reliance in a manner that reconciles the demands of divine unity, transmitted tradition, and the revealed law is of the utmost obscurity and difficulty. None can lift this veil, despite its profound concealment, except the seasoned masters among the scholars, those whom God the Exalted has graced with the light of realities, so they have perceived and realized, and then have spoken clearly of what they have witnessed, for they were made to speak. We shall now commence by mentioning the virtue of reliance by way of introduction, then follow it with divine unity in the first part of the book, and we shall mention the state and practice of reliance in the second part.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Reliance on God

As for the verses: Indeed, God Almighty has said, "And in God place your trust, if you are believers."

And Almighty God has said: "And in God let the trusting place their trust."

And He, the Exalted, said: "Whoever places their trust in God, He suffices them."

And He, the Exalted and Glorified, said: "Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon Him]." How magnificent is the station marked by the love of Allah, the Exalted, for its occupant, and enveloped by the guarantee of Allah's sufficiency for its adherent. For whoever has Allah, the Exalted, as his Sufficiency, his Provider, his Beloved, and his Guardian: he has indeed attained the supreme success. For the beloved is not punished, nor distanced, nor veiled.

And He, exalted be He, said: "Is not Allah sufficient for His servant?" Thus, he who seeks sufficiency from other than Him and abandons reliance is the one who belies this verse. For it is a question posed in the manner of compelling an admission of the truth, like His saying, exalted be He: "Has there not come upon man a period of time when he was nothing worthy of mention?"

And He, the Almighty, has said: "Whoever places their trust in God, indeed God is Almighty, All-Wise."

O Mighty One, who never humiliates those who seek His protection, nor forsakes those who take refuge in His sanctuary and flee to His safeguard and stronghold;  
O Wise One, who never falls short in managing the affairs of those who entrust their matters to His governance.

And God Almighty said: "Indeed, those whom you invoke besides God are servants like yourselves." He made clear that everything other than God the Exalted is a subjugated servant. Its need is like your need, so how can one rely upon it?

And He, the Exalted, said: "Indeed, those you worship besides God possess no provision for you. So seek provision from God, and worship Him."
And the Almighty said: "And to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not comprehend."

And He, the Exalted, said: "He directs the affair; there is no intercessor except after His permission."

Every mention of divine unity in the Qur’an serves as an admonition to sever one’s gaze from all that is other than God and to place one’s reliance solely upon the One, the All‑Compelling.

As for the Prophetic reports, God’s Messenger ﷺ said, as narrated by Ibn Mas‘ūd: “I was shown the nations at the gathering‑place, and I saw my community filling the plain and the mountain. Their great multitude and their splendid appearance delighted me. It was said to me, ‘Are you pleased?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ It was said, ‘And along with these there are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.’” It was asked, “Who are they, O Messenger of God?” He said, “Those who do not brand themselves [for healing], who do not take omens from birds, who do not seek charms [for protection], and who rely upon their Lord.” ‘Ukāshah stood and said, “O Messenger of God, pray to God that He make me one of them.” The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said, “O God, make him one of them.” Then another man said, “O Messenger of God, pray to God that He make me one of them.” He, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said, “‘Ukāshah has preceded you in this.”

And the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: "If you were to rely on God with the reliance He is due, He would provide for you as He provides for the birds: they go forth in the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full ones."

And the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: "Whoever devotes himself wholly to God, the Almighty, God, the Exalted, will suffice him for every need and provide for him from where he does not reckon. And whoever devotes himself wholly to the world, God will entrust him to it."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: "Whoever is pleased to be the richest of people, let him be more assured by what is with Allah than by what is in his own hands."

And it is narrated from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that whenever his family was struck by hardship, he would say, "Rise to prayer," and he would say, "With this my Lord, the Almighty, has commanded me," for the Almighty said: "And enjoin prayer upon your household and be steadfast in it."

And he said: "He has not truly relied upon Allah who seeks charms and cauterization."

It is related that when Gabriel said to Abraham, peace be upon them both, after he had been catapulted into the fire, "Do you have any need?" he replied, "Not from you," in fulfillment of his statement, "Sufficient for me is God; an excellent guardian is He," which he had said when he was taken to be thrown. Then God, exalted is He, revealed: "And [remember] Abraham, who fulfilled [his covenant]."

And God, exalted be He, revealed to David, peace be upon him: O David, there is no servant who takes refuge in Me, apart from My creation, and the heavens and the earth conspire against him, but that I make for him a way out.

As for the narrations: Sa‘id ibn Jubayr said, “A scorpion stung me, and my mother made an oath upon me that I must seek a ruqyah (healing recitation). So I offered the healer the hand that had not been stung.”

The spiritual elite recited God's words, "And put your trust in the Ever-Living who does not die," to the end, and said: After this verse, it is not fitting for the servant to seek refuge in anyone other than God Almighty.

It was said to a certain scholar in his dream: "Whoever places his trust in God Almighty has secured his provision."

Some scholars have said: Let not the sustenance guaranteed to you distract you from the duties prescribed upon you of righteous deeds, lest you lose the matter of your Hereafter and attain from this world only what God has decreed for you.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: In the servant's provision being granted without his seeking lies evidence that provision is commanded to seek the servant.

Ibrahim ibn Adham said: I asked one of the monks, "From where do you eat?" He replied to me, "This knowledge is not with me, but ask my Lord from where He feeds me."

Haram ibn Hayyan asked Uways al-Qarani, "Where do you advise me to reside?" He gestured toward Syria. Haram asked, "What is life like there?" Uways replied, "Alas for these hearts that doubt has mingled with, so that admonition no longer benefits them."

Some have said: When you are content with God as your trustee, you will find a path to every good. We ask God Almighty for excellence in conduct.

The First Half

On Divine Unity

Explanation of the reality of Tawhid, which is the foundation of Tawakkul.

Know that reliance (tawakkul) is among the gates of faith, and all the gates of faith are not set in order except through knowledge, state, and action. Likewise, reliance is set in order from—knowledge, which is the foundation; action, which is the fruit; and state, which is what is intended by the name "reliance."

Let us begin by clarifying the knowledge that is the foundation, which in the original language is termed *īmān* (faith), for faith is affirmation (*taṣdīq*). Every affirmation by the heart is knowledge, and when it becomes strong it is called certainty (*yaqīn*). However, the gates of certainty are many, and we only need from them that upon which we build reliance (*tawakkul*), which is monotheism (*tawḥīd*), expressed by your statement: "There is no god but God alone, without partner"; and faith in the power, expressed by your statement: "To Him belongs the dominion"; and faith in the generosity and wisdom, indicated by your statement: "and to Him belongs all praise." Thus, whoever says, "There is no god but God alone, without partner; to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He has power over all things," has completed the faith that is the foundation of reliance—meaning that the meaning of this statement becomes a necessary attribute firmly established and predominant in his heart.

As for monotheism, it is the foundation, and discourse concerning it is extensive. It belongs to the knowledge of unveiling (*‘ilm al-mukāshafah*). However, some of the knowledges of unveilings are connected to actions through the intermediary of spiritual states (*aḥwāl*), and the knowledge of spiritual transaction (*‘ilm al-mu‘āmalah*) is not perfected except through them. Therefore, do not delve into it except to the extent related to the spiritual transaction; otherwise, monotheism is the vast ocean without a shore.

We say: Monotheism has four levels, and it is divided into the kernel, the kernel of the kernel, the shell, and the shell of the shell. Let us approximate this to weak understandings with the example of a walnut in its outer shell, for it has two shells, a kernel, and within the kernel an oil that is the kernel of the kernel.

The first level of monotheism is that a person says with his tongue, "There is no god but God," while his heart is heedless of it or denies it, like the monotheism of the hypocrites.

The second is that his heart be truthful with the meaning of the word, just as the generality of Muslims are truthful with it, and this is the belief of the common people.

The third is to witness this through unveiling by means of the Light of Truth, which is the station of those brought near. This is to see many things, yet perceive them in their multitude as emanating from the One, the All-Compelling.

The fourth is to see in existence nothing but the One, which is the witnessing of the truthful ones and what the Sufis term annihilation in divine unity. For since he sees nothing but the One, he does not see himself either. And when he does not see himself due to being absorbed in divine unity, he is annihilated from himself in his unification, meaning he has vanished from seeing himself and creation. The first is a unifier merely by tongue, and that protects its possessor in this world from the sword and spear. The second is a unifier in the sense that he believes in his heart the meaning of his utterance, and his heart is free from denying what his heart has affirmed—it is a knot upon the heart without expansion and openness, yet it protects its possessor from punishment in the Hereafter if he dies upon it and his knot is not weakened by sins. For this knot there are stratagems aimed at weakening and untying it, called innovation; and for it there are stratagems aimed at repelling the stratagem of untying and weakening, and also aimed at securing this knot and tightening it upon the heart, called discourse. The one knowledgeable of it is called a theologian, and he stands in opposition to the innovator, his aim being to repel the innovator from untying this knot from the hearts of the common people. The theologian may be specifically named a unifier since he protects with his discourse the understood meaning of the utterance of divine unity upon the hearts of the common people so that their knot does not become untied. The third is a unifier in the sense that he witnesses nothing but a single Agent when the Truth is unveiled to him as it truly is, and he sees no true Agent except One, for the reality has been unveiled to him as it truly is, because he has tasked his heart to affirm the understood meaning of the utterance of reality, for that is the rank of the common people and the theologians, since the theologian does not differ from the common person in belief, but rather in the quality of formulating the discourse by which the innovator's stratagem for untying this knot is repelled. The fourth is a unifier in the sense that nothing but the One is present in his witnessing, so he does not see the whole from the aspect of its multiplicity but from the aspect of its oneness. This is the ultimate limit in divine unity. The first is like the outer shell of a walnut, the second like the inner shell, the third like the kernel, and the fourth like the oil extracted from the kernel. And just as the outer shell of a walnut has no good in it—indeed, if eaten it is bitter in taste, if one looks at its interior it is foul in appearance, if taken as firewood it extinguishes the fire and produces much smoke, if left in the house it constricts the space—it is only fit to be left on the walnut for protection for a time and then discarded, so too is unification by mere tongue without heartfelt affirmation devoid of benefit, full of harm, blameworthy in outward and inward; but it is beneficial for a time in protecting the inner shell until the moment of death. The inner shell is the heart and body. The unification of the hypocrite protects his body from the sword of the invaders, for they were not commanded to split hearts; the sword only strikes the body of the person, which is the shell, and one is only stripped of it by death, so his unification yields no benefit thereafter. And just as the inner shell is evidently beneficial relative to the outer shell, for it protects the kernel and guards it from corruption when stored, and if separated it can be used as firewood, yet it is of lower worth relative to the kernel, so too is mere belief without unveiling greatly beneficial relative to mere utterance by tongue, but deficient in worth relative to the unveiling and witnessing that occur through the expansion and openness of the breast and the illumination of the light of Truth within it. For that expansion is what is intended by His saying, exalted is He: "So whoever Allah wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam," and by His saying, mighty and majestic: "Is he whose breast Allah has expanded to Islam, so he is upon a light from his Lord?" And just as the kernel is precious in itself relative to the shell and is the entire objective, yet it is not free from admixture of residue relative to the oil extracted from it, so too is unification of action a lofty goal for the wayfarers, yet it is not free from the admixture of noticing otherness and turning attention to multiplicity relative to one who witnesses nothing but the One Truth.

If you ask: How can it be conceived that only One is witnessed, while He witnesses the heavens and the earth and all other sensible bodies, which are many—so how can the many be one? Know that this is the ultimate degree of the sciences of unveilings. The secrets of this knowledge may not be written in a book, for the knowers have said: Divulging the secret of Lordship is unbelief. Moreover, it is not connected to the science of conduct. Yet, mentioning what may break the pattern of your denial is possible: A thing may be many by one kind of witnessing and consideration, and be one by another kind of witnessing and consideration. This is like a human being, who is many if one turns attention to his spirit, body, limbs, veins, bones, and inner parts; yet by another consideration and witnessing he is one, for we say he is one human. Thus, in relation to humanity he is one. How many a person beholds a human without it occurring to his mind the multiplicity of his intestines, veins, limbs, and the details of his spirit, body, and organs! The difference between the two is that in the state of absorption and immersion, he is absorbed in one without differentiation, as if in the very eye of unity; while he who turns to multiplicity is in separation. Likewise, everything in existence—both Creator and creation—has many diverse considerations and witnessings. By one consideration it is one, and by other considerations it is many, some being more numerous than others. Its example is the human, though it does not exactly match the aim, yet it alerts in general to how multiplicity becomes, in the ruling of witnessing, one. By this discourse, abandoning denial and rejection of a station your faith has not reached becomes clear. Thus, insofar as you are a believer in this unification, you have a share, even if what you believed is not your attribute—just as when you believe in prophethood, though you are not a prophet, you have a share in it according to the strength of your faith. This witnessing, in which only the One Truth appears, sometimes endures and sometimes flashes like fleeting lightning—the latter being more common—while permanence is rare and precious. To this al-Ḥusayn ibn Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj alluded when he saw al-Khawwāṣ traveling in journeys and said: “For what are you?” He replied: “I travel in journeys to rectify my state in reliance, for I was among the reliant.” Al-Ḥusayn said: “You have spent your life building your inward; where is the annihilation in unification?” It was as if al-Khawwāṣ was in rectifying the third station in unification, so he demanded of him the fourth station. These, in summary, are the stations of the unitarians in unification.

If you say: This requires an explanation sufficient to understand how reliance upon Him is constructed! I respond:

As for the fourth, it is not permissible to delve into its exposition, nor is reliance built upon it; rather, the state of reliance is attained through the third level of divine unity. As for the first, which is hypocrisy, it is clear. As for the second, which is belief, it exists among the generality of Muslims, and the method of affirming it through discourse and repelling the sophistries of innovators therein is mentioned in the science of theology; we have mentioned the important measure of it in the book "Al-Iqtisad fi al-I'tiqad." As for the third: it is that upon which reliance is built, so let us mention from it the measure connected to reliance without its details, which a book like this cannot bear. Its essence is: that it becomes unveiled to you that there is no agent except God Almighty, and that every existent—from creation, provision, giving, withholding, death, wealth, poverty, and so on, to which the name applies—the One uniquely responsible for its origination and invention is God Almighty, with no partner therein. When this is unveiled to you, you do not look to other than Him; rather, your fear is of Him, your hope is in Him, your trust is in Him, and your reliance is upon Him, for He is the sole Agent without any other. All besides Him are subjugated, possessing no independence to move an atom in the dominion of the heavens and the earth. When the doors of spiritual unveiling open for you, this becomes clear to you with a clarity more complete than visual observation.

Satan only hinders you from this divine unity in a station where he seeks to introduce into your heart a tinge of association due to two causes: The first is turning attention to the volition of animals. The second is turning attention to inanimate objects. As for turning attention to inanimate objects, such as your dependence on rain for the emergence, growth, and flourishing of crops, on clouds for the descent of rain, on cold for the gathering of clouds, on wind for the steadiness and sailing of a ship: all of this is association in divine unity and ignorance of the realities of matters. Therefore, God Almighty said: "And when they board the ship, they supplicate God, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him." It is said: its meaning is that they say, 'Were it not for the steadiness of the wind, we would not have been saved.' Whoever has the affair of the world unveiled to him as it truly is knows that the wind is air, and air does not move unless a mover moves it, and likewise its mover, and so on until it ends at the First Mover who has no mover and is not moved in His essence, Glorified and Exalted. The servant's turning in salvation to the wind resembles the turning of one whose neck was taken to be severed, then the king wrote a decree of pardon and release for him, and he busied himself with mentioning the ink, paper, and pen with which the decree was written, saying: 'Were it not for the pen, I would not have been freed,' thus seeing his salvation from the pen, not from the mover of the pen, which is the height of ignorance. Whoever knows that the pen has no ruling power in itself, but is merely a tool subjugated in the hand of the writer, does not turn to it nor give thanks except to the writer. Indeed, the joy of salvation and gratitude to the king and the writer may so overwhelm him that the pen, ink, inkwell, sun, moon, stars, rain, clouds, earth, and every animal and inanimate object—all subjugated in the grasp of Divine Power like the subjugation of the pen in the writer's hand—do not even cross his mind. Rather, this is an analogy for you due to your belief that the signing king is the writer of the decree. The truth is that God, Blessed and Exalted, is the Writer, due to His saying, Almighty: "And you did not throw when you threw, but God threw." When it is unveiled to you that all in the heavens and the earth are subjugated in this manner, Satan turns away from you disappointed and despairs of mixing your divine unity with this association. So he comes to you with the second ruinous matter, which is turning attention to the volition of animals in voluntary actions, and says: 'How do you see everything as from God, when this human gives you your provision by his choice? If he wills, he gives you, and if he wills, he cuts you off. This person is the one who severs your neck with his sword, and he has power over you; if he wills, he severs your neck, and if he wills, he pardons you. So how do you not fear him, and how do you not hope in him, when your affair is in his hand, and you witness that and do not doubt it?' And he also says to him: 'Yes, if you do not regard the pen because it is subjugated, how do you not regard the writer with the pen, who is subjugated to it?' At this point, the feet of most people slip, except for the sincere servants of God over whom the accursed Satan has no authority. For they witnessed by the light of insight that the writer is a subjugated, compelled being, just as all the weak witnessed that the pen is subjugated. They knew that the error of the weak in that is like the error of an ant, for example, if it were crawling on the paper and saw the pen tip blackening the paper, but its sight did not extend to the hand and fingers, let alone the possessor of the hand, so it erred and thought the pen is what blackens the whiteness, due to the deficiency of its sight in surpassing the pen tip because of the narrowness of its pupil. Similarly, whoever's breast is not expanded by the light of God Almighty for Islam, his perception fell short of observing the Omnipotent Master of the heavens and the earth and witnessing His being dominant behind all, so he stopped on the path at the writer, which is pure ignorance. Rather, the possessors of hearts and spiritual visions—God Almighty has made every atom in the heavens and the earth speak by His power, with which He made everything speak, until they heard its sanctification and glorification of God Almighty and its testimony against itself of incapacity, with an eloquent tongue speaking without letter or sound, not heard by those who are isolated from hearing. I do not mean by it the apparent hearing that does not transcend sounds, for the donkey shares in that, and there is no value in what beasts share in. Rather, I intend by it a hearing that perceives speech that is not by letter nor sound, neither Arabic nor non-Arabic.

If you ask: "This is a marvel that the intellect cannot accept, so describe to me the manner of their speech, how they spoke and with what they spoke, and how they glorified and sanctified, and how they bore witness against themselves of incapacity?" Then know that every atom in the heavens and the earth has a secret communion with the lords of hearts, and that is something which cannot be enumerated nor brought to an end, for they are words drawn from the ocean of the speech of God, exalted is He, which has no limit: "Say: If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted" (Qur'an 18:109). Then, they commune with the mysteries of the dominion and the kingdom, and divulging a secret is base; rather, the breasts of the free are graves for secrets. Have you ever seen a trusted keeper of a king's secrets, who was confided in with his hidden matters, then proclaimed his secret before an assembly of creation? If divulging every secret were permissible for us, He would not have said, peace be upon him: "If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much." Rather, he would mention that to them until they wept and did not laugh. And because he forbade divulging the secret of divine decree, and because he said: "When the stars are mentioned, desist; when divine decree is mentioned, desist; and when my companions are mentioned, desist." And because he singled out Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, with some of the secrets. Therefore, regarding the narrations of the communion of the atoms of the dominion and the kingdom with the hearts of the lords of spiritual witnessing, there are two preventatives: one is the impossibility of divulging the secret, and the second: the escape of their words from enumeration and limit. But in the example we were upon—which is the movement of the pen—we narrate from their communion a small measure by which is understood in general the manner of building reliance upon Him; and we reduce their words to letters and sounds, though they are not letters and sounds, but it is a necessity for comprehension.

So we say: One of the observers, from the niche of the light of God, exalted is He, said to the paper, having seen its face blackened with ink: "What is the matter with your face? It was white and radiant, and now blackness has appeared upon it. Why have you blackened your face? And what is the cause for it?" The paper replied: "You have not been fair to me in this statement! For I did not blacken my face by myself. Rather, ask the ink, for it was gathered in the inkwell, which is its abode and homeland. It traveled from its homeland and settled upon the expanse of my face wrongfully and aggressively!" He said: "You have spoken truthfully." So he asked the ink about that. It said: "You have not been fair to me, for I was in the inkwell, peaceful and still, resolved not to depart from it. The pen assailed me with its corrupt greed, snatched me from my homeland, exiled me from my country, scattered my gathering, and dispersed me, as you see, upon a white expanse. The question is upon it, not upon me!" He said: "You have spoken truthfully." Then he asked the pen about the reason for its wrongdoing and aggression and for bringing the ink out from its homelands. It said: "Ask the hand and the fingers, for I was a reed growing on the banks of rivers, taking recreation amidst the greenery of trees. The hand came to me with a knife, pared away my bark, tore my garments, uprooted me from my origin, separated my tubes, then sharpened me and split my head. Then it dipped me in the blackness and bitterness of the ink, and it uses me and makes me walk upon the tip of my head. You have indeed scattered salt upon my wound with your question and reproach. So turn away from me and ask the one who overpowered me." He said: "You have spoken truthfully." Then he asked the hand about its wrongdoing and aggression against the pen and its using it. The hand said: "I am but flesh, bone, and blood. Have you ever seen flesh that does wrong or a body that moves by itself? I am merely a mount, subjugated; a rider called Power and Might mounted me. It is the one that moves me back and forth and makes me roam the regions of the earth. Do you not see that clay, stone, and trees—none of them transgresses its place nor moves by itself, since a rider like this strong, overpowering one has not mounted it? Do you not see the hands of the dead? They equal me in the form of flesh, bone, and blood, yet there is no interaction between them and the pen. So I, too, from my own essence, have no interaction with the pen. Ask Power about my affair, for I am a mount disturbed by the one who mounted me." He said: "You have spoken truthfully." Then he asked Power about its affair in employing the hand and its frequent use and moving of it. It said: "Leave off blaming and reproaching me. How many a blamer is blameworthy, and how many a blamed one has no fault? How has my affair been hidden from you? How did you think I wronged the hand by mounting it, when I was its rider before the movement? I was not moving it nor compelling it to serve. Rather, I was asleep, still—a sleep such that those who speculated about me thought I was dead or non-existent, for I was not moving nor causing movement until a deputy came to me, disturbed me, and compelled me to what you see from me. I had the strength to assist him, but I did not have the strength to oppose him. This deputy is called Will. I know him only by his name and his assault and his attack, for he disturbed me from the depths of sleep and compelled me to that from which I would have had an escape had he left me to my own opinion." He said: "You have spoken truthfully." Then he asked Will: "What emboldened you against this still, tranquil Power until you diverted it and compelled it to it so compellingly that it found no escape or deliverance from it?" Will said: "Do not hasten against me, for perhaps we have an excuse while you blame. For I did not rise up by myself, but was raised; I did not set out, but was sent out by an overpowering decree and a decisive command. I was still before its coming, but there came to me from the presence of the heart a messenger of Knowledge upon the tongue of Intellect, summoning Power to appear, so I made it appear by compulsion. For I am a wretched one, subjugated under the coercion of Knowledge and Intellect. I do not know by what crime I stood before it and was subjugated to it and obligated to obey it. But I know that I was in ease and stillness as long as this overpowering visitor, this just or unjust judge, did not come to me. I stood before it and was obligated to obey it obligatorily. Rather, whenever its ruling is decisive, no power to oppose remains for me. By my life, as long as it is in hesitation with itself and perplexed in its judgment, I am still, but with an awareness and an awaiting of its judgment. When its judgment is finalized, I am disturbed by nature and coercion under its obedience, and I summon Power to carry out the requirement of its judgment. So ask Knowledge about my affair and leave off reproaching me, for I am as the poet said:"

When will you depart from a people, yet not leave them behind,
When they have determined to depart, then the ones departing are they.

He said: You have spoken truthfully, and turned to Knowledge and Intellect, demanding of them and reproaching them for rousing the Will and subjugating it to manifest Power. Intellect said: As for me, I am a lamp; I did not ignite by myself, but was ignited. The Heart said: As for me, I am a tablet; I did not spread out by myself, but was spread out. Knowledge said: As for me, I am an inscription inscribed upon the whiteness of the tablet of the heart when the lamp of intellect shone forth; I did not inscribe myself. How long was this tablet empty of me! Ask the Pen about me, for writing occurs only by the pen. At that, the questioner stammered and was not satisfied with the answer, saying: My toil on this path has been long, my waystations many, and still he refers me—from whom I hoped to know this matter—to another. Yet I was content with frequent repetition, for I heard acceptable speech, though not in the heart, and an apparent excuse for deflecting the question. But as for your saying, 'I am writing and inscription, yet a pen wrote me'—I do not understand it, for I know no pen except from reed, no tablet except from iron or wood, no writing except with ink, no lamp except from fire. In this station I hear talk of the tablet, the lamp, the writing, and the pen, yet I witness nothing of it; I hear a clatter but see no grinding.

The Pen said to him: If you are truthful in what you say, then your merchandise is rejected, your provision scant, and your mount weak. Know that perils on the path you have set out upon are many. Right for you is to turn back and abandon what you are in, for this is not your pasture. Withdraw, for each is facilitated to what he was created for. But if you desire to complete the path to the goal, then cast aside what you carry, and be a witness. Know that the worlds on your path are three: the world of sovereignty and witnessing is the first. Paper, ink, pen, and hand were from this world, and you passed those stations with ease. The second is the world of dominion, and it lies beyond me. If you pass me, you will reach its stations, wherein are vast deserts, towering mountains, and drowning seas—I know not how you will be safe therein. The third is the world of might, which lies between the world of sovereignty and the world of dominion. You have traversed three of its stations at the outset: the station of Power, Will, and Knowledge. It is an intermediary between the world of sovereignty and witnessing and the world of dominion, for the world of sovereignty is an easier path than it, and the world of dominion a rougher course than it. The world of might, between the world of sovereignty and the world of dominion, resembles a ship moving between land and water: it is not in the state of water's agitation, nor in the state of land's stillness and fixity. Whoever walks on land is in the world of sovereignty and witnessing. If his strength increases so that he can ride the ship, he is like one walking in the world of might. If he reaches the point of walking on water without a ship, he walks in the world of dominion without stumbling. If you cannot walk on water, then turn back, for you have passed the land and left the ship, and nothing remains before you but pure water. The beginning of the world of dominion is witnessing the Pen with which Knowledge is written on the tablet of the heart, and attaining the certainty by which one walks on water. Have you not heard the saying of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, concerning Jesus, upon him be peace: "If his certainty had increased, he would have walked on air," when it was said to him that he walked on water?

The wayfaring questioner said: I am bewildered in my affair, and my heart is filled with fear from what you have described of the path's danger. I know not whether I can traverse these deserts you described or not. Is there a sign for that? He said: Yes, open your sight, gather the light of your eyes, and fix your gaze upon me. If the Pen with which I write on the tablet of the heart appears to you, then it is likely you are worthy of this path. For whoever passes the world of might and knocks on a door of the doors of dominion is unveiled to the Pen. Do you not see that the Prophet, peace be upon him, at the beginning of his affair, was unveiled to the Pen when was revealed to him: "Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous, who taught by the pen, taught man that which he knew not."

The wayfarer said: I have opened my sight and fixed my gaze, and by God, I see no reed nor wood, nor do I know a pen except as such. Knowledge said: You have strayed far. Have you not heard that the furnishings of a house resemble the master of the house? Do you not know that God, exalted is He, His essence is not resembled by other essences? Likewise, His hand is not like hands, His pen is not like pens, His speech is not like other speech, and His writing is not like other writings. These are divine matters from the world of dominion. God, exalted is He, is not in His essence a body, nor is He in a place unlike others. His hand is not flesh, bone, and blood unlike hands, nor is His pen from reed, nor His tablet from wood, nor His speech by voice and letters, nor His writing by script and form, nor His ink vitriol and gallnut. If you do not witness this thus, then I see you only as effeminate between the masculinity of transcendence and the femininity of comparison, vacillating between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those. How have you declared His essence and attributes, exalted is He, transcendent from bodies and their attributes, and declared His speech transcendent from the meanings of letters and sounds, yet you hesitate regarding His hand, His pen, His tablet, and His writing? If you have understood from His saying, peace be upon him, "Indeed, God created Adam upon His image," the apparent image perceived by sight, then be an absolute comparer, as it is said: Be a pure Jew, otherwise do not play with the Torah. But if you understood from it the inward image perceived by insight, not by sight, then be purely transcendent and wholly sanctified. Fold up the path, for you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. Listen with the secret of your heart to what is revealed; perhaps you will find guidance upon the fire, and perhaps from the pavilions of the Throne you will be called with what Moses was called: "Indeed, I am your Lord."

When the wayfarer heard that from Knowledge, he felt the inadequacy of his self and that he was effeminate between comparison and transcendence. His heart ignited with fire from the intensity of his anger at himself when he saw it with the eye of deficiency. The oil that was in the niche of his heart was almost glowing even if no fire had touched it. When Knowledge blew upon it with its intensity, its oil ignited and became light upon light. Knowledge said to him: Seize now this opportunity and open your sight; perhaps you will find guidance upon the fire. He opened his sight, and the divine Pen was unveiled to him. It was as Knowledge had described in transcendence: not from wood nor reed, having neither head nor tail, and it writes perpetually in the hearts of all people all kinds of knowledge. It is as if it has a head in every heart, yet it has no head. He was amazed and said: Excellent is the companion Knowledge; may God, exalted is He, reward him on my behalf with good, for now the truth of his reports about the attributes of the Pen has become clear to me. Indeed, I see it as a pen not like pens.

At this, he bid farewell to Knowledge and thanked him, saying: My stay with you has been long and my seeking from you prolonged. I am resolved to travel to the presence of the Pen and ask it about its affair. He traveled to it and said: What is with you, O Pen, that you write perpetually in hearts from the sciences what sends the wills to manifest decree and directs them to the decreed? It said: Have you forgotten what you saw in the world of sovereignty and witnessing and heard from the answer of the pen when you asked it and it referred you to the hand? He said: I have not forgotten that. It said: My answer is like its answer. He said: How, when you do not resemble it? The Pen said: Have you not heard that God, exalted is He, created Adam upon His image? He said: Yes. It said: Then ask about my affair the one titled the Right Hand of the King, for I am in His grasp. He is the one who turns me, and I am overpowered and subjugated. There is no difference between the divine Pen and the human pen in the meaning of subjugation; the difference is only in the apparent form.

He said: Then who is the Right Hand of the King? The Pen said: Have you not heard His saying, exalted is He: "And the heavens are folded in His right hand"? He said: Yes. It said: And the pens are also

If you say: This doctrine of divine unity has culminated in being founded upon belief in the realm of sovereignty (malakūt), so what is the path for one who does not comprehend it or denies it? I say: As for the denier, there is no remedy for him except to be told: Your denial of the realm of sovereignty is like the denial of the Sophists (al-Samaniyyah) regarding the realm of omnipotence (jabarūt), for they confined knowledge to the five senses and thus denied power, will, and knowledge because these are not apprehended by the five senses, so they remained confined to the lowest level of the perceptible world through the five senses. If he says: I am among them, for I am guided only to the perceptible world through the five senses and know nothing beyond it, it is said: Your denial of what we have witnessed beyond the five senses is like the denial of the Skeptics (al-Sūfisṭāʾiyyah) regarding the five senses themselves, for they said: We do not trust what we see, for perhaps we see it in a dream. If he says: I am among their number, for I also doubt sensory perceptions, it is said: This is a person whose temperament has become corrupt and whose treatment is impossible; he is left for a few days, and not every patient is strong enough for the physicians to treat. This is the judgment concerning the denier.

As for one who does not deny but does not comprehend, the way of the spiritual wayfarers with him is to examine the eye with which he perceives the realm of sovereignty. If they find it sound in origin but a black fluid has descended into it that is amenable to removal and purification, they busy themselves with its purification, as an oculist busies himself with visible eyesight. When his vision becomes clear, he is guided to the path to traverse it, as He did with His elect companions. If he is not receptive to treatment and cannot traverse the path we mentioned concerning divine unity, and cannot hear the discourse of the atoms of the kingdom and sovereignty bearing witness to divine unity, they speak to him with letters and sounds and bring the pinnacle of divine unity down to the level of his understanding, for in the perceptible world there is also a form of divine unity. Indeed, everyone knows that a household is ruined by two masters, and a city is ruined by two rulers. So he is told, according to the measure of his intellect: The deity of the universe is one and the governor is one, for if there were in them deities other than God, they would be ruined. Thus, this is according to the taste of what he has seen in the perceptible world, and the belief in divine unity becomes implanted in his heart through this path suitable to the capacity of his intellect. God has charged the prophets to speak to people according to the capacity of their intellects, and for this reason the Qur’an was revealed in the language of the Arabs, according to their customary manner of discourse.

If you ask: Can such creedal monotheism serve as the foundation for trust in God and its essential root?  
I say: Yes, for when conviction strengthens, it acts like unveiling in stirring spiritual states—except that it often weakens and is quickly overtaken by agitation and instability. Therefore, its possessor needs a theologian to guard it with discourse, or must learn theology himself to protect the creed he received from his teacher, his parents, or the people of his land.  

As for one who has witnessed the path and traversed it himself, nothing of that sort is to be feared for him. Even if the veil were lifted, his certainty would not increase—though clarity would grow—just as one who sees a person at dawn does not become more certain at sunrise that it is a person, but sees the details of his form more clearly. The likeness of those granted unveiling and those of mere creed is none other than the magicians of Pharaoh with the followers of the Samiri.  

For the magicians of Pharaoh, due to their long observation and experience, were aware of the ultimate effect of magic. When they saw from Moses—peace be upon him—what exceeded the bounds of magic, the truth of the matter was unveiled to them, and they paid no heed to Pharaoh’s threat, “I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides.” Rather, they said, “We will not prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and He who created us. So decree whatever you will decree; you can only decree concerning this worldly life.” For clear evidence and unveiling prevent change.  

But as for the followers of the Samiri, since their faith was based on observing the apparent serpent, when they looked upon the Samiri’s calf and heard its lowing, they changed. They heard his saying, “This is your god and the god of Moses,” and forgot that it could not respond to them with speech, nor possess for them any harm or benefit. Thus, whoever believes by looking at a serpent will inevitably disbelieve when looking at a calf, for both belong to the world of testimony—and in the world of testimony, contradiction and opposition abound.  

But the world of the unseen dominion is from God Almighty, and therefore we find in it no contradiction or opposition at all.

If you say: What I have mentioned regarding divine unity is evident so long as it is established that intermediaries and means are subjugated, and all of that is clear except in the movements of a human being, for he moves if he wills and remains still if he wills—so how can he be subjugated? Then know that if, along with this, he willed only when he wished to will, and did not will unless he wished to will, this would be a slippery foothold and a place of error. But it is known that he does what he wills when he wills, whether he wills to will or does not will to will—so the will is not up to him. For if it were up to him, it would require another will, and that would regress endlessly. And since the will is not up to him, whenever the will that directs power toward its object arises, power inevitably turns toward it and has no way to oppose it. Thus, movement necessarily follows from power, and power necessarily moves when the will is resolved. The will arises necessarily in the heart. These are necessities that follow one upon another, and the servant has no power to prevent the arising of the will, nor the turning of power toward its object after it, nor the existence of movement after the will has stirred power. Thus, in all of this, he is compelled.

If you say: This is pure compulsion, and compulsion contradicts free will, yet you do not deny free will—so how can one be both compelled and freely choosing? I say: Were the veil lifted, you would know that within the very essence of free will lies compulsion. Thus, he is compelled in his choosing. How, then, can this be understood by one who does not comprehend free will? Let us therefore explain free will briefly in the language of the theologians, in a manner fitting what has been mentioned, albeit as a digression and a supplement, for this book is intended solely for the science of spiritual conduct. Yet I say: The term "action" as applied to a human is used in three ways. It is said: A person writes with the fingers, breathes with the lungs and throat, and parts the water when his body stands upon it. Thus, parting the water, breathing, and writing are attributed to him. These three are, in reality, one in terms of necessity and compulsion, but they differ beyond that in certain aspects. I shall express them for you with three expressions: We call his parting of the water when he falls upon its surface a *natural action*; we call his breathing a *volitional action*; and we call his writing a *voluntary action*. Compulsion is evident in the natural action, for whenever he falls upon the water's surface or moves from the ground into the air, the air is necessarily parted. The parting may even be necessary after the movement. As for breathing in its meaning, the relation of the throat's movement to the will to breathe is like the relation of the water's parting to the weight of the hands; whenever the weight is present, the parting occurs thereafter, and the weight is not up to him. Likewise, the will is not up to him. Therefore, if a needle is aimed at a person's eye, the eyelids close by necessity; and if he wished to leave them open, he could not—even though closing the eyelids by necessity is a volitional action. But when the image of the needle is formed in his perception through apprehension, the will to close arises by necessity, and the movement occurs through it. Had he wished to refrain from that, he could not, even though it is an action performed with capability and will. Thus, this joins the natural action in being necessary.

As for the third—which is voluntary action—it is the locus of confusion, like writing and speech. It is said of it: If he wills, he acts; if he wills, he does not act; and at times he does not will. From this, it is thought that the matter is up to him. This is due to ignorance of the meaning of free will. Let us unveil it. Its explanation is that will follows knowledge which judges that a thing is agreeable to you. Things are divided into that which your outward or inward perception judges to be agreeable without perplexity or hesitation, and into that about which the intellect may hesitate. That which we determine without hesitation—such as someone aiming a needle at your eye or a sword at your body—admits no hesitation in your knowledge that repelling it is better and agreeable for you. Thus, inevitably, the will is stirred by knowledge, capability by will, and the movement of the eyelids in repelling and the hand in raising the sword occurs—but without deliberation and reflection. This is by will.

Among things are those in which discernment and the intellect pause, so one does not know whether it is agreeable or not, thus requiring deliberation and reflection until it becomes clear that the good lies in acting or refraining. When, through reflection and deliberation, knowledge is attained that one of them is good, it joins that which is determined without reflective deliberation. The will is stirred here just as it is stirred to repel the sword and spear. When it is stirred to do what has become clear to the intellect as good, this will is called *choice* (ikhtiyār), derived from *good* (khayr), meaning it is an impulse toward what has become clear to the intellect as good. It is precisely that will, except that in its impulse it awaited what that other will awaited—namely, the appearance of the goodness of the action in its regard—except that the goodness in repelling the sword appeared without deliberation, rather immediately, while this required deliberation. Thus, choice is an expression for a specific will: that which is stirred by the indication of the intellect concerning something in whose apprehension there is pause. Regarding this it is said that the intellect is needed to distinguish between the better of two goods and the lesser of two evils. It is inconceivable that the will be stirred except by a judgment of the senses and imagination or by a decisive judgment of the intellect. Therefore, if a person wished to cut his own throat, for example, he could not—not for lack of capability in the hand nor lack of a knife, but due to the absence of the specific, directing will that summons the capability. The will is absent because it is stirred by a judgment of the intellect or the senses that the action is agreeable, and killing himself is not agreeable to him. Thus, despite strong limbs, he cannot kill himself unless he is under an unbearable, painful punishment; for here the intellect pauses and hesitates in judgment because it hesitates between the lesser of two evils. If, after deliberation, it becomes preponderant to him that refraining from killing is the lesser evil, he cannot kill himself. But if he judges that killing is the lesser evil and his judgment is decisive, with no inclination away from it nor deterrent, then the will and capability are stirred, and he destroys himself—like one pursued by a sword for killing, who throws himself from a roof, for example, even unto destruction, without caring, and cannot refrain from throwing himself. If he is pursued by a light beating and reaches the edge of the roof, the intellect judges that the beating is lighter than throwing, so his limbs halt; he cannot throw himself, and no impulse stirs within him at all. For the impulse of the will is subservient to the judgment of the intellect and the senses; capability is subservient to the impulse; movement is subservient to capability; and all is decreed by necessity therein from where he does not know. He is merely the locus and channel for these matters. As for it being *from* him? No, not at all.

Therefore, the meaning of his being compelled is that all of that occurs in him from other than him, not from him. The meaning of his being freely choosing is that he is the locus for a will that occurred in him by compulsion after the intellect's judgment that the action is purely good and agreeable—and the judgment also occurred by compulsion. Thus, he is compelled in his choosing. So, the action of fire in burning, for example, is pure compulsion; the action of God, exalted is He, is pure choice; and the action of a human is at a station between the two stations, for he is compelled in choosing. Thus, the people of truth sought a third expression for this, because since it is a third category and they took their proof from the Book of God, exalted is He, they called it *acquisition* (kasb), which contradicts neither compulsion nor choice but rather combines both when understood. The action of God, exalted is He, is called choice, provided that choice is not understood to mean a will after perplexity and hesitation, for that is impossible in His regard. All the terms mentioned in languages cannot be used in regard to God, exalted is He, except in a manner of metaphor and approximation. To elaborate further is not fitting for this science and would prolong the discourse.

If you ask: Do you then say that knowledge gives birth to will, and will gives birth to power, and power gives birth to movement, and that each subsequent thing arises from the preceding one? If you say this, you have judged that something occurs not from the power of God Almighty. And if you refuse that, then what is the meaning of the sequential dependence of some of these upon others? Know then that the statement that some of these arise from others is pure ignorance, whether expressed as "giving birth" or otherwise. Rather, all of that is referred back to the meaning expressed as the Eternal Power, which is the foundation whose true reality has not been grasped by all of creation except those firmly rooted in knowledge. They have grasped the essence of its meaning, while the multitude have grasped merely its wording with a kind of analogy to our own power, which is far from the truth. Elucidating this would be lengthy. However, some of the things decreed are sequentially dependent upon others in their occurrence, like the dependence of the conditioned upon its condition. Thus, from the Eternal Power, will does not issue except after knowledge, and knowledge does not issue except after the locus of life exists. And just as it is not permissible to say that life is produced by the body, which is a condition for life, so it is with all other degrees of sequence. But some conditions may be apparent to the common people, while others are not apparent except to the elect who are unveiled by the light of truth. Otherwise, nothing precedes and nothing follows except by truth and necessity. So too are all the acts of God Almighty. Were it not for that precedence and sequence, it would be futile play resembling the acts of the insane—exalted is God above the speech of the ignorant, supremely exalted. To this, His saying, exalted is He, alludes: "I created the jinn and mankind only that they might worship Me" (51:56), and His saying, exalted is He: "We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play. We created them only with truth" (44:38-39). Thus, everything between heaven and earth occurs according to a necessary and true sequence; it is inconceivable to be other than as it has occurred, and according to this order which exists. Nothing follows except in anticipation of its condition, and the conditioned before its condition is impossible. The impossible cannot be described as being within the power [of God]. Thus, knowledge does not follow the sperm-drop except due to the absence of the condition of life, nor does will follow it after knowledge except due to the absence of the condition of knowledge. All of that is the course of the Necessary and the order of Truth. There is in none of that play or chance; rather, all of it is with wisdom and design. Comprehending this is difficult, but we give an example to bring the principles of truth closer to weak understandings regarding the suspension of the thing decreed despite the existence of the power, due to the absence of the condition. That is by imagining a created person submerged in water up to his neck. The minor ritual impurity does not lift from his limbs even though the water is the lifting agent and is in contact with him. So the Eternal Power is present, in contact with the things decreed, attached to them, like the water's contact with the limbs. But the thing decreed is not realized by it, just as the lifting of the impurity by the water is not realized, in anticipation of the condition, which is washing the face. When the person standing in the water places his face upon the water, the water acts upon all his limbs and the impurity lifts. An ignorant person might think that the impurity lifted from the hands because it lifted from the face, since it occurred afterward. He says: The water was in contact and was not lifting, and the water did not change from what it was, so how did it produce what it did not produce before? Rather, the lifting of the impurity from the hands occurred when washing the face. Therefore, washing the face is what lifted the impurity from the hands. This is ignorance resembling the supposition of one who thinks that movement is produced by power, and power is produced by will, and will by knowledge. All of that is error. Rather, when the impurity lifted from the face, the impurity lifted from the hand by the water for it, not by washing the face. The water did not change, the hand did not change, and nothing new occurred in them. But the condition came into existence, so the effect of the cause became manifest. Thus should you understand the issuing of the decreed things from the Eternal Power, even though the Power is eternal and the decreed things are temporal. This knocks on another door to another world among the worlds of unveilings. So let us leave all of that, for our aim is to point the way to the oneness of God in action, for the true Agent is One. He is the One to be feared and hoped for, and upon Him is reliance and dependence. We have not been able to mention from the oceans of divine oneness except a drop from the sea of the third station among the stations of oneness. Exhausting that in the lifespan of Noah is impossible, like exhausting the sea's water by taking droplets from it. All of that is encompassed by the statement "There is no god but God." How light its utterance is upon the tongue! How easy the belief in the understood meaning of its wording is upon the heart! And how precious its reality and core is among the scholars firmly rooted in knowledge, let alone among others.

If you ask: How can divine unity and religious law be reconciled? For the meaning of divine unity is that there is no agent except God Most High, while the meaning of religious law affirms actions for the servants. If the servant is an agent, how can God Most High be the agent? And if God Most High is the agent, how can the servant be an agent? An effect between two agents is not conceivable.

I say: Indeed, that is not conceivable if "agent" has a single meaning. But if it has two meanings, and the term is ambiguous, oscillating between them, there is no contradiction. Just as it is said: "The commander killed so-and-so," and it is said: "The executioner killed him." Yet the commander is a killer in one sense, and the executioner is a killer in another sense. Similarly, the servant is an agent in one sense, and God Almighty is an agent in another sense. The meaning of God Most High being the agent is that He is the Inventor, the Originator. The meaning of the servant being an agent is that he is the locus in which power was created after will was created in him, after knowledge was created in him. Thus, power became linked to will, and movement to power, like the link of condition to conditioned. And it is linked to God's power like the link of effect to cause, and the link of the invented to the Inventor. Whatever has a link to a power, the locus of that power is called its agent, however the link may be—just as the executioner is called a killer and the commander is called a killer, because killing is linked to their power, but in two different ways. Therefore, it is called an act for both of them. Likewise is the link of the determined things to the two powers. Due to the correspondence and agreement of this, God Most High attributes actions in the Qur'an sometimes to the angels and sometimes to the servants, and at other times attributes the very same actions to Himself.

Thus God Most High said concerning death: "Say: 'The angel of death will take you'" (32:11), then He Almighty said: "God takes the souls at the time of their death" (39:42). And He said: "Have you considered what you sow?" (56:63)—attributing it to us—then He said: "We pour down water, then We split the earth in clefts, and cause to grow therein grain" (80:25-27). And He Almighty said: "We sent to her Our Spirit, and he appeared to her as a well-proportioned man" (19:17), then He said: "We breathed into her of Our Spirit" (66:12), while the one who breathed was Gabriel, peace be upon him. And as He said: "So when We have recited it, then follow its recitation" (75:18)—it is said in interpretation: its meaning is when Gabriel recites it to you. And He said: "Fight them; God will punish them by your hands" (9:14), attributing the fighting to them and the punishment to Himself, and the punishment is precisely the killing. Indeed, He made it explicit, saying: "You did not kill them, but God killed them" (8:17). And He said: "You did not throw when you threw, but God threw" (8:17)—which combines negation and affirmation outwardly, but its meaning is: You did not throw in the sense by which the Lord is a thrower, when you threw in the sense by which the servant is a thrower, for they are two different meanings.

And God Most High said: "Who taught by the pen—taught man that which he knew not" (96:4-5), then He said: "The Most Merciful taught the Qur'an" (55:1-2), and He said: "He taught him clear expression" (55:4), and He said: "Then indeed, upon Us is its explanation" (75:19). And He said: "Have you considered the semen that you emit? Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator?" (56:58-59). Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said in describing the angel of the wombs: "He enters the womb and takes the sperm-drop in his hand, then he fashions it into a body, and says: 'O Lord, male or female? Sound or malformed?' Then God Most High decrees what He wills, and the angel creates." And in another wording: "The angel fashions it, then breathes into it the spirit, with happiness or misery."

Some of the early pious predecessors have said: The angel named the Spirit is the one who infuses spirits into bodies, and he breathes by his attribute, so that each breath of his becomes a spirit that enters a body, and for that reason he is called the Spirit. What is mentioned regarding such an angel and his attribute is true, witnessed by the possessors of hearts with their inner sight. As for the spirit being an expression for him, this cannot be known except through transmitted revelation, and to judge it without transmission is mere conjecture. Likewise, God the Exalted has mentioned in the Quran proofs and signs in the earth and the heavens, then said: "Is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?" And He said: "God bears witness that there is no deity except Him." Thus, He clarified that He is the proof for Himself, and that is not contradictory; rather, the paths of reasoning are diverse. How many a seeker has come to know God the Exalted by contemplating created beings, and how many a seeker has come to know all created beings through God the Exalted, as some of them said: "I knew my Lord through my Lord, and were it not for my Lord, I would not have known my Lord." This is the meaning of His saying, the Exalted: "Is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?" And God the Exalted has described Himself as the Giver of life and the Causer of death, then delegated death and life to two angels. Thus, in the report: "The two angels of death and life debated. The angel of death said: 'I cause the living to die.' The angel of life said: 'I give life to the dead.' So God the Exalted revealed to them: 'Be at your work for which I have subjugated you to perform, and I am the Causer of death and the Giver of life; none causes death or gives life besides Me.'" Therefore, an action is applied in different aspects, so these meanings do not contradict when understood. For this reason, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to the one who handed him a date: "Take it, for had you not come to it, it would have come to you," attributing the coming both to him and to the date. It is known that the date does not come in the manner that a person comes to it. Similarly, when the penitent said: "I repent to God the Exalted, and I do not repent to Muhammad," the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "He recognized the truth for its people." So whoever attributes everything to God the Exalted is the one who has realized and recognized the truth and reality, and whoever attributes it to other than Him is the one who uses figurative language and borrows in his speech. Figurative usage has its place just as literal reality has its place. The term "doer" was coined by the framer of language for the inventor, but he thought that man is an inventor by his own power, so he called him a doer due to his movement, thinking this was the reality, and imagined that attributing it to God the Exalted is figurative, like attributing killing to the commander, for it is figurative in addition to attributing it to the executioner. When the truth was unveiled for its people, they knew that the matter was the opposite and said: "The term 'doer' which you, O linguist, coined for the inventor—there is no doer except God. The name belongs to Him in reality and to others figuratively." That is, you use it figuratively for other than what the linguist coined it for. And when the true meaning flowed on the tongue of some Bedouins, whether intentionally or coincidentally, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) confirmed its truth, saying: "The truest verse spoken by a poet is the saying of Labid:
'Verily, everything other than
God is false.'"

Everything that has no subsistence in itself—whose subsistence is rather through another—is, in consideration of itself, null. Its reality and true essence lie in another, not in itself. Therefore, in truth, there is no reality except the Living, the Self-Subsisting, than Whom there is nothing like. For He subsists by His own Essence, and all besides Him subsists through His power. Thus He is the Reality, and all else is null. Hence Sahl said: "O poor one! He was, and you were not; He will be, and you will not be. Since you have come to be today, you say 'I' and 'I.' Be now as you were not, for He today is as He ever was."

If you say: It has now become apparent that all is predestination, so what is the meaning of reward and punishment, wrath and pleasure, and how can He be wrathful at His own act? Then know that the meaning of this we have already alluded to in the Book of Gratitude, so we shall not prolong by repeating it. This is the extent we have seen fit to hint at concerning the Oneness that engenders the state of reliance, and this is not perfected except through faith in mercy and wisdom. For Oneness engenders gazing upon the Causer of causes, and faith in mercy and its vastness is what engenders trust in the Causer of causes. The state of reliance, as will come, is not perfected except by trust in the Trustee and the heart's tranquility in the good oversight of the Guarantor. This too, through faith, is a great gate among the gates of faith, and recounting the path of the unveilers therein would be lengthy. So let us mention its essence that the seeker of the station of reliance may believe it with a decisive belief, free from doubt. It is to affirm with a certain affirmation, without weakness or doubt, that if God, Mighty and Majestic, were to create all creation with the intellect of the most intelligent among them and the knowledge of the most knowledgeable, and create for them from knowledge what their souls could bear, and shower upon them from wisdom what has no end to its description, then increase them by the like of all their number in knowledge, wisdom, and intellect, then unveil to them the consequences of affairs and acquaint them with the secrets of the dominion and make known to them the subtleties of gentleness and the hidden aspects of punishments, until through this they became aware of good and evil, benefit and harm, then command them to administer the kingdom and dominion with what they have been given of sciences and wisdoms, it would not necessitate—even with their cooperation and mutual support upon it—that a mosquito's wing be added to what God, glorified be He, has ordained for creation in this world and the next, nor that a mosquito's wing be subtracted from it, nor that an atom be raised from it nor an atom be lowered, nor that a sickness, defect, deficiency, poverty, or harm be repelled from one afflicted by it, nor that health, perfection, wealth, or benefit be removed from one upon whom God has bestowed it. Rather, everything God, Exalted, has created of the heavens and the earth—if they were to turn their gaze upon it and prolong their contemplation—they would see no disparity nor flaw in it. And all that God, Exalted, has apportioned among His servants of provision, lifespan, joy, sorrow, incapacity, capability, faith, disbelief, obedience, and disobedience—all of it is pure justice with no injustice therein, sheer truth with no wrong therein. Rather, it is upon the necessary, true order, as it ought to be and in the measure it ought to be. There is absolutely nothing better, more complete, or more perfect within possibility than it. If He were able and withheld its enactment, it would be stinginess contradicting generosity, and injustice contradicting justice. If He were not able, it would be incapacity contradicting divinity. Rather, every poverty and harm in this world is a diminishment from this world and an increase in the Hereafter. And every deficiency in the Hereafter relative to an individual is bliss relative to another. For were it not for night, the worth of day would not be known; were it not for sickness, the healthy would not enjoy health; were it not for the Fire, the people of Paradise would not know the worth of bliss. And just as the ransoming of human souls with the souls of animals and their empowerment to slaughter them is not injustice, but rather preferring the complete over the deficient is the essence of justice, so too is the magnification of favors upon the inhabitants of the Gardens by magnifying the punishment upon the people of the Fires, and the ransoming of the people of faith with the people of ingratitude, the essence of justice. Were the deficient not created, the complete would not be known; were animals not created, the nobility of humans would not appear. For completion and deficiency become apparent through relation. What generosity and wisdom necessitate is the creation of both the complete and the deficient. And just as severing a hand if it becomes gangrenous to preserve the soul is justice because it is the ransoming of the complete by the deficient, so too is the matter concerning the disparity among creation in apportionment in this world and the Hereafter. All of that is justice with no injustice therein, truth with no play therein. This now is another sea, immense in depth, vast in expanse, turbulent in waves, nearly as vast as the sea of Oneness. In it have drowned groups of the incapable, and they did not know that this is obscure, comprehended only by the knowers. Beyond this sea lies the secret of Divine Decree, in which the majority have become perplexed and from divulging its secret the unveilers have refrained.

The essence is that good and evil are decreed, and what has been decreed was necessary after the precedence of the Will. There is no averter of His judgment and no repealer of His decree and command. Rather, every small and great thing is recorded, and its occurrence is by a known, awaited measure. What has befallen you would not have missed you, and what has missed you would not have befallen you.

We shall confine ourselves to these allusions from the sciences of unveiling, which are the foundations of the station of reliance, and we shall return—God willing—to the science of spiritual conduct. Sufficient for us is God, and what an excellent Trustee He is.

The Second Part: On the States and Practices of Reliance on God

This section elucidates the state of reliance upon God, clarifies what the masters have said regarding its definition, explains reliance in earning for the solitary individual and the provider, clarifies reliance in proportion to saving, explains reliance in warding off harms, and explains reliance in removing harm through treatment and other means. And God grants success through His mercy.

Explanation of the State of Reliance on God

We have mentioned that the station of reliance is composed of: knowledge, state, and action. And we have discussed knowledge.

As for the state, trust in God with true realization is an expression thereof. Knowledge is its root, and action is its fruit. Many have delved into explaining the definition of trust, and their expressions have varied. Each spoke from his own station and described its limit as is the custom of the Sufis in their exclusive discourse. There is no benefit in extensive transmission and repetition, so let us unveil the cover and say: Trust (tawakkul) is derived from agency (wikālah). It is said: He entrusted his affair to so-and-so—meaning he delegated it and relied upon him therein. The one to whom it is entrusted is called an agent (wakīl), and the one who delegates to him is described as relying upon him and trusting in him, whenever his soul is at peace with him, trusts him, does not suspect him of negligence, and does not believe him incapable or deficient. Thus, trust is an expression for the heart’s reliance upon the Agent alone.

Let us give an analogy of an agent in a dispute: If someone brings a false claim against him through deception, and he appoints for the dispute one who uncovers that deception, he will not be trusting in him, nor confident in him, nor at peace in his soul with his appointment, unless he believes four qualities in him: utmost guidance, utmost power, utmost eloquence, and utmost compassion. As for guidance, it is to know the points of deception so that nothing of the subtleties of tricks remains hidden from him. As for capability and power, it is to embolden him to declare the truth plainly, without flattery, fear, shame, or cowardice. For perhaps he may discern the aspect of his opponent’s deception, yet fear, cowardice, shame, or some other distraction that weakens the heart prevents him from declaring it. As for eloquence, it is also a capability of the tongue to express all that the heart is emboldened to and indicates: not every one who knows the points of deception is capable, with fluency of tongue, of untying the knot of deception. As for utmost compassion, it motivates him to expend all the effort he can on his behalf, for his capability is of no avail without concern for him, if his affair does not matter to him and he does not care whether his opponent prevails or not, or whether his right perishes or not. If he doubts the four, or one of them, or allows that his opponent may be more complete in these four than his agent, his soul will not be at peace with his agent. Rather, his heart remains agitated, wholly preoccupied with scheming and planning to ward off what he fears from his agent’s deficiency and his opponent’s dominance. The varying degrees of his states in intensity of trust and tranquility correspond to the varying strength of his belief in these qualities in him. Beliefs and assumptions vary in strength and weakness without limit; thus, inevitably, the states of those who trust vary in strength of tranquility and confidence without limit, until they culminate in certainty without weakness—as if the agent were the client’s parent, who strives to gather the lawful and unlawful for his sake, for then he attains certainty of utmost compassion and concern, so one of the four qualities becomes definitive. Likewise, it is conceivable to attain certainty regarding the other qualities through prolonged practice and experience, and recurrent reports that he is the most eloquent of people in speech and the most capable in expression in supporting the truth—indeed, in portraying truth as falsehood and falsehood as truth. When you understand trust in this analogy, then measure by it trust in God, Exalted is He. If it is established in your soul, through unveiling or firm conviction, that there is no actor except God as previously stated, and you believe along with that complete knowledge and capability to suffice the servants, then complete concern, tenderness, and mercy for all servants and individuals, and that beyond the utmost of His capability there is no capability, beyond the utmost of His knowledge there is no knowledge, and beyond the utmost of His concern and mercy for you there is no concern or mercy—then inevitably your heart relies upon Him alone and does not turn to other than Him in any way, nor to itself, its means, or its strength, for there is no power nor strength except by God, as previously mentioned in the discussion of monotheism regarding movement and capability. For “power” (ḥawl) is an expression for movement, and “strength” (quwwah) is an expression for capability. If you do not find this state in yourself, its cause is one of two things: either weakness of certainty in one of these four qualities, or weakness and sickness of the heart due to the dominance of cowardice over it and its agitation because of overwhelming illusions. For the heart may become agitated following illusion and obeying it without deficiency in certainty. For one who is about to consume honey, if dung is presented before him, his nature may recoil and he finds it difficult to consume it. If a rational person were compelled to spend the night with a corpse in a grave, bed, or house, his nature would recoil from that, even if he were certain that it is dead, that it is inanimate at present, and that God’s consistent practice is that He will not resurrect it now nor give it life, though He is capable of it—just as His practice is consistent that He does not transform the pen in his hand into a snake, nor the cat into a lion, though He is capable of it. Despite having no doubt in this certainty, his nature recoils from lying with the dead in a bed or spending the night with it in the house, yet does not recoil from other inanimate objects. That is cowardice in the heart—a weak type that rarely is a person free from some of it, however little. It may strengthen and become a sickness until he fears to spend the night in the house alone even with the door locked and secured. Thus, trust is not complete except with both strength of heart and strength of certainty, for through them the heart’s stillness and tranquility are attained. Stillness in the heart is one thing, and certainty is another. How much certainty is there without tranquility, as God said to Abraham, peace be upon him: “Or have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but to reassure my heart.” He sought to witness the revival of the dead with his own eye to fix it in his imagination, for the soul follows imagination and is reassured by it, and is not reassured by certainty at the beginning of its affair until it reaches in the end the degree of the tranquil soul (al-nafs al-muṭmaʾinnah). That does not occur at the outset at all. And how many are tranquil without certainty, like the adherents of religions and schools? The Jew’s heart is tranquil in his Judaism, and likewise the Christian, yet they have no certainty at all. They follow only conjecture and what their souls desire, though guidance from their Lord has come to them, which is the cause of certainty, but they turn away from it. Thus, cowardice and boldness are innate traits, and certainty does not benefit with them. They are among the causes that oppose the state of trust, just as weakness of certainty in the four qualities is among the causes. When these causes combine, trust in God, Exalted is He, is attained. It has been said: It is written in the Torah: Cursed is he who trusts in a human like himself. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Whoever seeks glory through slaves, God will humiliate him.” When the meaning of trust is unveiled to you and you know the state named trust, know that this state has three degrees in strength and weakness: The first degree is what we mentioned: that his state regarding God, Exalted is He, and confidence in His guarantee and concern is like his state in confidence in an agent.

The second state, which is the stronger: that one's condition with God, exalted be He, be like the condition of a child with its mother. For the child knows none but her, flees for refuge to no one else, and relies upon none save her. When it sees her, it clings in every circumstance to her hem and does not leave her. If something befalls it in her absence, the first thing to rush to its tongue is, "O my mother!" and the first thought that occurs to its heart, for she is its refuge. This is because it has trusted in her guardianship, her sufficiency, and her tender care with a trust that is not devoid of a kind of discernment and recognition proper to it. And this is considered innate, in the sense that if the child were asked to detail these qualities, it would be incapable of articulating them with words or of summoning them distinctly in its mind. Yet all of that lies beyond conscious perception.

Thus, whoever has his heart turned to God, mighty and glorious, his gaze fixed upon Him, and his reliance placed upon Him, becomes attached to Him just as the child is attached to its mother, and thereby becomes a true trustee in God. For the child is a trustee upon its mother. The difference between this state and the first is that this person is a trustee and has become annihilated in his trust from his very trust, since his heart does not turn to the act of trusting or its reality, but solely to the One upon whom he trusts. Hence, there is no room in his heart for anything other than the One upon whom he relies. As for the first state, he trusts through effort and acquisition and is not annihilated from his trust, because he has an awareness of his trust and a feeling of it. That very awareness preoccupies him and diverts him from observing the One upon whom he relies alone.

It is to this degree that Sahl alluded when he was asked about trust in God: "What is its lowest level?" He said, "Abandoning hopes." It was said, "And its middle level?" He said, "Abandoning choice," which is a reference to the second degree. He was asked about its highest level but did not mention it, saying, "None knows it except he who has attained its middle."

The third and highest level is that one stands before God Almighty in all his movements and stillness like a corpse before the washer, never departing from this state except in that he perceives himself as dead, moved by the Eternal Power as the washer’s hand moves the corpse. This is the one whose certainty has grown strong that he is but a locus through which movement, power, will, knowledge, and all other attributes are manifested, and that each occurs by compulsion, thus becoming distinct from awaiting what befalls him. He differs from the child, for the child cries out to his mother, screams, clings to her hem, and runs after her. Rather, he is like a child who knows that even if he does not cry out to his mother, his mother seeks him; and even if he does not cling to her hem, his mother carries him; and even if he does not ask her for milk, his mother offers it and gives him drink. This station in reliance yields the fruit of abandoning supplication and request, out of trust in His generosity and care, and in the knowledge that He gives initially better than what is asked for. How many blessings has He initiated before supplication and request, and without any deserving! The second station does not necessitate abandoning supplication and request of Him, but only necessitates abandoning request from other than Him.

If you ask: "Are these states conceivable to exist?" Know that it is not impossible, but it is rare and precious. The second and third stations are the most precious, while the first is closest to possibility. Then, if the third and second are found, their permanence is even rarer; indeed, the third station in its continuity is scarcely like the pallor of fear. For the heart's expansion toward observing power, strength, and causes is natural, while its contraction is incidental—just as the blood's expansion to all extremities is natural and its contraction incidental. "Fear" here refers to the contraction of blood from the surface of the skin inward, until the redness that was visible through the thin veil of the skin disappears. For the skin is a thin veil through which the redness of blood appears; its contraction causes pallor, which does not last. Similarly, the heart's complete contraction from observing power, strength, and all apparent causes does not endure. As for the second station, it resembles the pallor of one with fever, which may last a day or two. The first is like the pallor of a patient whose illness has become severe, so it may either endure or vanish.

If you ask: Does the servant retain any management or attachment to means in these states? Know that the third station negates management entirely as long as the state persists; rather, its possessor becomes like one bewildered. The second station negates all management except in terms of fleeing to God through supplication and entreaty, like the management of a child in clinging only to its mother. The first station does not negate the root of management and choice, but negates certain managements, like one who relies on his agent in a dispute: he abandons management from a source other than the agent, but does not abandon the management which his agent indicated to him, or the management he knows from his agent's habit and practice without explicit indication. As for what he knows by his indication—such as when he says to him, "I will only speak in your presence"—he inevitably engages in management for attendance, and this does not contradict his reliance on him, for it is not a flight from him to his own power and strength in presenting the argument, nor to the power of another. Rather, the perfection of his reliance on him is to do what he has outlined for him; for if he were not relying on him nor depending on him in his statement, he would not have attended. His statement, "As for what is known from his habit and consistent practice," means that he knows from his habit that he does not dispute the opponent except from the register. Thus, the perfection of his reliance on him, if he is relying on him, is to not depend on his practice and habit while fulfilling their requirement: which is to carry the register with himself to him when disputing. Therefore, he cannot dispense with management for attendance and management for bringing the register. If he neglected any of that, it would be a deficiency in his reliance, so how could his action be a deficiency in it? Indeed, after he attended in fulfillment of his indication and brought the register in fulfillment of his practice and habit, he becomes an observer of his disputation. He may then reach the second and third stations in his presence, until he remains like one bewildered and waiting, not fleeing to his own power and strength, since no power or strength remains for him. His flight to his power and strength in attendance and bringing the register was by the agent's indication and practice, and it has reached its end, so nothing remains but tranquility of soul, trust in the agent, and waiting for what will transpire. If you contemplate this, every difficulty concerning reliance is dispelled from you, and you understand that it is not a condition of reliance to abandon every management and action; nor is it permissible with reliance, but it is subject to division, and its details will come in the actions. So when the reliant one flees to his own power and strength in attendance and bringing, it does not contradict reliance because he knows that were it not for the agent, his attendance and bringing would be vain and pure exertion without benefit. Therefore, it does not become beneficial from the perspective that it is his power and strength, but from the perspective that the agent made it a means for his disputation and informed him of that by his indication and practice. Thus, there is no power nor strength except by the agent. However, this statement does not attain its complete meaning in relation to the agent, for he is not the creator of his power and strength; rather, he is the one who makes them beneficial in themselves, and they would not be beneficial were it not for his action. This is only true in relation to the True Agent, who is God Almighty, for He is the Creator of power and strength, as preceded in the chapter on Divine Unity, and He is the One who made them beneficial by making them a condition for what He will create after them of benefits and objectives. Therefore, there is no power nor strength except by God, truly and verily. So whoever witnesses all of this will have the great reward that has come in the reports concerning one who says, "There is no power nor strength except by God." This may seem improbable, and it may be said: How is all this reward given for this statement, with its ease on the tongue and the ease of the heart's belief in the meaning of its wording? Far from it! That is only the recompense for this witnessing that we mentioned in the chapter on Divine Unity. The relation of this statement and its reward to the statement "There is no god but God" and its reward is like the relation of the meaning of one to the other. For in this statement is the attribution of two things to God Almighty alone—namely, power and strength—whereas the statement "There is no god but God" is the attribution of everything to Him. So look at the disparity between everything and two things to thereby know the reward of "There is no god but God" in addition to this. And as we mentioned before that Divine Unity has two shells and a kernel, so too does this statement and all other statements. Most of creation are confined to the two shells and have not penetrated to the kernels. To the kernels is the allusion in His saying, "Whoever says 'There is no god but God' truthfully from his heart, sincerely, Paradise is guaranteed for him." And where it is mentioned absolutely without truthfulness and sincerity, the intended by the absolute is this qualified, just as forgiveness is attributed to faith and righteous deeds in some places, and attributed to mere faith in some places, the intended being that qualified by righteous deeds. For the kingdom is not attained by speech and the tongue's movement—speech—and the heart's conviction is also speech, but it is the speech of the soul. Truthfulness and sincerity lie beyond them. And the throne of the kingdom is only set up for the brought-near, who are the sincere. Indeed, for those near to them in rank from the companions of the right hand there are also degrees with God Almighty, even if they do not culminate except in the kingdom. Do you not see that God, glorified and exalted, when He mentioned in Surah Al-Waqi'ah the brought-near, the foremost, He alluded to the throne of the kingdom, saying, "On thrones woven, reclining on them, facing each other." And when He concluded with the companions of the right hand, He increased in mentioning water, shade, fruits, trees, and wide-eyed maidens—all of that from the pleasures of what is seen, drunk, eaten, and coupled with. And this is conceivable for beasts perpetually. And how far are the pleasures of beasts from the pleasure of the kingdom, and from dwelling in the highest heights in the proximity of the Lord of the worlds! If these pleasures had any worth, they would not be shared with beasts, nor would the degree of the angels be raised above them. Do you think that the states of beasts—which are let loose in meadows, delighting in water, trees, and varieties of foods, enjoying grazing and corruption—are higher, more pleasurable, nobler, and more deserving to be envied by the possessors of perfection than the states of the angels in their joy at nearness to the proximity of the Lord of the worlds in the highest heights? Far, far is it from attainment that one who is given the choice between being a donkey or being in the rank of Gabriel, peace be upon him, would choose the rank of the donkey over the rank of Gabriel, peace be upon him! It is not hidden that everything is drawn to what resembles it, and that the soul whose inclination is more toward the craft of cobblery than toward the craft of writing is more akin in its essence to cobblers than to scribes. Likewise, one whose soul's inclination is more toward attaining the pleasures of beasts than toward attaining the pleasures of the angels is inevitably more akin to beasts than to angels. These are the ones about whom it is said, "Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray." They are more astray because livestock do not have in their capacity the seeking of the angels' rank, so their abandonment of the quest is due to incapacity. But man has that in his capacity, and one capable of attaining perfection is more deserving of blame and more worthy of being described as astray whenever he neglects to seek perfection. If this is an intervening discourse, let us return to the intended purpose. We have clarified the meaning of saying "There is no god but God" and the meaning of saying "There is no power nor strength except by God," and that whoever is not saying them from witnessing, then the state of reliance cannot be conceived from him.

If you say: In your statement "There is no power nor strength except by God" there is only the attribution of two things to God, then if someone were to say: "The heavens and the earth are God's creation," would his reward be like the reward for that? I say: No, because reward is according to the rank of what is sought, and there is no equality between the two ranks, nor is consideration given to the vastness of the heavens and earth and the smallness of power and strength—if it is permissible to describe them as small by way of hyperbole. Matters are not judged by the magnitude of the entities, for every common person understands that the earth and heavens are not from the side of humans but are from the creation of God Most High. As for power and strength, their matter has perplexed the Mu'tazilites, the philosophers, and many groups who claim to scrutinize opinion and reason to the point of splitting a hair with the sharpness of their insight. It is a perilous and hazardous ruin, a great stumbling block in which the heedless have perished when they affirmed for themselves a matter that is polytheism in divine unity and the affirmation of a creator other than God Most High. So whoever crosses this obstacle by God's grace toward him has indeed elevated his rank and magnified his degree; he is the one who truthfully says, "There is no power nor strength except by God." We have mentioned that in divine unity there are only two obstacles: one is looking at the heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the clouds, the rain, and all inanimate things; the second is looking at the volition of animals, and it is the greater and more perilous of the two obstacles. By traversing them, the perfection of the secret of divine unity is attained, and for that reason the reward of this phrase is great—I mean the reward of witnessing, of which this phrase is the translation. When the state of reliance returns to disavowing power and strength and relying on the One True God, it will become clear when we detail the acts of reliance, God willing.

Explanation of What the Masters Have Said Concerning the States of Reliance

It becomes clear that none of these depart from what we have mentioned, but each one points to certain states.  
Abu Musa al-Dayli said: I asked Abu Yazid, “What is tawakkul (reliance on God)?” He replied, “What do you say?” I said, “Our companions say: If wild beasts and snakes were on your right and left, your heart would not stir on account of them.”  
Abu Yazid said, “Yes, that is close. But if the people of Paradise were in Paradise enjoying bliss, and the people of Hell were in Hell suffering torment, and then a distinction between them arose in your heart, you would have left the ranks of tawakkul.”  
What Abu Musa mentioned is a report about the most exalted state of tawakkul, which is the third station. What Abu Yazid mentioned expresses the most precious kind of knowledge, which is among the foundations of tawakkul—namely, knowledge of divine wisdom: that whatever God Almighty does, He does out of necessity, so there is no distinction between the people of Hell and the people of Paradise with respect to the root of justice and wisdom. This is the most subtle kind of knowledge, and beyond it lies the mystery of divine decree.  
Abu Yazid rarely speaks except from the highest stations and utmost degrees. Yet, refraining from guarding against snakes is not a condition in the first station of tawakkul. Indeed, Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with him) took precautions in the cave when he blocked the openings against snakes—unless it is said he did so with his foot and his heart was not disturbed by it, or it is said he did so out of compassion for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), not for himself.  
Tawakkul is only nullified by the stirring and changing of the heart for a matter that relates to oneself. There is room for reflection here, but it will later be clarified that such things—and more—do not contradict tawakkul. For the heart’s agitation from snakes is fear, and it is right for the one who relies on God to fear the One who empowers the snakes, since snakes have no power or strength except by God. If one takes precaution, his reliance is not on his own planning, power, or strength in that precaution, but on the Creator of power, strength, and planning.

Dhul-Nun al-Misri was asked about reliance (tawakkul). He replied: "To cast off lordship and sever means." Casting off lordship alludes to the knowledge of divine oneness, and severing means alludes to actions—though it does not explicitly address the spiritual state, even if the wording implies it. He was then asked: "Tell us more!" He said: "To cast the self into servitude and remove it from lordship." This alludes solely to disavowing one's own power and strength.

Hamdun al-Qassar was asked about reliance on God (tawakkul). He replied: If you possess ten thousand dirhams yet owe a single daniq of debt, you should not feel secure from dying while your debt remains upon your neck. And if you owe ten thousand dirhams of debt without having left any means to repay it, do not despair of God Almighty that He will settle it for you. This points to pure faith in the vastness of His power, and that within the decreed matters there are hidden causes beyond these apparent causes.

Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Qurashi was asked about reliance (tawakkul). He replied: “Attachment to God, exalted is He, in every state.” The questioner said: “Tell me more!” He said: “Abandoning every means that leads to another means, until the Truth (al-Haqq) becomes the One in charge of that. The first statement is general to the three stations, while the second points specifically to the third station. It is like the reliance of Abraham, peace be upon him and his family, when Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to him: ‘Do you have any need?’ He replied: ‘Not from you, certainly not.’ For his asking would have been a means leading to another means—namely, Gabriel’s protection of him—so he forsook that, trusting that if God, exalted is He, willed, He would subjugate Gabriel for that purpose, and thus He would be the One in charge of it. This is the state of one bewildered, absent from himself through God, exalted is He, so he sees none other with Him. It is a state rare in itself, and its permanence, if found, is even rarer and more precious.”

Abu Sa‘id al-Kharraz said: “Reliance is agitation without rest, and rest without agitation.” Perhaps he is pointing to the second station. “Rest without agitation” points to the heart’s repose in the Trustee and its trust in Him. “Agitation without rest” points to one’s alarm before Him, beseeching and supplicating in His presence, like the agitation of a child before its mother and the repose of its heart in the completeness of her tenderness.

Abu ‘Ali al-Daqqaq said: “Reliance has three degrees: reliance (tawakkul), then submission (taslim), then entrustment (tafwid). The reliant one reposes in His promise; the submitted one is content with His knowledge; and the one who entrusts is pleased with His decree.” This points to the varying degrees of one’s vision in relation to the One beheld. For knowledge is the foundation, the promise follows it, and the decree follows the promise. It is not far-fetched that what predominates in the heart of the reliant one is the observance of something from that. The masters have other sayings concerning reliance besides what we have mentioned, but we shall not prolong with them, for unveiling is more beneficial than narration and transmission. This is what pertains to the state of reliance, and God grants success through His mercy and grace.

Explanation of the Acts of Those Who Rely on God

Know that knowledge begets spiritual states, and states yield deeds. Some may imagine that reliance on God means abandoning bodily effort, forsaking planning with the heart, and collapsing upon the earth like a discarded rag or meat upon a chopping block—but this is the fancy of the ignorant. For such is forbidden in the Sacred Law, and the Sacred Law has praised those who rely on God. How then could a station among the stations of religion be attained through what religion prohibits? Rather, the veil is lifted, and we say: The effect of reliance manifests in the movement and striving of the servant, with his knowledge, toward his aims. The servant’s striving by choice is either to obtain a benefit he lacks—such as earning a livelihood—or to preserve a benefit he possesses—such as saving—or to repel a harm that has not yet befallen him—such as warding off an aggressor, a thief, or a beast—or to remove a harm that has already befallen him—such as seeking treatment for illness. The purpose of the servant’s movements does not exceed these four categories: acquiring benefit, preserving it, repelling harm, or cutting it off. Let us then set forth the conditions and degrees of reliance in each of these, accompanied by proofs from the Sacred Law.

The First Art: On Attaining Benefit. We say regarding it: The means by which benefit is attained are of three levels: that which is certain, that which is presumed with a trustworthy presumption, and that which is imagined with a conjecture in which the soul does not place complete trust nor find tranquility.

The first degree: That which is certain, such as causes that are linked to their effects by God's decree and will in a consistent manner without variation. Just as when food is placed before you while you are hungry and in need, yet you do not reach your hand toward it, saying, "I am one who relies on God," and the condition of reliance is to abandon striving and reaching the hand toward it—for that is striving and movement—and likewise chewing it with the teeth and swallowing it by closing the upper palate upon the lower, this is pure madness and has nothing to do with reliance. For if you were to expect that God the Exalted would create satiety in you without the food, or create movement in the bread toward you, or commission an angel to chew it for you and deliver it to your stomach, then you have ignored the way of God the Exalted. Similarly, if you did not sow the earth and hoped that God the Exalted would create plants without seed, or that your wife would give birth without intercourse as Mary (peace be upon her) gave birth, all of that is madness, and examples of this are many and cannot be enumerated. Is not reliance in this situation through action, but rather through state and action? As for knowledge: it is that you know that God the Exalted created the food, the hand, the teeth, and the power of movement, and that He is the One who feeds you and gives you drink. As for the state: it is that your heart is at rest and your dependence is upon the act of God the Exalted, not upon the hand or the food. For how can you depend on the soundness of your hand when it may dry up at once and become paralyzed? How can you rely on your ability when something may befall you suddenly that removes your intellect and nullifies your power of movement? How can you depend on the presence of food when God the Exalted may empower someone to overcome you for it or send a snake to disturb you from your place and separate you from your food? And when such possibilities are considered and there is no remedy for them except by the grace of God the Exalted, then in that you should rejoice and upon that you should rely. So when his state and knowledge are thus, let him reach out his hand, for he is one who relies.

The second degree: causes that are not certain, but it is generally the case that effects do not occur without them, and the probability of their occurrence without them is remote. Like one who departs from cities and caravans to travel in deserts that people rarely traverse, and his journey is without provision. This is not a condition for trust in God; rather, taking provision in deserts is the practice of the predecessors. Trust in God is not nullified by it, provided that reliance is on the grace of God Almighty, not on the provision, as previously mentioned. However, doing so is permissible, and it is among the highest stations of trust, which is why the elect would do it.

If you say: "This is striving toward destruction and casting oneself into ruin," then know that it ceases to be forbidden by two conditions: first, that the man has disciplined his soul, struggled with it, and accustomed it to abstain from food for a week or thereabouts, such that he can endure it without distress of heart, disturbance of mind, or difficulty in remembering God Almighty.

The second condition is that one must be capable of subsistence on wild herbs and whatever lowly things one may come by. After these two conditions are met, it is generally the case in the deserts that within every week one will either encounter a human being, or reach a settlement or village, or find sufficient herbage to sustain oneself, thereby living while striving against one's own soul. Striving is the pillar of trust in God, and upon this the elect and their peers among those who truly rely on God have depended.

The proof for this is that the elect would never be without a needle, scissors, a rope, and a water-skin, saying: "This does not impair trust in God." The reason is that they knew water in the deserts is not found upon the surface of the earth, and it is not the established way of God, exalted is He, for water to ascend from a well without a bucket or a rope. Moreover, the presence of a rope and bucket in the deserts is not as common as the presence of herbage, yet water is needed for one's ablutions several times each day and for one's thirst at least once every day or two. For a traveler, with the heat of movement, cannot endure without water even if he endures without food. Likewise, he may have a single garment that might tear, exposing his private parts, and scissors and a needle are not commonly found in the deserts at the time of every prayer, nor is there anything else available in the deserts that can take their place in sewing and cutting.

Therefore, anything analogous to these four items also belongs to the second degree, because it is a matter of probable expectation, not certainty. For it is possible that the garment does not tear, or that someone gives him a garment, or that he finds someone at the wellhead to draw water for him. However, it is not possible for masticated food to move by itself into one's mouth. Thus, there is a distinction between the two degrees, though the second is akin to the first.

For this reason we say: If one were to withdraw to a ravine among the mountain ravines where there is no water, no herbage, and no passerby comes upon it, and he were to sit relying [solely on God], he would be sinful in doing so, hastening his own destruction. As it has been related that an ascetic among the ascetics left the towns and settled at the foot of a mountain for a week, saying: "I will not ask anyone for anything until my Lord brings me my provision." He remained for seven days until he was near death, yet no provision came to him. So he said: "O Lord, if You give me life, then bring me the provision You have apportioned for me; otherwise, take me to Yourself." Then God, majestic is His remembrance, revealed to him: "By My might, I will not provide for you until you enter the towns and sit among the people." So he entered a town and sat down. Then this one brought him food and that one brought him drink. He ate and drank, yet felt misgiving in his heart about it. Then God, exalted is He, revealed to him: "Did you wish to nullify My wisdom through your asceticism in the world? Did you not know that I provide for My servant through the hands of My other servants, which is more beloved to Me than providing for him by the hand of My power?"

Therefore, distancing oneself from all means is a defiance of wisdom and ignorance of the Sunnah of Allah, the Exalted. Acting in accordance with the Sunnah of Allah, the Exalted, while relying on Allah, the Almighty, without the means, does not contradict trust in Allah, as we previously illustrated with the example of the agent in litigation. However, the means are divided into apparent and hidden. The meaning of trust is to suffice with the hidden means over the apparent ones, while the heart finds tranquility in the Causer of causes, not in the causes themselves.

If you ask: What is your ruling on remaining in a city without seeking livelihood—is it forbidden, permissible, or recommended? Know that it is not forbidden, for it is like the action of a wanderer in the desert if he is not destroying himself. Thus, however he may be, he is not destroying himself such that his action would be forbidden. Rather, it is not far-fetched that provision may come to him from where he does not expect, though it may be delayed for him. Patience is possible until it coincides. However, if he were to lock the door of his house upon himself in such a way that no one has a path to him, then that action of his is forbidden. But if he opens the door of his house and is idle, not occupied with worship, then seeking livelihood and going out is more appropriate for him—yet his action is not forbidden unless he is on the brink of death. At that point, he must go out, ask, and seek livelihood. If his heart is occupied with God, not eagerly looking to people nor anticipating who enters from the door to bring him his provision, but rather his anticipation is for the grace of God Most High and his occupation is with God, then that is superior. It is among the stations of reliance (tawakkul); which is to be occupied with God Most High and not be concerned about his provision, for provision will come to him inevitably. At this point, what some scholars said is valid: that if a servant were to flee from his provision, it would pursue him, just as if he were to flee from death, it would overtake him; and that if he were to ask God Most High not to provide for him, He would not respond, and he would be disobedient, and He would say to him: "O ignorant one, how could I create you and not provide for you?" Therefore, Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "People have disagreed about everything except provision and term of life, for they have unanimously agreed that there is no provider and no giver of death except God Most High." And He, exalted is He, said: "If you were to rely on God as He deserves to be relied upon, He would provide for you as He provides for the birds: they go out hungry and return full. And by your supplication, the mountains would be removed."

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: Look at the birds—they neither sow nor reap nor store away, yet God the Exalted provides for them day by day. And if you say, "We have greater bellies," then look at the cattle and see how God the Exalted has apportioned for them this due provision.

Abu Ya'qub al-Susi said: The reliant ones have their provisions flow to them through the hands of servants without toil on their part, while others are preoccupied and wearied.

Some have said: All servants are within the provision of God, exalted is He, yet some of them eat through exertion, like beggars; some through toil and waiting, like merchants; some through demeaning labor, like craftsmen; and some through nobility, like the Sufis, who witness the All-Mighty and take their provision directly from His hand, seeing no intermediary.

The third degree: engaging with means that are imagined to lead to effects without evident trust, such as one who meticulously pursues intricate plans in detailing acquisition and its methods. This entirely exits all degrees of reliance, and it is that in which all people are—I mean those who acquire through subtle stratagems a permissible acquisition of permissible wealth. As for taking what is doubtful or acquiring through a means containing doubt, that is the utmost greed for the world and dependence on means. It is not hidden that this nullifies reliance. This is like the means whose relation to attracting benefit is like the relation of incantation, augury, and cauterization to removing harm, for the Prophet ﷺ described those who rely by that and did not describe them as not acquiring, not inhabiting cities, nor taking anything from anyone. Rather, he described them as undertaking these means, and similar means that are trusted for effects are numerous beyond enumeration.

Sahl said regarding reliance (tawakkul): It is the abandonment of personal planning. He said: Verily, Allah created creation and did not veil them from Himself; rather, their veil is by their own planning. Perhaps he intended by this the deduction of remote means through thought—these are what require planning, unlike the evident means. Thus, it has become clear that means are divided into those whose attachment to them removes one from reliance and those that do not. And that which removes is divided into what is certain and what is conjectural. The certain, when the state of reliance and its knowledge—which is dependence upon the Causer of causes—is present, does not remove one from reliance. Therefore, reliance in these is by state and knowledge, not by action.

As for the conjectural matters, reliance in them is by state, knowledge, and action all together. Those who rely (mutawakkilun) in engaging with these means are upon three stations: The first is the station of the elect and their peers. This is he who travels in the deserts without provision, trusting in the bounty of God, exalted is He, upon him in strengthening him to endure patiently for a week or more, or in facilitating herbage or sustenance for him, or in making him steadfast in contentment with death if none of that is facilitated. For he who carries provision may lose his provision or his camel may go astray and he die of hunger; that is possible with provision just as it is possible without it.

The second station: to remain in one's home or in a mosque, but within towns and cities. This is weaker than the first, yet it is also a form of trust, for he abandons earning and apparent means, relying upon the grace of God Most High in managing his affair through hidden means. However, by remaining in populated areas, he exposes himself to the means of provision, for that is among the attracting causes. Yet that does not invalidate his trust, provided his gaze is directed toward the One who subjugates the inhabitants of the town to convey his provision to him, not toward the inhabitants themselves. For it is conceivable that all of them might neglect him and cause him to be lost, were it not for the grace of God Most High in making them aware and stirring their motives.

The Third Station: That one goes out and earns a living in the manner we described in the third and fourth chapters of the Book of the Etiquettes of Earning. This striving does not remove one from the stations of trust in God, provided there is no tranquility of the soul in one's own sufficiency, strength, status, or merchandise, for God the Exalted may destroy all of that in an instant. Rather, one's gaze should be upon the True Guarantor who preserves all of that and facilitates its means for him. Indeed, one should see his earnings, his merchandise, and his sufficiency in relation to the power of God the Exalted, just as one sees the pen in the hand of the king who seals; his gaze is not upon the pen, but upon the heart of the king: with what is it moved? Towards what does it incline? And with what does it decree? Furthermore, if this earner is earning for his dependents or to distribute to the poor, then he is earning with his body while his heart is detached from it; the state of such a person is more noble than the state of one who sits idle in his house. The proof that earning does not contradict the state of trust, provided its conditions are observed and it is accompanied by the spiritual state and knowledge as previously mentioned, is that when Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, was pledged allegiance as Caliph, he went out in the morning carrying garments under his arm and a measuring stick in his hand, and entered the market calling out [to sell them], until the Muslims disapproved and said, "How can you do this when you have been established in the succession of Prophethood?" He replied, "Do not distract me from [providing for] my dependents, for if I neglect them, I would be even more neglectful of others," until they assigned for him the sustenance of a Muslim household. When they agreed to that, he considered their assistance, pleasing their hearts, and devoting his time to the welfare of the Muslims to be more appropriate. It is impossible to say that al-Siddiq was not in the station of trust! Who is more deserving of this station than him? This indicates that he was trusting in God, not by virtue of abandoning earning and striving, but by virtue of severing attention to his own strength and sufficiency, and knowing that God is the Facilitator of earning and the Arranger of means, and by conditions he observed in the path of earning: being content with what suffices for need without excess, boastfulness, or hoarding, and without his dirham being dearer to him than the dirham of another. For whoever enters the market and his dirham is dearer to him than the dirham of another is covetous of this world and loves it, and trust is not sound except with renunciation of the world. Indeed, renunciation can be sound without trust, for trust is a station beyond renunciation.

Abu Ja'far al-Haddad—who was the shaykh of al-Junayd, may God have mercy on both of them—and who was among those who truly relied upon God, said:  
I concealed my reliance for twenty years, yet never left the marketplace: I would earn a dinar each day and would not keep a single daniq of it overnight, nor would I allow myself the comfort of even a qirat to enter the bathhouse; rather, I would give it all away before nightfall.  
Al-Junayd would not speak about reliance in his presence, and he would say: "I am ashamed to speak on the subject while he is present before me."  
Know that sitting in the Sufi hospices with a known provision is far from true reliance. If there is no known provision, but an endowment exists and the servant is instructed to go out seeking, then reliance alongside that is not sound except in a weak form—though it may be strengthened by one's spiritual state and knowledge, like the reliance of one who earns. But if they do not ask, and are content with what is brought to them, that is stronger in their reliance. However, after the people have become known for this practice, it has effectively become a market for them—like entering the marketplace—and one who enters the marketplace cannot be considered truly reliant except under many conditions, as previously mentioned.

If you ask: "Is it better to remain in one's home or to go out and earn a livelihood?" Then know that if one can devote oneself, by abandoning earning, to contemplation, remembrance, sincerity, and immersing one's time in worship, and if earning would disturb that state, and if, along with this, his soul does not eagerly anticipate people, waiting for someone to come in and bring him something—but rather his heart is strong in patience and reliance upon God, the Exalted—then remaining at home is preferable for him. But if his heart becomes agitated in the house and he eagerly anticipates people, then earning is preferable, because the heart's eager anticipation of people is a request made by the heart, and abandoning that is more important than abandoning earning. The truly reliant ones would not take what their souls eagerly anticipated. It is related that Ahmad ibn Hanbal once instructed Abu Bakr al-Marwazi to give something extra to a certain poor man beyond what he had hired him for. The man refused it. When he left, Ahmad said to him: "Catch up to him and give it to him, for he will accept it." He caught up to him and gave it, and he took it. Ahmad was asked about this and said: "His soul had eagerly anticipated it, so he refused. When he left, his hope was cut off and he despaired, so he took it." And al-Khawwas, may God have mercy on him, if he saw a servant in the context of giving or feared the soul becoming accustomed to it, would not accept anything from him. And al-Khawwas, after being asked about the most wondrous thing he had seen in his travels, said: "I saw al-Khidr and he was pleased with my companionship, but I parted from him fearing that my soul would find rest in him, which would be a deficiency in my reliance." Therefore, the one who earns, if he observes the proper manners and conditions of his intention in earning—as preceded in the Book of Earning—namely that he does not aim by it at amassing wealth, and his reliance is not upon his merchandise and sufficiency, then he is truly reliant.

If you ask: "What is the sign that one is not relying upon his merchandise and sufficiency?" I say: Its sign is that if his merchandise is stolen, or his trade incurs a loss, or some matter of his affairs is hindered, he is content with it, his tranquility is not nullified, and his heart is not agitated. Rather, the state of his heart in serenity is the same before and after. For if one does not find rest in a thing, one is not agitated by its loss. And whoever is agitated by the loss of something has indeed found rest in it. It is said that Bishr used to make spindles and then abandoned them. This was because a man from a distant land wrote to him: "It has reached me that you seek help for your provision through spindles. Tell me, if God were to take your hearing and sight, upon whom would the provision be?" This settled in his heart, so he took the tool of spindles from his hand and abandoned it. And it is said he abandoned them when his name became renowned and people sought him for them. And it is said he did that when his dependents died, just as Sufyan had fifty dinars with which he traded, and when his dependents died, he distributed them.

If you ask: How can one imagine having merchandise yet not find solace in it, knowing that earning without merchandise is impossible? I respond: By knowing that those whom God Almighty provides for without merchandise are many, and that those whose merchandise is abundant but stolen or lost are also many, and by conditioning oneself to believe that God only does what is good for him. If He destroys his merchandise, it is better for him, for perhaps if He left it, it would be a cause for corruption in his religion, and God Almighty has been gracious to him. At worst, he may die of hunger, and he should believe that dying of hunger is better for him in the Hereafter, whatever God Almighty decrees without negligence on his part. When he believes all this, the presence or absence of merchandise becomes equal to him. In the report: "Indeed, a servant may contemplate at night a matter of trade that, if he acted upon it, would lead to his ruin. Then God Almighty looks upon him from above His Throne and turns him away from it, sorrowful and grieving, blaming his neighbor and cousin: 'Who preceded me? Who outdid me?' Yet it is nothing but a mercy with which God has shown him mercy." Therefore, Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "I do not care whether I wake up rich or poor, for I do not know which is better for me." And whoever’s certainty in these matters is not complete cannot truly conceive of reliance (tawakkul). Hence, Abu Sulayman al-Darani said to Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari: "I have a share in every spiritual station except this blessed reliance, for I have not even caught a scent of it." This is his statement despite his high rank, and he did not deny that it is among the attainable stations, but he said: "I have not attained it," perhaps meaning its utmost degree. And unless faith is perfected in that there is no actor except God and no provider but Him, and that whatever He decrees for the servant—be it poverty, wealth, death, or life—is better for him than what the servant desires, the state of reliance will not be perfected based on strong faith in these matters—as previously mentioned. Likewise, all other stations of religion, in words and deeds, are built upon their foundations in faith. In summary, reliance is a comprehensible station, but it demands strength of heart and certainty. Therefore, Sahl said: "Whoever criticizes earning a livelihood criticizes the Sunnah, and whoever criticizes abandoning earning a livelihood criticizes monotheism."

If you ask: Is there a remedy that benefits in diverting the heart from relying upon apparent means and having good expectations of God, exalted is He, in the facilitation of hidden means? I say: Yes, it is that you know that bad expectations are the prompting of Satan, and good expectations are the prompting of God, exalted is He. God, exalted is He, said: "Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to immorality, while God promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty." For indeed, man by his nature is captivated by hearing the threats of Satan, and for that reason it is said: The one who is overly cautious is addicted to bad expectations. And when cowardice, weakness of heart, and observing those who depend upon apparent means and are driven by them are added to it, bad expectations prevail and reliance is completely nullified. Nay, even seeing provision as coming from hidden means also nullifies reliance. It is narrated concerning an ascetic that he secluded himself in a mosque and had no known means of sustenance. The imam said to him: "If you were to earn a living, it would be better for you." He did not answer him until he repeated it three times. On the fourth time, he said: "A Jew in the vicinity of the mosque has guaranteed me two loaves of bread each day." The imam said: "If he is truthful in his guarantee, then your seclusion in the mosque is better for you." The ascetic said: "O you, if you were not an imam standing between God and the servants with this deficiency in monotheism, it would be better for you, since you preferred the promise of a Jew over the guarantee of God, exalted is He, for provision."

And the imam of the mosque said to one of the worshippers: "From where do you eat?" He replied: "O elder, be patient until I repeat the prayer I prayed behind you, then I will answer you."

And what benefits good expectations regarding the arrival of provision from the bounty of God, exalted is He, through hidden means is that you hear the stories which contain the wonders of God's, exalted is He, craftsmanship in delivering provision to its recipient, and in them are the wonders of God's, exalted is He, overpowering in destroying the wealth of merchants and the rich and causing them to die of hunger. As is narrated from Hudhayfah al-Mar'ashi—who had served Ibrahim ibn Adham—when he was asked: "What is the most amazing thing you saw from him?" He said: "We remained on the road to Mecca for days without finding food. Then we entered Kufa and took shelter in a ruined mosque. Ibrahim looked at me and said: 'O Hudhayfah, I see hunger upon you.' I said: 'It is as the elder sees.' He said: 'Bring me an inkwell and paper.' So I brought it to him, and he wrote: 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. You are the One sought in every state, and the One indicated in every meaning.' And he wrote poetry:

I am a praiser, I am / I am hungry, I am
A thanker, I am a rememberer / Lost, I am naked
These are six, and I / So be the Guarantor
The Guarantor for half of them / For half of them, O Creator
My praise for other than You is a flame / So save Your servant from
A fire I have entered / Entering the Fire."

Then he handed me the note and said: "Go forth, and let not your heart cling to anything but God Almighty. Give this note to the first person you meet." I went out, and the first to meet me was a man upon a mule. I offered him the note, and he took it. When he read it, he wept and said: "What has become of the bearer of this note?" I replied: "He is in such-and-such mosque." He gave me a purse containing six hundred dinars. Then I met another man and inquired about the rider of the mule. He said: "That is a Christian." I returned to Ibrahim and informed him of the account. He said: "Do not touch it, for he shall come presently." After an hour had passed, the Christian entered, fell upon Ibrahim's head kissing it, and embraced Islam.

Abu Ya'qub al-Aqta' al-Basri said: Once I gathered in the Sacred Precinct for ten days and felt weakness, so my soul whispered to me to leave. I went out to the valley hoping to find something to soothe my weakness, and I saw a discarded piece of salted meat. I took it, but found unease in my heart from it, as if a voice said to me: "You have fasted ten days, and in the end your portion is a piece of spoiled meat." So I threw it away, entered the mosque, and sat down. Then behold, a non-Arab man approached until he sat before me, placed a bag, and said: "This is for you." I said: "Why have you singled me out for it?" He said: "Know that we were at sea for ten days, and the ship was on the verge of sinking, so I vowed that if God Almighty saved me, I would give this in charity to the first person from the residents I laid eyes upon. You are the first I have met." I said: "Open it." He opened it, and inside was Egyptian semolina, peeled almonds, and cone sugar. I took a handful of this and a handful of that and said: "Return the rest to your companions as a gift from me to you, for I have accepted it." Then I said to myself: "Your provision was coming to you from ten days away, and you were seeking it from the valley."

Mimshad al-Dinwari said: I had a debt that preoccupied my heart. Then I saw in a dream as if a speaker was saying: O miser, you have taken this amount as debt from Us—take upon yourself the taking, and upon Us the giving. After that, I never again reckoned accounts with a grocer, a butcher, or anyone else.

It is narrated from Bannan the Porter that he said: I was on the road to Mecca, coming from Egypt, and I had provisions with me. A woman came to me and said: "O Bannan, you are a porter who carries provisions on your back, yet you imagine that He does not provide for you." He said: So I cast away my provisions. Then three days passed during which I ate nothing. I found an anklet on the road and said to myself: I shall carry it until its owner comes; perhaps he will give me something and I will return it to him. Then, behold, that same woman appeared to me and said: "You are a merchant, saying 'Perhaps its owner will come so I may take something from him'!" Then she threw some dirhams to me and said: "Spend these." And they sufficed me until near Mecca.

It is recounted that Banan was in need of a servant girl to attend to him, so he appealed to his brothers, and they gathered the price for her. They said, "Here comes the caravan; we shall purchase what is suitable." When the caravan arrived, they unanimously agreed upon one girl and said, "She is fitting for him." They asked her owner, "For how much is this one?" He replied, "She is not for sale." They insisted, and he said, "She is for Banan the porter; a woman from Samarkand has sent her as a gift to him." She was then conveyed to Banan, and the story was related to him.

It is said: In ancient times, a man was on a journey with a single loaf of bread. He said, "If I eat it, I will die." So God, Mighty and Majestic, assigned an angel to him, commanding: "If he eats it, provide for him; but if he does not eat it, grant him no other sustenance." Thus, the loaf remained with him until he died without eating it, and the loaf was left by his side.

Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz said: I entered the desert without provisions and was struck by severe need. I saw a waystation from afar and rejoiced at reaching it, then I reflected within myself that I had become complacent and reliant on other than Him, and I vowed not to enter the waystation unless I was carried to it. So I dug a hole for myself in the sand and buried my body in it up to my chest. Then I heard a voice in the middle of the night calling loudly: "O people of the waystation, God Most High has a saint who has confined himself in this sand—join him to you." A group came and extracted me, carrying me to the village.

It is related that a man persistently attended at the door of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, when he heard someone say: "O you, have you emigrated to 'Umar or to God Most High? Go and learn the Qur'an, for it will suffice you from 'Umar's door." The man went away and was absent until 'Umar missed him. It turned out he had withdrawn and busied himself with worship. 'Umar came to him and said: "I have longed for you—what has occupied you from me?" He replied: "I recited the Qur'an and it sufficed me from 'Umar and the family of 'Umar." 'Umar said: "May God have mercy on you—what did you find in it?" He answered: "I found in it: 'And in heaven is your provision and what you are promised.' So I said: My provision is in heaven, yet I seek it on earth." 'Umar wept and said: "You have spoken the truth." Thereafter, 'Umar would come to him and sit with him.

Abu Hamzah al-Khurasani said: I performed pilgrimage one year, and as I was walking along the road, I fell into a well. My soul struggled with me to call for help, but I said, “No, by God, I will not call for help.” I had scarcely finished this thought when two men passed by the mouth of the well. One said to the other, “Come, let us cover the mouth of this well so that no one falls into it.” They brought reeds and clay and sealed the mouth of the well. I was about to cry out, but I said to myself, “To whom shall I cry? He is nearer than these two,” and I remained still. Then, after a while, something came, uncovered the mouth of the well, lowered its leg, and it was as if it were saying in a murmur I recognized, “Hold on to me.” So I held on, and it brought me out—and behold, it was a lion. It passed by me, and a voice called out to me, “O Abu Hamzah, is this not better? We saved you from ruin through ruin.” Then I walked on, saying:

My modesty before You restrained me from revealing my passion,
Yet You enriched me with understanding, sparing me the need for disclosure.
You graciously attended to my affairs, even in my absence, and such grace
Manifests my inner witness, for grace is attained through grace.
You appeared to me in the unseen, heralding the unseen that You are
So near, as if in the palm of my hand.
I see You, yet awe of You leaves me with a solitude for You,
Which You then soothe with Your tenderness and compassion.
And You revive a lover whose death lies in love for You—
How wondrous that life coexists with demise.

And such occurrences are many, and when faith in Him is strengthened and joined with the ability to endure hunger for a week's duration without distress of heart, and faith is fortified that if his provision is not brought to him within the week, then death is better for him in the sight of God Almighty—and for that reason He withholds it from him—then reliance upon God is achieved through these states and visions; otherwise, it is not attained at all.

Explanation of the Trustee's Reliance

Know that reliance is a station of the stations of faith, and it is the reliance of the heart on the One who is truly relied upon, namely God—exalted is He—in the acquisition of what is beneficial and the repulsion of what is harmful in the affairs of this world and the Hereafter, all of them. It is to entrust all matters to Him and to be convinced that He alone decrees, and that what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen.



Know that one who has dependents is judged differently from the solitary individual, for the solitary individual's trust in God is only valid with two conditions: first, the ability to endure hunger for a week without craving or distress of soul; and second, certain doors of faith we have mentioned, among them: that he reconcile his soul to death should his provision not come to him, knowing that his provision is death and hunger, and though this is a loss in this world, it is a gain in the hereafter, so he sees that the better of the two provisions for him is being brought to him—namely, the provision of the hereafter—and that this is the illness by which he dies and is content with it, and that it is thus decreed and destined for him. By this the solitary individual's trust is perfected. But it is not permissible to impose upon dependents patience in hunger, nor is it possible to establish in them faith in divine oneness and that death by hunger is a provision to be envied in itself, even if that occurs rarely; likewise with the other doors of faith. Therefore, in their regard, he can only adopt the trust of the earner, which is the third station, like the trust of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, when he went out to earn. As for entering the deserts and abandoning his dependents in the name of trust in their regard, or sitting idle from concern for their affairs in the name of trust in their regard, this is forbidden and may lead to their destruction, and he will be held accountable for them. Indeed, the truth is that there is no difference between him and his dependents; if his dependents assist him in enduring hunger for a period and in considering death by hunger as provision and booty in the hereafter, then he may place trust in their regard and in his own soul as well, for they are dependents in his care. It is not permissible for him to neglect them unless they assist him in enduring hunger for a period. If he cannot bear it and his heart becomes agitated and his worship disturbed, then trust is not valid for him. Thus it is related that Abu Turab al-Nakhshabi saw a Sufi reaching for a watermelon rind to eat after three days and said to him: "Asceticism is not suitable for you; stick to the market." That is, there is no asceticism except with trust.

True reliance (tawakkul) is only valid for one who can endure hunger for more than three days. Abu Ali al-Rudhbari said: "If a poor person says after five days, 'I am hungry,' then oblige him to go to the market and command him to work and earn, for indeed his body is his dependent, and his reliance in what harms his body is like his reliance concerning his dependents. He differs from them in only one matter: he may impose upon himself patience in hunger, but he may not do so for his dependents."

From this, it becomes clear to you that reliance is not an abandonment of means, but rather it is dependence upon patience in hunger for a period, and contentment with death should provision be delayed—though this is rare—and adherence to towns and cities, or adherence to deserts that are not devoid of vegetation and the like. All these are means of survival, yet with a kind of hardship, for one cannot persist in them except through patience. Reliance in cities is closer to means than reliance in deserts. All of that constitutes means, but people have turned to more apparent means and no longer consider those as means, due to the weakness of their faith, the intensity of their greed, their lack of patience with worldly hardship for the sake of the Hereafter, and the domination of cowardice over their hearts through ill thoughts and prolonged hopes.

Whoever contemplates the dominion of the heavens and the earth will have revealed to him with certainty that God, exalted is He, has arranged the kingdom and the dominion in such a way that a servant's provision does not escape him, even if he abandons agitation. For one incapable of agitation, his provision does not escape him. Do you not see the fetus in its mother's womb? When it was incapable of agitation, how was its navel connected to the mother so that the remnants of the mother's nourishment reach it via the umbilical cord? That was not by the stratagem of the fetus. Then, when it separated, love and compassion were imposed upon the mother to care for it, willingly or unwillingly, by a compelling disposition from God, exalted is He, through what He ignited in her heart of the fire of love. Then, when it had no teeth to chew food, its provision was made from milk, which requires no chewing. And because of the delicacy of its constitution, it could not bear dense nourishment, so gentle milk was made to flow in the mother's breast upon its separation, according to its need. Was this by the stratagem of the child or the mother? When it reached a state where dense nourishment suited it, incisors and molars grew for it for the purpose of chewing. When it grew and became independent, means of learning and treading the path of the Hereafter were made easy for it.

Thus, his cowardice after maturity is pure ignorance, for the means of his livelihood did not decrease with his maturity; rather, they increased. For he was not capable of earning, but now he has become capable, so his capability has increased. True, the one showing compassion was a single person—the mother or father—and their compassion was exceedingly intense, so they would feed and give him drink twice a day, and his feeding was by God, exalted is He, imposing love and compassion upon their hearts. Likewise, God has imposed compassion, affection, mercy, and tenderness upon the hearts of Muslims—indeed, upon all the people of a town—so much so that each one of them, if he senses a needy person, feels pain in his heart, softens toward him, and is stirred by an impulse to remove his need. The object of compassion was one, but now the objects of compassion are a thousand and more. They did not show compassion upon them because they saw him under the care of mother and father—a specific compassion—so they did not see him as needy. Had they seen him an orphan, God would have stirred an impulse of mercy in one of the Muslims or in a group, so that they would take him and care for him. To this day, in years of plenty, no orphan has been seen to have died of hunger, even though he is incapable of agitation and has no specific guardian, for God, exalted is He, is his guardian through the compassion He created in the hearts of His servants. So why should his heart be preoccupied with his provision after maturity, when it was not preoccupied in childhood, even though the compassionate one was single and the compassionate are now a thousand? True, the mother's compassion was stronger and more beneficial, but it was one, while the compassion of individuals among people, even if weak, yields from their collective what suffices the purpose. How many an orphan has God, exalted is He, facilitated a state for that is better than the state of one who has a father and mother! Thus, the weakness of individual compassion is compensated by the multitude of the compassionate and by abandoning luxury, restricting oneself to the measure of necessity.

The poet spoke well when he said:
The pen of divine decree has written, so movement and stillness are alike in what will be.
It is madness from you that you strive for provision, while the fetus is provided for in its blindness.

If you say: People provide for orphans because they see them as helpless in their childhood, but this one is an adult capable of earning, so they pay him no heed and say, "He is like us, so let him strive for himself?" I say: If this capable person is idle, then they are right—earning is incumbent upon him, and there is no meaning to trust in God in his case, for trust is among the stations of religion by which one is aided in devoting oneself to God Almighty. What has the idle to do with trust? But if he is occupied with God, frequenting a mosque or a house, and is diligent in knowledge and worship, then people do not blame him for abandoning earning, nor do they impose it upon him. Rather, his preoccupation with God Almighty confirms love for him in the hearts of people, so that they bring him more than his sufficiency. He need only not close the door nor flee to a mountain away from people. Never has it been seen to this day a scholar or worshipper who immersed his times in God Almighty while in the cities and died of hunger—not at all. Rather, if he wished to feed a group of people by his word, he would be able to do so. For whoever is for God Almighty, God Almighty is for him, and whoever occupies himself with God Almighty, God casts his love into the hearts of people and subjugates hearts for him, just as He subjugated the heart of a mother for her child. Indeed, God Almighty has arranged the dominion and the kingdom with an arrangement sufficient for the people of dominion and kingdom. So whoever witnesses this arrangement trusts in the Arranger, occupies himself with Him, believes, and looks to the Arranger of causes, not to the causes. Yes, He has arranged it such that there reaches the one occupied with Him sweet things, fat birds, delicate garments, and precious steeds perpetually without fail, and that may also occur in some circumstances. But He has arranged it such that there reaches every one occupied with the worship of God Almighty in every week a barley loaf or herbs to consume without fail. And the prevalent is that more than that reaches him, indeed what exceeds the measure of need and sufficiency reaches him. So there is no reason to abandon trust except the soul's desire for perpetual luxury, wearing soft garments, and consuming delicate foods, and that is not from the path of the Hereafter. That may not be attained without agitation, and it also, in the prevalent case, is not attained with agitation; rather, it occurs rarely. And in the rare, it may be attained without agitation. So the effect of agitation is weakness in the sight of one whose insight has opened. Therefore, he does not find tranquility in his agitation, but in the Arranger of dominion and kingdom, whose arrangement does not pass by a single one of His servants his provision, even if he settles, except rarely with a great rarity, the like of which may be imagined for the agitated. So when these matters become clear and he has strength in the heart and courage in the soul, it yields what al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, said when he said: "I wish that the people of Basra were among my dependents, and that a grain were for a dinar." And Wahb ibn al-Ward said: "If the sky were of brass and the earth of lead, and I worried about my provision, I would think I am a polytheist." So if you understand these matters, you understand that trust is a station comprehensible in itself and attainable for one who subdues his soul, and you know that whoever denies the foundation of trust and its possibility denies it out of ignorance. Beware lest you combine the two bankruptcies: bankruptcy from experiencing the station by taste, and bankruptcy from believing in it by knowledge. Then, upon you is contentment with the little and satisfaction with the sustenance, for it will come to you without fail even if you flee from it. And at that point, it is upon God to send your provision to you by the hand of one you do not reckon. If you occupy yourself with piety, you will witness by experience the truth of His saying, Almighty: "And whoever fears God, He will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he does not expect." (Quran 65:2-3) Except that He has not guaranteed to provide him with the meat of birds and delights of foods; He has only guaranteed the provision by which his life is sustained. And this guaranteed is bestowed upon everyone who occupies himself with the Guarantor and is content with His guarantee. For that which encompasses him from the hidden causes of provision by God's arrangement is greater than what has appeared to creation. Indeed, the avenues of provision are countless and its channels cannot be found, for its appearance is on earth and its cause is in heaven. God Almighty said: "And in heaven is your provision and what you are promised." (Quran 51:22) And the secrets of heaven are not disclosed. For this reason, a group entered upon al-Junayd and said: "What do you seek?" They said: "We seek provision." He said: "If you know in which place it is, then seek it." They said: "We ask God." He said: "If you know that He forgets you, then remind Him." They said: "We enter the house and trust and see what will be." He said: "Trust based on experience is doubt." They said: "So what is the remedy?" He said: "Abandoning the remedy." And Ahmad ibn 'Isa al-Kharraz said: "I was in the desert and severe hunger afflicted me, so my soul overcame me to ask God Almighty for food. I said: 'This is not from the actions of the trusting.' Then it demanded that I ask God for a loaf. When I was about to do that, I heard a caller calling to me and saying:

'And he claims he is from us, while I do not lose one who comes to us.
And he asks us in hardship as if we do not see him nor are seen by him.'"

You have understood that one whose soul is broken, whose heart is strengthened and whose inner being is not weakened by cowardice, and whose faith in the management of God, Exalted is He, is strong, will always be a soul at peace, trusting in God, Mighty and Majestic. For the worst of his states is that he dies, and death must come to him just as it comes to one who is not at peace. Therefore, the perfection of trust in God lies in contentment on one hand and fulfillment of what is guaranteed on the other. He who has guaranteed the provision of those content with these means which He has arranged is truthful, so be content and try, and you will witness the truth of the promise being realized through the wondrous provisions that come to you, which were not in your expectation or calculation. In your trust, do not be one who awaits the means, but rather the Causer of the means, just as you would not be one who awaits the pen of the scribe, for He is the origin of the pen's movement. The First Mover is One, so the gaze should be directed only towards Him. This is the condition for the trust of one who traverses deserts without provisions or sits in cities while being obscure.

As for the one who has a reputation for worship and knowledge, if he is content in the day and night with food once, however it may be, even if it is not from the delights, and with a coarse garment befitting the people of religion, then his provision comes to him from where he expects and does not expect, constantly; indeed, multiples of it come to him. For him to abandon trust and be concerned with provision is the utmost weakness and shortcoming. For his fame due to an apparent cause that brings provision to him is stronger than the entering of cities for the obscure one with earning. Concern for provision is unbecoming for the desert-dweller in religion, and it is more unbecoming for the scholars, for their condition is contentment. The content scholar, his provision and the provision of a large group, if they are with him, comes to him, unless he wishes not to take from the hands of people and to eat from his own earnings. That has an aspect suitable for the practicing scholar whose conduct is by the outward knowledge and action, and who has no journeying in the inward: for earning prevents journeying with inward thought. His occupation with spiritual conduct while taking from the hand of one who seeks nearness to God, Exalted is He, through what he gives is more appropriate, because it is devotion to God, Mighty and Majestic, and an aid to the giver in attaining reward.

Whoever looks to the courses of God's, Exalted is He, custom knows that provision is not according to the measure of the means. For this reason, one of the Khosraus asked a sage about the fool who is provided for and the intelligent one who is deprived. He said: "The Maker intended to point to Himself, for if every intelligent one were provided for and every fool deprived, it would be thought that intelligence provided for its possessor. When they saw the contrary, they knew that the Provider is other than them, and there is no trust in the apparent means for them." The poet said:

If sustenance were contingent upon intellect, then beasts would perish in their ignorance.

An Exposition of the States of Those Who Rely Upon God in Their Connection to Means

He strikes an example

Know that the likeness of creation with God Almighty is as a group of beggars who stood in a courtyard before the door of a king's palace, in need of food. He sent out to them many servants carrying loaves of bread, commanding them to give some two loaves each, others one loaf each, and to strive not to overlook any one of them. He commanded a herald to call out among them: "Be still and do not cling to my servants when they come out to you. Rather, each of you should remain content in his place, for the servants are subservient and are commanded to deliver your sustenance to you. Whoever clings to the servants, harms them, and takes two loaves—when the courtyard gate is opened and he leaves, a servant will be assigned to follow him, entrusted with him until I proceed to punish him at a known appointment I have set, and I will conceal him. And whoever does not harm the servants and is content with one loaf that comes to him from the servant's hand while he is still—I will single him out for a noble robe at the aforementioned appointment for the other's punishment. And whoever remains steadfast in his place but takes two loaves, there is no punishment for him nor a robe for him. And whoever my servants miss, so they deliver nothing to him, and he spends the night hungry without resenting the servants or saying, 'If only he had delivered a loaf to me,' then tomorrow I will appoint him as my vizier and entrust my kingdom to him."

Thus the beggars were divided into four categories: A category whose bellies overcame them, so they paid no heed to the promised punishment, saying, "From today until tomorrow is a relief! We are hungry now." So they rushed at the servants, harmed them, and took the two loaves. The punishment overtook them at the mentioned appointment, and they regretted, but their regret availed them not. And a category refrained from clinging to the servants out of fear of punishment, but they took two loaves due to the overpowering of hunger, so they were safe from punishment but did not attain the robe. And a category said, "We will sit within sight of the servants so they do not miss us, but we will take, when they give us, one loaf and be content with it, so that perhaps we may attain the robe." And they attained the robe. And a fourth category hid in the corners of the courtyard and turned away from the sight of the servants, saying, "If they follow us and give us, we will be content with one loaf. And if they miss us, we will endure the severity of hunger tonight, so that perhaps we may find strength to abandon resentment and attain the rank of vizier and the degree of nearness to the king." But that did not benefit them, for the servants followed them into every corner and gave each one a single loaf.

And this pattern continued for days, until it happened rarely that three hid in a corner and the servants' glances did not fall upon them, being preoccupied with a distraction that prevented a lengthy search. So they spent the night in severe hunger. Two of them said, "If only we had presented ourselves to the servants and taken our sustenance, for we cannot bear patience." And the third remained silent until morning, and he attained the degree of nearness and the vizierate.

This is the likeness of creation. The courtyard is life in this world. The gate of the courtyard is death. The unknown appointment is the Day of Resurrection. The promise of the vizierate is the promise of martyrdom for the one who relies [on God] if he dies hungry and content, without delaying that until the appointment of the Resurrection, for the martyrs are alive with their Lord, receiving provision. The one who clings to the servants is the transgressor in [seeking] means. The subservient servants are the means. Those sitting in the open part of the courtyard within sight of the servants are those residing in towns, in ribats and mosques, in a state of stillness. Those hiding in the corners are the wanderers in the deserts in a state of reliance [on God]; the means follow them and sustenance comes to them, except on rare occasions. If one of them dies hungry and content, he has martyrdom and nearness to God Almighty.

And creation has been divided into these four categories. Perhaps out of every hundred, ninety cling to means, and of the remaining ten, seven reside in towns, exposing themselves to means merely by their presence and visibility, and three wander in the deserts. And two resent, and one attains nearness. And perhaps it was so in past ages. But as for now, the one who abandons means does not reach one in ten thousand.

The Second Chapter on Engaging in Means of Accumulation: For one who attains wealth through inheritance, earning, asking, or any other means, there are three states regarding accumulation: The first is to take only what suffices for his immediate need—eating if hungry, clothing if naked, purchasing a modest dwelling if in need—and to distribute the remainder promptly. He should not take or save except to the extent that he attains what is rightfully his, storing it with this intention. This is the one who fulfills the requirement of trust in God in its truest sense, and it is the highest degree.

The second state, which is the opposite of this exemption from the bounds of trust in God: is to store provisions for a year or more, for this is not from the trusting at all; and it has been said: None store among living creatures except three: the mouse, the ant, and the son of Adam.

The third scenario: when one stores provisions for forty days or less. Does this necessitate deprivation from the praiseworthy station promised in the Hereafter for those who rely on God? Scholars have differed on this matter. Sahl held that it removes one from the bounds of reliance. The elite scholars maintained that storing for forty days does not remove one from reliance, but exceeding forty days does. Abu Talib al-Makki said that even exceeding forty days does not remove one from reliance. This disagreement is meaningless once the permissibility of storing itself is conceded. Indeed, one might suppose that the very act of storing contradicts reliance, but setting a specific limit thereafter has no basis. Every reward promised for a certain spiritual rank is distributed according to that rank, and each rank has a beginning and an end. Those at the end are called the "Foremost," and those at the beginning are the "Companions of the Right Hand." The Companions of the Right Hand themselves have various degrees, as do the Foremost. The highest degrees of the Companions of the Right Hand border the lowest degrees of the Foremost. Therefore, setting a specific limit in such matters is meaningless. Rather, the reality is that reliance, through abandoning storage, is only perfected by curtailing hope. As for the complete absence of hope for survival, it is far-fetched to require it, even in one's inner self, for that is nearly impossible to attain. People vary in the length of their hope: the shortest span is a day and a night, or even less in hours; the longest is what one imagines to be a human lifespan. Between these are countless degrees. One who hopes for more than a month is closer to the objective than one who hopes for a year. Restricting it to forty days, based on the appointment of Moses (peace be upon him), is far-fetched, for that incident was not intended to specify the permissible extent of hope. Rather, Moses' deserving of the promised attainment was only completed after forty days due to a divine wisdom, in accordance with God's customary way of gradual progression in matters, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "God kneaded Adam's clay with His hand for forty mornings," because that clay's deserving of kneading was contingent upon that mentioned duration. Therefore, storing for beyond a year is only done due to weakness of heart and reliance on apparent causes, thus falling outside the station of reliance, lacking trust in the encompassing management of the True Agent over the hidden aspects of causes. For the means of income, through harvests and alms, typically recur with the passing of years. One who stores for less than a year has a degree according to the brevity of his hope. One whose hope is two months does not have the same degree as one whose hope is a month or three months; rather, his rank lies between them. Nothing prevents storage except short hope. The best is not to store at all, but if one's heart is weak, the less he stores, the greater his virtue. It is narrated concerning a poor man whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered Ali and Usamah (may God be pleased with them) to wash, and they washed him and shrouded him in his cloak. After burying him, the Prophet said to his companions: "He will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with a face like the moon on a full-moon night. Were it not for one trait he had, he would be resurrected with a face like the shining sun." We asked: "What is it, O Messenger of God?" He said: "He used to fast, pray at night, and remember God much, but when winter came, he would store his summer garment for his summer, and when summer came, he would store his winter garment for his winter." Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Rather, the least you have been given is certainty and resolve of patience." The jug, knife, and what is constantly needed are not in the same category, for storing them does not lower one's degree. As for a winter garment, it is not needed in summer. This applies to one whose heart is not disturbed by abandoning storage and whose soul does not yearn for the hands of creation, but whose heart turns only to the True Agent. If one feels inner agitation that distracts his heart from worship, remembrance, and reflection, then storage is preferable for him. Indeed, if he holds an estate yielding sufficient income for his needs, and his heart finds tranquility only thereby, that is preferable for him, for the objective is to rectify the heart so it may devote itself to the remembrance of God. One person may be distracted by the presence of wealth, another by its absence. The danger lies in what distracts from God Almighty. Otherwise, the world in itself is not dangerous, neither its presence nor its absence. For this reason, the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) was sent to all kinds of people, including merchants, professionals, and craftsmen. He did not command merchants to abandon their trade, nor the professional to abandon his profession, nor did he command one who left both to engage in them. Rather, he called all to God Almighty and guided them that their success and salvation lie in turning their hearts from the world to God Almighty. The essence of devotion to God Almighty is the heart. Therefore, the correct course for the weak is to store according to his need, just as the correct course for the strong is to abandon storage. All this pertains to the individual. As for the provider, he does not exceed the bounds of reliance by storing a year's provision for his dependents, to compensate for their weakness and calm their hearts. Storing more than that invalidates reliance, because means recur with the passing of years. Storing beyond that is due to weakness of his heart, which contradicts the strength of reliance. The reliant is one who affirms God's oneness, with a strong heart and a soul tranquil in the grace of God Almighty, trusting in His management without dependence on apparent causes. The Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) stored a year's provision for his dependents, but he forbade Umm Ayman and others from storing anything for him for the morrow, and he forbade Bilal from storing a piece of bread he had saved to break his fast with, saying: "Spend, O Bilal, and do not fear diminution from the Lord of the Throne."

He said, peace be upon him: "When asked, do not withhold, and when giving, do not conceal," following the example of the master of those who rely [on God], peace be upon him. And he had shortened his hope to such an extent that when he would urinate, he would perform dry ablution despite the proximity of water, saying, "How do I know? Perhaps I will not reach it."

And the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, if he had stored provisions, it would not have diminished from his trust in God, for he did not place his reliance in what he stored. However, he, peace be upon him, refrained from it as an instruction for the strong among his community, for the strong of his community are weak in comparison to his strength. And he, peace be upon him, stored provisions for his family for a year, not due to any weakness of heart in him or in his family. But this is not for the weak among his community. Rather, he informed us: "Indeed, God loves that His concessions be taken just as He loves that His obligations be taken," to comfort the hearts of the weak, so that their weakness does not lead them to despair and despondency, causing them to abandon the good that is within their capability due to their inability to reach the highest degrees. For the Messenger of God was sent only as a mercy to all the worlds, all of them, despite the differences in their kinds and their degrees. And when you understand this, you know that storing provisions may harm some people and may not harm others. This is indicated by what Abu Umamah al-Bahili narrated: that one of the People of the Suffah passed away and no shroud was found for him. The Prophet said: "Search his garment." They found two dinars inside his waist-wrapper. The Prophet said: "Two branding marks." Yet other Muslims would die and leave behind wealth, and he would not say that about them. This admits of two interpretations because his situation admits of two possibilities: One is that he meant two branding marks from the Fire, as God Almighty said: "Their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded with it." This is if his situation was one of displaying asceticism and poverty while concealing wealth from it, which is a kind of deception. The second is that it was not due to deception. Then the meaning is a deficiency from his degree of perfection, just as two branding marks on a face diminish from its beauty. This would not be due to deception. For everything a man leaves behind is a deficiency from his degree in the Hereafter, for no one is given anything from it except that an equivalent amount is diminished from his Hereafter. As for clarifying that storing provisions, with the heart being detached from what is stored, does not necessarily invalidate trust in God, what is narrated from Bishr bears witness to it. Al-Husayn al-Mughazili, one of his companions, said: I was with him in the forenoon when a middle-aged, dark-skinned man with sparse facial hair entered upon him. Bishr stood up for him—and I never saw him stand for anyone else. He said: And he handed me a handful of dirhams and said: "Buy for us from the finest, most excellent food you can find." And he had never said anything like that to me before. He said: So I brought the food and placed it. He ate with him—and I never saw him eat with anyone else. He said: We ate our fill and much food remained. The man took it, gathered it in his garment, carried it with him, and departed. I was astonished at that and disapproved of it for him. Bishr said to me: "Perhaps you found his action objectionable?" I said: "Yes, he took the leftover food without permission." He said: "That is our brother Fath al-Mawsili. He visited us today from Mosul. He only intended to teach us that when trust in God is sound, storing provisions does not harm it."

The Third Section on Employing Means to Ward Off Harm That Threatens Fear: Know that harm may threaten fear in one's soul or property, and it is not a condition of trust in God to abandon means of warding it off entirely. As for the soul, such as sleeping in a land infested with wild beasts, or in the pathways of a valley's flood, or beneath a leaning wall and a collapsing roof—all of this is forbidden, and one who does so exposes himself to destruction without benefit. Indeed, these means are divided into those that are certain, those that are presumed, and those that are illusory. Abandoning the illusory ones is a condition of trust in God; these are akin to the relation of amulets and incantations to warding off harm. For cauterization and incantations have preceded in averting danger to repel what is anticipated, and they may be used after harm has befallen to remove it. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, described those who trust in God only by their abandonment of cauterization, incantations, and omens, but he did not describe them as, when going out to a cold place, not wearing a cloak. A cloak is worn to ward off anticipated cold, and likewise all similar means. However, fortifying oneself by eating garlic, for example, when setting out on a journey in winter to stir the strength of inner heat, may be akin to delving deeply into means and relying on them, nearly approaching cauterization, unlike the cloak. As for abandoning means of warding off harm, even if they are certain, there is an aspect if harm comes from a person. For if one can endure and can also repel and seek redress, the condition of trust in God is to bear and endure patiently. God Almighty said: "So take Him as your trustee and be patient over what they say."

And He, the Exalted, said: "And we shall surely endure whatever harm you cause us, and in Allah let the reliant place their trust."

And He, the Exalted, said: "Leave their harm and place your trust in God."

And He, the Exalted, said: "So be patient as the resolute among the messengers were patient."

And God Almighty said: "Excellent is the reward of the workers, those who are patient and upon their Lord they rely." This pertains to the harm from people. As for patience regarding the harm from snakes, predatory beasts, and scorpions, refraining from repelling them is not part of reliance at all, for there is no benefit in it. Neither is striving intended, nor is striving abandoned for its own sake, but rather to aid in religion. The arrangement of means here is like their arrangement in seeking livelihood and securing benefits, so we shall not prolong by repetition. Likewise, regarding the means that protect wealth, reliance is not diminished by locking the door of the house when leaving, nor by hobbling the camel, for these are means known through God's established way, either with certainty or presumption. For this reason, He said to the Bedouin when he neglected his camel and said, 'I have relied upon God,' 'Tie it and rely.'

And He, the Exalted, said: "Take your precautions."

And He said regarding the manner of the prayer of fear: "And let them take their weapons."

And He, the Exalted, said: "And prepare for them whatever you are able of strength and of tethered horses."

And God said to Moses, peace be upon him: "So set forth with My servants by night." Seeking refuge in the night is a concealment from the eyes of enemies and a form of taking means. The concealment of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in the cave was a concealment from the eyes of enemies to repel harm. Taking a weapon during prayer is not a definitive repellant, like killing a snake or a scorpion, for that is a definitive repellant. Rather, taking a weapon is a presumed means, and we have clarified that the presumed is like the definitive. It is only the illusory that necessitates its abandonment in reliance [on God].

If you say: It has been narrated of a group that among them was one who placed a lion's paw upon his shoulder and did not move,
I say: And it has been narrated of a group that they mounted a lion and subdued it. Yet you should not let that station deceive you,
for even if it is genuine in itself, it is not suitable for emulation as a path to be learned from another.
Rather, that is an elevated station among spiritual graces, and it is not a condition for trust in God. Within it are mysteries that none can comprehend who has not attained to it.

If you ask: Is there a sign by which I may know that I have reached it? I say: The one who has arrived has no need to seek signs. Yet among the signs preceding that station is that the dog which is with you in your own skin—called Anger—is subdued for you. It does not cease biting you and biting others. If this dog is subdued for you, so that when it is stirred and unleashed it is only unleashed at your signal and is under your command, then perhaps your rank will rise until the lion, which is the king of beasts, is subdued for you. The dog of your home is more deserving of being subdued for you than the dog of the wilderness, and the dog within your skin is more deserving of being tamed than the dog of your home. If the inner dog is not subdued for you, then do not hope to subdue the outward dog.

If you ask: When the one who relies on God takes up his weapon out of caution against the enemy, locks his door out of caution against the thief, and ties up his camel out of caution that it may run loose—by what consideration is he then considered a true reliant? I say: He is a reliant by knowledge and by state. As for knowledge, it is that if the thief is repelled, he is not repelled by one’s own sufficiency in locking the door, but rather he is repelled only by the repelling of God, exalted is He. For how many a door is locked yet avails not, how many a camel is tied yet dies or escapes, and how many a one who takes up his weapon is killed or overcome. Therefore, do not rely on these means at all, but rely on the Causer of causes, as we gave the example of the agent in a lawsuit: if he attends and brings the document, he does not rely on himself and his document, but relies on the sufficiency and power of the agent. As for the state, it is that he be content with what God, exalted is He, decrees for his house and his self, and says: O God, if You empower over me one who takes what is in the house in Your way, and I am content with Your judgment, for I do not know whether what You gave me was a gift so that You would not take it back, or a loan and a trust so that You would reclaim it. Nor do I know whether it was my provision or whether Your pre-eternal will had preceded that it be the provision of another. However You decree, I am content with it. I did not lock the door to fortify against Your decree or in displeasure with it, but in accordance with the requirement of Your customary way in arranging the means. There is no trust except in You, O Causer of causes. If this is his state and that which we mentioned is his knowledge, he does not depart from the bounds of reliance by tying the camel, taking the weapon, and locking the door. Then, if he returns and finds his property in the house, he ought to have a fresh favor from God, exalted is He, in his regard. And if he does not find it but finds it stolen, then look to his heart. If he finds it content or joyful in that, knowing that God, exalted is He, only took that from him to increase his provision in the Hereafter, then his station in reliance is sound and his sincerity has become manifest to him. But if his heart is pained by it and he finds the strength of patience, then it has become clear to him that he was not truthful in his claim of reliance, because reliance is a station after renunciation, and renunciation is only sound from one who does not grieve over what has passed of the world nor rejoice over what comes, but rather is the opposite of that. So how can reliance be sound for him? Indeed, the station of patience may be sound for him if he conceals it and does not show his complaint, and does not exert himself excessively in seeking and investigating. But if he is not capable of that, so that his heart is distressed, he shows complaint with his tongue, and exhausts his body in pursuit, then the theft has become an increase in his sin from the perspective that his shortcoming in all stations and his falsehood in all claims have become apparent to him. After this, he ought to strive earnestly so that he does not deem his soul truthful in its claims nor lower himself by the rope of its deception; for it is deceitful, commanding to evil, and claiming good.

If you ask: How can one who relies on God possess wealth such that it may be taken? I say: The one who relies on God is not without some belongings in his home—such as a bowl from which he eats, a cup from which he drinks, a vessel for ablution, a sack to store his provisions, a staff to ward off his enemy, and other necessities of life from the furnishings of a house. Wealth may also come into his hand, and he holds it to find a needy person and direct it to him. Storing for this intention does not invalidate his reliance, nor is it a condition of reliance to discard the cup from which he drinks or the sack containing his provisions. That applies rather to food and any wealth exceeding the measure of necessity, for the way of God flows with goodness reaching the poor who rely on Him in the corners of mosques. Yet the established way does not entail distributing cups and belongings every day or every week, and departing from the way of God Almighty is not a condition of reliance. Therefore, the elect would take on journey a rope, a water-skin, scissors, and a needle, but not provisions, for the way of God Most High flows with a distinction between the two matters.

If you ask: How can one conceive of not grieving when his possessions, which he needs, are taken, and not lamenting their loss? If he does not desire them, why did he keep them and lock the door upon them? And if he kept them because he desires them due to his need for them, how can his heart not be pained nor grieve when he is prevented from what he desires? I say: He only preserved them to aid him in his religion, for he thought that what was best for him was to have those possessions. Had it not been that what was best for him lay in them, God the Exalted would not have provided them nor given them to him. He inferred this from God the Almighty’s facilitation and from having good thoughts of God the Exalted, along with his belief that it would assist him in the means of his religion—though this was not certain to him, for it is possible that what is best for him is to be tested by losing it, so that he strives in attaining his aim and his reward for the effort and toil becomes greater. When God the Exalted took it from him by the thief’s seizure, his assumption changed, for in all circumstances he is trusting in God and has good thoughts of Him. Thus he says: Had God the Almighty not known that what was best for me was its presence until now, and what is best for me now is its absence, He would not have taken it from me. With this assumption, it is conceivable that grief is repelled from him, for through it he departs from rejoicing in means merely because they are means, but rather rejoices because the Causer of causes has made them easy out of care and gentleness. He is like a sick person in the hands of a compassionate physician, content with what he does. If food is brought to him, he rejoices and says: Had he not known that food benefits me and that I have strength to bear it, he would not have brought it near to me. And if food is withheld from him after that, he also rejoices and says: Had food not harmed me and led me to death, he would not have come between me and it. Whoever does not believe in God the Exalted’s gentleness as the sick person believes in the skillful, compassionate parent who knows medicine, his trust is not sound at all. And whoever knows God the Exalted, knows His actions, and knows His way in rectifying His servants does not rejoice in means, for he does not know which means are better for him, as ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: “I do not care whether I wake up rich or poor, for I do not know which of them is better for me.” Likewise, the one who trusts should not care whether his possessions are stolen or not, for he does not know which is better for him in this world or the next. How many a worldly possession becomes a cause of man’s ruin! And how many a rich person is afflicted by a calamity because of his wealth, saying: “Would that I were poor!”

Explanation of the Etiquette for Those Who Trust in God When Their Possessions Are Stolen

The one who relies on God has etiquettes regarding his household possessions when he leaves them: The first is to lock the door, yet not to be excessive in the means of safeguarding, such as seeking a guarantee from neighbors for protection along with locking, or gathering many locks; for indeed, Malik ibn Dinar would not lock his door but would only tie it with a cord and say: "Were it not for the dogs, I would not have tied it either."

The second is that one should not leave in the house any possession that would incite thieves, thereby becoming the cause of their sin, or its retention becoming the reason for stirring their desire. For this reason, when al-Mughirah gifted a drinking vessel to Malik bin Yinar, he said, "Take it, I have no need for it." He was asked, "Why?" He replied, "The enemy whispers to me that a thief will take it." Thus, he guarded against causing the thief to sin and against occupying his own heart with the devil's whisperings about its theft. For this reason, Abu Sulayman said, "This is from the weakness of the Sufis' hearts; this one has renounced the world, so what is upon him if it is taken?"

Third: Regarding what one is compelled to leave behind in the house, it is fitting that upon departing, one intends contentment with whatever God decrees concerning it, whether by permitting a thief to seize it, and to say: "Whatever the thief takes is lawful for him from me, or it is in the path of God Almighty." If the thief is poor, it is charity upon him; and if poverty is not stipulated, it is even more preferable. Thus, he will have two intentions should it be taken by a rich or poor person: one, that his wealth becomes a barrier against sin, for perhaps the thief becomes self-sufficient by it and thereafter refrains from theft, and his transgression of consuming the unlawful is removed because he made it lawful for him; and second, that he does not wrong another Muslim, so his wealth becomes a ransom for the wealth of another Muslim. Whenever one intends to guard the wealth of another with his own wealth, or intends to repel sin from the thief or alleviate it for him, he has indeed given sincere counsel to the Muslims and complied with the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or oppressed." Helping the oppressor is by preventing him from oppression, and forgiving him is the elimination of oppression and a restraint against it. Let it be realized that this intention does not harm him in any way, for there is nothing in it that empowers the thief or alters the eternal decree; rather, his intention is realized through detachment. If his wealth is taken, he receives for every dirham seven hundred dirhams because he intended and aimed for it; and if it is not taken, he still attains the reward, as narrated from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) concerning one who refrains from withdrawal and allows the sperm to settle: he receives the reward of a child born from that intercourse who lives and is killed in the path of God Almighty, even if no child is born to him, because the matter of the child is merely the act of intercourse. As for creation, life, provision, and permanence, they are not within his control. Had a child been created, his reward would be for what he did, and his action is not nullified. Similarly is the matter of theft.

Fourth: If one finds his wealth stolen, he should not grieve; rather, he should rejoice if possible and say: "Had it not been that the best choice was in it, God Almighty would not have deprived me of it." Then, if he had not already designated it for the path of God Almighty, he should not be excessive in seeking it or in harboring ill thoughts toward Muslims. If he had designated it for the path of God, he should abandon seeking it, for he has advanced it as a provision for himself in the Hereafter. If it is returned to him, it is preferable not to accept it after having designated it for the path of God Almighty. If he does accept it, it remains his property according to apparent knowledge, because ownership is not nullified merely by that intention, but it is not beloved among those who rely on God.

It has been related that Ibn ‘Umar’s she-camel was stolen, and he searched for it until he grew weary. Then he said, “It is in the path of God, the Exalted,” and he entered the mosque and prayed two units of prayer therein. A man came to him and said, “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman, your she-camel is in such-and-such a place.” He put on his sandals and stood up, then said, “I seek forgiveness from God,” and sat down. He was asked, “Will you not go and take it?” He replied, “I had already said, ‘It is in the path of God.’”

And one of the shaykhs said: I saw one of my brothers in a dream after his death, so I asked: "What has God done with you?" He replied: "He forgave me and admitted me into Paradise, and my dwellings therein were shown to me, and I beheld them." Yet, he was, despite that, sorrowful and grieved! I said: "You have been forgiven and entered Paradise, yet you are grieved?" He sighed deeply and then said: "Yes, I remain grieved until the Day of Resurrection." I asked: "Why?" He said: "When I saw my dwellings in Paradise, elevated stations in the highest realms were raised for me, the like of which I had not seen among all I beheld, and I rejoiced in them. But when I was about to enter them, a caller called from above: 'Turn him away from it, for this is not for him; it is only for one who fulfilled the path.' I asked: 'And what is fulfilling the path?' I was told: 'You used to say of something that it was in the path of God, then you would retract it. Had you fulfilled the path, We would have fulfilled it for you.'"

It was narrated that one of the devout worshippers in Mecca was sleeping beside a man who had a purse with him. The man awoke and found his purse missing, so he accused him of taking it. The worshipper asked him, "How much was in your purse?" The man told him, and the worshipper brought out that amount from his own home and weighed it for him from his own wealth. Later, the man's companions informed him that they had taken the purse as a jest with him. So the man came with his companions and returned the gold, but the worshipper refused, saying, "Take it as lawful and pure, for I would never take back wealth I have given out in the path of God, the Almighty." When he still would not accept it, they insisted. So he called his son and began wrapping the gold into parcels and sending them to the poor until nothing of it remained.

Thus were the manners of the pious predecessors. Likewise, if one took a loaf to give to a poor person, but that person was absent, he would dislike returning it to the house after having brought it out; instead, he would give it to another poor person. And so he would do with dirhams, dinars, and all other forms of charity.

The fifth: It is the lowest of degrees that he does not invoke harm upon the thief who wronged him by taking his property. If he does so, his trust in God is nullified, and that indicates his displeasure and regret over what was lost, and his asceticism is invalidated. Even if he persists, his reward for what was taken is also nullified; for in the report: "Whoever invokes harm upon one who wronged him has taken his own revenge."

It is recounted that Rabīʿ ibn Khuthaym had a horse stolen from him, valued at twenty thousand, while he was standing in prayer. He did not break his prayer nor was he disturbed by its loss. People came to offer him condolences, and he said, "Indeed, I had seen him untying it." It was asked, "What prevented you from stopping him?" He replied, "I was engaged in what is more beloved to me than that"—meaning the prayer. They began to invoke curses upon the thief, but he said, "Do not do so; speak good instead, for I have made it a charity for him."

It was said to one of them concerning something that had been stolen from him: "Will you not invoke a curse upon your oppressor?" He replied: "I would not love to be an aid to Satan against him." It was said: "What if it were returned to you?" He said: "I would not take it nor look upon it, for I had already made it lawful for him."

And it was said to another: "Pray to God against your oppressor." He said: "No one has oppressed me." Then he said: "He has only oppressed himself. Is it not enough for the poor wretch that he has oppressed himself, that I should add evil to him?"

Many of them excessively reviled al-Hajjaj among some of the early pious predecessors due to his tyranny, and it was said: Do not drown in reviling him, for indeed Allah the Exalted will exact retribution for al-Hajjaj from whoever violates his honor, just as He will exact retribution from him for whoever seizes his wealth and blood.

In the hadith: "Verily, a servant may commit an injustice, and he will not cease to revile and insult the one he wronged until it equals the measure of his own wrongdoing. Then, the one wronged retains a rightful claim against the wrongdoer for what exceeded that measure, and it will be exacted from the wrongdoer."

The sixth: to grieve on account of the thief, his disobedience, and his exposure to the punishment of God Most High, and to thank God Most High for having made him the one wronged and not the wrongdoer, and for having made that a deficiency in his worldly life, not a deficiency in his religion. For a certain man complained to a scholar that someone had waylaid him and taken his wealth. The scholar said: "If you are not grieved that there has appeared among the Muslims one who deems this permissible, more than you are grieved for your wealth, then you have not given sincere counsel to the Muslims."

He stole dinars from Ali ibn al-Fadil while he was circumambulating the House, and his father saw him weeping and grieving. He said, "Are you weeping over the dinars?" He replied, "No, by God, but over the poor man who will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection and have no excuse."

It was said to one of them: "Invoke a curse upon the one who wronged you." He replied: "I am too occupied with grieving over him to invoke against him."

These are the moral qualities of the pious predecessors, may God be pleased with them all.

The Fourth Art: On Endeavoring to Remove Harm, Such as Treating Illness and the Like. Know that the causes which remove illness are also divided into: that which is certain, such as water removing the harm of thirst and bread removing the harm of hunger; that which is presumed, such as phlebotomy, cupping, drinking purgative medicine, and all other branches of medicine—I mean treating coldness with heat and heat with coldness, which are the apparent causes in medicine; and that which is illusory, such as cauterization and incantation. As for the certain, abandoning it is not from reliance [on God]; rather, abandoning it is forbidden when death is feared. As for the illusory, the condition of reliance is to abandon it, for by this the Messenger of God ﷺ described those who rely [on Him]. The strongest of these is cauterization, followed by incantation, and divination is the last of their degrees. Depending upon them and relying on them is the utmost immersion in observing causes. As for the intermediate degree, which is the presumed, such as treatment by the apparent causes according to physicians, its practice is not contradictory to reliance, unlike the illusory, and its abandonment is not prohibited, unlike the certain. Rather, it may be better than its practice in some circumstances and for some individuals; thus it is on a level between the two degrees. That treatment is not contradictory to reliance is indicated by the practice, saying, and command of the Messenger of God ﷺ. As for his saying, he ﷺ said: "There is no disease except that it has a cure; one who knows it knows it, and one who is ignorant of it is ignorant of it, except for death."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Seek treatment, O servants of God, for God created the disease and the cure."

He was asked about remedies and incantations: do they avert anything from the decree of God? He said: "They are from the decree of God."

And in the famous report: "I did not pass by any assembly of angels except that they said: 'Urge your community to practice cupping.'"

In the hadith, he ordered it and said: "Perform cupping on the seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first, lest the blood surge in you and kill you." It mentions that the surging of blood is a cause of death and that it kills by the permission of God Almighty, and clarifies that drawing blood is deliverance from it, for there is no difference between drawing the lethal blood from the skin and removing a scorpion from beneath the garments or a snake from the house. It is not a condition of trust in God to abandon this; rather, it is like pouring water on a fire to extinguish it and repel its harm when it occurs in the house, and trust in God does not at all entail departing from the way of the One entrusted.

In a disconnected report: "Whoever undergoes cupping on Tuesday, the seventeenth of the month, it will be a remedy for him from the ailments of the year."

As for his command, peace be upon him, he indeed commanded more than one of the Companions to seek medical treatment and observe dietary precautions. He cut a vein for Sa'd ibn Mu'adh—meaning he performed phlebotomy for him—and he cauterized Sa'd ibn Zurarah.

And he said to Ali, may God be pleased with him, who had an eye ailment: "Do not eat from this," meaning fresh dates, "but eat from this, for it is more suitable for you," meaning chard cooked with barley flour.

He said to Suhayb when he saw him eating dates while suffering from eye pain: "You eat dates while your eyes are inflamed?" He replied: "I am eating from the other side," and he smiled.

As for his practice, peace and blessings be upon him, it has been narrated in a tradition from the people of the household that he would apply kohl every night, undergo cupping every month, and take medicine every year. It is said: the medicine was Meccan senna.

And he was treated more than once from the sting of a scorpion and other things.

It has been related that whenever revelation descended upon him, his head would split, and he would then anoint it with henna.

And in a report: that when a sore would break out on him, he would place henna upon it, and he had placed upon a sore that broke out on him some soil.

And what has been narrated concerning his treatment and his command to do so is abundant beyond enumeration, and a book has been compiled on that subject, titled "The Medicine of the Prophet" (Tibb al-Nabi).

Some scholars mentioned in the Isra'iliyyat that Moses, peace be upon him, fell ill with an ailment. The Children of Israel came to him and recognized his illness. They said to him, "If you were to treat yourself with such-and-such, you would be cured." He replied, "I will not seek treatment until He heals me without any medicine." His ailment persisted, so they said to him, "The remedy for this illness is well-known and proven; we treat ourselves with it and are cured." He said, "I will not seek treatment," and his condition remained. Then God, the Exalted, revealed to him: "By My might and majesty, I will not heal you until you treat yourself with what they have mentioned to you." So he said to them, "Treat me with what you have mentioned." They treated him, and he was cured. He then felt a misgiving in his heart about this, so God, the Exalted, revealed to him: "Did you intend to nullify My wisdom by your reliance, when it is other than I who has placed the benefits of things within the remedies?"

It has been narrated in another report that a prophet among the prophets, peace be upon them, complained of an ailment he was experiencing, so God Almighty revealed: "Eat eggs." And another prophet complained of weakness, so God Almighty revealed to him: "Eat meat with milk, for in them is strength." It is said this was weakness regarding intercourse.

It has also been narrated that a people complained to their prophet about the ugliness of their children, so God Almighty revealed to him: "Instruct them to feed their pregnant women quince, for it beautifies the child." And this should be done in the third and fourth month, for in it God Almighty forms the child. They used to feed the pregnant woman quince and the postpartum woman fresh dates.

Thus it becomes clear that the Causer of causes established His custom by linking effects to causes as a manifestation of wisdom. Medicines are causes subjugated by the decree of God Almighty, like all other causes. Just as bread is the remedy for hunger and water the remedy for thirst, so is scammony the remedy for bile and scammony the remedy for diarrhea. It does not depart from this except in one of two matters: First, treating hunger and thirst with water and bread is evident and clear, perceived by all people, while treating bile with scammony is perceived by some of the specialists. Whoever comprehends this through experience joins, in his regard, the first category.

The second is that the remedy may be facilitated, and senna soothes the yellow bile under other conditions within the interior and causes in the temperament, perhaps making it difficult to ascertain all its conditions, and perhaps some conditions are missed, causing the remedy to fail in purging. As for the removal of thirst, it does not require numerous conditions beyond water, though it may occur from afflictions that necessitate the disease of thirst despite abundant water consumption, but this is rare. The disruption of causes is always confined to these two matters; otherwise, the effect inevitably follows the cause whenever its conditions are complete. All of this is through the management of the Causer of Causes, His subjugation, and His arrangement by the decree of His wisdom and perfect power. Thus, it does not harm the one who relies [on God] to use it while looking to the Causer of Causes rather than the physician and the remedy. It has been narrated from Moses, peace be upon him, that he said: "O Lord, from whom are disease and remedy?" He, the Exalted, said: "From Me." He said: "Then what do the physicians do?" He said: "They consume their provisions and comfort the souls of My servants until My healing or My decree comes." Therefore, the meaning of reliance while seeking treatment is reliance in knowledge and state, as preceded in the varieties of actions that repel harm and bring benefit. As for abandoning treatment altogether, it is not a condition therein.

If you say: "Then cauterization is also among the apparent beneficial causes." I say: It is not so, for the apparent causes are like bloodletting, cupping, drinking purgatives, and administering coolants to the fevered. As for cauterization, if it were like them in apparent benefit, many lands would not be devoid of it, and it is seldom practiced in most lands; rather, it is a custom of some Turks and Bedouins. Thus, it is among the imagined causes like incantations, except it is distinguished from them by one matter: it is the burning by fire in the present while being dispensable, for there is no pain treated by cauterization except that it has a remedy that suffices without burning. Burning by fire is a wound that ruins the constitution, feared for its spreading, while being dispensable—unlike bloodletting and cupping, for their spreading is remote and nothing else substitutes for them. Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prohibited cauterization but not incantation. Each of them is far from reliance.

It is reported that Imran ibn Husayn fell ill, and they suggested cauterization to him, but he refused. They persisted and the matter was pressed upon him until he was cauterized. He would then say, "I used to see a light, hear a voice, and the angels would greet me with peace. When I was cauterized, that was cut off from me." And he would say, "We were cauterized with several cauterizations, and by God, it brought no success nor benefit." Then he repented from it and turned back to God, the Exalted, and God, the Exalted, restored to him what he used to experience concerning the matter of the angels. He said to Mutarrif ibn Abdullah, "Do you not see the angels whom God had honored me with—God has restored them to me!" after he had informed him of their loss. Thus, cauterization and what is akin to it is what is not fitting for one who relies on God, because its application requires recourse to planning, and moreover it is blameworthy. This indicates the severity of being preoccupied with secondary causes and delving deeply into them. And God knows best.

Explanation that abandoning treatment may be praiseworthy in certain circumstances

And it indicates the strength of reliance upon God, and that this does not contradict the actions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.

Know that those among the early generations who sought treatment are not limited in number, yet a group of the great ones also abandoned medical treatment. One might think this is a deficiency, for if it were a perfection, the Messenger of God ﷺ would have abandoned it, since no one else’s state of reliance on God could be more complete than his.

It has been narrated from Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, that it was said to him: "Shall we call a physician for you?" He replied: "The physician has already examined me and said: 'Indeed, I do whatever I will.'"

It was said to Abu al-Darda during his illness, "What do you complain of?" He said, "My sins." It was said, "What do you desire?" He said, "The forgiveness of my Lord." They said, "Should we not call a physician for you?" He said, "The physician is the one who made me ill."

It was said to Abu Dharr when his eyes were inflamed, "Would you not treat them?" He said, "I am preoccupied from them." Then it was said, "Would you not ask God, exalted is He, to heal you?" He replied, "I ask Him for what is more important to me than they are."

And Rabi‘ ibn Khuthaym was struck by paralysis, and it was said to him: “Would you not seek treatment?” He replied: “I considered it, then I remembered ‘Ād and Thamūd and the Companions of the Rass and generations in between—many were they—and among them were physicians, yet the healer and the healed alike perished, and incantations availed them nothing.”

And Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to say: “I prefer that one who holds to trust in God and treads this path should abandon seeking treatment, whether by drinking medicine or otherwise; and even if he has ailments, he should not disclose them to a physician when asked.”

It was said to Sahl: "When does a servant's trust in God become sound?" He replied: "When harm befalls his body and loss diminishes his wealth, yet he pays it no heed, being wholly occupied with his state, and looks only to God's upholding of him."

Thus among them were those who abandoned treatment, and among them were those who disliked it. The reconciliation between the action of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and their actions only becomes clear by limiting the factors that divert from treatment. We say: Indeed, abandoning treatment has causes. The first cause: that the sick person is among those granted spiritual unveiling, and it has been unveiled to him that his appointed term has ended and that medicine will not benefit him. This is sometimes known to him through a truthful dream, sometimes through intuition and conjecture, and sometimes through a verified unveiling. It is plausible that the abandonment of treatment by al-Siddiq (may God be pleased with him) was due to this cause, for he was among those granted unveiling. He said to ‘A’ishah (may God be pleased with her) concerning the matter of inheritance: "They are but your two sisters," though she had only one sister. However, his wife was pregnant and gave birth to a female, so he knew that it had been unveiled to him that she was pregnant with a female. It is not far-fetched that it had also been unveiled to him that his appointed term had ended; otherwise, one would not suspect him of rejecting treatment, for he had witnessed the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) seeking treatment and commanding it.

The second cause: that the patient is preoccupied with his condition and fear of its outcome, and with God the Exalted's awareness of him. This makes him forget the pain of the illness, so his heart is not free to seek treatment, being occupied with his state. This is indicated by the words of Abu Dharr when he said, "I am preoccupied from them," and the words of Abu al-Darda' when he said, "I only complain of my sins." Thus, the pain of his heart from fear of his sins was greater than the pain of his body from illness. This is like one afflicted by the death of a beloved from among his dearest, or like a fearful person being taken to a king to be killed, if it is said to him, "Will you not eat while you are hungry?" and he replies, "I am preoccupied from the pain of hunger." This is not a denial that eating is beneficial for hunger, nor a criticism of what is eaten. Similar to this is the preoccupation of Sahl when it was said to him, "What is sustenance?" He replied, "It is the remembrance of the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining." It was said, "We only asked you about the means of subsistence?" He said, "The means of subsistence is knowledge." It was said, "We asked you about nourishment?" He said, "Nourishment is remembrance." It was said, "We asked you about the body's food?" He said, "What have you to do with the body? Leave what was entrusted to him first to be entrusted to him last. When an ailment befalls it, return it to its Maker. Have you not seen that when a crafted item is defective, they return it to its craftsman so he may repair it?"

The third reason: that the ailment be chronic, and the prescribed remedy relative to its condition be of dubious benefit, proceeding along the lines of cauterization and incantation, so the one who relies [on God] abandons it. To this points the saying of Rabīʿ ibn Khuthaym when he said: "I mentioned ʿĀd and Thamūd, and among them were physicians, yet both the healer and the healed perished." That is, the remedy is not to be trusted. This may be so in itself, or it may be so in the estimation of the patient due to his scant practice of medicine and limited experience with it, so he does not incline to the view that it is beneficial. There is no doubt that the experienced physician has a stronger conviction in remedies than others, for trust and presumption are according to conviction, and conviction is according to experience. Most of the worshippers and ascetics who abandoned treatment did so on this basis, because the remedy remained in their view something illusory without foundation. This is valid for some remedies in the estimation of one who knows the craft of medicine, but not valid for others. However, the non-physician may regard them all with a single gaze, seeing treatment as an excessive attachment to secondary causes, like cauterization and incantations, and so he abandons it.

The fourth reason: that the servant intends by abandoning treatment to preserve the illness so that he may attain the reward of illness through goodly patience upon the affliction of God Almighty, or to test himself in the capacity for patience. Indeed, what is mentioned regarding the reward of illness is abundant. He ﷺ said: "We, the company of prophets, are the most severely afflicted of people, then the next best and the next best. The servant is tested according to the measure of his faith. If his faith is firm, his affliction is intensified. If there is weakness in his faith, his affliction is lightened."

In the tradition, "Verily God Most High tests His servant with affliction as one of you tests his gold with fire. Among them is he who emerges like pure gold, without dross; and among them is he who falls short of that; and among them is he who emerges blackened and burnt."

And in a narration from the Ahl al-Bayt: "Indeed, when Allah the Exalted loves a servant, He tests him. If he is patient, He selects him; and if he is content, He chooses him."

And He said: "You love to be like stray donkeys, neither falling ill nor becoming sick."

Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: You will find the believer soundest in heart and most ailing in body, and you will find the hypocrite soundest in body and most ailing in heart. When the praise for sickness and tribulation became great, a people loved sickness and seized it to attain the reward of patience upon it. Among them was one who had an ailment he would conceal and not mention to the physician, enduring the ailment and being content with the decree of God, the Exalted, knowing that the Truth has greater sway over his heart than for sickness to distract him from it. Sickness only hinders his limbs. And they knew that their prayer while sitting, for example, coupled with patience for the decree of God, the Exalted, is better than prayer while standing with well-being and health. For in the report: "Indeed, God, the Exalted, says to His angels: 'Record for My servant the righteous deeds he used to perform, for he is in My bond. If I release him, I will replace his flesh with flesh better than his flesh and his blood with blood better than his blood. And if I cause him to die, I cause him to die unto My mercy.'"

He said, may God be pleased with him: "The best of deeds are those which the souls are averse to." It was said: Its meaning is what befalls one of illnesses and calamities, and this is alluded to in the saying of God, the Exalted: "But it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you."

Sahl used to say: "Abandoning treatment, even if it weakens one for acts of worship and causes one to fall short in fulfilling obligations, is superior to seeking treatment for the sake of worship." He himself was afflicted with a severe ailment, yet he did not seek treatment for it, though he would treat others for it. When he saw a servant praying while seated, unable to perform righteous deeds due to illness, and then seeking treatment in order to stand for prayer and rise for acts of worship, he would marvel at this and say: "His prayer while seated, coupled with contentment with his state, is superior to seeking treatment for strength and praying while standing." He was asked about taking medicine and said: "Whoever resorts to any kind of medicine, it is merely an allowance from God, Exalted is He, for the weak. And whoever does not resort to anything is superior, for if one takes something of medicine—even if it were water—one will be questioned, 'Why did I take it?' But whoever does not take anything, no questioning is upon him." His doctrine, and that of the Basrans, was to weaken the self through hunger and to break the appetites, for they knew that an atom's weight of the heart's works—such as patience, contentment, and reliance—is superior to mountains of the limbs' works. Illness does not prevent the works of the heart unless its pain becomes overwhelming and stupefying.

Sahl, may God have mercy upon him, said: The ailments of bodies are God's mercy, and the ailments of hearts are a punishment.

The fifth cause: that the servant may have preceding sins which he fears and is incapable of expiating, so he sees prolonged illness as an expiation and thus abandons [the desire for its quick removal] out of fear that the illness might hasten away. For it has been said: "Fever and shivering fever do not cease to afflict a servant until he walks upon the earth like a pure garment, free from sin and transgression."

In the hadith, "A day of fever is an expiation for a year," it is said this is because it diminishes the strength of a year. It is also said that a human has three hundred and sixty joints, and the fever enters all of them, and from each one he feels pain, so each pain becomes an expiation for a day.

And when he mentioned the expiation of sins through fever, Zayd ibn Thabit asked his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, that he never cease to be fevered, and the fever did not leave him until he died, may God have mercy on him. A group of the Ansar asked for that, and the fever did not depart from them. And when he said, "For whom God takes away his two precious ones, He is not content with a reward for him less than Paradise," it is said that indeed, among the Ansar were those who would wish for blindness.

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: He cannot be a true knower who does not rejoice when afflictions and illnesses befall his body and his wealth, for what he hopes to gain thereby is the expiation of his sins.

It is related that Moses, peace be upon him, looked upon a servant enduring immense tribulation and said, "O Lord, have mercy upon him." The Almighty said, "How shall I have mercy upon him through that by which I am having mercy upon him?"—meaning, through it I am expiating his sins and increasing his ranks.

The sixth cause: that the servant begins to sense the seeds of arrogance and insolence due to prolonged good health, so he abandons seeking cure for fear that the removal of illness might come upon him suddenly, and heedlessness, arrogance, and insolence would return to him; or due to prolonged hope and procrastination in making up for what is missed and delaying good deeds. For health is an expression of the strength of one's faculties, and through it desires surge, passions stir, and they call to sins. The least of these is that they call to indulgence in permissible pleasures, which is a squandering of time and a neglect of the immense profit in opposing the lower self and adhering to acts of obedience. And when God wills good for a servant, He does not leave him without being awakened by illnesses and afflictions. For this reason it is said: The believer is never free from some ailment, or scarcity, or slip.

It has been related that God, exalted is He, says: "Poverty is My prison and sickness is My fetter; with them I detain whom I love among My creation."
If, then, in sickness there is a restraint from insolence and the pursuit of sins, what greater good could there be beyond it? It is not fitting for one who fears that for himself to be preoccupied with seeking its cure, for true well-being lies in abandoning sins. Indeed, a certain gnostic said to a man: "How have you been since I saw you last?" He replied: "In well-being." The gnostic said: "If you have not disobeyed God, mighty and glorious, then you are indeed in well-being; but if you have disobeyed Him, what ailment is more grievous than disobedience? He who disobeys God has not been granted well-being."

And Ali, may God honor his countenance, said when he saw the finery of the Nabateans in Iraq on a festival day: "What is this that they have displayed?" They said: "O Commander of the Faithful, this is a festival day for them." He replied: "Every day in which God, the Mighty and Majestic, is not disobeyed is a festival for us."

And God Almighty said: "After He has shown you what you love," it is said, the recoveries, "Indeed, man becomes insolent when he sees himself self-sufficient." And likewise, when he becomes self-sufficient through well-being.

Some have said: Pharaoh only declared, "I am your supreme Lord," due to prolonged well-being, for he remained four hundred years without a headache afflicting him, without his body suffering fever, and without a vein throbbing in pain—so he claimed divinity—may God curse him. Had a migraine seized him for but a day, it would have preoccupied him from idle pursuits, let alone from claiming lordship.

And He, may He be exalted, said: "Increase in the remembrance of the Destroyer of Pleasures."

It is said: Fever is the herald of death, reminding one of it and dispelling procrastination.

And God Almighty said: "Do they not see that they are tested every year once or twice, yet they do not repent nor do they take heed?" It is said they are tested with illnesses by which they are tried.

It is said: When a servant falls ill twice and still does not repent, the Angel of Death says to him: O heedless one, messenger after messenger has come to you from Me, yet you did not respond.

The early believers would feel uneasy if a year passed without them experiencing some diminishment in their self or wealth.
They would say: "A believer does not pass forty days without being startled by a fright or afflicted by a trial." It has even been narrated that 'Ammar ibn Yasir married a woman who never fell ill, so he divorced her, and that the Prophet ﷺ was presented with a woman, and her description was related to him until he was inclined to marry her. It was then said, "But she has never been ill," to which he replied, "I have no need for her."

The Messenger of God ﷺ mentioned ailments and pains such as headaches and others, when a man said, "And what is a headache? I do not know it." So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said, "Away from me! Whoever wishes to look upon a man from the people of the Fire, let him look at this one and this one." For it has been conveyed in the report, "Fever is every believer's share of the Fire."

In the narration from Anas and Aisha, may God be pleased with them, it was asked: "O Messenger of God, will there be others with the martyrs on the Day of Resurrection?" He replied, "Yes, one who remembers death twenty times each day." In another wording, "One who remembers his sins and it grieves him." There is no doubt that the remembrance of death is more prevalent for the sick. Thus, when the benefits of illness became numerous, a group saw fit to abandon seeking its removal, for they perceived in it an increase for themselves—not because they saw treatment as a deficiency. And how could it be a deficiency when the Prophet, peace be upon him, himself did so?

Clarification of the Refutation Against Those Who Say Abandoning Treatment is Superior in All Circumstances

If someone were to say: "The Messenger of God ﷺ did that only to establish a practice for others, otherwise it is the state of the weak, and the rank of the strong necessitates reliance on God by forgoing medicine?" It should be said: Among the conditions of reliance should be the abandonment of cupping and bloodletting when the blood is agitated.

If it is said: That too is a condition, then let it be from his condition that a scorpion or a snake bite him and he does not remove it from himself, since the inner self bites like blood and the scorpion bites the outer self, so what difference is there between them? If he says: That too is a condition of trust in God? Then it is said: He ought not to remove the bite of thirst with water, the bite of hunger with bread, and the bite of cold with a cloak, and this is something no one says.

There is no distinction between these levels, for all of that consists of means whose ranks are ordained by the Causer of Causes—glorified and exalted is He—and through which He implements His established way. That this is not a condition of reliance (tawakkul) is indicated by what is narrated from ‘Umar—may God be pleased with him—and from the Companions concerning the story of the plague. When they set out for Syria and reached al-Jābiyah, news reached them that there was a great mortality and a fearsome epidemic there. The people then split into two groups. Some said: “We shall not enter a place of epidemic and thus cast ourselves into destruction.” Another party said: “Rather, we shall enter and place our trust [in God], and we shall not flee from the decree of God—exalted is He—nor flee from death, lest we become like those of whom God—exalted is He—said: ‘Have you not considered those who left their homes, though they were thousands, fearing death?’” They returned to ‘Umar and asked his opinion. He said: “We shall turn back and not enter the place of epidemic.” Those who disagreed with his view said to him: “Are you fleeing from the decree of God—exalted is He?” ‘Umar replied: “Yes, we flee from the decree of God to the decree of God.” Then he gave them an example, saying: “What would you think if one of you had sheep and descended into a valley with two branches—one fertile and the other barren? Would it not be that if he grazed them in the fertile one, he would do so by the decree of God—exalted is He—and if he grazed them in the barren one, he would do so by the decree of God—exalted is He?” They said: “Yes.” Then they sought ‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf to ask his opinion—he had been absent. When morning came, ‘Abd al-Raḥmān arrived, and ‘Umar asked him about the matter. He said: “O Commander of the Faithful, I have something concerning it that I heard from the Messenger of God—peace and blessings be upon him.” ‘Umar said: “God is greatest!” ‘Abd al-Raḥmān said: “I heard the Messenger of God—peace and blessings be upon him—say: ‘If you hear of an epidemic in a land, do not enter it; and if it occurs in a land where you are, do not flee from it.’” ‘Umar—may God be pleased with him—rejoiced at that and praised God—exalted is He—since it agreed with his opinion, and he turned back from al-Jābiyah with the people. How then could all the Companions have agreed to abandon reliance—which is among the highest spiritual stations—if such matters were among the conditions of reliance?

If you ask: Why is it forbidden to leave a city afflicted by a plague, when the cause of the plague in medicine is the air, and the most evident method of treatment is to flee from what is harmful, and the air is the harmful agent, and abandoning reliance on God in such matters is permissible? This does not point to the intended meaning. However, what becomes clear—and God knows best—is that the air does not harm merely because it contacts the body's exterior, but rather due to the prolonged inhalation of it. For if it contains putridity and reaches the lungs, the heart, and the inner organs, it affects them through extended inhalation. Thus, the plague does not manifest externally except after a prolonged effect internally. Therefore, leaving the city generally does not free one from the effect that has already taken hold, but one imagines deliverance. This then becomes akin to illusions, like charms and omens. If this meaning were isolated, it would contradict reliance on God and would not be prohibited. However, it became prohibited because another matter was added to it: that if the healthy were permitted to leave, none would remain in the city except the sick whom the plague has incapacitated. Their hearts would be broken, and they would lack caregivers, with no one left in the city to give them water or food, while they themselves are unable to do so. This would actively lead to their certain destruction, while their deliverance is awaited just as the deliverance of the healthy is awaited. If they stayed, staying would not guarantee death; and if they left, leaving would not guarantee deliverance—but it would guarantee the destruction of those who remain. The Muslims are like a structure, each part strengthening the other, and the believers are like a single body: if one part complains, the rest of the body responds with sympathy. This is what becomes clear to us in explaining the reason for the prohibition. The reverse applies to one who has not yet entered the city, for the air has not affected their inner being, nor do the city's inhabitants have a need for them. Indeed, if only plague-stricken individuals remained in the city and they were in need of caregivers, and a group came to them, it might then become commendable to enter here for the purpose of assistance. One is not prohibited from entering because it involves exposing oneself to harm in the hope of averting harm from the rest of the Muslims. In this light, fleeing from the plague is likened in some reports to fleeing from the battlefield, for it breaks the hearts of the remaining Muslims and actively seeks their destruction. These are subtle matters. Whoever does not observe them and looks only at the outward meanings of reports and traditions will find most of what he has heard contradictory. The errors of worshippers and ascetics in such matters are many. The nobility and virtue of knowledge are precisely for this reason.

If you ask: "In abstaining from treatment there is virtue, as you have mentioned, so why did the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) not abstain from treatment to attain that virtue?" We say: There is virtue in it relative to one whose sins are many, so that they may be expiated; or who fears for himself the tyranny of health and the dominance of desires; or who needs something to remind him of death due to the prevalence of heedlessness; or who needs to attain the reward of the patient due to his falling short of the stations of the content and the reliant; or whose insight is too limited to perceive the subtle benefits God Almighty has deposited in remedies, such that in his view they become akin to illusions like incantations; or whose preoccupation with his spiritual state prevents him from treatment, and treatment would distract him from his state due to his weakness in combining both. To these meanings revert the factors for abstaining from treatment. All of these are perfections relative to some of creation, but are deficiencies relative to the rank of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). Indeed, his station was higher than all these stations, for his state necessitated that his witnessing be on a single pattern both when means are present and when they are absent. For he had no regard for conditions except to the Causer of causes. Whoever is of this station, the means do not harm him, just as desire is a deficiency. Desire for wealth is an aversion to it, and even if it is a perfection, it is also a deficiency relative to one for whom the presence and absence of wealth are equal. The equivalence of stone and gold is more perfect than fleeing from gold but not from stone. His state (peace be upon him) was the equivalence of clay and gold in his sight, and he did not withhold from it to teach creation the station of asceticism, for that is the ultimate limit of their capacity, not out of fear for himself from withholding it, for he was of a rank too lofty to be deluded by this world—indeed, the treasures of the earth were offered to him and he refused to accept them. Likewise, for him, engaging with means and abandoning them were equal due to such witnessing. He did not abandon the use of medicine only in following the custom of God Almighty and as a concession for his community in what they need, even though there is no harm in it, unlike hoarding wealth, for that greatly increases its harm. Indeed, treatment only causes harm from the perspective of seeing the medicine as beneficial apart from the Creator of the medicine—this is forbidden—and from the perspective of intending by it health to be used for disobedience—this is also forbidden. The believer, for the most part, does not intend that, and not one of the believers sees the medicine as beneficial in itself, but rather because God Almighty has made it a cause for benefit, just as one does not see water as quenching thirst or bread as satiating hunger by themselves. The ruling on treatment in its intent is like the ruling on earning: if one earns to aid in obedience or in disobedience, it takes that ruling; if one earns for permissible enjoyment, it takes its ruling. Thus, it has become clear through the meanings we have presented that abstaining from treatment may be superior in some circumstances, that treatment may be superior in some, and that this varies according to differing circumstances, persons, and intentions, and that neither action nor abstention is a condition for reliance, except abstaining from illusions like cauterization and incantations, for that is an excessive delving into contrivances unbefitting of those who rely.

Explanation of the Conditions of Those Who Rely on God Regarding Revealing Illness and Concealing It

Know that concealing illness, hiding poverty, and veiling various afflictions are among the treasures of righteousness and rank among the highest spiritual stations. For contentment with God’s decree and patience in the face of His trial constitute a private transaction between a servant and God, Almighty and Exalted. Thus, keeping such matters concealed is safer from corruptions.

And with this, there is no harm in disclosure if the intention and purpose are sound. The purposes of disclosure are three:

The first: That his aim be seeking a cure, so he needs to mention it to the physician. He mentions it not in the manner of complaint, but in the manner of narrating what has manifested upon him of the power of God, the Exalted. For indeed, Bishr would describe his ailments to the physician ‘Abd al-Rahman, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal would inform of illnesses he experienced, saying: "I am only describing the power of God, the Exalted, within me."

The second is when one describes their condition to someone other than a physician, who is a person to be emulated and is firmly grounded in spiritual knowledge, intending by mentioning it to learn from them the beauty of patience in illness—or rather, the beauty of gratitude—by manifesting that they view the illness as a blessing and give thanks for it, thus speaking of it as one speaks of blessings.

Al-Hasan al-Basri said: When a sick person praises God Most High and gives thanks, then mentions his pains, that is not considered a complaint.

The third aspect: That he thereby manifests his weakness and his need of God Most High. This is becoming of one for whom strength and courage are fitting and from whom weakness is unexpected. As it is related that it was said to Ali, may God be pleased with him, during his illness: "How are you?" He said: "In a bad state." Some of those present looked at one another as if they disliked this and thought it was a complaint. So he said: "Should I put on a brave face before God?" He wished to manifest his weakness and need, despite what was known of his strength and fortitude, and he conducted himself in this with the etiquette taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, when Ali, may God honor his face, was ill. The Prophet, peace be upon him, heard him saying: "O God, grant me patience in affliction." So he, peace be upon him, said to him: "You have asked God Most High for affliction. Rather, ask God for well-being."

With these intentions, it becomes permissible to mention illness, for such mention is stipulated because speaking of it constitutes complaint, and complaining against Allah the Exalted is forbidden—as I have mentioned in the prohibition of begging by the poor except out of necessity. Disclosure becomes a complaint when accompanied by indications of displeasure and showing aversion to the decree of Allah the Exalted. If it is free from signs of displeasure and from the intentions we have mentioned, it is not described as forbidden, but it is judged that it is preferable to abstain from it, for it may give the impression of complaint, and because it may involve affectation or exaggeration in describing the existing ailment. As for one who abandons treatment out of reliance on Allah, there is no reason for disclosure in his case, for finding rest in medicine is better than finding rest in divulgence. Some have said: "Whoever divulges has not been patient," and it is said regarding the meaning of His words, "So beautiful patience," that there is no complaint in it.

And it was said to Jacob, peace be upon him: "What has taken away your sight?" He replied: "The passage of time and the length of sorrows!" Then Allah the Exalted revealed to him: "You have busied yourself with complaining to My servants." He said: "O Lord, I repent to You."

It is reported from Tawus and Mujahid that they said: The moaning of the sick person during his illness is recorded against him. They used to dislike the moaning of illness because it is a manifestation of a meaning that implies complaint, to the point that it was said: What afflicted Iblis—may God curse him—from Job, peace be upon him, was nothing but his moaning during his illness, and thus the moaning became his share from him.

In the tradition, "When a servant falls ill, God Almighty inspires the two angels: 'Observe what he says to his visitors. If he praises God and speaks good, they pray for him; but if he complains and mentions evil, they say: So be it.'" Some worshippers disliked receiving visitors out of fear of complaining and dread of excess in speech. Thus, when some of them fell ill, they would lock their door so no one could enter until they recovered and went out to them. Among them were Fudayl, Wahb, and Bishr. Fudayl used to say, "I wish to fall ill without visitors," and he said, "I dislike illness only because of the visitors." May God be pleased with him and with all of them.

The Book of Divine Unity and Reliance on God is completed with the aid of God and His gracious facilitation. To follow it, if God Almighty wills, is: The Book of Love, Longing, Intimacy, and Contentment. And God, Glorified and Exalted, is the Granter of success.

[1] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "I was shown the nations at the gathering place, and I saw my nation filling the plain and the mountain." The hadith is narrated by Ibn Mani' with a good chain, and the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) agreed upon it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas.

[2] The hadith: "If you were to rely upon Allah with the reliance He is due, you would be provided for as birds are provided for." Al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim narrated and authenticated it from the narration of 'Umar, and it has preceded.

[3] The hadith: "Whoever devotes himself exclusively to Allah, Allah will suffice him for every concern." Al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Saghir*, Ibn Abi al-Dunya, and my path is that of al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from a narration from 'Imran ibn Husayn, but he did not hear it from him. In its chain is Ibrahim ibn al-Ash'ath, whom Abu Hatim criticized.

[4] The hadith: "Whoever is pleased to be the richest of people, then let him find contentment in what is with Allah more secure than what is in his hand." Al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Zuhd* narrated it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain.

[5] The hadith: "When hardship befell his family, he would say, 'Get up for prayer,' and he would say, 'With this my Lord has commanded me.'" Allah Almighty said: "And enjoin prayer upon your family and be steadfast therein." Al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* narrated it from the narration of Muhammad ibn Hamzah from 'Abdullah ibn Salam who said: "When distress descended upon his family, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would command them to pray, then recite this verse." Muhammad ibn Hamzah ibn Yusuf ibn 'Abdullah ibn Salam—they only mentioned his narration from his father from his grandfather, so his hearing from his paternal grandfather is unlikely.

[6] The hadith: "He has not truly relied (on Allah) who seeks ruqyah (healing by Qur'an) or cauterization." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and graded it *hasan*, as did al-Nasa'i in *al-Kabir* and al-Tabarani—the wording is his—except he said "or" from the hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Whoever seeks cauterization or ruqyah has absolved himself of tawakkul (reliance)." Al-Nasa'i said: "He has not relied who seeks cauterization or ruqyah."

[7] The hadith: "If you knew what I know, you would laugh little..." has preceded more than once.

[8] The hadith prohibiting the divulgence of the secret of Divine Decree (al-Qadr). Abu 'Adi and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* narrated it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Divine Decree is the secret of Allah, so do not divulge the secret of Allah, Mighty and Majestic." These are the words of Abu Nu'aym. Ibn 'Adi said: "Do not speak about Divine Decree, for it is the secret of Allah." The hadith is weak and has preceded.

[9] The hadith: "When the stars are mentioned, refrain; and when Divine Decree is mentioned, refrain." Al-Tabarani and Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa* narrated it, and it has preceded in the chapter on Knowledge.

[10] The hadith that he (peace be upon him) singled out Hudhayfah with some secrets has preceded.

[11] The hadith: "It was said to him that 'Isa (Jesus) walks on water. He said: 'If his certainty were increased, he would walk on air.'" It has preceded.

[12] The hadith: "Glory be to You, I cannot enumerate praise of You; You are as You have praised Yourself." It has preceded.

[13] The hadith describing the Angel of the Wombs, that he enters the womb and takes the sperm-drop in his hand, then forms it into a body. Al-Bazzar and Ibn 'Adi narrated it from the narration of 'A'ishah: "When Allah, Blessed and Exalted, wishes to create a creation, He sends an angel who enters the womb and says, 'O Lord, what...?'" and at its end: "There is nothing but that He creates with it in the womb." Its chain has an unknown narrator. Ibn 'Adi said it is *munkar* (rejected), and its origin is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud in a similar manner.

[14] The hadith: "The Angel of Death and the Angel of Life debated. The Angel of Death said, 'I cause the living to die,' and the Angel of Life said, 'I bring the dead to life.' So Allah revealed to them, 'Be about your work.'" I have not found an origin for it.

[15] The hadith: "He said to the one who handed him a date: 'Take it, for if you had not gone to it, it would have come to you.'" Ibn Hibban narrated it in *Kitab Rawdat al-'Uqala* from the narration of Hudhayl ibn Sharahbil, and al-Tabarani connected it from Hudhayl from Ibn 'Umar, and its narrators are narrators of *al-Sahih*.

[16] The hadith: "He said to the one who said, 'I repent to Allah, and I do not repent to Muhammad': 'He has recognized the truth for its people.'" It has preceded in the chapter on Zakat.

[17] The hadith: "The truest verse spoken by the Arabs is the verse of Labid: 'Verily, everything other than Allah is false.'" It is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording: "The poet said it," and in a narration of Muslim: "The most poetic word spoken by the Arabs."

[18] The hadith: "Whoever seeks might through slaves, Allah will abase him." Al-'Uqayli in *al-Du'afa* and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* narrated it from the narration of 'Umar. Al-'Uqayli cited it in the biography of 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdullah al-Umawi and said he is not corroborated in his hadith. Ibn Hibban mentioned him among the trustworthy but said he is contradicted in his narration.

[19] The hadiths on the reward for saying "There is no power nor strength except by Allah" have preceded in the chapter on Supplications.

[20] The hadith: "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' truthfully and sincerely from his heart, Paradise is guaranteed for him." Al-Tabarani narrated it from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam, and Abu Ya'la from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it has preceded.

[21] The hadith that Abu Bakr blocked the openings of snakes in the cave out of compassion for the Prophet (peace be upon him) has preceded.

[22] The hadith: "If you were to rely upon Allah with the reliance He is due..." and at its end is added: "...and mountains would be moved by your supplication." Both have preceded recently without this addition. Imam Muhammad ibn Nasr narrated it in *Kitab Ta'zim Qadr al-Salah* from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Jabal with a chain containing some weakness: "If you knew Allah with the knowledge He is due, you would walk upon the seas, and mountains would be moved by your supplication."
