The Book of the Mysteries and Essentials of Prayer
Being the Fourth Book of the Quarter of Devotions
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who has overwhelmed His servants with His subtle graces and filled their hearts with the lights of religion and its obligations, which descend from the Throne of Majesty to the lowest heaven as one of the degrees of mercy, His tender affections. He is distinct from kings, who are alone in their majesty and grandeur, by encouraging His creation to ask and supplicate, saying: "Is there anyone who calls upon Me that I may answer him? Is there anyone who seeks forgiveness that I may forgive him?" And He differs from sovereigns by opening the door and lifting the veil, granting permission to His servants for intimate communion through prayers in all their changing circumstances, in congregations and in solitude. Nor did He stop at mere permission, but graciously encouraged and invited. Other weak kings do not permit a private audience except after presenting gifts and bribes. Glory be to Him! How magnificent is His state, how mighty His dominion, how perfect His subtle grace, and how all-encompassing His benevolence. And blessings upon Muhammad, His chosen Prophet and His selected intimate, and upon his family and his companions, the keys of guidance and the lamps in the darkness, and may peace be upon him abundantly.

Now then, prayer is the pillar of religion, the cord of certainty, the foremost of acts of nearness, and the adornment of acts of obedience. We have exhaustively treated its principles and branches in the discipline of jurisprudence, in its expansive, intermediate, and concise forms, directing the fullness of our attention to its rare details and unusual occurrences so that it may be a treasury for the jurist from which he draws and a resource to which he turns in need. In this book, however, we shall confine ourselves to what is indispensable for the spiritual seeker regarding its outward acts and its inward mysteries, and we shall unveil from the subtle, hidden meanings of reverence, sincerity, and intention that which is not customary to mention in the discipline of jurisprudence. We have arranged the book into seven chapters.

Chapter One: On the Excellences of Prayer.
Chapter Two: On the Excellence of the Outward Acts of Prayer.
Chapter Three: On the Excellence of its Inward Acts.
Chapter Four: On Leadership and Setting an Example.
Chapter Five: On the Friday Prayer and its Etiquettes.
Chapter Six: On Miscellaneous Issues of Common Occurrence Which the Seeker Needs to Know.
Chapter Seven: On Supererogatory Prayers and Others. Chapter One: On the Excellences of Prayer, Prostration, Congregation, the Call to Prayer, and Others.

(The Excellence of the Call to Prayer)
He (peace be upon him) said: "On the Day of Resurrection, three will be upon a dune of black musk; neither the Reckoning will dismay them nor will terror reach them until judgment is passed among the people: a man who recited the Qur'an seeking the Countenance of God, the Mighty and Majestic; a man who led a people in prayer and they were pleased with him; and a man who gave the call to prayer in a mosque and called to God, the Mighty and Majestic, seeking the Countenance of God; and a man who was tested with provision in the world, yet it did not distract him from the work of the Hereafter." And He (peace be upon him) said: "No jinn, human, or anything hears the call of the mu'adhdhin except that it will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection." And He (peace be upon him) said: "The hand of the Most Gracious is upon the head of the mu'adhdhin until he finishes his call." It is said in interpretation of His word, the Mighty and Majestic: "And who is better in speech than one who invites to God and does righteous work?" [Fussilat: 33] that it was revealed concerning the callers to prayer. And He (peace be upon him) said: "When you hear the call, say the like of what the mu'adhdhin says." This is recommended except for the two 'hayya 'ala' phrases; in them one says: 'There is no power nor strength except by God.' And upon his saying 'qad qamat al-salah' one says: 'May God establish it and perpetuate it as long as the heavens and the earth endure.' And in the second call for the dawn prayer, one says: 'You have spoken truthfully, been righteous, and given good counsel.' And upon completion, one says: 'O God, Lord of this perfect call and the established prayer, grant Muhammad the means of nearness, the excellence, and the elevated rank, and resurrect him to the praiseworthy station which You have promised him, for You do not fail in Your promise.' Said Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib: "Whoever prays in a desolate land, an angel prays on his right and an angel on his left. If he gives the call and the iqamah, angels like mountains pray behind him."

(The Excellence of the Prescribed Prayer)
God, the Exalted, says: "Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times." [An-Nisa': 103] And He (peace be upon him) said: "Five prayers which God has prescribed upon the servants. Whoever comes with them, not neglecting anything of them out of disregard for their right, has a covenant with God that He will admit him to Paradise. And whoever does not come with them has no covenant with God; if He wills, He will punish him, and if He wills, He will admit him to Paradise." And He (peace be upon him) said: "The likeness of the five prayers is that of a fresh, abundant river at the door of one of you, into which he plunges five times every day. What do you think that would leave of his dirt?" They said: "Nothing." He said: "Thus the five prayers remove sins as water removes dirt." And He (peace be upon him) said: "The prayers are an expiation for what is between them, so long as major sins are avoided." And He (peace be upon him) said: "Between us and the hypocrites is attendance at the 'Isha' and Fajr prayers; they are incapable of them." And He (peace be upon him) said:

Whoever meets Allah while having neglected prayer, Allah will not care for any of his good deeds. And He said: "Prayer is the pillar of religion; whoever abandons it has demolished religion." He was asked: "Which deed is most excellent?" He replied: "Prayer at its appointed times." And He said: "Whoever guards the five prayers, perfecting their purification and their times, they will be a light and a proof for him on the Day of Resurrection. But whoever neglects them will be gathered with Pharaoh and Haman." And He said: "The key to Paradise is prayer." And He said: "After the declaration of Oneness, Allah has not obligated upon His creation anything more beloved to Him than prayer. If there were anything more beloved to Him than it, He would have made His angels worship with it; among them are those bowing, prostrating, standing, and sitting." And the Prophet said: "Whoever intentionally abandons a prayer has disbelieved," meaning he has come close to being stripped of faith by the loosening of its bond and the collapse of its pillar, just as one who nears a town is said to have reached and entered it. And He said: "Whoever intentionally abandons a prayer has absolved himself from the covenant of Muhammad, peace be upon him." And Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Whoever performs ablution and perfects it, then goes out intending for prayer, he is in a state of prayer as long as he intends for it. For every step he takes, one good deed is recorded for him and one bad deed is erased. When you hear the call to stand for prayer, you should not delay, for the one among you with the greatest reward is the one whose home is farthest." They asked: "Why, Abu Huraira?" He said: "Because of the many steps." It is narrated that the first thing from a servant's deeds to be examined on the Day of Resurrection is prayer. If it is found complete, it is accepted from him along with his other deeds. If it is found deficient, it is returned to him along with his other deeds. And He said: "O Abu Huraira, command your household to pray, for Allah will bring you provision from where you do not expect." Some scholars said: "The likeness of one who prays is that of a merchant who does not gain profit until his capital is secure. Likewise, the voluntary prayers of one who prays are not accepted until he fulfills the obligatory ones." Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say: "When the time for prayer comes, rise to extinguish the fire you have kindled."

(The Virtue of Perfecting the Pillars)
He said: "The likeness of the prescribed prayer is that of a scale; whoever gives full measure receives in full." And Yazid al-Raqqashi said: "The prayer of the Messenger of Allah was balanced as if weighed." And He said: "Two men from my community may stand for prayer, their bowing and prostration identical, yet the difference between their prayers is like that between heaven and earth," alluding to devotion. And He said: "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look at a servant who does not straighten his back between his bowing and prostration." And He said: "Does he not fear, the one who turns his face during prayer, that Allah will turn his face into the face of a donkey?" And He said: "Whoever prays a prayer at its time, perfects its ablution, and completes its bowing, prostration, and devotion, it ascends white and radiant, saying: 'May Allah preserve you as you have preserved me.' But whoever prays not at its time, does not perfect its ablution, nor complete its bowing, prostration, or devotion, it ascends dark and gloomy, saying: 'May Allah neglect you as you have neglected me,' until when it reaches where Allah wills, it is folded like an old garment and struck against his face." And He said: "The worst of thieves is he who steals from his prayer." And Ibn Mas'ud and Salman, may Allah be pleased with them, said: "Prayer is a measure; whoever gives full measure receives in full, and whoever gives short measure knows well what Allah has said about those who give short measure."

(The Virtue of Congregational Prayer)
He said: "Prayer in congregation is superior to prayer alone by twenty-seven degrees." Abu Huraira narrated that He missed some people in one of the prayers and said: "I was about to command a man to lead the people in prayer, then go to men who stay away from it and burn their houses down." In another narration: "Then go to men who stay away from it and command that their houses be burned down with bundles of firewood. If any of them knew he would find a meaty bone or two hooves, he would attend it," meaning the night prayer. And 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, reported: "Whoever attends the night prayer, it is as if he stood in prayer for half the night, and whoever attends the dawn prayer, it is as if he stood in prayer the entire night." And He said: "Whoever prays a prayer in congregation has filled his throat with worship." Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: "For twenty years, no caller to prayer has given the call but that I was in the mosque." Muhammad ibn Wasil said: "I desire nothing from this world but three things: a brother who, if I deviate, sets me straight; provision that comes easily without burden; and prayer in congregation, from which my lapses are lifted and its virtue is recorded for me." It is narrated that Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah once led people in prayer, and when he finished he said: "Satan did not cease troubling me until I imagined I had superiority over others; I will never lead again." And al-Hasan said: "Do not pray behind a man who does not regularly attend the mosque."

The scholars. Al-Nakha'i said: The likeness of one who leads people in prayer without knowledge is like one who measures water into the sea, not knowing whether he increases it or decreases it. Hatim al-Asamm said: I missed the congregational prayer, and only Abu Ishaq al-Bukhari offered me condolences. Had my child died, more than ten thousand would have condoled me, for the calamity of religion is lighter in the sight of people than the calamity of the world. Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: Whoever hears the caller and does not respond, has not desired any good, nor has good been desired for him. Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: For the son of Adam to have his ear filled with molten lead is better for him than to hear the call and then not answer. It is related that Maymun ibn Mihran came to the mosque and was told: "The people have already dispersed." He said: "To God we belong and to Him we return. The virtue of this prayer is more beloved to me than the governorship of Iraq." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays for forty days in congregation, not missing the opening *takbir*, God will record for him two immunities: immunity from hypocrisy and immunity from the Fire." It is said that on the Day of Resurrection, a people will be gathered whose faces are like shining stars. The angels will say to them: "What were your deeds?" They will say: "When we heard the call to prayer, we would rise for purification, letting nothing else preoccupy us." Then a group will be gathered whose faces are like moons, and they will say after being questioned: "We would perform ablution before the time." Then a group will be gathered whose faces are like the sun, and they will say: "We would hear the call to prayer in the mosque." It is related that the pious predecessors would offer themselves condolences for three days if they missed the first *takbir*, and for seven days if they missed the congregation.

(The Virtue of Prostration)
The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The servant draws nearer to God with nothing better than a hidden prostration." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "There is no Muslim who prostrates to God a single prostration except that God raises him a degree by it and removes a sin from him by it." It is related that a man said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "Pray to God to make me among the people of your intercession and to grant me your companionship in Paradise." He, peace be upon him, said: "Help me to achieve that by frequent prostration." It is said that the closest a servant is to God, the Exalted, is when he is prostrating. This is the meaning of His, Mighty and Majestic, saying: "And prostrate and draw near." And His, Mighty and Majestic, saying: "Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration." It is said this is what sticks to their faces from the ground during prostration; it is said it is the light of humility, for it shines from the inner being to the outer appearance, and this is the soundest view; and it is said it is the radiance that will be on their faces on the Day of Resurrection from the effect of ablution. And he, peace be upon him, said: "When the son of Adam recites the verse of prostration and prostrates, Satan withdraws weeping and says: 'Woe is me! This one was commanded to prostrate, so he prostrated, and for him is Paradise. I was commanded to prostrate and I disobeyed, so for me is the Fire.'" It is related from 'Ali ibn 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas that he would prostrate a thousand prostrations every day, and they used to call him "The Prostrator." It is related that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God be pleased with him, would only prostrate on dust. Yusuf ibn Asbat used to say: "O company of youth, hasten to act while in health before illness, for I envy no one left except a man who completes his bowing and prostration, and I have been prevented from that." Sa'id ibn Jubayr said: "I regret nothing of the world except prostration." 'Uqbah ibn Muslim said: "There is no characteristic in a servant more beloved to God, Mighty and Majestic, than a man who loves meeting God, Mighty and Majestic. And there is no moment in which the servant is closer to God, Mighty and Majestic, than when he falls down prostrating." Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: "The closest a servant is to God, Mighty and Majestic, is when he is prostrating, so increase your supplication at that time."

(The Virtue of Humility)
God, the Exalted, said: "And establish prayer for My remembrance." And He, the Exalted, said: "And do not be among the heedless." And He, Mighty and Majestic, said: "Do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying." It is said: intoxicated from excessive worry; it is said: from love of the world. Wahb said the meaning is its apparent meaning, and it contains an admonition regarding the intoxication of the world, for He stated the reason, saying: "until you know what you are saying." How many a worshipper has not drunk wine yet does not know what he is saying in his prayer. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays two units of prayer without conversing with himself in them about anything of the world, his previous sins will be forgiven." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Prayer is only submissiveness, humility, supplication, sighing, remorse, and placing your hands and saying: O God, O God. Whoever does not do that, it is deficient." It is related from God, Glorified is He, in the previous scriptures that He said: "I do not accept the prayer of every worshipper. I only accept the prayer of one who humbles himself before My majesty, does not act arrogantly towards My servants, and feeds the hungry poor for My sake."

He said, peace be upon him: "Prayer was prescribed, and the Hajj and circumambulation were commanded, and the rites were made known, for the establishment of the remembrance of God, Exalted is He. So if there is not in your heart for the Remembered One—Who is the intended goal and the object of desire—any majesty or awe, then what is the worth of your remembrance?" And he, peace be upon him, said to the one he advised: "When you pray, pray the prayer of one bidding farewell." That is, bidding farewell to his soul, bidding farewell to his desire, bidding farewell to his lifespan, journeying to his Master, as the Almighty has said: "O mankind, indeed you are laboring toward your Lord with [great] exertion and will meet Him." (Al-Inshiqaq 84:6) And He, Exalted is He, said: "And fear Allah; and Allah teaches you." (Al-Baqarah 2:282) And He, Exalted is He, said: "And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him." (Al-Baqarah 2:223) And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever is not prevented by his prayer from indecency and evil, increases nothing from Allah except distance." And prayer is a confidential discourse, so how can it be with heedlessness? And Bakr ibn 'Abdullah said: "O son of Adam, if you wish to enter upon your Master without permission and speak to Him without an interpreter, then enter." It was said: "How is that?" He said: "Perfect your ablution and enter your prayer niche, and behold, you have entered upon your Master without permission and speak to Him without an interpreter." And from 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, would converse with us and we would converse with him, but when the time for prayer arrived, it was as if he did not know us and we did not know him," due to being occupied with the majesty of Allah, the Almighty. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Allah does not look at a prayer in which a man does not bring his heart together with his body." And Ibrahim, the intimate friend, when he stood for prayer, the throbbing of his heart could be heard from two miles away. And Sa'id al-Tanukhi, when he prayed, tears would not cease flowing from his cheeks onto his beard. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, saw a man fidgeting with his beard in prayer and said: "If this one's heart had humility, his limbs would have humility." And it is related that al-Hasan looked at a man playing with pebbles and saying: 'O Allah, marry me to the wide-eyed maidens.' He said: "What a poor suitor you are! You seek the wide-eyed maidens while you play with pebbles!" And it was said to Khalaf ibn Ayyub: "Does the fly not bother you in your prayer so that you shoo it away?" He said: "I do not accustom myself to something that would ruin my prayer for me." It was said to him: "How do you bear that?" He said: "It reached me that the wicked endure under the whips of the ruler so that it may be said, 'So-and-so is patient,' and they boast of that. And I am standing before my Lord—should I move for a fly?" And it is related from Muslim ibn Yasar that when he intended to pray, he would say to his family: "You converse, for I will not hear you." And it is related from him that he was praying one day in the mosque of Basrah when a section of the mosque collapsed, and the people gathered for that, but he was not aware of it until he had finished his prayer. And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him and honor his countenance, when the time for prayer arrived, would tremble and his face would change color. So it was said to him: "What is the matter with you, O Commander of the Faithful?" He would say: "The time has come for a trust which Allah offered to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and feared it; and I bore it." And it is related from 'Ali ibn al-Husayn that when he performed ablution, his color would turn pale. So his family would say to him: "What is this that comes over you at ablution?" He would say: "Do you know before Whom I intend to stand?" And it is related from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: "Dawood, peace be upon him, said in his intimate discourse: 'My God, who dwells in Your House and from whom do You accept prayer?' So Allah revealed to him: 'O Dawood, only he who humbles himself before My majesty, cuts his day with My remembrance, restrains his soul from desires for My sake, feeds the hungry, shelters the stranger, and shows mercy to the afflicted—he dwells in My House and I accept prayer from him. That is the one whose light shines in the heavens like the sun. If he calls upon Me, I answer him; if he asks of Me, I give to him. I make for him forbearance in ignorance, remembrance in heedlessness, and light in darkness. His likeness among people is like the Firdaws in the highest Gardens—its rivers do not dry up, nor do its fruits change.'" And it is related from Hatim al-Asamm, may Allah be pleased with him, that he was asked about his prayer. He said: "When the time for prayer arrives, I perfect the ablution and go to the place where I intend to pray. I sit there until my limbs are gathered together, then I rise for my prayer. I place the Ka'bah between my eyebrows, the Sirat (Path) beneath my feet, Paradise to my right, Hellfire to my left, and the Angel of Death behind me, thinking it is my final prayer. Then I stand between hope and fear. I pronounce the opening magnification with conviction, I recite with measured recitation, I bow with humility, I prostrate with reverence, and I sit on my left hip, spreading the top of the foot and erecting the right foot on the big toe, and I follow it with sincerity. Then I do not know whether it has been accepted from me or not." And Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "Two moderate units of prayer with contemplation are better than standing the night in prayer with a heedless heart."

(The Virtue of the Mosque and the Place of Prayer)
Allah, the Almighty, said: "The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day." (At-Tawbah 9:18) And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever builds for Allah a mosque, even if it be like the dust-scrape of a sandgrouse, Allah builds for him a palace in Paradise."

(He said, "Paradise") and He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "Whoever frequents the mosque, Allah the Exalted will frequent him." And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "When one of you enters the mosque, let him pray two rak'ahs before he sits." And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "There is no prayer for the neighbor of the mosque except in the mosque." And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "The angels pray for one of you as long as he remains in his prayer place where he prays, saying: O Allah, bless him, O Allah, have mercy on him, O Allah, forgive him, so long as he does not break his ablution or leave the mosque." And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "At the end of time, people from my community will come to the mosques and sit in them in circles; their talk will be of the world and love of the world. Do not sit with them, for Allah has no need of them." And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said in some of the scriptures: 'Verily, My houses on My earth are the mosques, and My visitors therein are those who maintain them. Blessed is the servant who purifies himself in his house and then visits Me in My house. It is incumbent upon the One visited to honor His visitor.'" And He said, may blessings and peace be upon him: "If you see a man who regularly attends the mosque, then bear witness to his faith." And Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: "Whoever sits in the mosque is only sitting with his Lord, so it is not fitting for him to say anything but good." And it is seen in the tradition or report: "Conversation in the mosque consumes good deeds just as livestock consume grass." And al-Nakha'i said: "They used to hold that walking to the mosque on a dark night necessitates Paradise." And Anas ibn Malik said: "Whoever lights a lamp in the mosque, the angels and the bearers of the Throne do not cease seeking forgiveness for him so long as the light of that lamp remains in the mosque." And 'Ali, may Allah honor his countenance, said: "When a servant dies, his prayer place from the earth and the ascent of his deeds from the sky weep for him." Then he recited: "So the sky and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they given respite." And Ibn 'Abbas said: "The earth weeps for him for forty mornings." And 'Ata' al-Khurasani said: "There is no servant who prostrates to Allah a prostration in any spot of the earth except that it will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection and weep for him on the day he dies." And Anas ibn Malik said: "There is no spot upon which Allah the Exalted is mentioned through prayer or remembrance except that it boasts to the spots around it and rejoices in the remembrance of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to the extent of the seven earths. And there is no servant who stands to pray except that the earth is adorned for him." And it is said: "There is no dwelling where a people settle except that dwelling prays for them or curses them."

   (The Second Chapter: On the Manner of the Outward Acts of Prayer, Beginning with the Takbir and What Precedes It)

   It is fitting for the one praying, when he has completed the ablution and purification from filth on the body, the place, and the garments, and has covered the private parts from the navel to the knee, to stand upright, facing the qiblah, and to separate his feet slightly, not joining them together, for that was among the things by which a man's understanding of religion was recognized. And He, may blessings and peace be upon him, forbade *safn* and *safad* in prayer. *Safad* is the joining of the feet together, and from it is His saying, the Exalted: "Shackled together in fetters." And *safn* is the raising of one foot, and from it is His saying, Mighty and Majestic: "The pawing, swift steeds." This is what he observes regarding his feet during the standing. And he observes regarding his knees and the place of his belt the upright posture. As for his head, if he wishes, he may leave it in line with the upright standing, or if he wishes, he may lower it, and lowering is closer to humility and more restraining for the gaze. Let his sight be confined to his prayer place upon which he prays. If he does not have a designated prayer place, then let him draw near to a wall or draw a line, for that shortens the range of sight and prevents the scattering of thoughts. And let him restrain his gaze from exceeding the edges of the prayer place or the boundaries of the line. And let him persist in this standing thus until the bowing, without turning aside. This is the etiquette of the standing.

   When his standing, his facing, and his lowering are thus established, then let him recite: "Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind," seeking protection by it from Satan. Then let him give the *iqamah*. And if he hopes for the attendance of someone who will follow him, let him give the *adhan* first. Then let him bring forth the intention, which is that he intends for the noon prayer, for example, and says in his heart: "I perform the obligatory noon prayer for Allah," to distinguish it by saying "I perform" from making it up, by "obligatory" from voluntary, and by "noon" from the afternoon and others. And let the meanings of these words be present in his heart, for that is the intention, and the words are reminders and causes for their presence. And let him strive to sustain that until the end of the *takbir*, so that it does not slip away. When that is present in his heart, then let him raise his hands to the level of his shoulders after letting them hang, such that his palms are opposite his shoulders, his thumbs opposite the earlobes, and the tips of his fingers opposite the tops of his ears, so as to combine the narrations reported concerning it. And let him turn his palms and thumbs toward the qiblah, and spread his fingers, not clenching them, nor forcing them to be separated or closed, but rather leaving them according to their natural state, for it is transmitted in the tradition both spreading and closing, and this is between them, so it is preferable. And when the hands are settled in their place, he begins...

The magnification (saying "Allahu Akbar") is performed while extending the hands and bringing the intention to mind. Then he places his hands above the navel and below the chest, placing the right hand over the left as an honor to the right hand by having it be the bearer, and he spreads the thumb and middle finger of the right hand along the length of the forearm, and he grasps the wrist of the left hand with the thumb, the little finger, and the ring finger. It has been narrated that the magnification is performed with raising the hands, with settling them, and with extending them; all of that is without blame, and I see the extension as most fitting, for it is the word of the contract, and placing one hand upon the other is in the form of a contract, its beginning is the extension and its end is the placement, and the beginning of the magnification is the *alif* and its end is the *ra'*, so it is fitting to observe the correspondence between the action and the contract. As for raising the hands, it is like a prelude to this beginning. Then he should not raise his hands forward in a raised manner during the magnification, nor bring them back behind his shoulders, nor shake them to the right and left with a shake when he finishes the magnification; rather, he extends them with a light, gentle extension. He resumes placing the right hand over the left after the extension. In some narrations, it is reported that "when he would magnify, he would extend his hands, and when he intended to recite, he would place the right hand over the left." If this is authentic, it is preferable to what we have mentioned. As for the magnification, he should join the *ha'* of His saying "Allah" with a light joining without exaggeration, and he should not insert something resembling a *waw* between the *ha'* and the *alif*, for that results from exaggeration. He should not insert an *alif* between the *ba'* of "Akbar" and its *ra'* as if saying "Akbaar," and he should make the *ra'* of the magnification vowelless and not join it. This is the form of the magnification and what accompanies it.

(The Recitation)
Then he begins with the opening supplication, and it is good to say after his saying "Allahu Akbar": "Allahu Akbaru kabeera, wal-hamdu lillahi katheera, wa subhanallahi bukratan wa aseela," then "Wajjahtu wajhi..." up to "...wa ana min al-muslimeen." Then he says: "Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, wa tabarakasmuka, wa ta'ala jadduka, wa jalla thana'uka, wa la ilaha ghairuk," so that he may combine the various matters that have come in the reports. If he is behind an Imam, he shortens it if the Imam does not have a long pause in which to recite. Then he says: "A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajeem," then he recites Al-Fatihah, beginning it with "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Raheem" with all its emphases and letters complete, and he strives to differentiate between the *dad* and the *dha'*. He says "Ameen" at the end of Al-Fatihah and prolongs it with a prolongation, and he does not connect "Ameen" to his saying "wa lad-dalleen" with a connection. He recites aloud in the Fajr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers unless he is a follower, and he says "Ameen" aloud. Then he recites a Surah or an amount of three verses from the Qur'an or more, and he does not connect the end of the Surah to the magnification of the bowing by separating between them with an amount like his saying "Subhanallah." He recites in Fajr from the long Surahs of Al-Mufassal, and in Maghrib from its short ones, and in Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha similarly, and "Wassama'i thati al-burooj" and what is similar to it, and in Fajr during travel, "Qul ya ayyuha al-kafiroon" and "Qul huwa Allahu ahad," and likewise in the two rak'ahs of Fajr, Tawaf, and the greeting. In all of that, he is maintaining the standing and the placement of the hands as we described at the beginning of the prayer.

(The Bowing and Its Related Matters)
Then he bows, observing in it several matters: that he magnifies for the bowing, that he raises his hands with the magnification of the bowing, that he prolongs the magnification until reaching the bowing, that he places his palms on his knees during the bowing with his fingers spread and directed towards the Qiblah along the length of the shin, that he makes his knees upright and does not bend them, that he extends his back evenly, that his neck and head are level with his back like a single plate, his head neither lower nor higher, that he keeps his elbows away from his sides (and the woman draws her elbows to her sides), and that he says "Subhana Rabbi al-'Adheem" three times, and increasing to seven and to ten is good if he is not an Imam. Then he rises from the bowing to the standing, raises his hands, and says "Sami' Allahu liman hamidah," and he is tranquil in the straightening and says: "Rabbana lakal-hamdu mil'as-samawati wa mil'al-ardi wa mil'a ma shi'ta min shay'in ba'd." He does not prolong this standing except in the prayer of glorification, the eclipse prayer, and Fajr. He performs the supplication in Fajr in the second rak'ah with the transmitted words before the prostration.

(The Prostration)
Then he descends to the prostration while magnifying, placing his knees on the ground, and placing his forehead, nose, and palms uncovered. He magnifies during the descent and does not raise his hands except in the bowing. It is proper that the first of him to touch the ground be his knees, that he places his hands after them, then places his face after them, that he places his forehead and nose on the ground, that he keeps his elbows away from his sides (and the woman does not do that)...

He should spread his legs apart, but a woman should not do so. In prostration, he should lower himself close to the ground, while a woman should not lower herself as much. "Lowering" means raising the abdomen away from the thighs and spreading the knees apart. He should place his hands on the ground opposite his shoulders, not spreading his fingers apart but rather joining them together, and include the thumbs with them. If he does not include the thumbs, it is acceptable. He should not spread his forearms on the ground like a dog, for that is prohibited. He should say, "Glory be to my Lord, the Most High," three times; if he increases it, it is good, unless he is leading the prayer. Then he should rise from prostration, sitting calmly and upright, raising his head while saying "Allahu Akbar." He should sit on his left foot and erect his right foot, placing his hands on his thighs with fingers extended, neither forcing them together nor spreading them apart. He should say, "My Lord, forgive me, have mercy on me, provide for me, guide me, mend me, grant me well-being, and pardon me." He should not prolong this sitting except in the prostration of glorification. Then he performs the second prostration in the same manner. After it, he sits up lightly for a brief rest in every rak'ah, but does not recite the Tashahhud following it. Then he rises, placing his hands on the ground, not advancing one of his feet during the rising. He should extend the takbir so that it spans from the midpoint of his rise from sitting to the midpoint of his rise to standing, such that the "ha" of "Allah" occurs when he is settled sitting, and the "kaf" of "Akbar" when he leans on his hands to stand, with another "Akbar" in the middle of his rise to standing. He begins in the middle of his rise to standing so that the takbir falls in the middle of his movement, not missing it except at the extremes, which is closer to comprehensiveness. He prays the second rak'ah like the first and repeats the seeking of refuge as at the beginning.

(The Tashahhud)
Then, in the second rak'ah, he recites the first Tashahhud, then sends blessings upon the Messenger of God and his family. He places his right hand on his right thigh, curling the fingers of his right hand except the index finger; it is also acceptable to leave the thumb relaxed. He points with his right index finger alone when saying "except God," not when saying "There is no god." In this Tashahhud, he sits on his left foot as between the two prostrations. In the final Tashahhud, he completes the transmitted supplication after sending blessings upon the Prophet, and its manners are like the manners of the first Tashahhud, but in the final one he sits on his left hip because he is not poised to rise but is settled. He extends his left foot out from under him and erects his right foot, directing the tip of his thumb toward the qiblah if it is not difficult. Then he says, "Peace be upon you and the mercy of God," turning to the right so that his right cheek is visible from behind on the right side, and similarly turns to the left, offering a second salutation. He intends to exit the prayer with the salutation, and in the first salutation intends peace upon the angels and Muslims to his right, and intends the same in the second. He should pronounce the salutation decisively, not prolonging it, as that is the Sunnah. This is the form of the prayer for one praying alone. He raises his voice with the takbirs, but only to the extent he can hear himself. The imam intends leadership to attain the merit; if he does not intend it, the prayer of the people is valid if they intend to follow, and they attain the merit of congregation. He silently recites the opening supplication and seeking of refuge like one praying alone. He recites Al-Fatihah and the surah aloud in all Fajr prayers and the first two rak'ahs of Isha and Maghrib, as does one praying alone. He says "Amin" aloud in prayers recited aloud, as does the follower. The follower synchronizes his "Amin" with the imam's simultaneously, not consecutively. The imam pauses briefly after Al-Fatihah to catch his breath, and the follower recites Al-Fatihah during this pause in prayers recited aloud to be able to listen during the imam's recitation. The follower does not recite surahs in prayers recited aloud unless he cannot hear the imam's voice. The imam says, "God hears those who praise Him," when raising his head from bowing, as does the follower. The imam should not exceed three in the glorifications of bowing and prostration, nor in the first Tashahhud after saying, "O God, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad." He confines himself to Al-Fatihah in the last two rak'ahs and does not prolong unduly for the people. He should not exceed in his supplication in the final Tashahhud beyond the extent of the Tashahhud and sending blessings upon the Messenger of God. He intends with the salutation peace upon the people and angels, and the people intend with their salutation to respond to him. The imam remains stationary a while until the people finish the salutation, then turns his face toward the people. It is preferable for him to remain if there are women behind the men so they may depart before him. No one from the people should rise until he rises, and the imam may depart as he wishes, to his right or left, with the right being more beloved. The imam should not specify himself in the supplication of the qunut of Fajr but rather say, "O God, guide us," reciting it aloud, and the people say "Amin" and raise their hands opposite their chests, wiping their faces at the conclusion of the supplication according to the hadith.

If it is transmitted therein, then it is permissible; otherwise, the analogy is that the hands should not be raised, as is the case at the end of the Tashahhud.
                                 (The Prohibitions)
   The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prohibited *safn* and *safd* in prayer—both of which we have mentioned—and also prohibited *iq'a'*, *sadl*, *kaft*, *ikhtisar*, *salb*, *mawasala*, and the prayer of one who is restraining urine (*haqin*), restraining feces (*haqib*), or wearing tight footwear (*haziq*), as well as the prayer of one who is hungry, angry, or covering his face (*mutalaththim*), which means veiling the face. As for *iq'a'*, according to the linguists, it is to sit on one's buttocks, erect the knees, and place the hands on the ground like a dog. According to the scholars of Hadith, it is to sit on one's shanks, kneeling, with only the tips of the toes and the knees touching the ground. As for *sadl*, the view of the Hadith scholars is that it is to wrap oneself in one's garment, inserting the hands from within, and then to bow and prostrate in that state. This was the practice of the Jews in their prayer, so Muslims were forbidden to resemble them. The shirt is similar in meaning, so one should not bow and prostrate with his hands inside the body of the shirt. It is also said that it means to place the middle of the waist-wrapper on one's head and let its ends hang on his right and left without placing them on his shoulders. The first interpretation is more accurate. As for *kaft*, it is to lift one's garments from the front or from behind when intending to prostrate. *Kaft* can also apply to the hair of the head, so one should not pray while having his hair tied up. The prohibition is for men. In the Hadith: "I have been commanded to prostrate on seven limbs and not to tuck up my hair or my garment." Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God be pleased with him, disliked girding a waist-wrapper over the shirt during prayer and considered it a form of *kaft*. As for *ikhtisar*, it is to place one's hands on one's waist. As for *salb*, it is to place one's hands on one's waist while standing and to keep the upper arms away from the sides while standing. As for *mawasala*, it comprises five matters: two pertain to the Imam—that he should not connect his recitation with the opening *takbir*, nor his bowing with his recitation; two pertain to the follower—that he should not connect his opening *takbir* with the Imam's *takbir*, nor his salutation with the Imam's salutation; and one is common to both—that he should not connect the first salutation of an obligatory prayer with the second salutation, but should separate between them. As for *haqin*, it refers to one restraining urine; *haqib* refers to one restraining feces; and *haziq* refers to one wearing tight footwear, for all of these prevent humility. In the same meaning are the hungry and the preoccupied. The prohibition of the hungry is understood from his saying, peace be upon him: "When dinner is served and the prayer is established, begin with dinner, unless the time is tight or one's heart is at ease." And in the report: "Let none of you enter prayer while frowning, nor should any of you pray while angry." Al-Hasan said: "Any prayer in which the heart is not present is quicker to punishment." In the Hadith: "Seven things in prayer are from Satan: nosebleed, drowsiness, whispering thoughts, yawning, itching, turning the head, and fiddling with something." Some added forgetfulness and doubt. Some of the predecessors said: "Four things in prayer are from heedlessness: turning the head, wiping the face, leveling the pebbles, and praying in a pathway where people pass in front of you." (He also prohibited interlocking the fingers, or cracking the fingers, or covering the face, or placing one palm on the other and inserting them between the thighs while bowing.) Some of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, said: "We used to do that, but we were prohibited from it." It is also disliked to blow on the ground during prostration for cleaning, and to level the pebbles with one's hand, for these are unnecessary actions. One should not raise one foot and place it on his thigh, nor should he lean against a wall while standing. If he leans in such a way that if that wall were removed he would fall, the more apparent ruling is the invalidity of his prayer, and God knows best.
                           (Distinguishing Obligations and Traditions)
   The totality of what has been mentioned comprises obligations, traditions, etiquettes, and postures, all of which one who desires the path of the Hereafter should observe. The obligations among them are twelve traits: intention, the *takbir*, standing, [reciting] al-Fatihah, bowing in the *ruku'* until one's palms reach his knees with stillness, rising upright from it, prostrating with stillness (placing the hands is not obligatory), rising upright from it while sitting, sitting for the final Tashahhud, the final Tashahhud, sending blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the first salutation. As for the intention to exit [the prayer], it is not obligatory. Apart from this, nothing else is obligatory; rather, they are traditions and postures pertaining to these and to the obligations. As for the traditions among the actions, they are four: raising the hands during the opening *takbir*, when descending to bow, when rising to stand, and the sitting for the first Tashahhud. As for what we mentioned concerning the manner of spreading the fingers and the limit of raising them, these are postures subsidiary to this tradition. *Tawarruk* and *iftirash* are postures subsidiary to the sitting. Lowering the gaze and refraining from turning are postures for the standing and improving its form. We have not counted the sitting of rest among the fundamental traditions of action.

For it is like an embellishment for the posture of rising from prostration to standing, because it is not intended in itself, and for that reason it was not singled out for mention. As for the Sunnah acts from the invocations, they are: the opening supplication, then seeking refuge, then saying 'Amin' for it is a confirmed Sunnah, then reciting the Surah, then the takbirs for transitions, then the remembrance in the bowing, prostration, and rising from them, then the first Tashahhud and the prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ therein, then the supplication at the end of the final Tashahhud, then the second Taslim. And if we gather them under the name 'Sunnah', they have varying degrees, for four of them are compensated for by the prostration of forgetfulness. As for the actions, there is one: the first sitting for the initial Tashahhud, for it is effective in ordering the arrangement of the prayer in the eyes of the observers so that it is known by it whether it is four-rak'ah or not, unlike raising the hands, for it does not affect changing the arrangement. Thus, it was expressed as 'some', and it is said these parts are compensated for by prostration. As for the invocations, all of them do not necessitate the prostration of forgetfulness except three: the Qunut, the first Tashahhud, and the prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ therein, unlike the takbirs of transitions and the remembrances of bowing, prostration, and rising from them. This is because bowing and prostration in their form are contrary to custom, and the meaning of worship is attained by them along with silence from the invocations and from the takbirs of transitions. Thus, the absence of those invocations does not change the form of the worship. As for the sitting for the first Tashahhud, it is a customary action, and it was only added for the Tashahhud, so omitting it has an apparent effect. As for the opening supplication and the Surah, omitting them does not have an effect, given that the standing has become inhabited by the Fatihah and distinguished from custom by it. Likewise, the supplication in the final Tashahhud and the Qunut are the furthest from being compensated for by prostration. However, the prolonging of the standing in the dawn prayer was legislated for its sake, so it became like prolonging the sitting of rest, for it became, with the prolonging along with the Tashahhud, a sitting for the first Tashahhud. Thus, this remained a prolonged, customary standing in which there is no obligatory remembrance. In specifying 'prolonged', there is a distinction from other than the dawn prayer, and in its being empty of an obligatory remembrance, there is a distinction from the original standing in the prayer.

If you say: Distinguishing Sunnah acts from obligatory ones is understandable, for validity is lost by missing an obligation, not a Sunnah, and punishment is directed for it, not for it. But as for distinguishing one Sunnah from another, while all are commanded on the basis of recommendation, and there is no punishment in omitting all of them, and reward exists for all of them, then what is its meaning? Know that their sharing in reward, punishment, and recommendation does not remove their disparity. We shall unveil that for you with an example: A human being is not a complete, existing human except by an inner meaning and outward limbs. The inner meaning is life and the spirit, and the outward are the bodies of his limbs. Then, some of those limbs, the human ceases to exist by their absence, like the heart, liver, and brain—every limb by whose absence life is lost. And some of them, life is not lost by their absence, but the purposes of life are lost by it, like the eye, hand, leg, and tongue. And some of them, neither life nor its purposes are lost by their absence, but beauty is lost by it, like the eyebrows, beard, eyelashes, and fairness of complexion. And some of them, the foundation of beauty is not lost by their absence, but its perfection is, like the arching of the eyebrows, the blackness of the beard and eyelashes, the proportionality of the limbs' creation, and the blending of redness with whiteness in the complexion. These are varying degrees. Similarly, worship is a form whose shape the Lawgiver has fashioned, and He has made us worship by acquiring it. Its spirit and inner life are humility, intention, presence of heart, and sincerity, as will come later. We are now concerning its outward parts. Thus, the bowing, prostration, standing, and other pillars take the place of the heart, head, and liver, for the existence of the prayer is lost by their loss. And the Sunnah acts we mentioned—from raising the hands, the opening supplication, and the first Tashahhud—take the place of the hands, eyes, and legs. Validity is not lost by their loss, just as life is not lost by the loss of these limbs, but the person becomes, due to their loss, deformed in creation, blameworthy, and undesirable. Likewise, whoever confines himself to the minimum that suffices for the prayer is like one who presents to a king among kings a living slave with severed limbs. As for the postures, which are beyond the Sunnah acts, they take the place of the causes of beauty from the eyebrows, beard, eyelashes, and fairness of complexion. And as for the functions of the invocations in those Sunnah acts, they are perfections of beauty, like the arching of the eyebrows, the roundness of the beard, and other such things. So the prayer, in your view, is a means of nearness and a gift you draw near with to the presence of the King of Kings, like a handmaid a seeker of nearness from the sultans presents to them. This gift is presented to God, Mighty and Majestic, then it is returned to you on the Day of the Greatest Presentation. The choice is yours in beautifying its form or making it ugly. If you beautify it, it is for yourself, and if you spoil it, it is upon yourself. And it is not fitting that your portion from practicing jurisprudence is merely that the Sunnah is distinguished for you from...

The obligation is such that nothing from the descriptions of the Sunnah should be attached to your understanding except that it is permissible to leave it, so you leave it. For that resembles the saying of the physician: "Piercing the eye does not nullify a human's existence, but it removes him from being truthful in the hope of the one seeking closeness when the Sultan presents him in the context of a gift." Thus should you understand the ranks of the Sunnahs, forms, and etiquettes. For every prayer whose bowing and prostration a person does not complete, it is the foremost adversary against its owner, saying: "May God neglect you as you have neglected me." So examine the reports we have cited concerning the perfection of the pillars of prayer, that its impact may become clear to you.

(Chapter Three: On the Inner Conditions from the Heart's Works)

And let us mention in this chapter the connection of prayer with humility and the heart's presence. Then we shall mention the inner meanings, their definitions, their causes, and their remedy. Then let us mention in detail what should be present in every pillar of the prayer, that it may be suitable as provision for the Hereafter.

(Explanation of the Condition of Humility and the Heart's Presence)

Know that the proofs for this are many. Among them is His saying, the Exalted: "And establish prayer for My remembrance" [Ta-Ha: 14]. The apparent meaning of the command is obligation, and heedlessness opposes remembrance. So how can one who is heedless throughout all his prayer be establishing prayer for His remembrance? And His saying, the Exalted: "And be not among the heedless" [al-A'raf: 205] is a prohibition, and its apparent meaning is forbiddance. And His saying, the Almighty: "Until you know what you are saying" [an-Nisa': 43] is an explanation for the prohibition against the intoxicated, and it applies equally to the heedless one whose concern is absorbed by whisperings and worldly thoughts. And His saying, peace be upon him: "Prayer is nothing but submissiveness and humility" confines it with the definite article, and the word 'innama' is for affirmation and emphasis. The jurists understood from his saying, peace be upon him: "Preemption is only for what has not been divided" confinement, affirmation, and negation. And his saying, peace be upon him: "Whoever is not prevented by his prayer from obscenity and evil deeds increases nothing from God except distance." And the prayer of the heedless does not prevent obscenity and evil deeds. And he said, peace be upon him: "How many a person standing in prayer gains nothing from it but fatigue and weariness," and he intended none but the heedless. And he said, peace be upon him: "The servant has from his prayer only what he comprehends of it." The reality in this is that the one praying is in intimate discourse with his Lord, the Almighty, as has been reported in the tradition. And speech with heedlessness is not intimate discourse at all. Its explanation is that if a person is heedless of Zakat, for example, it in itself opposes desire and is difficult upon the soul, and likewise fasting subdues the faculties and breaks the dominance of caprice, which is the instrument of Satan, the enemy of God. Thus it is not far-fetched that its objective is attained even with heedlessness. Similarly, Hajj—its actions are arduous and severe, and within it is a striving that results in hardship, whether the heart is present with its actions or not. As for prayer, there is nothing in it except remembrance, recitation, bowing, prostration, standing, and sitting. As for the remembrance, it is proximity and intimate discourse with God, the Almighty. Now, is the objective from it that it be an address and dialogue, or is the objective from it the letters and sounds as a test for the tongue through action, just as the stomach and private parts are tested by abstinence in fasting, and just as the body is tested by the hardships of Hajj, and tested by the hardship of giving Zakat and cutting off beloved wealth? Without doubt, this latter category is invalid. For moving the tongue with babbling—how light it is for the heedless! There is no test in it from the perspective of it being an action. Rather, the objective is the letters from the perspective of it being speech, and it is not speech unless it expresses what is within the conscience, and it does not express except with the presence of the heart. So what question is there in saying "Guide us to the straight path" if the heart is heedless? And if the intention of it being supplication and invocation is not present, then what hardship is there in moving the tongue with it while heedless, especially after habituation? This is the ruling concerning the remembrances. Nay, I say: If a person swore an oath and said, "I will surely thank so-and-so, praise him, and ask him for a need," then the words indicating these meanings flowed on his tongue in sleep, he would not have fulfilled his oath. And if they flowed on his tongue in darkness, and that person was present, but he did not know of his presence and did not see him, he would not become one who has fulfilled his oath, for his speech is not an address and speech with him unless he is present in his heart. If these words were to flow on his tongue while he was present, except that in broad daylight he was heedless because his concern was absorbed by a thought from among thoughts, and he had no intention of directing the address to Him at the moment of his speech, he would not become one who has fulfilled his oath. There is no doubt that the objective of the recitation and remembrances is praise, glorification, supplication, and invocation, and the one addressed is God, the Almighty. Yet his heart is veiled by the veil of heedlessness, veiled from Him, so he does not see Him nor behold Him. Rather, he is heedless of the One addressed, and his tongue moves by force of habit. How far is this from the objective of prayer, which was legislated to polish the heart, renew the remembrance of God, the Almighty, and solidify the bond of faith in Him. This is the ruling concerning the recitation.

And remembrance, in summary, is a characteristic that cannot be denied in speech and distinguished from action. As for bowing and prostration, their purpose is undoubtedly glorification. If it were permissible for one to be glorifying God, Exalted is He, by his action while being heedless of it, then it would be permissible for one to be glorifying an idol placed before him while being heedless of it, or glorifying the wall before him while being heedless of it. If it ceases to be glorification, nothing remains but mere movement of the back and head, containing no hardship intended as a test. Then to make it the pillar of religion and the distinction between disbelief and Islam, to give it precedence over Hajj and all other acts of worship, and to mandate killing specifically for its abandonment—I do not see that all this grandeur for prayer, from the perspective of its outward actions, is warranted unless the objective of intimate communion is added to it. For that takes precedence over fasting, almsgiving, Hajj, and others; indeed, even over sacrifices and offerings, which are a struggle for the soul through the diminishment of wealth. God, the Exalted, has said: "Their flesh will not reach God, nor their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you" (Qur'an 22:37). That is, the quality that has taken hold of the heart, compelling it to obey the commands, is what is sought. So how is the matter with prayer, where there is no benefit in its mere actions? This indicates, from the perspective of meaning, the necessity of the heart's presence.

If you say: "If you rule the prayer invalid and make the heart's presence a condition for its validity, you contradict the consensus of the jurists, for they only stipulated the heart's presence at the opening takbir." Then know that it has been previously established in the Book of Knowledge that jurists do not delve into the inward, nor do they probe hearts, nor into the path of the Hereafter. Rather, they base the rulings of religion on the outward actions of the limbs, and outward actions suffice to avert capital punishment and the ruler's disciplinary punishment. As for whether it benefits in the Hereafter, that is not within the scope of jurisprudence. Moreover, consensus cannot be claimed, for it has been reported from Bishr ibn al-Harith—as narrated from him by Abu Talib al-Makki from Sufyan al-Thawri—that he said: "Whoever does not have humility, his prayer is corrupted." And it is reported from al-Hasan that he said: "Every prayer in which the heart is not present is quicker to punishment." And from Mu'adh ibn Jabal: "Whoever knowingly recognizes who is on his right and left while in prayer, his prayer is not valid." It is also reported with a chain that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, a servant may pray a prayer, and not a sixth nor a tenth of it is recorded for him. Only that portion of his prayer which he is mindful of is recorded for the servant." Had this been reported from anyone else, it would have been taken as a school of thought, so how can one not adhere to it? And 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: "The scholars have agreed that a servant only has from his prayer what he is mindful of," thus considering it a consensus. What has been reported of this kind from the scrupulous jurists and the scholars of the Hereafter is too numerous to count. The truth is to return to the proofs of the Sacred Law, and the reports and traditions are clear regarding this condition. However, the position of issuing legal rulings regarding the outward obligation is gauged according to the deficiency of creation, so it is not possible to stipulate upon people the presence of the heart throughout the entire prayer, for that is beyond the capability of all humankind except a very few. Since stipulating complete attentiveness is impossible due to necessity, there is no recourse but to stipulate from it what the term applies to, even if in a single moment—and the most appropriate moment for that is the moment of the opening takbir. Thus, we have limited the obligation to that. Yet, despite that, we hope that the state of the heedless person throughout his entire prayer is not like the state of one who abandons it completely, for he has generally undertaken the action outwardly and brought his heart to presence for a moment. How could it not be so? For one who prays while in a state of minor impurity forgetfully, his prayer is invalid according to God, the Exalted, but he has reward for what he reckoned his action to be, according to his deficiency and excuse. With this hope, it is feared that his state may be more severe than that of the abandoner. How could it not be so? For one who attends the service yet is negligent in the presence, and speaks the words of the heedless and contemptuous, is in a more severe state than one who turns away from the service. When the causes of fear and hope conflict and the matter becomes perilous in one's soul, then the choice thereafter between caution and leniency is yours. Nevertheless, there is no hope in opposing the jurists in what they have issued as a ruling of validity despite heedlessness, for that is from the necessity of legal ruling, as previously indicated. And whoever knows the secret of prayer knows that heedlessness contradicts it. But we have mentioned in the chapter on the difference between inward and outward knowledge in the Book of the Foundations of Beliefs that the deficiency of creation is one of the reasons preventing the explicit declaration of all that is unveiled of the secrets of the Sacred Law. So let us limit ourselves to this extent of investigation, for in it is sufficiency for the aspirant seeking the path of the Hereafter. As for the contentious disputant, we do not intend to address him now. The essence of the discourse is that the presence of the heart is the spirit of prayer, and the minimum that preserves a trace of that spirit is presence at the opening takbir. Any deficiency therein is ruin.

And according to the increase in it, the spirit expands throughout the parts of the prayer. How many a living being is there with no movement, close to being dead? Thus, the prayer of the heedless in all its parts except at the takbir is like a living being with no movement. We ask God for good assistance.

(Explanation of the Inner Meanings Which Complete the Life of the Prayer)

Know that the expressions for these meanings are many, but they are gathered in six phrases: presence of heart, comprehension, reverence, awe, hope, and shame. Let us mention their details, then their causes, then the remedy for acquiring them.

As for the details: The first is presence of heart. By it we mean that the heart is emptied of anything other than what it is engaged with and speaking of, so that knowledge of the action and the speech is coupled with them, and thought does not wander to other than them. Whenever thought turns away from other than what one is in, and there is in his heart a remembrance of what he is in, and there is no heedlessness in him regarding everything, then presence of heart has been achieved. However, comprehension of the meaning of the speech is a matter beyond presence of heart. For perhaps the heart is present with the wording but is not present with the meaning of the wording. The heart's encompassing knowledge of the meaning of the wording is what we intended by comprehension. This is a station in which people differ, for people do not share equally in comprehending the meanings of the Qur'an and the glorifications. How many subtle meanings does the worshipper understand during the prayer that had not occurred to his heart before? From this perspective, the prayer is a restraint from indecency and evil, for it makes one understand matters that undoubtedly prevent from indecency.

As for reverence, it is a matter beyond presence of heart and comprehension. For a man may address his servant with speech in which his heart is present and he comprehends its meaning, yet he does not revere him. So reverence is additional to them both.

As for awe, it is additional to reverence. Rather, it is an expression for a fear whose source is reverence. For one who does not fear is not called 'in awe'. Fear of a scorpion, or the bad character of a servant, and what is similar to these base causes, is not called awe. Rather, fear of a revered sovereign is called awe. Awe is fear whose source is veneration.

As for hope, there is no doubt it is additional. For how many revere a king among kings, or fear his tyranny, but do not hope for his reward? The servant should be hoping by his prayer for the reward of God, Glorified and Exalted, just as he is fearful due to his shortcomings of the punishment of God, Glorified and Exalted.

As for shame, it is additional to the totality. For its basis is the feeling of shortcoming and the imagining of sin. Reverence, fear, and hope can be conceived without shame where there is no imagining of shortcoming and commission of sin.

As for the causes of these six meanings, know that the cause of presence of heart is earnest aspiration. For your heart follows your earnest aspiration; it is only present in what concerns you. Whenever a matter concerns you, the heart is present in it, whether it wills or refuses, for it is created and subjugated to that. If the heart is not present in the prayer, it is not idle; rather, it wanders in what the earnest aspiration is directed to from worldly affairs. There is no means or remedy for bringing the heart to presence except by directing the earnest aspiration to the prayer. And the earnest aspiration is not directed to it unless it becomes clear that the desired objective is tied to it, and that is faith and belief that the Hereafter is better and more lasting, and that prayer is a means to it. When this is added to the true knowledge of the insignificance of the world and its affairs, from their combination presence of heart in the prayer is achieved. By a cause like this, your heart is present if you are present before some great personage who has no power to harm or benefit you. So if it is not present during intimate discourse with the King of kings, in Whose hand is the dominion and the sovereignty, and benefit and harm, then do not think it has any cause other than weakness of faith. Strive now in strengthening faith, and its path is detailed elsewhere.

As for comprehension, its cause, after presence of heart, is persistent reflection and directing the mind to grasping the meaning. Its remedy is the same as the remedy for bringing the heart to presence, along with turning to reflection and exerting oneself to repel distracting thoughts. The remedy for repelling distracting, preoccupying thoughts is to cut off their sources—I mean, turning away from those causes to which thoughts are drawn. Unless those sources are cut off, thoughts do not turn away from them. For whoever loves something mentions it often, and the remembrance of the beloved assaults the heart necessarily. Therefore, you see that whoever loves other than God, his prayer is not pure from distracting thoughts.

As for reverence, it is a state of the heart generated from two knowledges: The first: knowledge of the majesty of God, Glorified and Exalted, and His greatness. This is from the fundamentals of faith, for whoever does not believe in His greatness, his soul does not submit to revering Him. The second: knowledge of the insignificance of the self, its baseness, and its being an enslaved, subjugated, owned servant. So that from the two knowledges is generated humility, brokenness, and submissiveness to God, the Exalted, and it is expressed as reverence. Unless the knowledge of the insignificance of the self is mixed...

The soul, through knowledge of God's majesty, does not automatically attain the state of reverence and humility. For one who is self-sufficient and secure in himself may recognize attributes of grandeur in another, yet reverence and humility may not be his state, because the other requisite element—the knowledge of the soul's own insignificance and need—has not accompanied it. As for awe and fear, these are states of the soul generated from the knowledge of God's power, His overwhelming authority, and the execution of His will upon it, coupled with His lack of concern for it—that were He to destroy the first and the last, it would not diminish His dominion by an atom. This is alongside observing what befalls the prophets and the saints of calamities and various tribulations, despite the ability to repel them, contrary to what is witnessed with the kings of the earth. In sum, whenever knowledge of God increases, fear and awe increase. The causes of this will come in the Book of Fear from the Quarter of the Deliverances.

As for hope, its cause is knowledge of God's gentleness, His generosity, His vast blessings, the subtleties of His craftsmanship, and knowledge of His truthfulness in His promise of Paradise for prayer. When certainty in His promise and knowledge of His gentleness are attained, hope inevitably springs from their combination. As for shame, it is by sensing one's shortcoming in worship and knowing one's inability to fulfill the immense right of God, and this is strengthened by knowledge of the soul's faults, its defects, its lack of sincerity, the corruption of its inner thoughts, and its inclination toward immediate gain in all its actions, coupled with knowledge of the immense requirement of God's majesty and the knowledge that He is aware of the secret and the fleeting thoughts of the heart, however minute and hidden they may be. When these forms of knowledge are attained with certainty, a state called shame necessarily arises from them. These are the causes of these attributes, and whatever one seeks to attain, its remedy is to bring about its cause. Thus, in knowing the cause lies the knowledge of the remedy. The bond uniting all these causes is faith and certainty—by which I mean these forms of knowledge we have mentioned. The meaning of their being certainty is the absence of doubt and their domination over the heart, as previously explained in the clarification of certainty in the Book of Knowledge. The heart humbles itself in proportion to the certainty. Therefore, 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would converse with us and we with him, but when the time for prayer came, it was as if he did not know us and we did not know him." It has been narrated that God, glorified be He, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, when you remember Me, remember Me while your limbs tremble, and be humble and tranquil when you remember Me. When you remember Me, place your tongue behind your heart. When you stand before Me, stand as a humble, lowly servant, and commune with Me with a fearful heart and a truthful tongue." And it was narrated that God, exalted be He, revealed to him: "Say to the sinners of your community: Let them not remember Me, for I have sworn upon Myself that whoever remembers Me, I will remember him. If they remember Me, I will remember them with a curse." This is regarding a sinner who is not heedless in his remembrance; how then if heedlessness and disobedience are combined?

Due to the differing meanings we have mentioned in hearts, people are divided into the heedless one who completes his prayer without his heart being present for a moment of it, and into one who completes it and whose heart is not absent for a moment; indeed, his concern with it may be so all-encompassing that he is not aware of what happens before him. For this reason, Muslim ibn Yasar did not feel the pillar falling in the mosque while people gathered around it. Some would attend the congregational prayer for a period and never know who was on his right or left. The throbbing of the heart of Abraham, prayers and peace of God be upon him, could be heard from two miles away. There were groups whose faces would turn pale and whose limbs would tremble. All of this is not far-fetched, for multiples of it are witnessed in the concerns of the people of this world and the fear of the kings of this world, despite their impotence, weakness, and the baseness of the gains obtained from them—to the point that one enters upon a king or a minister, speaks to him of his important matter, then leaves; if he were asked about those around him or about the king's garment, he would be unable to inform about it because his concern with him distracted him from his garment and from those present around him. For everyone are degrees according to what they have done. Thus, each person's share of his prayer is according to his fear, humility, and reverence, for the place of God's gaze, glorified be He, is the hearts, not the outward movements. Therefore, some of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, said: "People will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment in the likeness of their state in prayer—in tranquility and calm, and in experiencing bliss and delight with it." He spoke truthfully, for each will be resurrected according to what he died upon, and he dies according to what he lived upon, and in that, the state of his heart is considered, not the state of his person. From the attributes of hearts, forms are molded in the Abode of the Hereafter, and none will be saved except he who comes to God with a sound heart. We ask God for success through His gentleness and generosity.

(Clarification of the Beneficial Remedy for the Presence of the Heart)

Know that the believer must necessarily revere God, fear Him, hope in Him, and feel shame for his shortcomings. He does not depart from these states after his faith, though their strength is according to the strength of his certainty. His departure from them during prayer has no cause except the scattering of thought and the division of attention.

The heart's absence from intimate communion and heedlessness during prayer arise only from distracting thoughts that intrude. The remedy for bringing the heart into presence is to repel those thoughts, and nothing is repelled except by removing its cause. Therefore, know its cause: the source of intrusive thoughts is either an external matter or an internal matter within oneself.

As for the external, it is what strikes the hearing or appears to the sight, for such can snatch away one's concern so that it follows it and becomes occupied with it. Then thought is drawn from it to other matters, becoming a chain, and seeing becomes a cause for reflection. Then some of those thoughts become a cause for others. Whose intention is strong and resolve is lofty is not distracted by what occurs to his senses, but the weak one inevitably has his thoughts scattered. His cure is to cut off these causes by lowering his gaze, or praying in a dark room, or not leaving before him what occupies his senses, and drawing near to a wall during his prayer so that the range of his sight does not widen. He should guard against praying on thoroughfares, in places with ornate designs, on dyed carpets. For this reason, those devoted to worship would worship in a small, dark room, its size just enough for prostration, so that it would gather one's concern more completely. The strong among them would attend mosques, lower their gaze not letting it go beyond the place of prostration, and considered the perfection of prayer to be not knowing who was on their right or left. Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, would not leave a Qur'an, a sword, or a book in the place of prayer without removing or erasing it.

As for the internal causes, they are more severe. For one whose concerns are scattered in the valleys of worldly matters, his thought is not confined to a single topic but constantly flits from one side to another. Lowering the gaze does not suffice him, for what has settled in the heart beforehand is enough for distraction. The method here is to compel the soul forcibly to comprehend what it recites in prayer and occupy it with that to the exclusion of else. What aids in this is to prepare for it before the opening *takbir* by resolving within himself to remember the Hereafter, the moment of intimate communion, and the gravity of standing before Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, the All-Seeing, and to empty his heart before the *takbir* of whatever concerns him, leaving no preoccupation for his soul that his thoughts might turn to.

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said to 'Uthman ibn Abi Shaybah, "I forgot to tell you to cover the pot that is in the house," for there should not be anything in the house that distracts people from their prayer. This is the way to calm thoughts. If his turbulent thoughts are not calmed by this soothing remedy, then nothing will save him except the purgative that expels the disease's matter from the depths of the veins, which is to look into the matters that divert and distract from bringing the heart into presence. Without doubt, they revert to his preoccupations, and they only became preoccupations due to his desires. So he disciplines his soul by withdrawing from those desires and severing those attachments. For everything that distracts him from his prayer is opposed to his religion and is a soldier of Iblis, his enemy. Holding onto it is more harmful to him than disposing of it, so he rids himself of it by disposing of it.

It is related that when he, peace be upon him, wore the *khumaysah* (a striped garment) brought to him by Abu Jahm, which had a pattern, and prayed in it, he removed it after his prayer and said, "Take this to Abu Jahm, for it distracted me just now from my prayer, and bring me the *anbajaniyyah* (a plain garment) of Abu Jahm." And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered the thong of his sandal to be renewed, then he looked at it during his prayer because it was new, so he ordered it to be removed from it and the old thong returned. He, peace be upon him, had put on sandals whose beauty pleased him, so he prostrated and said, "I humbled myself before my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, so that He would not detest me," then he went out and gave them to the first beggar he met. Then he ordered 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, to buy him two plain, untanned sandals and wore them. He, peace be upon him, had a gold ring on his hand before the *takbir* while on the pulpit, and he threw it away saying, "This distracted me; a glance at it and a glance at you."

It is related that Abu Talhah prayed in an orchard where there was a tree, and a sparrow flying among the trees seeking an exit caught his fancy. He followed it with his gaze for a while, then did not know how much he had prayed. He mentioned to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, what had befallen him of distraction, then said, "O Messenger of Allah, it is charity; place it where you wish." And from another man, that he prayed in his orchard while the palm trees were laden with their fruit. He looked at them and was pleased by them, and did not know how much he had prayed. He mentioned that to 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, and said, "It is charity; use it in the way of Allah, Mighty and Majestic." 'Uthman sold it for fifty thousand, and they would do that to cut off the source of thought and as an expiation for what occurred of deficiency in the prayer.

This is the remedy that cuts off the source of the ailment, and nothing else suffices. As for what we mentioned of gently calming and returning to comprehending the remembrance, that benefits weak desires and concerns that only occupy the fringes of the heart. As for the strong, overwhelming desire, calming does not benefit it; rather, it continually pulls at it and pulls at you, then overcomes you and is spent.

All of your prayer is occupied with the struggle of distraction. Its example is a man beneath a tree who wished for his thoughts to become clear for him, but the chirping of sparrows disturbed him. He would not cease to scare them away with a stick in his hand and return to his thoughts, then the sparrows would return, and he would return to driving them away with the stick. It was said to him, "This is the captive of waterwheels and will not cease. If you desire deliverance, cut down the tree." Likewise, the tree of desires, when its branches spread and fork, thoughts are drawn to it as sparrows are drawn to trees and flies are drawn to filth, and the effort to repel them becomes prolonged. For the fly, whenever it is driven away, it returns, and for that reason it is named *dhubāb* (the returner). So it is with passing thoughts. These desires are many, and the servant is seldom free from them. They are gathered by a single root, which is the love of this world. That is the head of every sin, the foundation of every deficiency, and the source of every corruption. Whoever's inward being is folded upon the love of this world, to the point of inclining towards something of it—not to provision himself from it nor to seek its aid for the Hereafter—then let him not hope that the delight of intimate communion in prayer will become clear for him. For whoever rejoices in the world does not rejoice in God, glorified and exalted is He, nor in communion with Him. A man's aspiration is with the delight of his eye; if the delight of his eye is in the world, his aspiration inevitably turns to it. Yet despite this, one must not abandon striving and returning the heart to prayer, and reducing the distracting causes. This is the bitter medicine, and due to its bitterness, natures find it repugnant, and the ailment remains chronic, and the disease becomes intractable—to the point that the great ones strove to pray two rak'ahs without their souls whispering to them about worldly matters, yet they were incapable of that. Therefore, there is no hope for the likes of us in that. Would that we were secure in half or a third of our prayer from insinuating thoughts, that we might be among those who mix a good deed with another that is evil. In sum, the aspiration for the world and the aspiration for the Hereafter in the heart are like water poured into a cup full of vinegar: inevitably, for every amount of water we put into it, an equal amount of vinegar comes out, and the two do not combine.

(Detailed explanation of what should be present in the heart during every pillar and condition of the prayer's acts)

We say: It is your due, if you are among those who desire the Hereafter, that you first not be heedless of the reminders within the conditions and pillars of the prayer. As for the preceding conditions, they are the call to prayer, purification, covering the private parts, facing the direction of prayer, standing upright, and intention. When you hear the call of the mu'adhdhin, bring to your heart the terror of the call on the Day of Resurrection, and gird your outward and inward being for answering and hastening, for those who hasten to this call are those who will be called with gentleness on the Day of the Greatest Presentation. Present your heart to this call. If you find it filled with joy and glad tidings, charged with eagerness to hasten, then know that the call of glad tidings and success will come to you on the Day of Judgment. For that reason, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Give us rest, O Bilal," meaning, "Give us rest by it and by the call to it," for it was the delight of his eye. As for purification, when you perform it in your place, which is your outermost container, then in your garments, which are your closest covering, then on your skin, which is your innermost layer, do not be heedless of your core, which is your essence—your heart. Strive to purify it through repentance, regret for what you have neglected, and a firm resolve to abstain in the future. Purify your inward being with it, for it is the place your worshipped Lord looks upon. As for covering the private parts, know that its meaning is to cover the shameful parts of your body from the sight of creation, for the outward of your body is a pasture for the gaze of creation. What then of the hidden shameful parts of your inward being and the scandals of your secrets, which none perceives except your Lord, Mighty and Majestic? Bring those scandals to your mind, demand of your soul to cover them, and realize that no cover can conceal anything from the sight of God, glorified and exalted is He; rather, they are forgiven through regret, shame, and fear. By bringing them to your heart, you benefit from the mobilization of the troops of fear and shame from their hiding places, thereby humbling your soul, and your heart becomes subdued under shame, and you stand before God, Mighty and Majestic, like a sinful, offending, runaway servant who has regretted and returned to his Master, his head bowed from shame and fear. As for facing the direction, it is turning the outward of your face from all other directions towards the direction of the House of God, exalted is He. Do you think that turning the heart from all other matters towards God, Mighty and Majestic, is not required of you? Far from it! There is nothing required but that. These outward acts are but movements for the inward states, a restraint for the limbs, and a settling of them by fixing them in one direction, so that they do not transgress against the heart. For if they transgress and are unjust in their movements and turning towards their own directions, they would pull the heart along and turn it away from the Countenance of God, Mighty and Majestic. So let the face of your heart be with the face of your body. Know that just as the face cannot turn towards the direction of the House except by turning away from all else, so the heart cannot turn to God, Mighty and Majestic, except by being free from all besides Him. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "When a servant stands for his prayer, if his passion, his face, and his heart are towards God, Mighty and Majestic, he turns away..."

as on the day his mother bore him. As for standing upright, it is the presentation of the person and the heart before God, exalted is He. Therefore, let your head, which is the highest of your limbs, be lowered, bowed down, and cast down. Let the lowering of the head from its height serve as a reminder to obligate the heart to humility, submissiveness, and disavowal of leadership and arrogance. And let there be present in your awareness here the thought of standing before God, exalted is He, in the dread of the One who observes at the time of presentation for questioning. Know in that moment that you are standing before God, exalted is He, and He is observing you. So stand before Him as you would stand before one of the kings of the age, if you are incapable of comprehending the reality of His majesty. Rather, imagine throughout the duration of your standing in prayer that you are watched and observed by the watchful eye of a righteous man from your family or from those in whose eyes you desire to be known for righteousness. For then your limbs will become calm, your bodily parts will become humble, and all your components will become still, fearing that this weak, poor individual might attribute to you a lack of reverence. And if you sense within yourself composure when observed by a poor servant, then admonish yourself and say to it: You claim knowledge and love of God; are you not ashamed of your audacity towards Him while you revere one of His servants? Or do you fear people and not fear Him, when He is more deserving of being feared? It is for this reason that when Abu Hurairah asked, "How is shyness from God?" He (peace be upon him) said: "Be shy before Him as you would be shy before a righteous man from your people," and it is also narrated "from your family."

As for the intention, resolve to respond to God, exalted is He, in complying with His command to pray, completing it, refraining from what invalidates and spoils it, and making all of that sincerely for the countenance of God, glorified is He, hoping for His reward, fearing His punishment, seeking nearness to Him, and taking on the obligation from Him by His permission. Beware, in your intimate discourse, given your poor manners, abundant disobedience, and the greatness in your soul of the stature of discoursing with Him. Consider whom you are addressing, how you are addressing, and with what you are addressing. At this, your forehead should sweat from shame, your limbs tremble from awe, and your face turn pale from fear.

As for the *takbir* (saying 'Allahu Akbar'), when your tongue utters it, your heart should not belie it. For if there is in your heart something greater than God, glorified is He, then God bears witness that you are a liar, just as the speech was truthful when He bore witness against the hypocrites for their saying, "He is the Messenger of God." If your caprice is more dominant over you than the command of God, exalted is He, then you are more obedient to it than to God, the Most High, and you have taken it as your god and magnified it. It is likely that your saying "God is greater" becomes mere speech with the tongue alone, while the heart lags behind in supporting it. How great is the peril in that, were it not for repentance, seeking forgiveness, and good hope in the graciousness and pardon of God, the Most High.

As for the opening supplication, the first of its words is your saying, "I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth." The meaning of 'face' is not the apparent face, for you have only turned it toward the direction of the *qiblah*, and God, glorified is He, is sanctified above being confined by directions such that you turn your bodily face toward Him. Rather, it is the face of the heart with which you turn toward the Creator of the heavens and the earth. So look to it: is it turned toward its hopes and concerns in the home and the market, following desires, or is it turned toward the Creator of the heavens? Beware that your first opening of intimate discourse be with falsehood and fabrication. The face will not turn to God, the Most High, except by turning away from all besides Him. Strive in that moment to turn it toward Him, and if you are incapable of doing so permanently, then let your saying in that moment be truthful.

When you say, "as a *hanif* and a Muslim," it should occur to your mind that the Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. If you are not such, then you are a liar. Strive to resolve upon it at this commencement and regret what has passed of conditions. When you say, "and I am not of the polytheists," then bring to mind hidden polytheism (*shirk khafi*), for His saying, exalted is He, "So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone," was revealed concerning one who intends by his worship the face of God and the praise of people. Be cautious and fearful of this polytheism, and feel shame in your heart if you describe yourself as not being from the polytheists without being free from this polytheism, for the name of polytheism applies to its minor and major forms.

When you say, "My life and my death are for God," know that this is the state of a servant lost to himself and existing for his Master, and that if it issues from one whose pleasure, anger, standing, sitting, desire for life, and fear of death are for worldly matters, it is not appropriate to the state. When you say, "I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan," know that he is your enemy, lying in wait to divert your heart from God, exalted is He, out of envy toward you for your intimate discourse with God, exalted is He, and your prostration to Him, despite the fact that he was cursed for abandoning a single prostration and was not granted success for it. And your seeking refuge in God, glorified is He, from him is by abandoning what he loves and exchanging it for what God, exalted is He, loves, not by your mere saying. For if a predatory beast or an enemy intends...

lest it devour or kill him, he says, "I seek refuge in that impregnable fortress," while remaining in his place, this will not benefit him; indeed, it will not grant him sanctuary unless he changes his location. Similarly, one who pursues the desires that are the delights of Satan and the abominations of the Merciful will not be aided by mere words alone. Therefore, let his words be coupled with the resolve to seek refuge in the fortress of God, exalted be He, from the evil of Satan. His fortress is "There is no god but God," for He, exalted be He, has said, as reported by our Prophet (peace be upon him): "There is no god but God is My fortress, so whoever enters My fortress is safe from My punishment." The one who takes refuge in it has no object of worship except God, glorified be He. As for the one who takes his desire as his god, he is in the arena of Satan, not in the fortress of God, exalted be He.

Know that among his snares is to distract you during your prayer with thoughts of the Hereafter and planning good deeds, to prevent you from understanding what you recite. Know that anything which distracts you from understanding the meanings of your recitation is a whispering. For the movement of the tongue is not the objective; rather, the objective is its meanings. As for recitation, people are of three types: a man whose tongue moves while his heart is heedless; a man whose tongue moves and his heart follows the tongue, so he understands and hears from it as if hearing from another—these are the ranks of the Companions of the Right Hand; and a man whose heart precedes to the meanings first, then the tongue serves the heart by translating it. So distinguish between the tongue being an interpreter for the heart and it being a teacher for the heart. For those brought near, their tongue is an interpreter that follows the heart; the heart does not follow it.

To detail the translation of meanings: when you say, "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," intend by it seeking blessing for beginning the recitation of the speech of God, glorified be He, and understand that all matters are by God, glorified be He, and that what is meant by "the name" here is the Named One. Since all matters are by God, glorified be He, it is only fitting that all praise is due to God. Its meaning is that gratitude is for God, for blessings are from God. Whoever sees a blessing from other than God, or directs gratitude to other than God, glorified be He, except inasmuch as that other is subjugated by God, exalted be He, then in his naming and praising there is deficiency proportionate to his turning to other than God, exalted be He.

When you say, "the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," bring to your heart all forms of His gentleness, so that His mercy becomes clear to you, and from it your hope springs forth. Then stir from your heart awe and fear by saying, "Master of the Day of Judgment." As for awe, because there is no sovereign except Him; as for fear, due to the terror of the Day of Recompense and Reckoning, of which He is the Master. Then renew sincerity by saying, "You alone we worship," and renew incapacity, need, and disavowal of power and strength by saying, "and You alone we ask for help." Realize that your obedience was not made easy except by His assistance, and that the favor is His for having guided you to obedience, employed you in His worship, and made you worthy of intimate discourse with Him. Had He deprived you of guidance, you would have been among the repelled with the accursed Satan.

Then, when you have finished seeking refuge, and saying "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," and praising, and expressing the need for assistance in general, specify your request and ask only for your most important needs, and say, "Guide us to the straight path, which leads us to Your proximity and brings us to Your pleasure." Increase it with explanation, detail, emphasis, and testimony by those upon whom He has bestowed the grace of guidance from the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous—not those who have incurred wrath from the disbelievers, nor the astray from the Jews, Christians, and Sabians. Then seek the response and say, "Amen."

If you recite the Opening Chapter in this manner, it is likely that you are among those of whom God, exalted be He, said, as reported by the Prophet (peace be upon him): "I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves: half of it is for Me and half for My servant, and for My servant is what he asks." The servant says, "Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds," and God, exalted be He, says, "My servant has praised Me and extolled Me"—this is the meaning of His saying, "God hears those who praise Him," and so on in the hadith. So if you had no share from your prayer except God's mention of you in His majesty and greatness, that alone would be a sufficient prize; how much more then what you hope for from His reward and bounty.

Likewise, you should understand what you recite from the chapters, as will come in the Book of Reciting the Quran. Do not be heedless of His command and prohibition, His promise and threat, His admonitions, the stories of His prophets, and the mention of His favors and kindness. Each has its due: hope is the due of the promise, fear is the due of the threat, resolve is the due of the command and prohibition, taking admonition is the due of the admonition, gratitude is the due of the mention of favor, and reflection is the due of the reports of the prophets.

It is narrated that when Zurarah ibn Awfa reached the verse, "So when the Horn is blown," he fell down dead. And Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, when he heard the verse, "When the sky is split apart," would tremble until his limbs shook. And Abdullah ibn Waqid said: "I saw Ibn Umar praying, overcome." It is fitting that his heart be burned by the promise and threat of his Master, for he is a sinful, lowly servant before a Compelling, Overpowering Lord. These meanings are according to the degrees of understanding, and understanding is according to the abundance of knowledge and the purity of the heart.

The heart and its levels are beyond enumeration, and prayer is the key to hearts, wherein the secrets of words are unveiled. This is the reality of recitation, and it is also the reality of remembrances and glorifications. Then, reverence in recitation is observed: one recites with measured deliberation, not in haste, for that is more conducive to contemplation, and one distinguishes between the tones in verses of mercy and punishment, promise and threat, praise, exaltation, and magnification. Al-Nakha‘i, when passing by a verse such as the Almighty’s saying, “God has not taken any son, nor is there any god alongside Him,” would lower his voice like one ashamed to mention Him with anything unbefitting. And it is related that it is said to the reciter of the Qur’an: “Recite, ascend, and recite with measured deliberation as you used to recite with deliberation in the world.” As for maintaining the standing posture, it alerts to keeping the heart established with God, the Almighty, in a single state of presence. He, peace be upon him, said: “Indeed, God, the Almighty, is facing the worshipper as long as he does not turn away.” And just as it is obligatory to guard the head and eyes from turning toward directions, so too is it obligatory to guard the inner self from turning to other than the prayer. If it turns to other than it, remind it of God’s awareness of it and of the ugliness of being neglectful in intimate discourse when the one being addressed is heedless, so that it may return to it, and insist on the heart’s humility, for freedom from turning, inwardly and outwardly, is the fruit of humility. Whenever the inward is humble, the outward becomes humble. He, peace be upon him, said—having seen a man praying while fiddling with his beard—“If this one’s heart were humble, his limbs would be humble.” For the subjects follow the ruler’s command, and thus it is reported in the supplication: “O God, rectify the ruler and the subjects,” meaning the heart and the limbs. And Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, in his prayer was like a peg, and Ibn al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with him, was like a staff, and some would become so still in their bowing that birds would land on them as if they were inanimate objects. All of this is demanded by natural disposition before one whom the children of this world revere, so how could it not be demanded before the King of Kings for one who knows the King of Kings? Whoever is tranquil before other than God, the Almighty, in humility, yet whose limbs are restless before God in play, that is due to the deficiency of his knowledge of the majesty of God, the Almighty, and of His awareness of his secret and conscience. And ‘Ikrimah said regarding His, the Almighty’s, saying, “Who sees you when you rise and your movements among those who prostrate,” meaning his standing, bowing, prostration, and sitting. As for bowing and prostration, one should renew at them the remembrance of God’s greatness, and raise one’s hands seeking refuge in God’s pardon from His punishment, renewing intention and following the practice of His Prophet, peace be upon him. Then, one begins for Him with abasement and humility in one’s bowing, striving to soften one’s heart and renew one’s humility, and feeling that and the might of one’s Master and one’s lowliness and the exaltedness of one’s Lord, and one aids in affirming that in one’s heart with one’s tongue, so one glorifies one’s Lord and bears witness to His greatness—that He is greater than every great one—and repeats that upon one’s heart to confirm it through repetition. Then one rises from bowing hoping that He is merciful to you, affirming the hope in oneself by saying, “God hears those who praise Him,” meaning He answers those who thank Him. Then one follows that thanks, which calls for increase, by saying, “Our Lord, to You is praise,” and multiplies praise by saying, “as much as fills the heavens and the earth.” Then one descends to prostration, which is the highest degree of submission, placing the noblest of one’s limbs, which is the face, upon the lowliest of things, which is dust. And if you can avoid any barrier between them, prostrating directly on the ground, then do so, for it is more conducive to humility and more indicative of abasement. And when you place yourself in the position of abasement, know that you have placed it in its proper place and returned the branch to its root, for you were created from dust and to it you return. At this point, renew in your heart the greatness of God and say, “Glory be to my Lord, the Most High,” and confirm it with repetition, for a single instance has weak effect. If your heart softens and that becomes apparent, then affirm your hope in God’s mercy, for His mercy hastens to weakness and abasement, not to arrogance and pride. Then raise your head saying “God is greatest,” asking for your need and saying, “My Lord, forgive and have mercy,” and overlook what You know, or whatever supplication you intend, then confirm humility through repetition by returning to a second prostration likewise. As for the testimony, when you sit for it, sit with etiquette and declare that all that you offer of prayers and good things—meaning pure character—is for God, and likewise dominion is for God, which is the meaning of “greetings.” And bring to your heart the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his noble person, and say, “Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings,” and let your hope be true that it reaches him and he returns to you what is more complete than it. Then give peace upon yourself and upon all of God’s righteous servants, then reflect that God, the Exalted, returns to you a complete peace according to the number of His righteous servants. Then bear witness to His Oneness and to Muhammad, His Prophet, peace be upon him, as His messenger, renewing the covenant of God by repeating the two testimonies and recommitting to taking refuge in them. Then supplicate at the end of your prayer with the transmitted supplication, with humility, reverence, earnest entreaty, and devotion, and sincerity.

Hope for acceptance, and include your parents and all believers in your supplications. Intend, upon concluding the prayer, to offer salutations to the angels and those present, and resolve to seal the prayer with this. Feel gratitude to God, exalted is He, for granting you success in completing this act of obedience, and imagine that you are bidding farewell to this prayer of yours, and that perhaps you will not live to see another like it. For the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised the one he counseled: "Pray the prayer of one bidding farewell." Then, make your heart feel awe and shame for shortcomings in the prayer, and fear that your prayer may not be accepted, and that you may be detested due to an apparent or hidden sin, so your prayer is cast back in your face. Yet, simultaneously hope that He, by His generosity and grace, may transform it. Yahya ibn Waththab, when he prayed, would remain for as long as God willed, with the gravity of prayer evident upon him. And Ibrahim would remain after the prayer for an hour as if he were ill. This is the detailed description of the prayer of the humble, those who are humble in their prayers, those who guard their prayers, those who are constant in their prayers, and those who commune with God according to their capacity in servitude. Let a person measure himself against this prayer; for the portion he attains of it, he should rejoice, and for what he misses, he should grieve, and in striving to attain it, he should exert effort. As for the prayer of the heedless, it is perilous, unless God envelops them in His mercy—and mercy is vast and generosity overflowing. So we ask God to envelop us in His mercy and immerse us in His forgiveness, for we have no means except confessing our inability to fulfill His obedience. Know that purifying the prayer from faults, sincerely dedicating it to the Countenance of God Almighty, and performing it with the inner conditions we mentioned—humility, reverence, and shame—are causes for lights to arise in the heart. Those lights become keys to the sciences of unveiling. The saints of God, those unveiled to the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the secrets of Lordship, are unveiled specifically during prayer, especially in prostration, for the servant draws near to his Lord Almighty through prostration. Thus, the Exalted said: "And prostrate and draw near." The unveiling for each worshipper is according to the clarity of his heart from the impurities of the world, and it varies in strength and weakness, scarcity and abundance, clarity and obscurity, until for some the thing is unveiled in its very essence, and for others it is unveiled through its likeness—just as the world was unveiled to some in the form of a carcass, and Satan in the form of a dog crouching upon it, calling to it. It also varies according to what is unveiled: for some, aspects of God's attributes and majesty are unveiled; for others, His actions; and for others, subtleties of the sciences of spiritual conduct. The specification of these meanings at every moment has hidden, innumerable causes, the most fitting of which is spiritual aspiration. For when aspiration is directed to a specific matter, that matter is most deserving of being unveiled. Since these matters only appear in polished mirrors, and all mirrors are rusty, guidance is veiled from them—not due to stinginess from the Bestower of guidance, but due to the foul, accumulated rust upon the place where guidance is received. Tongues hasten to deny such things, for human nature is disposed to deny what is not present. If a fetus had intellect, it would deny the possibility of a human existing in the expanse of air. If a child had discernment, he might deny what the wise claim to perceive of the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Thus, a person in every stage almost denies what lies beyond it. Whoever denies the stage of sainthood must consequently deny the stage of prophethood. He created creation in stages, so it is not fitting for anyone to deny what is beyond his own degree. Indeed, when they sought this through disputation and confusing investigation, and did not seek it through purifying the hearts from all besides God Almighty, they lost it and thus denied it. Whoever is not among the people of unveiling should at the very least believe in the unseen and affirm it until he witnesses it through experience. In the report: "When a servant stands in prayer, God Almighty lifts the veil between Him and His servant, and faces him with His Countenance, and the angels stand from his shoulders to the air due to his prayer, and they affirm his supplication. Indeed, upon the worshipper is showered blessings from the canopy of the sky to the parting of his hair, and a caller calls out: 'If only this one in communion knew, he would not turn away.' And the gates of heaven are opened for those who pray, and God Almighty boasts to His angels of His servant who is praying." Thus, the opening of the gates of heaven and God Almighty facing him with His Countenance is a metaphor for the unveiling we mentioned. In the Torah it is written: "O son of Adam, do not be too incapable to stand before Me praying and weeping, for I am God who has drawn near to your heart, and in the unseen, you have seen My light." It is said: "We used to understand that tenderness, weeping, and the opening experienced by the worshipper in his heart is from the nearness of the Lord, exalted is He, to the heart." If this nearness is not nearness in place, then it has no meaning except nearness through guidance, mercy, and the lifting of the veil. It is said that when a servant prays...

Two rak'ahs at which ten rows of angels marveled, each row comprising ten thousand, and with them Allah boasted to one hundred thousand angels. This is because the servant has combined in prayer standing, sitting, bowing, and prostrating, while Allah has distributed these acts among forty thousand angels: those standing do not bow until the Day of Resurrection, those prostrating do not rise until the Day of Resurrection, and likewise for those bowing and sitting. For what the Exalted has granted the angels in terms of nearness and rank is fixed and perpetual, in a single state that neither increases nor decreases. Therefore, Allah informed about them that they said: "And there is none among us except that he has a known station." Humanity differs from the angels in ascending from one degree to another, for one continually draws nearer to Allah the Exalted, thereby gaining increased nearness, while the door of increase is closed to the angels, peace be upon them. Each one has only the rank appointed to him and the worship with which he is occupied; he does not transfer to another nor cease from it. They do not grow arrogant against worshipping Him, nor do they weary; they glorify Him night and day without ceasing. The key to increased degrees is the prayers. Allah Almighty said: "Indeed, successful are the believers who are humble in their prayer." He praised them after faith with a specific prayer—that coupled with humility. Then He concluded the attributes of the successful with prayer as well, saying: "And those who guard their prayers." Then He said regarding the fruit of those attributes: "Those are the inheritors who shall inherit Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally." He described them with success first and with inheriting Paradise last. In my view, the babbling of the tongue with a heedless heart does not reach this limit. Therefore, Allah Almighty said concerning their opposites: "What has caused you to enter Hell?" They will say, "We were not of those who prayed." Thus, those who pray are the inheritors of Paradise, they are the ones who witness the light of Allah the Exalted and enjoy His nearness and closeness to their hearts. We ask Allah to make us among them and to protect us from the punishment of those whose words are adorned but whose deeds are foul. Indeed, He is the Generous Bestower, the Eternal in beneficence. And may Allah bless every chosen servant.

(Stories and reports concerning the prayer of the humble, may Allah be pleased with them)

Know that humility is the fruit of faith and the result of certainty attained through the majesty of Allah Almighty. Whoever is granted that will be humble in prayer and outside of prayer, even in his solitude and in the treasury when in need, for the cause of humility is knowledge of Allah's awareness of the servant, knowledge of His majesty, and knowledge of the servant's shortcomings. From these knowledges, humility is born, and it is not specific to prayer. Therefore, it is narrated from some that he did not raise his head to the sky for forty years out of shyness from Allah and humility before Him. And due to the intensity of lowering his gaze and bowing his head, some people thought Rabi' ibn Khuthaym was blind. He frequented the house of Ibn Mas'ud for twenty years, and when his maidservant saw him, she would say to Ibn Mas'ud, "Your blind friend has come," and Ibn Mas'ud would laugh at her words. When the door was knocked, the maidservant would go out to him and find him with bowed head and lowered gaze. Ibn Mas'ud, when looking at him, would say, "And give glad tidings to the humble." By Allah, if Muhammad (peace be upon him) had seen you, he would have rejoiced in you—in another wording, he would have loved you; in another wording, he would have smiled. One day, he walked with Ibn Mas'ud past the blacksmiths, and when he saw the bellows blowing and the fire blazing, he fainted and fell unconscious. Ibn Mas'ud sat by his head until prayer time, but he did not regain consciousness, so he carried him on his back to his house. He remained unconscious until the same hour he had fainted, missing five prayers, with Ibn Mas'ud at his head saying, "This, by Allah, is true fear." Rabi' used to say, "I never entered a prayer without being preoccupied in it except by what I say and what is said to me." 'Amir ibn 'Abdullah was among the humble in prayer; when he prayed, sometimes his daughter would beat the tambourine and the women would converse about whatever they wished in the house, and he would not hear nor perceive it. One day he was asked, "Does your soul whisper to you during prayer about anything?" He said, "Yes, about my standing before Allah Almighty and my fate in one of the two abodes." It was said, "Do you experience any of the worldly matters that we experience?" He replied, "That spears should clash is more beloved to me than to find in my prayer what you find." And he used to say, "If the veil were lifted, I would not increase in certainty." Muslim ibn Yasar was among them, and it is reported that he did not notice a column collapsing in the mosque while he was in prayer. And the extremity of one of them became gangrenous and required amputation, but it was not possible. It was said that he, being in prayer, is unaware of what happens to him, so it was amputated while he was in prayer. Some said, "Prayer is from the Hereafter, so when you enter it, you leave the world." Another was asked, "Do you converse..."

Did you preoccupy yourself with something worldly during prayer? He replied: Neither in prayer nor outside it. Someone was asked: Do you remember anything during prayer? He said: Is there anything more beloved to me than prayer that I would remember during it? Abu al-Darda, may God be pleased with him, used to say: Among a man's understanding is that he attends to his need before entering prayer, so that he may enter prayer with a heart free. Some of them would shorten the prayer out of fear of insinuating thoughts. It is narrated that 'Ammar ibn Yasir prayed a prayer and made it light, so it was said to him: You made it light, O Abu al-Yaqzan? He said: Did you see me diminish any of its prescribed limits? They said: No. He said: I hastened to preempt the forgetfulness of Satan, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, a servant may pray a prayer, and not half of it is recorded for him, nor a third, nor a quarter, nor a fifth, nor a sixth, nor a tenth." And he used to say: "Only that portion of a servant's prayer is recorded for him of which he is mindful." It is said that Talha and al-Zubayr and a group of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, were the lightest of people in prayer and said: We hasten with it to preempt the insinuations of Satan. It is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said from the pulpit: A man may grow gray in Islam, yet never complete a single prayer perfectly for God, Exalted is He. It was asked: How is that? He said: He does not perfect its reverence, humility, and turning his heart to God, Mighty and Majestic, within it. Abu al-'Aliyah was asked about the saying of God, Exalted is He: "Those who are heedless of their prayer." He said: It is the one who is heedless in his prayer, so he does not know on what count he finishes—on an even or an odd number. Al-Hasan said: It is the one who is heedless of the prayer's time until it passes. Some said: It is the one who, if he prays at the beginning of its time, does not rejoice, and if he delays it beyond its time, does not grieve, so he does not see hastening it as a good nor delaying it as a sin. Know that a prayer may have some of it counted and some of it recorded, and some not, as the reports indicate, even though the jurist says that the prayer, in terms of validity, is not divisible, but that has another meaning we have mentioned, and this meaning is indicated by the hadiths, as it is established that deficiencies in the obligatory prayers are compensated for by the supererogatory ones. In the report, Jesus, peace be upon him, said: God, Exalted is He, says regarding the obligatory acts: My servant is saved from Me, and regarding the supererogatory acts: My servant draws near to Me. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "God, Exalted is He, said: My servant is not saved from Me except by fulfilling what I have made obligatory upon him." It is narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed a prayer and omitted a verse from its recitation. When he finished, he said: What did I recite? The people fell silent. He asked Ubayy ibn Ka'b, may God be pleased with him, who said: You recited such-and-such a chapter and omitted such-and-such a verse. We do not know whether it was abrogated or raised? He said: You are for it, O Ubayy. Then he turned to the others and said: What is the matter with people who attend their prayer and complete their rows while their Prophet is before them, yet they do not know what he recites to them from the Book of their Lord? Indeed, the Children of Israel did such, so God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to their prophet: Say to your people: You present your bodies to Me and give Me your tongues, yet your hearts are absent from Me. Vain is what you pursue. This indicates that listening to what the Imam recites and understanding it is equivalent to reciting the chapters oneself. Some said: A man may prostrate a prostration, thinking he has drawn near to God, Mighty and Majestic, by it, yet if his sins during that prostration were distributed among the people of his city, they would perish. It was said: How can that be? He said: He is prostrating before God while his heart is inclined to a desire and beholding falsehood that has overcome him. These are the attributes of the reverent. These accounts and reports, along with what preceded, indicate that the foundation of prayer is reverence and presence of heart, and that mere physical movements with heedlessness are of little benefit in the Hereafter, and God knows best. We ask God for good success.

(The Fourth Chapter: On Leadership and Example, and on the Pillars of Prayer and After the Salutation, and on the Duties of the Imam Before Prayer and Regarding Recitation)
As for the duties that are before the prayer, they are six: The first is that he should not lead people in prayer who dislike him. If they differ, consideration is given to the majority. If the minority are the people of goodness and religion, then consideration for them is preferable. In the hadith: "Three whose prayer does not rise above their heads: a runaway slave, a woman whose husband is angry with her, and an Imam who leads a people while they dislike him." And just as he is forbidden from leading if they dislike him, so too is he forbidden from taking precedence if behind him is one more knowledgeable in jurisprudence than him, unless the one more entitled refuses, then he may lead. If none of that is the case, then let him lead whenever he is put forward and knows in himself the ability to fulfill the conditions of leadership. At that point, disputing over it is disliked, for it is said that a people disputed over the leadership after the prayer was established, and the earth swallowed them. What is narrated of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, disputing over leadership was due to their preferring whom they saw as more entitled to it, or their fear for themselves of forgetfulness and the risk of being accountable for their prayer, for the Imams are guarantors, and it is as if one not accustomed to that might...

His heart becomes preoccupied and his sincerity in prayer is disturbed due to shyness before those following him, especially during his audible recitation. Thus, some who are cautious avoid causes of this kind. Second, when a person is given the choice between the call to prayer and leading the prayer, he should choose leading the prayer, for each has its merit, but combining them is disliked; rather, the prayer leader should be other than the caller to prayer. If combining them is unavoidable, then leading the prayer is preferable. Some have said the call to prayer is preferable due to the transmitted merits of the call to prayer and due to his saying, peace be upon him: "The prayer leader is a guarantor, and the caller to prayer is entrusted." They said: In this lies the risk of the guarantee. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The prayer leader is trustworthy, so when he bows, bow, and when he prostrates, prostrate." And in the hadith: "If he perfects it, it is for him and for them, and if he is deficient, it is upon him, not upon them." And because he, peace be upon him, said: "O God, guide the prayer leaders and forgive the callers to prayer." Forgiveness is more worthy of being sought, for guidance is desired for the sake of forgiveness. And in the report: "Whoever leads prayer in a mosque for seven years, Paradise is guaranteed for him without reckoning, and whoever gives the call to prayer for forty years enters Paradise without reckoning." Therefore, it is transmitted from the Companions, may God be pleased with them, that they used to defer from leading the prayer. The correct view is that leading the prayer is superior, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr, and Umar, may God be pleased with them, and the Imams after them consistently performed it. Yes, it contains the risk of the guarantee, but merit accompanies risk, just as the rank of just authority is superior due to his saying, peace be upon him: "A single day of a just ruler is better than worship of seventy years," yet it contains risk. Therefore, the most excellent and most knowledgeable must be given precedence, for he, peace be upon him, said: "Your prayer leaders are your intercessors, or he said: your delegates to God. So if you wish for your prayers to be purified, put forward the best among you." Some of the predecessors said: There is none after the prophets more excellent than the scholars, and none after the scholars more excellent than the prayer-leading Imams, for these stand before God, Mighty and Majestic, and His creation: this one with prophethood, this one with knowledge, and this one with the pillar of religion, which is prayer. With this argument, the Companions argued for giving precedence to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him and with them, for the caliphate when they said: We considered, and indeed prayer is the pillar of religion, so we chose for our worldly affairs one whom the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, approved for our religion. They did not advance Bilal, arguing that he approved him for the call to prayer. And it is narrated that a man said to him: "O Messenger of God, direct me to a deed by which I may enter Paradise." He said: "Be a caller to prayer." He said: "I am not able." He said: "Be a prayer leader." He said: "I am not able." He said: "Pray facing the prayer leader." Perhaps he thought he would not be satisfied with his leading, since the call to prayer is directed to him, and leading the prayer is directed to the congregation and their advancing him. Then after that, he imagined he might be capable of it. Third, the prayer leader should observe the prayer times and pray at their beginnings to attain the pleasure of God, the Exalted, for the merit of the beginning of the time over its end is like the merit of the Hereafter over this world. Thus it is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. And in the hadith: "Indeed, a servant may pray a prayer at the end of its time, and it is not missed, yet what he missed from its beginning is better for him than the world and all it contains." One should not delay the prayer waiting for a larger congregation; rather, they should hasten to attain the merit of the beginning of the time, for it is better than a large congregation and longer recitation. It has been said: They used to, if two were present for congregational prayer, not wait for a third, and if four were present for a funeral prayer, not wait for a fifth. And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was delayed for the dawn prayer while they were on a journey, and he was delayed only for purification, so he did not wait, and Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf was put forward and led them until the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, missed a rak'ah, so he stood to make it up. He said: So we were concerned about that, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "You have done well; do thus." And he was delayed for the noon prayer, so they put forward Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, until the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, came while he was in prayer and stood at his side. It is not incumbent upon the prayer leader to wait for the caller to prayer; rather, it is incumbent upon the caller to prayer to wait for the prayer leader for the iqamah. If he is present, he should not wait for another. Fourth, he should lead prayer sincerely for God, Mighty and Majestic, and fulfilling the trust of God, the Exalted, in his purity and all the conditions of his prayer. As for sincerity, it is by not taking a wage for it, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded Uthman ibn Abi al-As al-Thaqafi and said: "Appoint a caller to prayer who does not take a wage for the call to prayer." The call to prayer is a path to prayer, so prayer is more deserving of not taking a wage for it. If he takes sustenance from a mosque that is endowed for one who performs its leadership, or from the ruler, or from individuals, it is not ruled forbidden, but it is disliked, and the dislike in obligatory prayers is stronger than in the Tarawih prayers. It would be a wage for his persistence in attending the place and overseeing the mosque's interests in establishing the congregation, not for the prayer itself. As for the trust, it is purity inwardly from immorality and major sins.

Persisting in minor sins: one who is being considered for leadership should strive to avoid that with all effort, for he is like a delegation and an intercessor for the people; thus, he ought to be the best among them. Likewise, purity outwardly from ritual impurity and filth, for none but he is aware of it. If he remembers during his prayer that he is in a state of impurity or that wind has passed from him, he should not feel ashamed; rather, he should take the hand of someone near him and appoint him as a substitute. Indeed, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) remembered being in a state of major impurity during the prayer, so he appointed a substitute, performed the ritual bath, then returned and entered into the prayer. Sufyan said: Pray behind every righteous and wicked person, except a habitual drunkard, one who openly commits immorality, one who is disobedient to his parents, an innovator, or a runaway slave. Fifth: He should not begin the opening takbir until the rows are straight, so he should turn to the right and left; if he sees a gap, he should command them to straighten. It is said they used to align their shoulders and press their ankles together. And he should not begin the takbir until the mu'adhdhin has finished the iqamah, and the mu'adhdhin delays the iqamah from the adhan by the amount of time needed for people to prepare for prayer, as in the report: "Let the mu'adhdhin take his time between the adhan and the iqamah by the amount of time it takes for an eater to finish his food and one relieving himself to finish his relief." This is because he (peace be upon him) forbade resisting the two urges and commanded having the evening meal before the evening prayer, seeking emptiness of heart. Sixth: He should raise his voice with the opening takbir and the other takbirs, but the follower should not raise his voice except to the extent he hears himself. And he should intend the imamate to attain its merit; if he does not intend it, his prayer and the prayer of the people are valid if they intended to follow and attained the merit of following, but he does not attain the merit of leading. And the follower should delay his takbir after the imam's takbir, beginning after he finishes. And God knows best.

As for the duties of recitation, they are three: First, he should silently recite the opening supplication and seeking refuge, like one praying alone, and recite aloud the Opening Chapter and the surah after it in all of the dawn prayer and the first two rak'ahs of the night and sunset prayers, as does one praying alone. And he should say "Amen" aloud in the audible prayers, as should the follower, and the follower should coincide his "Amen" with the imam's simultaneously, not consecutively. And he should recite "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" aloud, though the reports on this are conflicting, and the preference of al-Shafi'i (may God be pleased with him) is to recite it aloud. Second: The imam should have three pauses in the standing position, as narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub and 'Imran ibn al-Husayn from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). The first of them is when he says the opening takbir, and it is the longest of them, the amount of time for those behind him to recite the Opening Chapter, and that is the time for his recitation of the opening supplication; for if he does not pause, they miss listening, and he is accountable for what is deficient in their prayer. If they do not recite the Opening Chapter during his pause and are occupied with something else, that is upon him, not them. The second pause is when he finishes the Opening Chapter, so that whoever is reciting the Opening Chapter in the first pause may complete it, and it is about half the length of the first pause. The third pause is when he finishes the surah before bowing, and it is the lightest of them, the amount to separate the recitation from the takbir, for he forbade joining them. And the follower should not recite behind the imam except the Opening Chapter; if the imam does not pause, he recites the Opening Chapter with him, and the one falling short is the imam. If the follower does not hear in the audible prayer due to distance or is in the silent prayer, there is no harm in reciting a surah. The third duty: He should recite in the dawn prayer two surahs from the oft-repeated, less than a hundred verses, for prolonging the recitation in the dawn prayer and performing it in darkness is a Sunnah, and leaving it with the appearance of light does not harm him. There is no harm in reciting in the second rak'ah the ends of surahs, around thirty or twenty verses until he completes them, because that is not repeated to the ears often, thus being more effective in admonition and more inviting to reflection. Some scholars disliked reciting parts from the beginnings of surahs and cutting them off. It is narrated that he (peace be upon him) recited part of Surah Yunus, and when he reached the mention of Moses and Pharaoh, he cut it off and bowed. And it is narrated that he recited in the dawn prayer a verse from al-Baqarah, which is His saying: "Say, 'We have believed in God and what has been revealed to us,'" and in the second: "Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed," and he heard Bilal reciting from here and there, so he asked him about that, and he said: "I mix good with good," and he said: "You have done well." And he should recite in the noon prayer the long surahs of the Mufassal up to thirty verses, and in the afternoon half of that, and in the sunset prayer the last surahs of the Mufassal. The last prayer the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) prayed was the sunset prayer, in which he recited Surah al-Mursalat; he did not pray after it until he passed away. In summary, lightness is preferable, especially when the congregation is large. He (peace be upon him) said regarding this concession: "When one of you leads the people in prayer, let him make it light, for among them are the weak, the elderly, and one with a need; and when he prays by himself, let him prolong as he wishes." Mu'adh ibn Jabal used to lead people in the night prayer and recited al-Baqarah, so a man left the prayer and completed it by himself, and they said: "He has shown hypocrisy."

The man and his companion disputed and brought their case to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, rebuked Mu'adh and said, "Are you a tempter, O Mu'adh? Recite the surahs 'Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,' 'By the heaven and the night-visitant,' and 'By the sun and its brightness.'" As for the duties pertaining to the pillars [of prayer], they are three. The first is to lighten the bowing and prostration, not exceeding the glorifications beyond three. It has been narrated from Anas that he said, "I have never seen a prayer lighter than that of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in its completeness." Yes, it has also been narrated that Anas ibn Malik, when he prayed behind 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, who was the governor of Medina, said, "I have not prayed behind anyone whose prayer more closely resembled the prayer of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, than this young man." He said, "And we would glorify behind him ten, ten times." And it has been narrated in a general form that they said, "We would glorify behind the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in the bowing and prostration ten, ten times." That is good, but the three [glorifications] are better when the congregation is large. If none are present except those devoted solely to religion, then there is no harm in ten. This is the way to reconcile the narrations. And the Imam should say, when raising his head from the bowing, "God hears those who praise Him."

The second, concerning the follower, is that he should not match the Imam in bowing and prostrating, but rather delay, not descending for prostration until the Imam's forehead reaches the ground. This was how the Companions followed the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. And he should not descend for bowing until the Imam is fully settled in the bowing position. It has been said that people leave the prayer in three categories: a group with twenty-five prayers—these are those who say the *takbir* and bow after the Imam; a group with one prayer—these are those who match him; and a group with no prayer—these are those who precede the Imam. There has been disagreement concerning whether the Imam, while in the bowing position, should wait for those entering to catch up, so they may attain the virtue of the congregation and catch that unit of prayer. Perhaps the preferable view is that, with sincerity, there is no harm in this if no apparent disparity is shown to those present, for their right is observed in not prolonging [the prayer] upon them.

The third is not to exceed in the supplication of the *tashahhud* beyond the measure of the *tashahhud* itself, for fear of prolongation, and not to specify oneself in supplication, but rather to come with the plural form, saying, "O God, forgive us," and not saying, "Forgive me." It has been disliked for the Imam to specify himself. There is no harm in seeking refuge in the *tashahhud* with the five phrases transmitted from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: "We seek refuge in You from the punishment of Hellfire and the punishment of the grave, and we seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death, and from the trial of the False Messiah. And if You intend a trial for a people, then take us to You not having been trialed." It has been said he is called *Masih* (the anointed one) because he will traverse the earth in its length, and it has been said because his eye is anointed, meaning obliterated.

As for the duties pertaining to the conclusion [of prayer], they are three. The first is to intend with the two salutations the greeting upon the congregation and the angels. The second is to remain still immediately after the salutation; thus did the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and Abu Bakr and 'Umar, may God be pleased with them. Then he prays the supererogatory prayer in another place. If there are women behind him, he does not rise until they have departed. In the famous report, he, peace and blessings be upon him, would not sit except for the duration of his saying, "O God, You are Peace, and from You is peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor." The third, when he rises, he should turn his face towards the people. It is disliked for the follower to stand before the Imam has moved. It has been narrated from Talhah and al-Zubayr, may God be pleased with them, that they prayed behind an Imam, and when they gave the salutation, they said to the Imam, "How excellent and complete your prayer was, except for one thing: when you gave the salutation, you did not turn your face." Then they said to the people, "How excellent your prayer was, except that you departed before your Imam turned." Then the Imam departs where he wills, to his right or left, and the right is more beloved.

These are the duties of the prayers. As for the Dawn prayer, the *qunut* is added to it. He says, "O God, guide us," and does not say, "O God, guide me." The follower says *amin*. When he reaches the phrase, "For You decree and are not decreed upon," it is not fitting for him to say *amin*, for it is praise, so he recites with him, saying the same as he says, or says, "Yes, and I am among the witnesses to that," or "You have spoken truthfully and righteously," and the like. A hadith has been narrated concerning raising the hands in the *qunut*. If the hadith is authentic, that is recommended, even though it differs from the supplications at the end of the *tashahhud*, for the hands are not raised due to them. Rather, reliance is upon the established practice. There is also a distinction between them: the hands have a function in the *tashahhud*, which is placing them on the thighs in a specific manner, and they have no function here, so it is not far-fetched that raising the hands is the function in the *qunut*, for it is fitting for supplication. And God knows best. These are the comprehensive etiquettes of following and leading prayer. And God is the Granter of success.

(The Fifth Chapter: The Excellence of Friday, Its Etiquettes, Traditions, and Conditions)
(The Virtue of Friday)
Know that this is a great day, through which God has magnified Islam and specifically favored the Muslims. God Almighty has said...

When the call to prayer is proclaimed on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of God and leave off trading. Thus, engaging in worldly affairs and anything that diverts from hastening to the Friday prayer is forbidden. He (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, has made the Friday prayer obligatory for you on this day of mine, in this place of mine." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever leaves the Friday prayer three times without an excuse, God seals his heart." In another wording: "He has indeed cast Islam behind his back." A man kept going to Ibn Abbas, asking him about a man who died without having attended the Friday prayer or congregational prayers, and he said: "In the Fire." He kept returning to him for a month, asking him about that, and he would say: "In the Fire." In the report: The people of the two Scriptures were given Friday, but they differed concerning it, so they were turned away from it, and God, Exalted is He, guided us to it and deferred it for this community, making it a festival for them. Thus, they are the foremost people to it, and the people of the two Scriptures follow them. In the narration of Anas from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "Gabriel (peace be upon him) came to me with a white mirror in his hand and said: 'This is Friday. Your Lord has made it obligatory upon you to be a festival for you and for your community after you.' I said: 'What is for us in it?' He said: 'For you in it is a good hour. Whoever supplicates for a good thing in it, God, Glorified is He, will grant it to him, or if it is not his portion, it is stored for him something greater than it. Or whoever seeks refuge from an evil decreed for him, God, Mighty and Majestic, will grant him refuge from what is greater than it. It is the master of days with us, and we call it in the Hereafter the Day of Increase.' I said: 'Why?' He said: 'Indeed, your Lord, Mighty and Majestic, has taken in Paradise a spacious valley of white musk. When Friday comes, He, Exalted is He, descends from the Highest Heaven to His Throne and manifests Himself to them until they gaze upon His Noble Countenance.'" And he (peace be upon him) said: "The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday. On it, Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on it, he was admitted to Paradise; on it, he was sent down to the earth; on it, his repentance was accepted; on it, he died; and on it, the Hour will be established. It is, with God, the Day of Increase. Thus, the angels in the heaven name it, and it is the day of gazing upon God, Exalted is He, in Paradise." In the report: "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, has in every Friday six hundred thousand emancipated from the Fire." In the narration of Anas (may God be pleased with him) that he (peace be upon him) said: "If Friday is safe, the days are safe." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, Hellfire is stoked every day before noon when the sun is at the zenith of the sky, so do not pray during this hour except on Friday, for it is all prayer, and indeed Hellfire is not stoked on it." Ka'b said: "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, has favored among the lands Mecca, among the months Ramadan, among the days Friday, and among the nights the Night of Decree." It is said: "The birds and the creeping creatures meet one another on Friday and say: 'Peace, peace, a righteous day.'" And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever dies on Friday or the night of Friday, God writes for him the reward of a martyr and protects him from the trial of the grave."

(Explanation of the Conditions for Friday Prayer)
Know that it shares all the conditions with the other prayers and is distinguished from them by six conditions. The first is the time. If the Imam's final salutation occurs at the time of the 'Asr prayer, the Friday prayer is missed, and he must complete it as a four-rak'ah Dhuhr prayer. There is disagreement concerning one who joins late if his final rak'ah occurs outside the time. The second is the place. It is not valid in deserts, open country, or among tents. Rather, there must be a settled area with permanent buildings, gathering forty of those for whom the Friday prayer is obligatory. A village therein is like a town. The presence or permission of the ruler is not stipulated, but it is preferable to seek his permission. The third is the number. It is not valid with fewer than forty adult, obligated, free, resident males who do not depart from it in winter or summer. If they disperse until the number decreases, whether during the sermon or the prayer, the Friday prayer is not valid. Rather, they must be present from the beginning to the end. The fourth is the congregation. If forty prayed in a village or town separately, their Friday prayer is not valid. However, one who joins late, if he catches the second rak'ah, he may pray the second rak'ah alone. If he does not catch the bowing of the second rak'ah, he follows the Imam and intends Dhuhr. When the Imam gives the salutation, he completes it as Dhuhr. The fifth is that there not be another Friday prayer preceding it in that town. If it is impossible for them to gather in one mosque, it is permissible in two, three, or four mosques according to need. If there is no need, the correct position is that the Friday prayer which first establishes the prohibition (of other prayers) is valid. When the need is established, it is best to pray behind the better of the two Imams. If they are equal, then the older mosque. If they are equal, then the nearer one. The greater number of people also has merit to be considered. The sixth is the two sermons. They are obligatory, standing during them is obligatory, and sitting between them is obligatory. In the first sermon, there are four obligations: praise, and its minimum is 'Alhamdulillah'; the second is sending prayers upon the Prophet (peace be upon him); the third is exhortation to fear God, Glorified and Exalted.

The fourth is reciting a verse from the Qur’an, and likewise the obligatory acts are four, except that in it supplication replaces recitation, and listening to the two sermons is obligatory among the forty. As for the recommended acts: when the sun passes the meridian and the caller to prayer gives the call, and the imam sits on the pulpit, prayer is discontinued except for the greeting, and speech does not cease except with the opening of the sermon. The preacher greets the people when he turns his face toward them, and they return the greeting to him. When the caller finishes, he stands facing the people with his face, not turning right or left, and occupies his hands with the hilt of the sword or the spear and the pulpit so that he does not fidget with them or place one on the other. He delivers two sermons, between them a brief sitting, and he does not use obscure language, nor draw out his speech, nor chant. The sermon should be short, eloquent, and comprehensive. It is recommended to recite a verse in the second sermon as well. One who enters while the preacher is delivering the sermon does not offer the greeting; if he does offer it, he does not deserve a reply, though gesturing a reply is good. He also does not say "Yarhamuk Allah" to one who sneezes. These are the conditions for validity. As for the conditions for obligation, Friday prayer is only obligatory upon a male, adult, sane, Muslim, free, resident in a village that comprises forty men possessing these qualities, or in a village from the outskirts of the city whose call reaches it from the side of its gate, with the voices calm and the caller having a loud voice, due to His saying, exalted is He: "When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business." An excuse is granted to these for missing Friday prayer due to the excuse of rain, mud, fear, illness, or nursing, if there is no other caretaker for the sick person. Then it is recommended for them—meaning those with excuses—to delay the noon prayer until the people finish from Friday prayer. If a sick person, traveler, slave, or woman attends Friday prayer, their Friday prayer is valid and suffices for the noon prayer. And Allah knows best.

(Explanation of the Etiquettes of Friday According to the Order of Custom, Which Are Ten Points)

First: That he prepares for it on Thursday, resolving upon it and anticipating its virtue, so he occupies himself with supplication, seeking forgiveness, and glorification after the afternoon prayer on Thursday because it is an hour that corresponds to the ambiguous hour on Friday. Some of the predecessors said: Verily, Allah, mighty and majestic, has a grace besides the provisions of the servants; none is given from that grace except one who asks for it on the evening of Thursday and on Friday. On this day, he washes his clothes and whitens them, and prepares perfume if he does not have any, and empties his heart from preoccupations that prevent him from going early to Friday prayer. In this night, he intends to fast on Friday, for it has virtue, and let it be coupled with Thursday or Saturday, not singled out, for that is disliked. He occupies himself with reviving this night through prayer and completing the Qur’an, for it has much virtue, and the virtue of Friday extends over it. He has intercourse with his wife in this night or on Friday, for a group have recommended that based on his saying, peace be upon him: "May Allah have mercy on one who goes early and begins early, and washes and performs the major ablution"—and that is urging the family to perform the major ablution. It is said its meaning is washing his clothes, so it is narrated with lightening, and he performed the major ablution for his body. With this, the etiquettes of anticipation are completed, and he exits from the ranks of the heedless who, when morning comes, say: "What day is this?" Some of the predecessors said: The person with the fullest share of Friday is the one who awaited it and guarded it from yesterday, and the lightest in share is the one who, when morning comes, says: "What day is today!" Some of them would spend the night of Friday in the mosque for its sake. Second: When morning comes, he begins with the major ablution after the dawn breaks, and if he does not go early, the closest to midday is more beloved, to be closer in time to cleanliness. The major ablution is recommended with strong recommendation, and some scholars held it to be obligatory. He, peace be upon him, said: "The major ablution on Friday is obligatory upon every pubescent male." The well-known from the narration of Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both: "Whoever comes to Friday prayer, let him perform the major ablution." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever attends Friday from men and women, let him perform the major ablution." The people of Medina, when two would insult each other, one of them would say to the other: "You are worse than one who does not perform the major ablution on Friday." And 'Umar said to 'Uthman, may Allah be pleased with them both, when he entered while he was delivering the sermon, at this hour, reproaching him for missing going early, so he said: "I did not do more after hearing the call than performing ablution and going out." He said: "Even ablution? And you knew that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to command us to perform the major ablution." The permissibility of omitting the major ablution with 'Uthman's ablution, may Allah be pleased with him, is known, and by what is narrated that he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever performs ablution on Friday, it is good and fine, and whoever performs the major ablution, then the major ablution is better." Whoever performs the major ablution for impurity, let him pour water over his body another time with the intention of Friday major ablution. If he suffices with one major ablution, it suffices him and he attains the virtue if he intends both, and the Friday major ablution is included in the major ablution for impurity. And one of the Companions entered upon his son who had performed the major ablution, so he said to him:

Regarding Friday? He said: Rather, concerning major impurity. So he said: Repeat the washing a second time. The Hadith concerning the Friday washing for every pubescent male was narrated, and he only commanded him to do it because he had not formed the intention for it. It is not far-fetched to say the intended purpose is cleanliness, which is achieved without the intention. However, this point also arises concerning ablution, and it has been established in the Sacred Law as an act of devotion, so seeking its virtue is necessary. Whoever performs the major ablution and then nullifies it performs the minor ablution, and his major ablution is not invalidated, though it is more beloved to guard against that. The third is adornment, which is recommended on this day, and it is of three kinds: clothing, cleanliness, and perfuming the scent. As for cleanliness, it is with the tooth-stick, shaving the hair, trimming the nails, clipping the mustache, and all that preceded in the Book of Purification. Ibn Mas'ud said: Whoever trims his nails on Friday, God Almighty extracts from him a malady and inserts in him a cure. If one has entered the bathhouse on Thursday or Wednesday, the purpose is achieved, so let him perfume himself on this day with the finest perfume he possesses, to overcome thereby the foul odors and to convey thereby the spirit and scent to the nostrils of those present near him. The most beloved perfume for men is that whose scent is apparent and its color hidden, and the perfume for women is that whose color is apparent and its scent hidden. This is narrated in the tradition. Al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, said: Whoever cleans his garment, his anxiety lessens, and whoever improves his scent, his intellect increases. As for clothing, the most beloved is white garments, for the most beloved garments to God Almighty are white. One should not wear what contains ostentation, and wearing black is not from the Sunnah nor is there virtue in it; rather, a group disliked looking at it because it is an innovated novelty after the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. The turban is recommended on this day. Wathila ibn al-Asqa' narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, God and His angels send blessings upon the wearers of turbans on Friday." If the heat distresses him, there is no harm in removing it before the prayer and after it, but he should not remove it during the time of walking from the home to the Friday prayer, nor during the time of the prayer, nor when the Imam ascends the pulpit and during his sermon. The fourth is going early to the mosque, and it is recommended to intend the mosque from two or three parasangs, and to go early. The time for going early begins at the dawn, and the virtue of going early is immense. One should be in his walking to Friday in a state of humility, submissiveness, intending to abide in the mosque until the time of prayer, aiming to hasten to respond to the call of God Almighty to him for Friday, and racing to His forgiveness and good pleasure. He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever goes to Friday in the first hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel; whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow; whoever goes in the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram; whoever goes in the fourth hour, it is as if he offered a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour, it is as if he offered an egg. When the Imam emerges, the scrolls are rolled up, the pens are lifted, and the angels gather at the pulpit listening to the remembrance. Whoever comes after that, he comes only for the prayer's due; he has no share of the virtue." The first hour is sunrise, the second until its ascent, the third until its spreading when feet are scorched, and the fourth and fifth after the forenoon until noon. Its virtue is little, and the time of noon is the prayer's due with no virtue in it. He, peace be upon him, said: "Three things, if people knew what is in them, they would race like camels in seeking them: the call to prayer, the first row, and going early to Friday." Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God be pleased with him, said: The best of them is going early to Friday. In the report: "When it is Friday, the angels sit at the doors of the mosques with scrolls of silver and pens of gold, writing the first then the first according to their ranks." It came in the report: "Verily, the angels inquire about the man when he is delayed from his time on Friday, asking one another about him: 'What has so-and-so done? What has delayed him from his time?' They say: 'O God, if poverty delayed him, enrich him; if illness delayed him, heal him; if business delayed him, free him for Your worship; if amusement delayed him, turn his heart to Your obedience.'" It was seen in the first century, before dawn, the pathways filled with people walking with lanterns and crowding with them to the mosque like the days of Eid, until that faded. It was said: The first innovation to occur in Islam was abandoning going early to the mosque. How can Muslims not feel ashamed before the Jews and Christians, for they go early to their synagogues and churches on Saturday and Sunday! And the seekers of this world, how they go early to the marketplaces for buying, selling, and profit! So why do the seekers of the Hereafter not race them? It is said: People will be in their nearness, upon looking at the Face of God, the Exalted, according to their earliness to Friday. Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, entered the mosque early and saw three men who had preceded him in earliness, so he was grieved by that and began saying to himself...

The fourth of four is not far from the earlycomers. The fifth, concerning the manner of entry, is that one should not step over people's necks nor pass before their hands, and for the earlycomer this is made easy. A severe warning has been conveyed regarding stepping over necks: that it will become a bridge on the Day of Resurrection which people will cross. Ibn Jurayj reported in a mursal narration: "While the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was delivering the Friday sermon, he saw a man stepping over people's necks until he advanced and sat down. When the Prophet, peace be upon him, finished his prayer, he intercepted the man until he met him and said, 'O so-and-so, what prevented you from praying with us today?' He said, 'O Prophet of God, I did pray with you.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'Did I not see you stepping over people's necks?'" He indicated by this that his deed was nullified. In a musnad narration, he said, "What prevented you from praying with us?" He said, "Did you not see me, O Messenger of God?" He, peace be upon him, said, "I saw you delay and harm," meaning he delayed from coming early and harmed those present. Whenever the first row is left vacant, it is permissible for him to step over people's necks because they have neglected their right and abandoned the place of virtue. Al-Hasan said, "Step over the necks of those who sit at the doors of mosques on Friday, for they have no sanctity." And if there is no one in the mosque except those praying, one should not give salutations because it is an imposition of a response in an inappropriate place. The sixth is not to pass before people and to sit where he is, near a column or wall, so that they do not pass before him—meaning before the one praying—for that does not invalidate the prayer but it is prohibited. He, peace be upon him, said, "For one to stand for forty years is better for him than to pass before one praying." And he, peace be upon him, said, "For a man to be ashes or decomposed dust scattered by the winds is better than to pass before one praying." It has been narrated in another hadith concerning the passer and the one praying where he prayed on the road or fell short in repelling: "If the passer before one praying and the one praying knew what is upon them in that, standing for forty years would be better for him than passing before him." The column, wall, and prayer mat are boundaries for the one praying; whoever passes beyond them should be repelled. He, peace be upon him, said, "Let him repel him; if he refuses, let him repel him; if he refuses, let him fight him, for he is a devil." Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may God be pleased with him, would repel whoever passed before him until he threw him down, and sometimes the man would cling to him and complain to Marwan, and he would inform him that the Prophet, peace be upon him, commanded him to do so. If he finds no column, let him place something before him the length of a forearm to serve as a marker for his boundary. The seventh is to seek the first row, for its merit is great as we have narrated. In the hadith: "Whoever washes, performs ghusl, comes early, advances, draws near to the imam, and listens, that will be an expiation for him for what is between the two Fridays and an increase of three days." In another wording: "God forgives him until the next Friday," and in some versions it is stipulated, "and did not step over people's necks." One should not neglect in seeking the first row three matters: First, if he sees near the preacher an evil he is unable to change—such as the imam or others wearing silk, or praying with much heavy, distracting weaponry, or gilded weaponry, or other things that necessitate disapproval—then staying back is safer and more conducive to peace of mind. A group of scholars did this seeking safety. It was said to Bishr ibn al-Harith, "We see you coming early and praying in the last rows?" He said, "What is intended is the closeness of hearts, not the closeness of bodies," indicating that this is closer to the safety of his heart. Sufyan al-Thawri looked at Shu'ayb ibn Harb near the pulpit listening to the sermon from Abu Ja'far al-Mansur. When he finished the prayer, he said, "My heart was preoccupied with your closeness to this one. Did you feel secure from hearing speech you must disapprove of and not rise to do so?" Then he mentioned what they had innovated in wearing black and said, "O Abu 'Abd Allah, is it not in the report, 'Draw near and listen'?" He said, "Woe to you, that was for the rightly-guided, divinely-directed caliphs. As for these, the farther you are from them and the less you look at them, the closer you are to God, Mighty and Exalted." Sa'id ibn 'Amir said, "I prayed next to Abu al-Darda', and he kept moving back in the rows until we were in the last row. When we prayed, I said to him, 'Is it not said that the best rows are the first?' He said, 'Yes, but this community is shown mercy and is looked upon among the nations. When God, Exalted is He, looks upon a servant in prayer, He forgives him and those behind him among the people. So I moved back hoping that God would forgive me through one of them whom He looks upon.'" Some narrators reported that he said, "I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say that." So whoever moves back with this intention, preferring others and displaying good character, there is no harm. At this point it is said: "Deeds are by intentions." Second, if it is not a restricted area near the preacher, separated from the mosque for rulers, then the first row is beloved.

Otherwise, some scholars have disliked entering the prayer enclosure. Al-Hasan and Bakr al-Muzani would not pray in the enclosure, viewing it as a restriction to rulers and an innovation introduced after the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) in mosques, while the mosque is open to all people. However, that was designated during the caliphate, and Anas ibn Malik and 'Imran ibn Husayn prayed in the enclosure without disliking it, seeking proximity. Perhaps the dislike pertains specifically to cases of exclusivity and prevention. As for the mere presence of an enclosure without restriction, no dislike is found. Thirdly, the pulpit cuts off some rows; only the first continuous row in front of the pulpit is considered complete, while those on its sides are cut off. Al-Thawri said the first row is the one extending before the pulpit, which is correct because it is continuous and because those sitting in it face the preacher and hear from him. It is not far-fetched to say the closest to the qibla is the first row, but this meaning is not considered, and prayer in markets and courtyards outside the mosque is disliked. Some Companions would strike people and remove them from courtyards. Eighth, one should cease prayer upon the Imam's emergence and also cease speech, rather engage in responding to the caller to prayer and then listening to the sermon. Some common people have customarily prostrated when the callers stand, but no basis for this is established in any trace or report; however, if it coincides with a prostration of recitation, it is not objectionable for supplication, as it is a virtuous time, and this prostration is not deemed prohibited, for there is no reason to prohibit it. It is narrated from 'Ali and 'Uthman (may God be pleased with them) that they said: "Whoever listens and remains silent has two rewards; whoever does not listen but remains silent has one reward; whoever listens and engages in idle talk bears two burdens; and whoever does not listen and engages in idle talk bears one burden." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says to his companion while the Imam is delivering the sermon 'Be silent' or 'Hush' has engaged in idle talk, and whoever engages in idle talk while the Imam is delivering the sermon has no Friday prayer." This indicates that silencing should be by gesture or throwing a pebble, not by speech. In the narration of Abu Dharr, when he asked Ubayy while the Prophet (peace be upon him) was delivering the sermon, "When was this chapter revealed?" Ubayy gestured to him to be silent. When the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) descended, Ubayy said to him, "Go, you have no Friday prayer?" Abu Dharr complained to the Prophet (peace be upon him), who said, "Ubayy spoke truthfully." If one is far from the Imam, one should not speak about knowledge or other matters but remain silent, for all such leads to murmuring until it reaches the listeners. One should not sit in a circle of those speaking; if unable to hear due to distance, let him remain silent, which is recommended. If prayer is disliked during the Imam's sermon, speech is more worthy of dislike. 'Ali (may God honor his face) said: "Prayer is disliked at four times: after dawn, after afternoon, at midday, and during prayer while the Imam is delivering the sermon." Ninth, observe in the Friday prayer leader what we mentioned for others; if one hears the Imam's recitation, one should recite only the Opening Chapter. When finished with Friday prayer, recite 'Praise be to God' seven times before speaking, and 'Say: He is God, the One' and the two seeking-refuge chapters seven times each. Some predecessors narrated that whoever does this is protected from one Friday to the next and it is a safeguard for him from Satan. It is recommended to say after Friday prayer: "O God, O Self-Sufficient, O Praiseworthy, O Originator, O Restorer, O Merciful, O Loving, enrich me with Your lawful provision over Your unlawful, and with Your bounty over all besides You." It is said whoever persists in this supplication, God the Exalted enriches him from His creation and provides for him from where he does not expect. Then pray after Friday six units. It is narrated by Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them) that he (peace be upon him) prayed after Friday two units; Abu Hurayrah narrated four; 'Ali and 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas (may God be pleased with them) narrated six—all are correct in different circumstances, and the most complete is best. Tenth, one should remain in the mosque until praying the afternoon prayer; if one stays until sunset, that is best. It is said whoever prays afternoon in the congregational mosque has the reward of Hajj, and whoever prays sunset has the reward of Hajj and 'Umrah. If one cannot ensure safety from showing off and harm from people observing his retreat, or fears delving into what does not concern him, it is best to return home remembering God Almighty, reflecting on His blessings, thanking God the Exalted for His enablement, fearing one's shortcomings, and guarding one's heart and tongue until sunset, so as not to miss the noble hour. One should not speak in the congregational mosque or other mosques about worldly matters. He (peace be upon him) said: "A time will come upon people when their conversation in their mosques will be about their worldly affairs, with no need for God the Exalted among them—so do not sit with them."

(Clarification of etiquettes and traditions outside the previous order that encompass the entire day, which are seven matters)

First, attend knowledge gatherings in the morning or after afternoon, and do not attend storytellers' gatherings.

There is good in their speech, and it is not fitting for the seeker to be devoid of good deeds and supplications throughout the entire Friday, until the noble hour meets him while he is engaged in goodness. Nor is it fitting to attend circles before the prayer. Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, narrated: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, forbade forming circles on Friday before the prayer," unless one is a scholar of Allah who reminds people of Allah's days and gives understanding in the religion of Allah, speaking in the mosque in the morning, so people sit with him. This combines early attendance and listening, and listening to beneficial knowledge for the Hereafter is better than occupying oneself with supererogatory prayers. Indeed, Abu Dharr narrated: "Attending a gathering of knowledge is better than praying a thousand rak'ahs." Anas ibn Malik said regarding the saying of Allah, the Exalted: "And when the prayer is concluded, disperse in the land and seek from the bounty of Allah," that it is not for seeking worldly gain, but rather visiting the sick, attending a funeral, learning knowledge, and visiting a brother for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has named knowledge 'bounty' in several places. He, the Exalted, said: "And taught you what you did not know, and great is the bounty of Allah upon you." And He, the Exalted, said: "And We gave David bounty from Us," meaning knowledge. Therefore, learning knowledge on this day and teaching it are among the best acts of nearness, and prayer is better than the gatherings of storytellers, as they considered it an innovation and expelled the storytellers from the mosque. Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, came early to his place in the congregational mosque and found a storyteller in his spot. He said, "Get up from my place." The man said, "I will not get up; I have sat and preceded you to it." So Ibn Umar sent for the chief of police and had him removed. If this were from the Sunnah, it would not have been permissible to remove him. Indeed, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Let none of you make his brother rise from his seat and then sit in it, but rather make room and spread out." Ibn Umar, if a man rose from his seat for him, would not sit in it until the man returned to it. It is narrated that a storyteller used to sit in the courtyard of Aisha's chamber, may Allah be pleased with her, so she sent to Ibn Umar saying, "This man has disturbed me with his stories and distracted me from my glorification." Ibn Umar beat him until he broke his stick on his back and then expelled him. The second is to have good observance of the noble hour, for in the famous report: "There is an hour on Friday which no Muslim servant encounters, asking Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, for something, except that He grants it to him." And in another report: "No servant encounters it while praying." There is disagreement about it. It is said it is at sunrise, or at noon, or with the call to prayer, or when the Imam ascends the pulpit and begins the sermon, or when the people stand for the prayer, or the last time of Asr, meaning the preferred time, or before sunset. Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, used to observe that time and order her maidservant to watch the sun and inform her of its setting, then she would engage in supplication and seeking forgiveness until the sun set, and she reported that this hour is the awaited one, narrating it from her father, peace be upon him, and upon her. Some scholars said it is unspecified throughout the entire day, like the Night of Decree, so motives are focused on observing it. It is said it moves through the hours of Friday like the Night of Decree moves, and this is the most fitting, and it has a secret not suited to the knowledge of practical conduct to mention. But one should believe in what the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Your Lord has breaths of mercy in the days of your time, so expose yourselves to them." Friday is among those days, so the servant should be throughout its day exposing himself to them by bringing presence of heart, adhering to remembrance, and abstaining from worldly whisperings, so that perhaps he may attain something of those breaths. Ka'b al-Ahbar said it is in the last hour of Friday, which is at sunset. Abu Hurairah said, "How can it be the last hour when I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'No servant encounters it while praying, and not at the time of prayer'?" Ka'b said, "Did not the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'Whoever sits waiting for the prayer is in prayer'?" He said, "Yes." Ka'b said, "That is prayer." So Abu Hurairah fell silent. Ka'b inclined to the view that it is a mercy from Allah, glorified be He, for those who fulfill the rights of this day, and its time of sending is upon completion of the work. In summary, this is a noble time along with the time of the Imam's ascent to the pulpit, so increase supplication in both. Third, it is recommended to increase sending prayers upon the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on this day, for he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever sends prayers upon me eighty times on Friday, Allah will forgive him the sins of eighty years." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah, how should we send prayers upon you?" He said, "Say: O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad, Your servant and Your prophet and Your messenger, the unlettered prophet, and count one. And if you say: O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, a prayer that is pleasing to You and fulfills his right, and grant him the means, and resurrect him to the praiseworthy station that You promised him, and reward him on our behalf what he deserves, and reward him..."

The best reward You have granted a prophet for his community is to send blessings upon him and upon all his brethren among the prophets and the righteous, O Most Merciful of the merciful. If you say this seven times, it has been related that whoever says it in seven gatherings—seven times in each Friday—has secured his intercession. And if one wishes to increase, let him recite the transmitted supplication, saying: O Allah, bestow the excellence of Your blessings, the growth of Your benedictions, the nobility of Your purifications, Your tenderness, Your mercy, and Your greetings upon Muhammad, the master of messengers, the leader of the God-fearing, the seal of the prophets, and the messenger of the Lord of the worlds, the guide to goodness, the opener of righteousness, the prophet of mercy, and the master of the community. O Allah, raise him to a praiseworthy station by which You draw him near, delight his eye, and cause the former and the latter to envy him. O Allah, grant him excellence, virtue, honor, the means, the lofty rank, and the elevated, sublime status. O Allah, grant Muhammad his request, fulfill his hope, and make him the first intercessor and the first whose intercession is accepted. O Allah, magnify his proof, weigh heavily his scale, make his argument luminous, and elevate his degree among the highest of those brought near. O Allah, gather us in his company, make us among the people of his intercession, enliven us upon his Sunnah, cause us to die upon his creed, lead us to his pool, and give us to drink from his cup, without disgrace, regret, doubt, alteration, seduction, or being seduced. Amen, O Lord of the worlds. In summary, any wording of the prayer, even the well-known one in the Tashahhud, constitutes prayer, and it is fitting to add to it seeking forgiveness, for that is also recommended on this day.

The fourth is reciting the Qur’an. Let one increase in it and specifically recite Surah al-Kahf, for it has been narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that whoever recites Surah al-Kahf on the night of Friday or the day of Friday is granted a light from where he recites it to Makkah, is forgiven until the next Friday, is given an excess of three days, seventy thousand angels send blessings upon him until he rises, and he is protected from illness, abscess, pleurisy, leprosy, leprosy, and the trial of the Dajjal. It is recommended to complete the Qur’an on Friday and its night if one is able, and let his completion be in the two rak’ahs of Fajr if he recites at night, or in the two rak’ahs of Maghrib, or between the adhan and iqamah for Friday, for there is great virtue in it. The devout used to recommend reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad one thousand times on Friday, and it is said that whoever recites it in ten or twenty rak’ahs is better than a complete recitation. They would send blessings upon the Prophet one thousand times and would say Subhan Allah, al-Hamdu Lillah, La ilaha illa Allah, and Allahu Akbar one thousand times. If one recites the six “Mussabbahat” surahs on Friday or its night, it is good. It is not narrated that the Prophet used to recite specific surahs except on Friday and its night: he would recite in the Maghrib prayer on Friday night “Qul Ya Ayyuha al-Kafirun” and “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad,” and in the ‘Isha prayer on Friday night Surah al-Jumu’ah and al-Munafiqun. It is narrated that he would recite them in the two rak’ahs of Friday, and he would recite in the Fajr prayer on Friday Surah as-Sajdah, Luqman, and “Hal Ata ‘ala al-Insan.”

The fifth is prayers. It is recommended that when one enters the mosque, he should not sit until he prays four rak’ahs, reciting in them Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad two hundred times—fifty times in each rak’ah—for it has been transmitted from the Messenger of Allah that whoever does so will not die until he sees his place in Paradise or it is shown to him. And he should not omit the two rak’ahs of greeting, even if the Imam is delivering the sermon, but he should make them brief. The Messenger of Allah commanded this. In a rare hadith, he remained silent for one entering until he prayed them. The people of Kufah said that if the Imam remains silent for him, he should pray them. It is recommended on this day or its night to pray four rak’ahs with four surahs: al-An’am, al-Kahf, Ta-Ha, and Ya-Sin. If one is not proficient, let him recite Ya-Sin, Surah as-Sajdah, Luqman, Surah ad-Dukhan, and Surah al-Mulk. One should not neglect reciting these four surahs on Friday night, for there is much virtue in them. Whoever is not proficient in the Qur’an recites what he can, and it is equivalent to a complete recitation for him. Let him increase in reciting Surah al-Ikhlas. It is recommended to pray the prayer of glorification, as will come in the chapter on voluntary prayers regarding its manner, for he said to his uncle al-‘Abbas: “Pray it every Friday.” Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, would not omit this prayer on Friday after the sun passes the meridian, and he would inform of its immense virtue. The best is to allocate the time until the sun passes the meridian for prayer, after the Friday prayer until ‘Asr for listening to knowledge, and after ‘Asr until Maghrib for glorification and seeking forgiveness.

The sixth is charity. It is recommended especially on this day, for it is multiplied, except for one who asks while the Imam is delivering the sermon and speaks during the Imam’s speech—this is disliked. Salih ibn Muhammad said: A beggar asked on Friday while the Imam was delivering the sermon, and he was next to Abu...

A man handed a piece to Abu Qatadah to pass to him, but Abu did not take it from him. Ibn Mas'ud said: "If a man begs in the mosque, he deserves not to be given; and if he begs while reciting the Qur'an, do not give him." Some scholars disliked giving charity to those who beg in the congregational mosque while stepping over people's necks, unless the beggar asks while standing or sitting in his place without stepping over others. Ka'b al-Ahbar said: "Whoever attends the Friday prayer, then leaves and gives two different types of charity, then returns and performs two rak'ahs, completing their bowing, prostration, and devotion, then says: 'O Allah, I ask You by Your name, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," and by Your name, "There is no god but Allah, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, whom neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes,"'—he will not ask Allah Almighty for anything except that He grants it." Some of the early pious said: "Whoever feeds a needy person on Friday, then goes early and does not harm anyone, then says when the Imam gives the salutation: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, I ask You to forgive me, have mercy on me, and protect me from the Fire,' then supplicates as he wishes—his supplication will be answered." The seventh is to dedicate Friday to the Hereafter, refraining from all worldly occupations, increasing devotional acts, and not commencing travel. It has been narrated that whoever travels on Friday night, his two angels invoke against him, and after dawn it is forbidden unless the caravan would be missed. Some of the early pious disliked buying water in the mosque from a water-carrier to drink or to give as charity, so as not to engage in trade in the mosque, for buying and selling in the mosque is disliked. They said: "There is no harm if he gives the piece outside the mosque, then drinks or gives charity inside." In summary, one should increase on Friday his devotional acts and varieties of good deeds, for if Allah the Exalted loves a servant, He employs him in virtuous times with virtuous deeds, and if He despises him, He employs him in virtuous times with evil deeds, so that his punishment is more severe and His disdain greater, due to his deprivation of the blessing of the time and violation of its sanctity. It is recommended on Friday to make supplications, which will be mentioned in the Book of Supplications, God willing. May Allah bless every chosen servant.

(Sixth Chapter: On miscellaneous issues that are widespread and the seeker needs to know them)
As for rare issues, we have detailed them in books of jurisprudence.

[Issue] A minor action, even if it does not invalidate the prayer, is disliked except out of necessity, such as pushing away a passerby or killing a scorpion that is feared and can be killed with one or two strikes; if it becomes three, it becomes excessive and invalidates the prayer. Likewise, lice and fleas—if one is harmed by them, he may push them away, as well as the need to scratch if it disturbs his devotion. Mu'adh would take lice and fleas during prayer, and Ibn 'Umar would kill lice during prayer until blood appeared on his hand. Al-Nakha'i said: "He may take it and weaken it, and there is no blame if he kills it." Ibn al-Musayyib said: "He may take it, numb it, then discard it." Mujahid said: "It is more beloved to leave it unless it harms him and distracts him from his prayer, then he weakens it enough so it does not harm and discards it." This is a concession; otherwise, perfection is to abstain from action even if minor, which is why some would not shoo away flies, saying: "I do not accustom myself to that, lest I ruin my prayer." I have heard that sinners in the presence of kings endure much harm without moving. If one yawns, it is not wrong to place his hand over his mouth, and it is preferable. If he sneezes, he praises Allah Almighty in his heart without moving his tongue. If he belches, he should not raise his head to the sky. If his cloak falls, he should not adjust it, nor the ends of his turban—all that is disliked except out of necessity.

[Issue] Prayer in shoes is permissible, even if removing them is easy. The concession for leather socks is due to the difficulty of removal, but this impurity is overlooked, and similarly for overshoes. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) prayed in his shoes, then removed them, so the people removed their shoes. He said: "Why did you remove your shoes?" They said: "We saw you remove them, so we removed them." He (peace be upon him) said: "Gabriel (peace be upon him) came to me and informed me that there was filth on them. So when one of you intends to enter the mosque, let him turn over his shoes and look; if he sees filth, let him wipe it on the ground and pray in them." Some said: "Praying in shoes is better because he (peace be upon him) said: 'Why did you remove your shoes?'" This is an exaggeration, for he (peace be upon him) asked them to explain the reason for his removal, knowing they had removed them in imitation. It has been narrated by 'Abdullah ibn al-Sa'ib that the Prophet (peace be upon him) removed his shoes. Thus, he did both. So whoever removes them should not place them to his right or left, narrowing the space and breaking the row, but place them in front of him, and not leave them behind him lest his heart be turned to them. Perhaps one who saw...

Prayer in them is superior, considering this meaning, which is the heart's attention to them. Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When one of you prays, let him place his sandals between his feet." And Abu Hurairah said to another: "Place them between your legs and do not harm a Muslim with them." The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, placed them on his left side while he was leading the prayer. The imam may do that since no one stands on his left, but it is preferable not to place them between his feet, as they would distract him; rather, in front of his feet, and perhaps this is the intended meaning of the hadith. Jubayr ibn Mut'im said: "A man placing his sandals between his feet is an innovation."

[Issue] If one spits during his prayer, his prayer is not invalidated because it is a minor action, and what does not produce sound is not considered speech, nor does it take the form of speech letters. However, it is disliked, so one should refrain from it except as the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, permitted. Some Companions reported: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, saw phlegm in the direction of the qiblah and became extremely angry. Then he scraped it with a palm stalk in his hand and said: 'Bring me some perfume.' He smeared its trace with saffron, then turned to us and said: 'Which of you would like to be spat upon in his face?' We said: 'No one.' He said: 'When one of you enters prayer, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is between him and the qiblah.'" In another wording: "Allah, the Exalted, is facing him, so let none of you spit directly in front of him nor to his right, but to his left or under his left foot. If an urge overcomes him, let him spit into his garment and rub it like this, one part against another."

[Issue] For the follower's standing, there is a recommended practice and an obligation. As for the recommended practice, a single male stands to the right of the imam, slightly behind him, and a single female stands behind the imam. If she stands beside the imam, it does not invalidate but contradicts the recommended practice. If a man is with her, the man stands to the right of the imam, and she stands behind the man. No one should stand alone behind the row; rather, he should join the row or pull someone from the row to himself. If he stands alone, his prayer is valid but disliked. As for the obligation, it is the connection of the row, meaning there is a unifying link between the follower and the imam, for they are in congregation. If they are in a mosque, that suffices as a link because it is built for it, so connection of a row is not needed, only knowledge of the imam's actions. Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, prayed on the roof of the mosque following the imam's prayer. If the follower is in the courtyard of the mosque, on a shared road or open ground, and there is no separating structure between them, proximity within an arrow's shot suffices, and that is a sufficient link, as the action of one reaches the other. The condition applies if one stands in a courtyard to the right or left of the mosque, with its door adjacent to the mosque; the condition is that the mosque's row extends into its corridor without interruption to the courtyard. Then the prayer of those in that row and behind it is valid, but not of those ahead of it. Such is the ruling for different structures. As for a single building or a single open area, it is like open ground.

[Issue] If one who missed part of the prayer catches the last part of the imam's prayer, it is the beginning of his own prayer. Let him conform to the imam and build upon it, and let him perform the qunut in the dawn prayer at the end of his own prayer, even if he performed qunut with the imam. If he catches some of the standing with the imam, he should not occupy himself with supplication but begin with Al-Fatihah and shorten it. If the imam bows before its completion and he can catch up with him in his straightening from the bowing, let him complete it. If unable, he conforms to the imam and bows, and some of Al-Fatihah has the ruling of all of it, so it is waived due to precedence. If the imam bows while he is in the surah, let him cut it off. If he catches the imam in prostration or tashahhud, he says the opening takbir, then sits and does not say another takbir, unlike if he catches him in bowing, for he says a second takbir while descending, as that is a counted transition for him. The takbirs are for the original transitions in the prayer, not for incidental ones due to following. One does not catch the rak'ah unless he attains stillness in bowing while the imam is still within the state of those bowing. If his stillness is not complete until after the imam has passed the state of those bowing, that rak'ah is missed.

[Issue] If one misses the noon prayer until the afternoon time, let him pray the noon prayer first, then the afternoon. If he begins with the afternoon, it suffices him, but he has abandoned the preferable and entered into the suspicion of disagreement. If he finds an imam, let him pray the afternoon, then pray the noon afterward, for congregation in performance is preferable. If he prays alone at the beginning of the time, then catches a congregation, he prays in the congregation and intends the prayer of the time, and Allah counts whichever He wills. If he intends a missed prayer or a voluntary prayer, it is permissible. If he has prayed in a congregation, then catches another congregation, let him intend the missed prayer or the voluntary, for repeating the performed prayer in congregation again has no basis, but it is only tolerated to attain the merit of congregation.

[Issue] If one prays, then sees impurity on his garment, the preferable is to repeat the prayer, but it is not obligatory. Even if he sees...

If impurity occurs during prayer, and one casts off the garment and completes it, it is preferable to recommence. The origin of this is the story of removing the two sandals when Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, that there was impurity on them, for he, may God bless him and grant him peace, did not recommence the prayer.

[Issue] Whoever omits the first Tashahhud, or the Qunut, or omits sending prayers upon the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, in the first Tashahhud, or performs an act forgetfully that would invalidate the prayer if done intentionally, or doubts whether he prayed three or four rak'ahs, should take the certain number and perform the two prostrations of forgetfulness before the salutation. If he forgets, then after the salutation, whenever he remembers, if it is soon after. If he prostrates after the salutation and after having broken his ritual purity, his prayer is invalidated. This is because when he entered into the prostration, it is as if he made his salutation a forgetful act in an improper place, so the dissolution [of prayer] is not achieved by it, and he returns to the prayer. Therefore, he recommences the salutation after the prostration. If he remembers the prostrations of forgetfulness after leaving the mosque or after a long interval, it has been missed.

[Issue] Obsessive doubt in the intention for prayer stems from a deficiency in the intellect or ignorance of the Sacred Law. For obeying the command of God, Exalted is He, is like obeying the command of another, and honoring Him is like honoring another in terms of intent. If a scholar enters upon a person and he stands for him, if he were to say, "I intend to stand up out of respect for the entrance of Zayd the virtuous, due to his virtue, turning my face toward him," this would be foolishness in his intellect. Rather, as he sees him and knows his virtue, the motive for respect arises, so he stands for him, and he is thereby honoring him, unless he stood for another reason or in heedlessness. Stipulating that the prayer be the noon prayer, performed as an obligatory duty, in it being an act of obedience, is like stipulating that the standing be connected with the entrance while turning the face toward the entrant and the absence of any other motive besides it, and intending respect by it so that it may be an act of respect. For if he stood turning his back to him, or waited and then stood after a period, he would not be honoring him. These attributes must necessarily be known and intended. Yet they need not be present in the soul for a prolonged moment. What is prolonged is the composition of the words indicating them, either by utterance with the tongue or by reflection in the heart. Whoever does not understand the intention for prayer in this manner is as if he has not understood intention at all. There is nothing more to it than that you were called to pray at a time, and you responded and stood up. Obsessive doubt is pure ignorance, for these intents and this knowledge gather in the soul in a single state and are not detailed individually in the mind such that the soul reviews and contemplates them. There is a difference between a thing being present in the soul and its being detailed by thought. Presence is the opposite of absence and heedlessness, even if it is not detailed. For example, one who knows an event knows it with a single knowledge in a single state. This knowledge encompasses other knowledges that are present even if not detailed. For one who knows an event has known the existent and the nonexistent, precedence and subsequence, time, that precedence belongs to nonexistence, and that subsequence belongs to existence. These knowledges are enfolded within the knowledge of the event, evidenced by the fact that if one who knows the event did not know the others, and were asked, "Did you know only precedence, or subsequence, or nonexistence, or the precedence of nonexistence, or the subsequence of existence, or time divided into the preceding and the subsequent?" and he said, "I never knew that," he would be lying, and his statement would contradict his saying, "I know the event." From ignorance of this subtle point arises obsessive doubt. For the one afflicted with waswasah burdens himself with making present in his heart the noon prayer, its performance, and its obligatory nature in a single state, detailed with their words, and he reviews them. That is impossible. If he burdened himself with that for standing up for a scholar, it would be impossible for him. With this understanding, obsessive doubt is repelled: that obeying the command of God, Glorified is He, in the intention is like obeying the command of another. Then I add, by way of facilitation and concession, and say: If the one afflicted with waswasah does not understand the intention except by bringing these matters present in detail, and cannot conceive of obedience all at once, and brings the totality of that present during the takbir from its beginning to its end, such that he does not finish the takbir except that the intention has been attained, that suffices him. We do not burden him with conjoining all of it with the beginning or the end of the takbir, for that is an excessive imposition. If he were commanded with that, the early generations would have asked about it, and at least one of the Companions would have experienced obsessive doubt about the intention. The absence of that occurring is proof that the matter is one of leniency. However the intention becomes easy for the one afflicted with waswasah, he should be content with it until he becomes accustomed to it and the obsessive doubt leaves him. He should not demand of himself to verify it, for verification increases the obsessive doubt. We have mentioned in the legal responses aspects of verification concerning the verification of knowledges and intents related to the intention that scholars need to know. As for the common people, hearing them might harm them and stir up obsessive doubt in them. Therefore, we have omitted them.

[Issue] The follower should not precede the imam in bowing, prostrating, and rising from them, nor in any of the other actions. Nor should he match him, but rather he should follow him and tread in his footsteps. This is the meaning.

Regarding following in prayer: If one intentionally aligns with the Imam, it does not invalidate his prayer, just as if he were to stand at his side without lagging behind. If he moves ahead of him, there is disagreement concerning the invalidation of his prayer, and it is not far-fetched to rule for its invalidation, drawing an analogy to one who steps ahead of the Imam at the prayer site. Indeed, this is more appropriate, because congregational prayer is about following in actions, not in physical positioning. Thus, following in action is paramount. The stipulation to avoid moving ahead in position is merely to facilitate following in action and to achieve the semblance of being a follower, since it is fitting for the one being followed to be ahead. Therefore, moving ahead of him in action is indefensible unless it occurs by mistake. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, strongly condemned it, saying: "Does he who raises his head before the Imam not fear that God will transform his head into the head of a donkey?" As for lagging behind him by one pillar of prayer, it does not invalidate the prayer. This is when the Imam straightens up from bowing while the follower has not yet bowed. However, lagging to this extent is disliked. If the Imam places his forehead on the ground for prostration while the follower has not yet reached the state of those bowing, his prayer is invalidated. Similarly, if the Imam places his forehead for the second prostration while the follower has not yet performed the first prostration.

[Issue] It is incumbent upon one who attends the prayer, upon seeing another performing it incorrectly, to correct him and disapprove of it. If it comes from an ignorant person, he should be gentle with the ignorant and teach him. Among such matters are commanding the straightening of rows, preventing one from standing alone outside the row, and disapproving of one who raises his head before the Imam, among other things. For he, peace be upon him, said: "Woe to the learned from the ignorant, when he does not teach him." And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever sees someone performing his prayer poorly and does not forbid him, he is a partner in its sin." And from Bilal ibn Sa'd, he said: "A sin, when concealed, harms only its doer, but when made public and not changed, it harms the general public." It is reported in the Hadith that Bilal used to straighten the rows and strike their ankles with a whip. And from 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, he said: "Check on your brothers regarding prayer. If you find them missing, if they are sick, visit them; if they are healthy, reproach them." Reproach is disapproval of one who abandons the congregation, and one should not be lenient in this matter. The early generations were so strict in this that some would carry a funeral bier to one who stayed away from the congregation, indicating that it is the dead who stay away from the congregation, not the living. One who enters the mosque should aim for the right side of the row, which is why people crowded there in the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until it was said to him that the left side was neglected. He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever frequents the left side of the mosque will have a double reward." Whenever one finds a boy in the row and finds no place for himself, he may move him to the back and take his place, meaning if the boy is not of age. This is what we intended to mention of the issues commonly encountered. The rulings for various prayers will follow in the Book of Regular Devotions, God willing.

                    (Chapter Seven: On Supererogatory Prayers)

Know that prayers other than the obligatory ones are divided into three categories: Sunnah, recommended, and voluntary. By Sunnah, we mean what has been transmitted from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, regarding his consistent practice, such as the regular prayers following the obligatory ones, the forenoon prayer, the Witr prayer, the night prayer, and others, because Sunnah denotes the trodden path. By recommended, we mean what has been reported concerning its merit but without transmission of consistent practice, as we will relate regarding prayers for specific days and nights of the week, and prayers upon leaving and entering the home, and the like. By voluntary, we mean beyond that, for which no specific report exists, but the servant voluntarily performs it out of desire to commune with God, Exalted is He, through prayer, the merit of which has been generally established in the Sacred Law. Thus, it is as if he is donating it, since he was not specifically urged to that particular prayer, though he was urged to prayer in general. Voluntary denotes donation. These three categories are called supererogatory because *nafl* means increase, and all of them are additional to the obligations. We intended the terms supererogatory, Sunnah, recommended, and voluntary as conventions to define these meanings. There is no harm if one changes this convention, for there is no contention over terms once the meanings are understood. Each of these categories varies in degrees of merit according to the reports and traditions known concerning their merit, according to the length of the Messenger of God's, peace be upon him, consistent practice of them, and according to the soundness and prevalence of the reports concerning them. Therefore, it is said that congregational Sunnah prayers are superior to individual Sunnah prayers. The best of congregational Sunnah prayers is the Eid prayer, then the eclipse prayer, then the prayer for rain. The best of individual Sunnah prayers is the Witr, then the two rak'ahs of dawn, then what follows them of the regular prayers, despite their variation. Know that supererogatory prayers, in relation to what they are attached to, are divided...

concerning matters related to causes such as eclipses and prayers for rain, and concerning matters related to times. Matters related to times are divided into those that recur with the recurrence of day and night, or with the recurrence of the week, or with the recurrence of the year. Thus, the totality comprises four divisions.

The first division is what recurs with the recurrence of days and nights, and these are eight: five are the regular Sunnah prayers of the five obligatory prayers, and three are beyond them, namely the Duha prayer, reviving the time between the two evening prayers, and the night vigil (Tahajjud).

The first: The regular Sunnah of the dawn prayer, which is two rak'ahs. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The two rak'ahs of the dawn are better than the world and all it contains." Its time begins with the appearance of the true dawn, which is the widespread light, not the elongated streak. Perceiving this at its beginning is difficult except by learning the lunar mansions or knowing the timing of its appearance by the visible stars, thereby deducing it from the stars and recognizing it by the moon on two nights of the month. For the moon rises with the dawn on the twenty-sixth night, and the dawn appears with the setting of the moon on the twelfth night of the month—this is the general rule, though variation occurs in some zodiacal signs. Elaborating on this is lengthy, and learning the lunar mansions is among the important matters for the seeker, so that he may thereby discern the measures of the night times and the dawn. The time for the two rak'ahs of the dawn expires with the expiration of the time for the obligatory dawn prayer, which is sunrise, but the Sunnah is to perform them before the obligatory prayer. If one enters the mosque and the prayer has already commenced, he should occupy himself with the obligatory prayer, for he, peace be upon him, said: "When the prayer is established, there is no prayer except the obligatory one." Then, after finishing the obligatory prayer, he should rise to them and pray them. The correct view is that they are performed as timely if they occur before sunrise, because they are followers of the obligatory prayer in its time; the order between them is a Sunnah in precedence and delay when not coinciding with a congregation. If coinciding with a congregation, the order is reversed, and they remain timely. It is recommended to pray them at home, make them brief, then enter the mosque and pray two rak'ahs as a greeting of the mosque, then sit and not pray until performing the obligatory prayer. Between dawn and sunrise, what is most beloved therein is remembrance and reflection, and limiting oneself to the two rak'ahs of the dawn and the obligatory prayer.

The second: The regular Sunnah of the noon prayer, which is six rak'ahs: two after it, which are also a confirmed Sunnah, and four before it, which are also a Sunnah, though less emphasized than the last two. Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever prays four rak'ahs after the sun has passed the meridian, perfecting their recitation, bowing, and prostration, seventy thousand angels pray with him, seeking forgiveness for him until nightfall." And he, peace be upon him, would not omit four after the meridian, prolonging them, and saying: "The gates of heaven are opened at this hour, and I love that a deed of mine be raised therein." Reported by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, who alone narrated it. This is also indicated by what Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet, peace be upon him, reported that he said: "Whoever prays twelve rak'ahs every day beyond the obligatory prayers, a house will be built for him in Paradise: two before the dawn, four before noon, two after it, two before the afternoon, and two after the sunset." And Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said: "I memorized from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, ten rak'ahs every day," mentioning what Umm Habibah, may God be pleased with her, mentioned except the two rak'ahs of the dawn, for he said that was an hour when he would not enter upon the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, but my sister Hafsa, may God be pleased with her, informed me that he, peace be upon him, would pray two rak'ahs in her house then leave. And in his narration, he said two before noon and two after the night prayer, thus making the two before noon more emphasized than the set of four. The time for this enters with the meridian, and the meridian is known by the increase in the shadow of upright objects leaning toward the east. For an object casts a shadow at sunrise on the western side, which lengthens; as the sun rises, the shadow decreases and shifts from the west until the sun reaches its zenith, which is the arc of midday, and that is the point of the shadow's minimum. When the sun declines from its zenith, the shadow begins to increase. From where the increase becomes perceptible to the senses, the time for noon prayer enters. It is known with certainty that the meridian in the knowledge of God, glorified be He, occurred before it, but religious obligations are only tied to what falls under perception. The remaining shadow from which it begins to increase lengthens in winter and shortens in summer; its maximum length is when the sun reaches the beginning of Capricorn, and its minimum shortness is when it reaches the beginning of Cancer. This is known by feet and scales. Among the methods close to accuracy for one who observes well is to note the North Pole at night and place a square board on the ground in a level position such that one of its sides is toward the Pole, so that if one imagines a stone falling from the Pole to the ground, then imagines a line from the stone's landing point to the side...

The line adjacent to the board is drawn along the edge at two right angles, meaning the line is not inclined toward either side. Then, a perpendicular is erected on the board, set perfectly upright at the position of the marker, which is opposite the pole. Its shadow falls on the board at the beginning of the day, leaning toward the direction of the west along line A. It continues to incline until it aligns with line B, such that if its head were extended, it would reach straight to the point where the stone falls and be parallel to the eastern and western edges, not leaning toward either. When its inclination to the western side ceases, the sun is at its zenith. When the shadow deviates from the line on the board toward the east, the sun has declined. This is perceived with certainty by the senses at a time close to the beginning of the decline, according to the knowledge of God, the Exalted. Then, a mark is made at the head of the shadow at its deviation. When the shadow from that mark becomes equal to the perpendicular, the time for the Asr prayer enters. This much is acceptable to know regarding the science of the decline, and its illustration is as follows:

The third regular prayer is that of Asr, which is four rak'ahs before Asr. Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "May God have mercy on a servant who prays four rak'ahs before Asr." Doing this in hope of being included in the supplication of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, is strongly recommended, for his supplication is undoubtedly answered. However, his consistency regarding this Sunnah before Asr is not like his consistency regarding the two rak'ahs before Dhuhr.

The fourth: the regular prayer of Maghrib, which is two rak'ahs after the obligatory prayer, with differing narrations about them. As for two rak'ahs before it, between the call to prayer and the iqamah, as a form of hastening, it has been reported from a group of Companions such as Ubayy ibn Ka'b, 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, Abu Dharr, Zayd ibn Thabit, and others. 'Ubadah or another said: "When the mu'adhdhin gave the call for Maghrib prayer, the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would hasten to the pillars to pray two rak'ahs." Some said: "We would pray the two rak'ahs before Maghrib until someone entering would think we had already prayed," and they would ask, "Have you prayed Maghrib?" This falls under the generality of his saying, peace be upon him: "Between every two calls to prayer, there is a prayer for whoever wishes." Ahmad ibn Hanbal used to pray them, but people criticized him, so he stopped. When asked about it, he said, "I did not see people praying them, so I stopped." He said, "If a man prays them in his house or where people do not see him, it is good." The time for Maghrib begins with the disappearance of the sun from sight in flat lands not surrounded by mountains. If they are surrounded by mountains in the direction of the west, one waits until the darkness approaches from the east. He, peace be upon him, said: "When night approaches from here and day departs from here, the fasting person breaks his fast." It is most beloved to hasten specifically in Maghrib prayer. If delayed and prayed before the disappearance of the red twilight, it is valid as performance, but it is disliked. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, delayed Maghrib prayer one night until a star appeared, then he freed a slave. Ibn 'Umar delayed it until two stars appeared, then freed two slaves.

The fifth: the regular prayer of 'Isha', which is four rak'ahs after the obligatory prayer. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would pray four rak'ahs after 'Isha', then sleep." Some scholars, based on the totality of reports, preferred that the number of regular prayers be seventeen, like the number of obligatory prayers: two before Fajr, four before Dhuhr, two after it, four before Asr, two after Maghrib, and three after 'Isha', which is Witr. Whatever narrations are known regarding it, there is no meaning to specification, for he, peace be upon him, said: "Prayer is the best position, so whoever wishes may increase and whoever wishes may decrease." Thus, each seeker chooses from these prayers according to his desire for good. It has become clear from what we mentioned that some are more emphasized than others, and neglecting the more emphasized is farther from correctness, especially since obligatory prayers are completed by voluntary ones. Whoever does not increase in them may soon find his obligatory prayer not secure without a compensator.

The sixth: Witr. Anas ibn Malik said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would pray Witr after 'Isha' with three rak'ahs, reciting in the first: 'Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,' in the second: 'Say, O disbelievers,' and in the third: 'Say, He is God, the One.'" It is reported that he, peace be upon him, would pray two rak'ahs sitting after Witr, in some reports cross-legged. In some narrations: "When he intended to enter his bed, he would crawl to it and pray two rak'ahs upon it before lying down, reciting in them: 'When the earth is shaken' and Surah At-Takathur." In another narration: "Say, O disbelievers." Witr may be performed separated or connected with one taslim or two. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, prayed Witr with one rak'ah, three, five, and so on in odd numbers up to eleven rak'ahs.

The number of rak'ahs was debated between thirteen, and in a rare narration, seventeen. These rak'ahs, meaning the total we have named, constitute the Witr prayer at night, which is the Tahajjud, and performing Tahajjud at night is a strongly emphasized Sunnah. Its merits will be mentioned later in the Book of Regular Devotions. There is a difference of opinion regarding what is best. It is said that performing Witr with a single, odd rak'ah is superior, as it is authentically reported that he (peace be upon him) would consistently perform Witr with a single rak'ah. Others say the connected prayer is better, to avoid the semblance of disagreement, especially for the Imam, as someone who does not consider a single rak'ah a valid prayer may follow him. If he prays it connected, he intends Witr for the entire set. If he confines himself to a single rak'ah after the two rak'ahs of the 'Isha' prayer or after the obligatory 'Isha' prayer, he intends Witr and it is valid, because the condition for Witr is that it be odd in itself and that it make odd what preceded it. The obligatory prayer has already been made odd. If he were to perform Witr before 'Isha', it would not be valid—meaning, he would not attain the merit of Witr, which is better for him than red camels, as the report states. Otherwise, a single rak'ah is valid at any time. It is only invalid before 'Isha' because it breaches the consensus of the community in practice and because nothing preceded it to make it odd. If one intends to perform Witr with three separate rak'ahs, there is consideration regarding his intention for the first two. If he intends them as Tahajjud or the Sunnah of 'Isha', they are not part of the Witr. If he intends Witr for them, they are not odd in themselves, for the Witr is what comes after them. However, the most apparent view is to intend Witr for them, just as one intends Witr for the three connected rak'ahs. But Witr has two meanings: one, that it be odd in itself; the other, that it be initiated to be made odd by what follows it, so the totality of the three becomes odd. The two rak'ahs are part of the three, except that their being made odd is contingent upon the third rak'ah. If he is resolved to make them odd with a third, he may intend Witr for them, and the third rak'ah is odd in itself and makes other prayers odd. The first two do not make other prayers odd, nor are they odd in themselves, but they are made odd by another. Witr should be the last prayer of the night, occurring after Tahajjud. The merits of Witr and Tahajjud and the manner of ordering between them will come in the Book of Arranging Devotions.

Seventh: The Duha prayer. Consistency in it is among the resolute and virtuous actions. As for its number of rak'ahs, the maximum transmitted is eight rak'ahs. Umm Hani', the sister of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with them both), reported that he (peace be upon him) prayed Duha with eight rak'ahs, prolonging and beautifying them. No one else transmitted this number. As for 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), she mentioned that he (peace be upon him) would pray Duha with four rak'ahs and increase as much as Allah willed. She did not specify the increase, except that he was consistent on the four and would not decrease from them, though he might add more. It is reported in a separate narration that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would pray Duha with six rak'ahs. As for its time, 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he (peace be upon him) would pray Duha with six rak'ahs in two times: when the sun rose and became high, he would stand and pray two rak'ahs—this is the first regular devotion of the day, as will come later—and when the sun spread and was a quarter of the sky from the east, he would pray four. The first is only when the sun has risen the height of half a spear, and the second when a quarter of the day has passed, corresponding to the 'Asr prayer, for its time is when a quarter of the day remains. Dhuhr is at midday, and Duha is at the midpoint between sunrise and zenith, just as 'Asr is at the midpoint between zenith and sunset. This is the best of times. From the time the sun rises until just before zenith is generally a time for Duha.

Eighth: Reviving the time between the two 'Isha prayers (Maghrib and 'Isha'), which is a strongly emphasized Sunnah. What is transmitted of its number from the action of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) between the two 'Isha prayers is six rak'ahs. This prayer has great merit, and it is said that it is what is intended by His words, Exalted is He: "Their sides forsake their beds." It is reported from him (peace be upon him) that he said: "Whoever prays between Maghrib and 'Isha', it is among the prayer of the oft-returning." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever dedicates himself between Maghrib and 'Isha' in a congregational mosque, speaking only for prayer or recitation of the Qur'an, it is a right upon Allah to build for him two palaces in Paradise, each a journey of a hundred years, and to plant for him between them plantations that, if the people of the earth were to gather, would suffice them." The remainder of its merits will come in the Book of Regular Devotions, if Allah wills.

(Part Two: What Repeats with the Recurrence of Weeks)
(These are the prayers of the days of the week and their nights, for each day and each night)

As for the days, we begin with Sunday. Sunday: Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "Whoever prays on Sunday four rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book..."

The Book, and the Messenger believed. Once God writes for him, according to the number of every Christian man and woman, good deeds, and gives him the reward of a prophet, and writes for him the merit of a Hajj and an Umrah, and writes for him with every rak'ah a thousand prayers, and gives him in Paradise for every letter a city of fragrant musk. And it is narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Declare God's Oneness by abundant prayer on Sunday, for He, Glorified is He, is One, without partner. So whoever prays on Sunday after the noon prayer four rak'ahs, after the obligatory and the sunnah, reciting in the first the Opening of the Book and 'The Prostration' (Surah As-Sajdah), and in the second the Opening of the Book and 'Blessed is the King' (Surah Al-Mulk), then gives the testimony and salutation, then stands and prays two other rak'ahs, reciting in them the Opening of the Book and the Surah of 'The Congregation' (Al-Jumu'ah), and asks God, Glorified is He, for his need, it is a right upon God to fulfill his need."

Monday: Jabir narrated from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever prays on Monday at the height of the day two rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book once, the Verse of the Throne once, and 'Say: He is God, the One' and the two seeking-refuge surahs once each, then when he gives the salutation, seeks God's forgiveness ten times and sends blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, ten times, God the Exalted will forgive him all his sins."

And Anas ibn Malik narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever prays on Monday twelve rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and the Verse of the Throne once, then when he finishes, recites 'Say: He is God, the One' twelve times and seeks forgiveness twelve times, will be called out on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where is so-and-so, son of so-and-so? Let him rise to take his reward from God, the Mighty and Majestic.' The first thing given to him of the reward will be a thousand garments, and he will be crowned, and it will be said to him: 'Enter Paradise.' A hundred thousand angels will meet him, each angel bearing a gift, escorting him until he tours a thousand palaces of light, radiant."

Tuesday: Yazid al-Raqqashi narrated from Anas ibn Malik, who said the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Tuesday ten rak'ahs at midday," and in another narration, "at the height of the day, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and the Verse of the Throne once, and 'Say: He is God, the One' three times, no sin will be recorded against him for seventy days. If he dies within seventy days, he dies a martyr, and his sins of seventy years are forgiven."

Wednesday: Abu Idris al-Khawlani narrated from Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may God be pleased with him, who said the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Wednesday twelve rak'ahs at the height of the day, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and the Verse of the Throne once, and 'Say: He is God, the One' three times, and the two seeking-refuge surahs three times, a caller will call out near the Throne: 'O servant of God, begin your work anew, for what has preceded of your sin has been forgiven you.' And God, Glorified is He, will lift from you the punishment, constriction, and darkness of the grave, and will lift from you the hardships of the Resurrection, and will raise for him from that day the deed of a prophet."

Thursday: From Ikrimah, from Ibn Abbas, who said the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Thursday between the noon and afternoon prayers two rak'ahs, reciting in the first the Opening of the Book and the Verse of the Throne a hundred times, and in the second the Opening of the Book and 'Say: He is God, the One' a hundred times, and sends blessings upon Muhammad a hundred times, God will give him the reward of one who fasted Rajab, Sha'ban, and Ramadan, and he will have reward like that of a pilgrim to the House, and God will write for him, according to the number of everyone who believes in God, Glorified is He, and relies upon Him, a good deed."

Friday: It is narrated from Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Friday is a day of prayer entirely. There is no believing servant who rises when the sun has fully risen and ascended the height of a spear or more, then performs ablution, perfects the ablution, and then prays the forenoon prayer of two rak'ahs in faith and seeking reward, except that God writes for him two hundred good deeds and erases from him two hundred bad deeds. And whoever prays four rak'ahs, God, Glorified is He, will raise for him in Paradise four hundred degrees. And whoever prays eight rak'ahs, God the Exalted will raise for him in Paradise eight hundred degrees and forgive him all his sins. And whoever prays twelve rak'ahs, God will write for him two thousand two hundred good deeds, erase from him two thousand two hundred bad deeds, and raise for him in Paradise two thousand two hundred degrees."

And from Nafi', from Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever enters the mosque on Friday and prays four rak'ahs before the Friday prayer, reciting in each rak'ah 'Praise be to God' and 'Say: He is God, the One' fifty times, will not die until he sees his place in Paradise, or it is seen for him."

Saturday: Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Saturday four rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book once and 'Say: He is God, the One' three times, then when he finishes recites the Verse of the Throne, God will write for him for every letter the merit of a Hajj and an Umrah, and raise for him for every letter the reward of a year fasting its days and standing in prayer its nights, and God, the Mighty and Majestic, will give him for every letter the reward of a martyr, and he will be under the shade...

The Throne of God is with the prophets and the martyrs. As for the nights: Sunday night: Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Sunday night twenty rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and 'Say: He is God, the One' fifty times, and the two chapters of refuge once each, and seeks forgiveness from God, the Mighty and Majestic, one hundred times, and seeks forgiveness for himself and his parents one hundred times, and sends blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, one hundred times, and disavows his own power and strength and takes refuge in God, then says: 'I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Adam is the chosen one of God and His creation, and Abraham is the intimate friend of God, and Moses is the one spoken to by God, and Jesus is the spirit of God, and Muhammad is the beloved of God,' he will have a reward equal to the number of those who have ascribed a son to God and those who have not ascribed a son to God, and God, the Mighty and Majestic, will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection with the secure ones, and it is a right upon God, the Exalted, to admit him to Paradise with the prophets." Monday night: Al-A'mash reported from Anas that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Monday night four rak'ahs, reciting in the first rak'ah 'Praise be to God' and 'Say: He is God, the One' eleven times, and in the second rak'ah 'Praise be to God' and 'Say: He is God, the One' eleven times, and in the third rak'ah 'Praise be to God' and 'Say: He is God, the One' thirty times, and in the fourth rak'ah 'Praise be to God' and 'Say: He is God, the One' forty times, then gives the salutation and recites 'Say: He is God, the One' seventy-five times, and seeks forgiveness from God for himself and his parents seventy-five times, then asks God for his need, it is a right upon God to grant him his request, whatever he asks." This is called the Prayer of Need. Tuesday night: Whoever prays two rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and 'Say: He is God, the One' and the two chapters of refuge fifteen times, and recites after the salutation the Throne Verse fifteen times and seeks forgiveness from God, the Exalted, fifteen times, will have a great reward and immense recompense. And it is reported from 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever prays on Tuesday night two rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book once and 'Indeed, We sent it down' and 'Say: He is God, the One' seven times, God will free his neck from the Fire, and he will have on the Day of Resurrection a guide and leader to Paradise." Wednesday night: Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Whoever prays on Wednesday night two rak'ahs, reciting in the first the Opening of the Book and 'Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak' ten times, and in the second after the Opening 'Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind' ten times, then when he gives the salutation, seeks forgiveness from God ten times, then sends blessings upon Muhammad, peace be upon him, ten times, seventy thousand angels descend from every heaven writing his reward until the Day of Resurrection." And in another narration: "Sixteen rak'ahs, reciting after the Opening whatever God wills, and reciting in the last two rak'ahs the Throne Verse thirty times, and in the first two thirty times 'Say: He is God, the One,' he will intercede for ten of his household members, all of whom were destined for the Fire." And Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, reported that she said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Wednesday night six rak'ahs, reciting in a rak'ah after the Opening 'Say: O God, Owner of Sovereignty' to the end of the verse, then when he finishes his prayer says: 'May God reward Muhammad on our behalf as he deserves,' his sins of seventy years are forgiven, and a certificate of freedom from the Fire is written for him." Thursday night: Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Thursday night between the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers two rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and the Throne Verse five times and 'Say: He is God, the One' five times and the two chapters of refuge five times, then when he finishes his prayer seeks forgiveness from God, the Exalted, fifteen times and dedicates its reward to his parents, he has fulfilled the right of his parents upon him, even if he was disobedient to them, and God, the Exalted, gives him what He gives to the truthful and the martyrs." Friday night: Jabir said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Friday night between the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers twelve rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book once and 'Say: He is God, the One' eleven times, it is as if he worshipped God, the Exalted, for twelve years, fasting its days and standing in prayer its nights." And Anas said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Friday night the last 'Isha' prayer in congregation and prays the two rak'ahs of the Sunnah, then prays after them ten rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and 'Say: He is God, the One' and the two chapters of refuge once each, then prays the Witr with three rak'ahs and sleeps on his right side with his face toward the qiblah, it is as if he revived the Night of Decree." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Increase in sending blessings upon me on the radiant night and the bright day—the night of Friday and the day of Friday." Saturday night: Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever prays on Saturday night between

The Maghrib and Isha prayers are twelve rak'ahs; a palace is built for him in Paradise, and it is as if he has given charity to every believing man and woman, and he is absolved from the Jews, and it becomes incumbent upon God to forgive him.

(Third Section: What Repeats with the Recurrence of Years)
These are four: the prayers of the two Eids, Tarawih, and the prayers of Rajab and Sha'ban. The first is the prayer of the two Eids: it is a confirmed Sunnah and a symbol among the symbols of the religion. Seven matters should be observed in it. First: The magnification (saying Allahu Akbar) three times in succession, saying: "God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest, greatly, and praise be to God abundantly, and glory be to God morning and evening. There is no god but God alone, with no partner, sincere to Him in religion even if the disbelievers dislike it." The magnification begins on the night of Eid al-Fitr until the start of the Eid prayer, and in the second Eid (al-Adha), the magnification begins after the dawn prayer on the Day of Arafah until the end of the day on the thirteenth. This is the most complete of the sayings. And one magnifies after the obligatory prayers and after the supererogatory prayers, with it being more emphasized after the obligatory ones. Second: When the day of Eid dawns, one performs the ritual bath, adorns oneself, and applies perfume as we mentioned regarding Friday. The robe and turban are best for men, and boys should avoid silk and old women should avoid adornment when going out. Third: To go out by one route and return by another, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, did. And he, peace be upon him, used to command the bringing out of adolescent girls and those in seclusion. Fourth: It is recommended to go out to the open ground except in Mecca and Jerusalem. If it is a day of rain, then there is no harm in praying in the mosque. And on a clear day, it is permissible for the Imam to order a man to lead the weak in prayer in the mosque and go out with the strong, magnifying. Fifth: Observing the time, for the time of the Eid prayer is between sunrise and noon, and the time for slaughtering the sacrifices is between the sun rising the amount of two sermons and two rak'ahs until the end of the day on the thirteenth. It is recommended to hasten the prayer of Eid al-Adha for the sake of slaughtering and to delay the prayer of Eid al-Fitr for the sake of distributing the charity of al-Fitr before it; this is the Sunnah of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Sixth: Regarding the manner of the prayer, the people should go out magnifying on the way. When the Imam reaches the prayer ground, he does not sit nor perform supererogatory prayers, and the people cease supererogatory prayers. Then a caller calls: "The prayer is gathering." The Imam leads them in two rak'ahs. In the first, he magnifies besides the opening magnification and the bowing magnification seven magnifications, saying between every two magnifications: "Glory be to God, praise be to God, there is no god but God, and God is the Greatest." And he says after the opening magnification: "I have turned my face to the One who created the heavens and the earth," and delays seeking refuge until after the eighth. He recites Surah Qaf in the first after the Opening and "The Hour has drawn near" in the second. The additional magnifications in the second are five besides the two magnifications of standing and bowing, and between every two magnifications is what we mentioned. Then he delivers two sermons with a sitting between them. Whoever misses the Eid prayer makes it up. Seventh: To sacrifice a ram (the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sacrificed two horned rams and slaughtered with his hand, saying: "In the name of God, God is the Greatest, this is on behalf of me and on behalf of anyone from my community who did not sacrifice"). And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever sees the crescent of Dhul-Hijjah and intends to sacrifice, let him not take anything from his hair or nails." Abu Ayyub al-Ansari said: "A man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of his household during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and they would eat and feed." And one may eat from the sacrifice after three days and beyond; permission regarding it came after it was prohibited. And Sufyan al-Thawri said: "It is recommended to pray twelve rak'ahs after Eid al-Fitr and six rak'ahs after Eid al-Adha," and he said it is from the Sunnah.

The second is Tarawih: It is twenty rak'ahs, and its manner is well-known. It is a confirmed Sunnah, even if it is less than the two Eids. They differed regarding whether congregation in it is better or individual prayer. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, went out for it for two or three nights for congregation, then did not go out, saying: "I fear it may become obligatory upon you." And Umar, may God be pleased with him, gathered the people for it in congregation when he was secure from it becoming obligatory due to the cessation of revelation. So it was said that congregation is better due to the action of Umar, may God be pleased with him, and because gathering is a blessing and has virtue by evidence of the obligatory prayers, and because one may become lazy in individual prayer and become energetic when seeing the gathering. And it was said individual prayer is better because this is a Sunnah that is not among the symbols like the two Eids, so likening it to the Duha prayer and the greeting of the mosque is more appropriate, and congregation was not legislated for it. And it has been the custom that a group enters the mosque together and then they do not pray the greeting in congregation. And due to his saying, peace be upon him: "The superiority of supererogatory prayer in one's house over his prayer in the mosque is like the superiority of the obligatory prayer in the mosque over his prayer in the house." And it is narrated that he, peace be upon him, said: "A prayer in this mosque of mine is better..."

A prayer in the Sacred Mosque is superior to a hundred prayers in other mosques, and a prayer in my mosque is superior to a thousand prayers elsewhere. Yet superior to all that is a man who prays two rak'ahs in a corner of his house, unknown to any but Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. This is because ostentation and affectation may infiltrate congregational prayer, while one is secure from them in solitude. Such is what has been said on the matter. However, the preferred view is that congregational prayer is superior, as held by Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, for some supererogatory prayers have been legislated with congregation, and this is worthy of being among the visible rites. As for turning attention to ostentation in congregation and laziness in solitude, this diverts from the intended consideration of the virtue of congregation precisely because it is congregation. It is as if the speaker says: Prayer is better than abandoning it due to laziness, and sincerity is better than ostentation. Let us then posit the issue concerning one who is confident in himself that he would not be lazy if praying alone, nor would he show off if attending the congregation: which is better for him? The consideration revolves between the blessing of the congregation and the increased strength of sincerity and presence of heart in solitude. Thus, it is permissible that there be hesitation in preferring one over the other.

Among the recommended practices is the qunut supplication in the witr prayer during the latter half of Ramadan. As for the prayer of Rajab: It has been narrated with a chain from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, that he said: "There is no one who fasts the first Thursday of Rajab, then prays between the evening and late-night prayers twelve rak'ahs, separating every two rak'ahs with the salutation, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book once, 'Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree' three times, and 'Say, He is Allah, the One' twelve times; then when he finishes his prayer, he sends blessings upon me seventy times, saying: 'O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, the unlettered Prophet, and upon his family'; then he prostrates and says in his prostration seventy times: 'Glory be to the Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit'; then he raises his head and says seventy times: 'My Lord, forgive, have mercy, and overlook what You know, for You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous'; then he prostrates another prostration and says therein what he said in the first prostration; then he asks for his need in his prostration, and it will be granted." The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "No one prays this prayer except that Allah, the Exalted, forgives all his sins, even if they were like the foam of the sea, the number of sand grains, the weight of mountains, and the leaves of trees; and he will intercede on the Day of Resurrection for seven hundred of his household members who deserved the Fire." This is a recommended prayer. We have only mentioned it in this section because it recurs with the recurrence of years, although its rank does not reach the rank of Tarawih and the Eid prayer, because this prayer has been transmitted by individual narrators. However, I saw the people of Jerusalem unanimously adhering to it and not permitting its abandonment, so I wished to mention it.

As for the prayer of Sha'ban: On the night of the fifteenth thereof, one prays one hundred rak'ahs, every two rak'ahs with a salutation, reciting in each rak'ah after the Opening 'Say, He is Allah, the One' eleven times. Or if one wishes, he may pray ten rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah after the Opening 'Say, He is Allah, the One' one hundred times. This is also narrated among the collection of prayers. The predecessors used to pray this prayer and call it the Prayer of Goodness, and they would gather for it, sometimes praying it in congregation. It is narrated from Al-Hasan that he said: "Thirty Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, related to me that whoever prays this prayer on this night, Allah will look upon him seventy glances, and with each glance He will grant him seventy needs, the least of which is forgiveness."

(The fourth category of supererogatory prayers is that which relates to incidental causes and is not tied to specific times.) These are nine: The prayer of the lunar and solar eclipses, the prayer for rain, the greeting of the mosque, the two rak'ahs of ablution, the two rak'ahs between the adhan and the iqamah, the two rak'ahs upon leaving and entering the home, and similar prayers. We will mention from them what comes to mind now.

The first is the prayer of the eclipse. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "The sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed for the death or life of anyone. So when you see that, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and to prayer." He said this when his son Ibrahim, peace be upon him, died and the sun was eclipsed, and people said it was eclipsed due to his death. The consideration regarding its manner and time: As for the manner, if the sun is eclipsed during a time when prayer is disliked or not disliked, the call "as-salatu jami'ah" is made, and the Imam leads the people in prayer in the mosque with two rak'ahs, performing in each rak'ah two bowings, the first of each being longer than the last. He does not recite aloud. In the first standing of the first rak'ah, he recites the Opening and Al-Baqarah; in the second, the Opening and Al 'Imran; in the third, the Opening and Surat An-Nisa'; in the fourth, the Opening and Surat Al-Ma'idah, or an equivalent amount of the Qur'an from wherever he wishes. If he confines himself to the Opening in each standing, it suffices him, and if he confines himself to short surahs, there is no harm. The objective of prolongation is the continuity of prayer until the eclipse clears. In the first bowing, he glorifies for the duration of a hundred verses, and in the second for the duration of...

In the first [rak'ah], recite the length of one hundred verses; in the second, the length of eighty; in the third, the length of seventy; and in the fourth, the length of fifty. And let the prostration be of a length equal to the bowing in each rak'ah. Then he delivers two sermons after the prayer, with a sitting between them, and commands the people to give charity, free slaves, and repent. Likewise is done for the lunar eclipse, except that he prolongs it therein because it is a night prayer. As for its time, it is from the beginning of the eclipse until its complete clearing. Its time expires when the sun sets while eclipsed. The prayer for a lunar eclipse is missed when the sun's disc rises, for the dominion of the night is nullified, but it is not missed by the moon setting while eclipsed, because the entire night is the moon's dominion. If it clears during the prayer, he completes it in an abbreviated manner. Whoever catches the second bowing with the Imam has missed that rak'ah, because the foundation is the first bowing.

The second is the prayer for rain (Salat al-Istisqa'): When rivers dry up and rains cease, or a canal collapses, it is recommended for the Imam to first command the people to fast for three days, to give as much charity as they can, to relinquish wrongfully held property, and to repent from sins. Then he goes out with them on the fourth day, along with the elderly women and children, cleansed, in humble garments, with meekness and humility—unlike the Eid prayer. It is said it is recommended to bring out the animals for their sharing in the need, and due to His saying, "Were it not for suckling infants, bowing elders, and grazing beasts, the punishment would have been poured upon you in torrents." If the People of the Covenant also come out, distinguished, they are not prevented. When they gather at the prayer ground connected to the desert, the call "as-salatu jami'ah" is proclaimed. The Imam then leads them in two rak'ahs like the Eid prayer but without the extra takbirs. Then he delivers two sermons, with a light sitting between them. Let seeking forgiveness constitute the majority of both sermons. During the middle of the second sermon, he should turn his back to the people and face the Qiblah, and turn his cloak inside out at that moment, as an optimistic sign for the changing of the state. Thus did the Messenger of Allah do: he made its top its bottom, and what was on the right to the left, and what was on the left to the right. The people do likewise and supplicate secretly at this time. Then he faces them again and concludes the sermon. They leave their cloaks turned as they are until they remove them whenever they remove their garments. And he says in the supplication: "O Allah, You commanded us to call upon You and promised us Your response. We have called upon You as You commanded us, so answer us as You promised us. O Allah, bestow upon us forgiveness for what we have committed, and Your response in watering us and expanding our provisions." There is no harm in supplicating after the prayers during the three days before going out. This supplication has inner etiquettes and conditions, such as repentance and restoring wrongfully held property, among others. That will come in the Book of Supplications.

The third is the funeral prayer (Salat al-Janazah): Its procedure is well-known. The most comprehensive transmitted supplication is what is narrated in the Sahih from 'Awf ibn Malik, who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah pray over a funeral, and I memorized from his supplication: "O Allah, forgive him, have mercy on him, grant him well-being and pardon him, honor his lodging, widen his entrance, wash him with water, snow, and hail, and cleanse him of sins as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. Replace for him a home better than his home, a family better than his family, and a spouse better than his spouse. Admit him into Paradise and protect him from the punishment of the grave and from the punishment of the Fire." 'Awf said: I wished I were that deceased person. Whoever catches the second takbir should observe the order of the prayer within himself and say the takbirs along with the Imam's takbirs. When the Imam gives the salutation, he makes up the takbir he missed, like one who has joined late. For if he hurried the takbirs, the meaning of following the Imam in this prayer would be lost, as the takbirs are the apparent pillars, and it is fitting that they take the place of the rak'ahs in other prayers. This is the most correct view in my opinion, although other views are possible. The narrations concerning the virtue of the funeral prayer and accompanying the funeral procession are well-known, so we will not prolong by citing them. How could its virtue not be great, when it is one of the communal obligations (fard kifayah)? It only becomes a supererogatory act for one upon whom it is not incumbent due to the presence of others. Yet he attains by it the virtue of a communal obligation even if it was not personally incumbent, because they collectively fulfilled what is a communal obligation and removed the burden from others. Thus, it is not like a supererogatory act that does not remove an obligation from anyone. It is recommended to seek a large gathering, seeking blessing through the multitude of intentions and supplications, and its inclusion of one whose supplication is answered. As narrated by Kuraib from Ibn 'Abbas: His son died and he said, "O Kuraib, see how many people have gathered for him." I went out and saw that people had gathered for him, so I informed him. He said, "Do you say they are forty?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Take him out, for I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'There is no Muslim man who dies and forty men who associate nothing with Allah stand for his funeral prayer, except that Allah the Exalted grants them intercession for him.'" And when accompanying the funeral and reaching the graves or entering them initially, one says: "Peace be upon you, O inhabitants of these dwellings, from among the believers and the Muslims. And may Allah have mercy on those of us who have gone ahead."

And those who are behind, and indeed, if Allah wills, we will join you. It is preferable not to depart until the deceased is buried. When the grave is leveled over the deceased, one should stand over it and say: O Allah, Your servant has been returned to You, so be gentle with him and have mercy on him. O Allah, let the earth be spacious around his sides, open the gates of the heavens for his spirit, and accept him from You with a good word. O Allah, if he was a doer of good, then multiply his reward for his good deeds, and if he was a wrongdoer, then overlook it for him. Fourth: The greeting of the mosque: two rak'ahs or more are a confirmed Sunnah, to the extent that they are not omitted even if the Imam is delivering the sermon on Friday, despite the emphasis on the obligation of listening to the preacher. If one is occupied with an obligatory prayer or making up a missed prayer, the greeting is fulfilled and the virtue is attained, for the purpose is that one's initial entry should not be devoid of a specific act of worship for the mosque, fulfilling the right of the mosque. For this reason, it is disliked to enter the mosque without ablution. If one enters for passage or to sit, then let him say: Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest. He should say it four times; it is said that it equals two rak'ahs in virtue. The school of Imam al-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, holds that the greeting prayer is not disliked during the disliked times, which are after 'Asr, after Fajr, at noon, and at sunrise and sunset, due to what was narrated (that he ﷺ prayed two rak'ahs after 'Asr, and it was said to him: Did you not forbid us from this? He said: These are two rak'ahs I used to pray after Dhuhr, but the delegation distracted me from them). This hadith yields two benefits: One is that the dislike is restricted to a prayer that has no cause, and among the weakest causes is making up voluntary prayers, for scholars have differed regarding whether voluntary prayers are made up, and if one does what he missed, is it considered making up? If the dislike is removed by the weakest of causes, then it is all the more removed by entering the mosque, which is a strong cause. Therefore, the funeral prayer is not disliked if it occurs, nor the eclipse prayer or the prayer for rain during these times, because they have causes. The second benefit: making up voluntary prayers, for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ made them up, and we have a good example in him. 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: (If sleep or illness overcame the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and he did not pray that night, he would pray twelve rak'ahs at the beginning of the day). Scholars have said: Whoever is in prayer and misses responding to the call to prayer, then when he finishes, he should make up and respond, even if the caller has fallen silent. There is no meaning now to the saying of those who say that this is like the first and is not made up, for if that were the case, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would not have prayed it during a disliked time. Indeed, whoever has a regular practice and an excuse prevents him from it, he should not permit himself to abandon it, but rather make it up at another time, so that his soul does not incline towards ease and comfort. Making it up is good as a way of striving against the soul, and because he ﷺ said: (The most beloved deeds to Allah the Exalted are the most consistent, even if little). The intention is that one should not slacken in the continuity of his work. 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: (Whoever worships Allah the Almighty with an act of worship then abandons it out of weariness, Allah the Almighty detests him). So let him beware of falling under the threat. The realization of this report is that Allah the Exalted detests him for abandoning it out of weariness; were it not for the detestation and distancing, weariness would not have been empowered over him. Fifth: Two rak'ahs after ablution are recommended, because ablution is an act of devotion and its purpose is prayer, and impurities occur incidentally; perhaps impurity occurs before prayer, nullifying the ablution and wasting the effort. Therefore, hastening to two rak'ahs achieves the purpose of ablution before it is missed, and this is known from the hadith of Bilal, when he ﷺ said: (I entered Paradise and saw Bilal in it, so I said to Bilal: By what did you precede me to Paradise? Bilal said: I do not know of anything except that I do not perform ablution without praying two rak'ahs afterward). Sixth: Two rak'ahs upon entering the home and upon leaving it. Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (When you leave your home, pray two rak'ahs; they will protect you from an evil exit. And when you enter your home, pray two rak'ahs; they will protect you from an evil entrance). In the meaning of this is every matter that one begins that has significance. Therefore, two rak'ahs have been reported upon entering the state of Ihram, two rak'ahs at the beginning of a journey, two rak'ahs upon returning from a journey in the mosque before entering the house. All of that is transmitted from the action of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Some of the righteous, when they ate a meal, would pray two rak'ahs, and when they drank a drink, they would pray two rak'ahs. Likewise, in every matter he initiates and the beginnings of affairs, one should seek blessing in them by remembering Allah the Almighty. They are of three levels: some are repeated frequently, like eating and drinking, so one begins with: In the name of Allah the Almighty. And he ﷺ said: (Every significant matter that is not begun with 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful' is cut off). The second: what is not frequently repeated and has significance, like concluding marriage, beginning advice, and consultation. What is recommended in them...

That he should commence with praise of God, so the one giving in marriage says: "Praise be to God and blessings upon the Messenger of God, I have married you my daughter." And the one accepting says: "Praise be to God and blessings upon the Messenger of God, I have accepted the marriage." It was the custom of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, when beginning to deliver a message, offer advice, or give counsel, to preface it with praise. The third: That which does not occur frequently, and when it does occur, it endures and has a significant impact, such as travel, purchasing a new home, entering the state of consecration (for Hajj or Umrah), and what is similar to it. It is recommended to precede it with two units of prayer, and the least of it is leaving the house and entering it, for it is a type of short journey. The seventh: The prayer of seeking guidance (Istikharah). For whoever intends a matter and does not know its outcome, nor knows whether the good lies in abandoning it or proceeding with it, the Messenger of God has commanded him to pray two units of prayer, reciting in the first unit the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) and "Say, 'O disbelievers...'" (Surah Al-Kafirun), and in the second unit the Opening and "Say, 'He is God, the One...'" (Surah Al-Ikhlas). Then, when he finishes, he should supplicate and say: "O God, I seek Your guidance through Your knowledge, and I seek ability through Your power, and I ask You from Your immense bounty, for You have power and I have none, and You know and I know not, and You are the Knower of the unseen. O God, if You know that this matter is good for me in my religion, my worldly life, and the outcome of my affair—its immediate and its future—then decree it for me, bless it for me, and make it easy for me. And if You know that this matter is evil for me in my religion, my worldly life, and the outcome of my affair—its immediate and its future—then turn me away from it and turn it away from me, and decree for me the good wherever it may be, for indeed You have power over all things." [Reported by Jabir ibn Abdullah, who said: "The Messenger of God used to teach us the prayer of seeking guidance in all matters, as he would teach us a chapter of the Quran." And he said: "When one of you intends a matter, let him pray two units of prayer, then name the matter and supplicate with what we have mentioned."] Some of the wise have said: "Whoever is granted four things is not denied four: whoever is granted gratitude is not denied increase; whoever is granted repentance is not denied acceptance; whoever is granted seeking guidance is not denied the best choice; and whoever is granted consultation is not denied correctness." The eighth: The prayer of need. For whoever is in a difficult situation and is afflicted by a need concerning the rectification of his religion or worldly life regarding a matter that has become difficult for him, let him pray this prayer. It has been reported from Wahb ibn al-Ward that he said: "Among the supplications that is not rejected is that a servant prays twelve units of prayer, reciting in each unit the Mother of the Book (Al-Fatihah), the Verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi), and 'Say, 'He is God, the One...'" (Surah Al-Ikhlas). Then, when he finishes, he prostrates and says: 'Glory be to the One who is clothed in might and has said it; Glory be to the One who is adorned with majesty and honored by it; Glory be to the One who has enumerated all things by His knowledge; Glory be to the One to whom glorification is due alone; Glory be to the Possessor of bounty and grace; Glory be to the Possessor of might and generosity; Glory be to the Possessor of abundance. I ask You by the bonds of might from Your Throne, and the ultimate mercy from Your Book, and by Your Greatest Name and Your Most High Majesty, and Your perfect, all-encompassing words which no righteous or wicked one can surpass, that You send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad.' Then he asks for his need, provided it does not involve disobedience, and he will be answered, if God the Almighty wills." Wahb said: "It reached us that it was said: 'Do not teach it to your foolish ones, lest they use it to cooperate in disobedience to God Almighty.'" The ninth: The prayer of glorification (Tasbih). This prayer is authentically transmitted in a certain form. It is not restricted to a specific time or reason, and it is recommended that one not let a week pass without performing it once, or a month once. It has been reported from Ikrimah, from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, that the Prophet said to al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib: "Shall I not give you, shall I not grant you, shall I not endear you to something which, if you do it, God will forgive your sin—its first and its last, its old and its new, its mistake and its deliberate, its secret and its public? You pray four units of prayer, reciting in each unit the Opening of the Book and a surah. Then, when you finish the recitation in the first unit while standing, you say: 'Glory be to God, praise be to God, there is no god but God, God is the Greatest' fifteen times. Then you bow and say it while bowing ten times. Then you rise from the bowing and say it while standing ten times. Then you prostrate and say it ten times. Then you rise from the prostration and say it while sitting ten times. Then you prostrate and say it while prostrating ten times. Then you rise from the prostration and say it ten times. That is seventy-five in each unit. You do that in four units. If you are able to pray it once every day, then do so. If you cannot, then once every week. If you cannot, then once every month. If you cannot, then once a year." In another narration: He says at the beginning of the prayer: "Glory be to You, O God, and praise; blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty; hallowed are Your names, and there is no god other than You." Then he glorifies fifteen glorifications before the recitation and ten after the recitation, and the remainder as previously mentioned, ten by ten, and he does not glorify after the final prostration while sitting. This is the best and is the choice of Ibn al-Mubarak. The total from the two narrations is three hundred glorifications. If he prays it during the day, then with one salutation (Taslim); and if he prays it at night...

And two cycles are better, as it has been reported: "The night prayer is offered two by two." And if one adds after the glorification the saying, "There is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great," it is good, for that has been reported in some narrations. These are the transmitted prayers. And none of these supererogatory prayers is recommended during the disliked times, except for the greeting of the mosque and what we have mentioned after the greeting: the two cycles of ablution, the prayer of travel, the prayer upon leaving the home, and the prayer for seeking guidance. This is because the prohibition is emphatic, and these reasons are weak, not reaching the level of the eclipse prayer, the prayer for rain, and the greeting. I have seen some Sufis pray the two cycles of ablution during the disliked times, and this is extremely far-fetched, for ablution is not a cause for prayer; rather, prayer is the cause for ablution. One should perform ablution in order to pray, not pray because he performed ablution. And anyone in a state of minor impurity who wishes to pray during a disliked time has no way except to perform ablution and pray, so the dislike loses its meaning. And one should not intend the two cycles of ablution as one intends the two cycles of the greeting. Rather, if he performs ablution, he prays two cycles voluntarily, so that his ablution is not left unused, as Bilal used to do. It is a pure voluntary prayer that occurs after ablution. The hadith of Bilal does not indicate that ablution is a cause like the eclipse or the greeting, such that one should intend the two cycles of ablution. It is impossible to intend the ablution for the prayer; rather, one should intend the prayer for the ablution. How can it be consistent that he says during his ablution, "I perform ablution for my prayer," and in his prayer he says, "I pray for my ablution"? Rather, whoever wishes to guard his ablution from being left unused during a disliked time, let him intend a makeup prayer if it is permissible that there be upon him a prayer that has been impaired due to some reason, for making up prayers during disliked times is not disliked. As for the hope for voluntary prayer, there is no basis for it. In the prohibition regarding the disliked times, there are three important matters: The first is to avoid resembling sun worshippers. The second is to guard against the dispersal of devils, for He (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, the sun rises with a devil at its side. When it rises, he accompanies it; when it ascends, he leaves it; when it reaches its zenith, he accompanies it; when it declines, he leaves it; when it inclines towards setting, he accompanies it; and when it sets, he leaves it." And he prohibited prayers at these times, indicating thereby the reason. The third is that the travelers on the path of the Hereafter are constantly persevering in prayers at all times, and perseverance in a single pattern of worship breeds weariness. Whenever they are prevented from it for an hour, their zeal increases and their motives are stirred, for man is eager for what he is forbidden. In suspending these times, there is increased incentive and impetus to await the passing of the time. Therefore, these times are designated for glorification and seeking forgiveness, as a precaution against weariness from continuous practice and as a relief by shifting from one type of worship to another. For in novelty and renewal there is delight and vigor, and in persistence on one thing there is burdensomeness and tedium. For this reason, the prayer is not mere prostration alone, nor bowing alone, nor standing alone; rather, the acts of worship are arranged from different actions and diverse remembrances, for the heart perceives from each of them a new delight upon transitioning to it. If one were to persist in one thing alone, weariness would hasten to it. Since these are important matters in the prohibition against engaging in the disliked times, besides other secrets not within human capacity to comprehend—and Allah and His Messenger know best—these important matters are not set aside except for important reasons in the Sacred Law, such as making up prayers, the prayer for rain, the eclipse prayer, and the greeting of the mosque. As for what is weaker than these, it should not clash with the objective of the prohibition. This is the most correct view according to us, and Allah knows best.

Here ends the Book of the Secrets of Prayer from the book *The Revival of the Religious Sciences*. It will be followed, if Allah wills, by the Book of the Secrets of Zakat, by the praise of Allah and His help and His gracious facilitation. And praise be to Allah alone, and His blessings upon the best of His creation, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions, granting them abundant peace.

[5] The hadith concerning the five prayers that God has prescribed for His servants was narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban from the narration of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr authenticated it.
[6] The hadith comparing the five prayers to a river was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Jabir, and a similar version exists from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.
[7] The hadith stating that the prayers are an expiation for what occurs between them, so long as major sins are avoided, was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.
[8] The hadith stating that what distinguishes us from the hypocrites is attendance at the 'Isha' and Fajr prayers was narrated by Malik from the report of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab as a *mursal* narration.
[9] The hadith stating that whoever meets God having neglected the prayer, God will not care for any of his good deeds. In a similar vein is the hadith: The first thing the servant will be called to account for is the prayer, and if it is corrupt, all his other deeds will be corrupt. This was narrated by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Anas.
[10] The hadith stating that prayer is the pillar of the religion was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* with a chain he deemed weak, from the narration of 'Umar. Al-Hakim said: 'Ikrimah did not hear it from 'Umar. He also said: Ibn 'Umar narrated it, but Ibn al-Salah did not find it established, stating in *Mushkil al-Wasit* that it is not known.
[11] The hadith: He was asked which deed is best, and he said: Prayer at its appointed times. It is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.
[12] The hadith: Whoever is diligent in performing the five prayers, perfecting their purification and their times, they will be a light and a proof for him. This was narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Hibban from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.
[13] The hadith: The keys to Paradise are prayer. It was narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tayalisi from the narration of Jabir, and it is found in al-Tirmidhi, but it is not included in the narration.
[14] The hadith: After the declaration of God's oneness, God has not prescribed anything for His creation more beloved to Him than prayer. I have not found it exactly like this. The end of the hadith is found in al-Tabarani from the narration of Jabir, and in al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.
[15] The hadith: Whoever intentionally abandons the prayer has disbelieved. It was narrated by al-Bazzar from the narration of Abu al-Darda' with a chain containing criticism.
[16] The hadith: Whoever intentionally abandons the prayer has absolved himself from the covenant of Muhammad (peace be upon him). It was narrated by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Umm Ayman in a similar form, and its narrators are trustworthy.
[17] The hadith: The first thing God will look at on the Day of Resurrection from a servant's deeds is the prayer. We have narrated it in *al-Tuyuriyyat* from the narration of Abu Sa'id with a weak chain. The compilers of the *Sunan* and al-Hakim have a similar version from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, which he authenticated its chain, and it will come later.
[18] The hadith: O Abu Hurayrah, instruct your family to pray, for God will bring you provision from where you do not expect. I have not found a source for it.
[19] The hadith comparing the prescribed prayer to a scale: whoever gives full measure receives it in full. It was narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak in *al-Zuhd* from the narration of al-Hasan as a *mursal* report. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in *al-Shu'ab* with a chain from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas containing an unknown narrator.
[20] The hadith of Yazid al-Raqqashi: The prayer of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was balanced as if it were weighed. It was narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak in *al-Zuhd*, and from his route by Abu al-Walid al-Saffar in *Kitab al-Salah*. It is a weak *mursal* report.
[21] The hadith: Verily, two men from my community may stand for prayer, and their bowing and prostration are one. It was narrated by Ibn al-Mujabbar in *al-'Aql* from the narration of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari in a similar form, and it is fabricated. Al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah narrated it in his *Musnad* from Ibn al-Mujabbar.
[22] The hadith: God does not look at a servant who does not straighten his back between his bowing and his prostration. It was narrated by Ahmad from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain.
[23] The hadith: Does he not fear, the one who turns his face away during prayer, that God will turn his face into the face of a donkey? Ibn 'Adi narrated it in *'Awali Mashayikh Misr* from the narration of Jabir: "Does he not fear, if he turns away during his prayer, that God Almighty will turn his face into the face of a dog or the face of a pig?" He said: It is rejected with this chain.

In the two authentic collections, from the narration of Abu Hurairah: Does not the one who raises his head before the Imam fear that Allah will make his face the face of a donkey?

[24] The narration: "Whoever performs the prayer at its time, perfects its ablution, completes its bowing and prostration, and observes its humility, it is presented [to Allah] shining white, saying, 'May Allah preserve you as you have preserved me.'" This narration was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of Anas with a weak chain, and by al-Tayalisi and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit with a similar weak chain.

[25] The narration: "The worst thief among people is he who steals from his prayer." Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from the narration of Abu Qatadah.

[26] The narration: "The prayer in congregation surpasses the prayer of the individual by twenty-seven degrees." Agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[27] The narration of Abu Hurairah: "I was about to command a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would go to men who stay behind from it." Agreed upon.

[28] The narration of 'Uthman: "Whoever attends the 'Isha' prayer, it is as if he stood [in prayer] for half the night." Reported by Muslim from his narration as *marfu'* (attributed to the Prophet). Al-Tirmidhi said it is also narrated from 'Uthman as *mawquf* (attributed to a Companion).

[29] The narration: "Whoever prays a prayer in congregation has filled his throat with worship." I did not find it as *marfu'*; rather, it is a statement of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, reported by Muhammad ibn Nasr in *Kitab al-Salah*.

[30] The narration: "Whoever prays the prayers in congregation for forty days without missing the opening *takbir*..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Anas with a chain whose narrators are trustworthy.

[31] The narration: "The servant draws near to Allah with nothing more excellent than a hidden prostration." Reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in *al-Zuhd* from the narration of Damrah ibn Habib as *mursal*.

[32] The narration: "There is no Muslim who prostrates to Allah a prostration except that Allah raises him a degree and removes from him a sin." Reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit with a sound chain, and Muslim has a similar narration from Thawban and Abu al-Darda'.

[33] The narration: "A man said to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, 'Supplicate to Allah to make me among those granted your intercession and to grant me your companionship in Paradise.'" Reported by Muslim from the narration of Rabi'ah ibn Ka'b al-Aslami, and it was he who asked him that.

[34] The narration: "The closest a servant is to his Lord is when he is prostrating." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah.

[35] The narration: "When the son of Adam recites the verse of prostration and prostrates, Satan withdraws weeping." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah.

[36] The narration: "Whoever prays two units of prayer without conversing with himself about anything worldly, his previous sins are forgiven." Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah in *al-Musannaf* from the narration of Sillah ibn Ashim as *mursal*. It is in the two authentic collections from the narration of 'Uthman with an addition at the beginning, but without the phrase "about anything worldly." Al-Tayalisi added, "except for good."

[37] The narration: "Prayer is but humility, supplication, and entreaty." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i in a similar form from the narration of al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas with a problematic chain.

[38] The narration: "Prayer was prescribed, and the command for Hajj, Tawaf, and the rites were instituted, for the establishment of the remembrance of Allah." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from a similar narration of 'A'ishah, but without mention of prayer. Al-Tirmidhi said: *hasan sahih*.

[39] The narration: "When you pray, pray the prayer of one bidding farewell." Reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Ayyub, and by al-Hakim from the narration of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, who said its chain is sound, and by al-Bayhaqi in *al-Zuhd* from the narration of Ibn 'Umar and others.

[40] The narration: "Whoever is not prevented by his prayer from indecency and evil, increases nothing from Allah except distance." Reported by 'Ali ibn Mu'abbad in *Kitab al-Ta'ah wa al-Ma'siyah* from the narration of al-Hasan as *mursal* with a sound chain. Al-Tabarani reported it, and Ibn Mardawayh in his *Tafsir* attributed it to Ibn 'Abbas with a weak (*layyin*) chain.

And al-Tabarani reports from the saying of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whoever is not commanded by his prayer to do good and forbidden from evil..." The hadith and its chain are sound.

[41] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would converse with us and we with him, but when the time for prayer arrived, it was as if he did not know us, nor we him." Reported by al-Azdi in *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of Suwayd ibn Ghaflah, as a *mursal* report: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, when he heard the call to prayer, it was as if he did not recognize anyone among the people."

[42] The hadith: "God does not look at a prayer in which a man does not bring his heart together with his body." I have not found it with this wording. Muhammad ibn Nasr reported in *Kitab al-Salah* from the narration of 'Uthman ibn Dahhash, as a *mursal* report: "God does not accept from a servant any deed until he brings his heart together with his body." And Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b, and its chain is weak.

[43] The hadith: "He saw a man fidgeting with his beard in prayer and said, 'If the heart of this one were humble, his limbs would be humble.'" Reported by al-Tirmidhi al-Hakim in *al-Nawadir* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain, that it is from the saying of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported it in *al-Musannaf*, and in it is a man who is not named.

[44] The hadith: "Whoever builds a mosque for God, even if it be like the nest of a sandgrouse..." Reported by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Jabir with a sound chain, and by Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Abu Dharr, and it is agreed upon from the hadith of 'Uthman, except for his saying "even if it be like the nest of a sandgrouse."

[45] The hadith: "Whoever frequents the mosque, God the Exalted will frequent him." Reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with a weak chain.

[46] The hadith: "When one of you enters the mosque, let him perform two rak'ahs before he sits." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Qatadah.

[47] The hadith: "There is no prayer for the neighbor of the mosque except in the mosque." Reported by al-Daraqutni from the hadith of Jabir and Abu Hurayrah with two weak chains, and by al-Hakim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[48] The hadith: "The angels pray upon one of you as long as he remains in his place of prayer..." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[49] The hadith: "There will come at the end of time people from my community who will come to the mosques and sit in them in circles; their talk will be of the world..." Reported by Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, and by al-Hakim from the hadith of Anas, and he said its chain is sound.

[50] The hadith: "God the Exalted said: 'Verily, My houses on My earth are the mosques, and their visitors are those who maintain them...'" Reported by Abu Nu'aym from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with a weak chain: "God, Mighty and Majestic, will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where are My neighbors?' The angels will say, 'Who is this who deserves to be Your neighbor?' He will say, 'Where are the reciters of the Qur'an and the maintainers of the mosques?'" And it is in *al-Shu'ab* similarly, as a statement attributed to the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, with a sound chain. Ibn Hibban attributed the end of the hadith in *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of Salman, and he considered it weak.

[51] The hadith: "If you see a man regularly attending the mosque, then bear witness to his faith." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and he graded it as *hasan*, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Sa'id.

[52] The hadith: "Conversation in the mosque consumes good deeds just as livestock consumes grass." I have not found a source for it.

[53] The hadith: "The prohibition of *safn* and *safd* in prayer." Ruzayn attributed it to al-Tirmidhi, but I did not find it with him nor with others. Rather, it was mentioned by the scholars of rare terms like Ibn al-Athir in *al-Nihayah*. Sa'id ibn Mansur reported that Ibn Mas'ud saw a man with his feet spread apart or joined and said, "This one has erred from the Sunnah."

[54] The hadith: "Raising the hands to the level of the shoulders," and "to the earlobes," and "to the tops of the ears." Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with the first wording; Abu Dawud reported from the hadith of Wa'il ibn Hujr with a weak chain "to the earlobes"; and Muslim reported from the hadith of Malik ibn al-Huwayrith "to the tops of his ears."

[55] The hadith: "Spreading the fingers at the opening [of prayer]," and it is also transmitted "closing them together." And 'Ata' and Ibn Khuzaymah reported from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and al-Bayhaqi: "He did not separate his fingers nor did he close them together." And I did not find an explicit statement about closing the fingers together.

[56] The hadith: "The *takbir* along with raising the hands." Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "He would raise..."

[57] The narration regarding raising the hands with the *takbir* (saying 'Allahu Akbar'), meaning while they are raised, was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "When he stood for prayer, he would raise his hands until they were level with his shoulders, then he would say the *takbir*." Abu Dawud added: "while they were like that."

[58] The narration regarding the *takbir* with the releasing of the hands was reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Abu Humayd: "When he stood for prayer, he would raise his hands until they were level with his shoulders, then he would say the *takbir* until every bone settled in its place, balanced." Ibn al-Salah said in *al-Mushkil*: "The word 'until,' which denotes a limit, indicates by implication what was mentioned," i.e., the beginning of the *takbir* with the releasing [of the hands].

[59] The narration: "When he said the *takbir*, he would release his hands, and when he intended to recite, he would place his right hand over his left," was reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Mu'adh with a weak chain.

[60] The narration that he would say after saying 'Allahu Akbar': "Allahu Akbar kabira, wal-hamdu lillahi kathira, wa subhanallahi bukratan wa asila," was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, who said: "While we were praying with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), a man among the people said: 'Allahu Akbar kabira...' the hadith." It was also reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the narration of Jubayr ibn Mut'im that he saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) praying a prayer and saying: "Allahu Akbar kabira...' the hadith.

[61] The narration of the opening supplication: "Wajjahtu wajhiya..." was reported by Muslim from the narration of 'Ali.

[62] The narration: "Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika..." as an opening supplication was also reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the narration of 'A'ishah, though al-Tirmidhi and al-Daraqutni considered it weak. Muslim reported it as a statement of 'Umar (*mawquf*). Al-Bayhaqi reported from the narration of Jabir combining "Wajjahtu" with "Subhanaka Allahumma."

[63] The narration of the *qunut* in the dawn prayer with the transmitted words was reported by al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) would perform the *qunut* in the dawn prayer and in the *witr* of the night with these words: 'Allahumma ihdini fi man hadayta...' the hadith." It was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan* (good), and al-Nasa'i from the narration of al-Hasan that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would teach him these words to say in the *witr*, and its chain is sound.

[64] The narration prohibiting spreading one's forearms on the ground as a dog spreads them is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from the narration of Anas.

[65] The transmitted supplication after the *tashahhud* was reported by Muslim from the narration of 'Ali in the opening supplication: "Then, among the last things he would say between the *tashahhud* and the *taslim* (salutation) was: 'Allahumma ighfir li ma qaddamtu...' the hadith." In the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of 'A'ishah: "When one of you recites the *tashahhud*, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things: from the punishment of Hell...' the hadith. There are other narrations on the topic, all of which are in the original source.

[66] The narration that making the salutation (*salam*) definitive is a *sunnah* was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he (al-Tirmidhi) said it is *hasan sahih* (good and sound), though Ibn al-Qattan considered it weak.

[67] The narration prohibiting *iq'a'* (sitting on the heels with the buttocks on the ground) was reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of 'Ali with a weak chain: "Do not perform *iq'a'* between the two prostrations." Muslim reported from the narration of 'A'ishah: "He would prohibit the sitting posture of Satan." Al-Hakim reported from the narration of Samurah and authenticated it: "He prohibited *iq'a'*."

[68] The narration prohibiting *sadl* (letting one's garment hang down) in prayer was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[69] The narration prohibiting *kaft* (gathering or holding back) in prayer is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) commanded us to prostrate on seven bones and not to gather our hair or garment (*la nakftu sha'ran wa la thawban*)."

[70] The narration prohibiting *ikhtisar* (shortening, i.e., placing hands on hips) was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it is agreed upon with the wording: "He prohibited a man from praying while *mukhtasiran* (shortening/placing hands on hips)."

[71] The narration prohibiting *salb* (crossing arms over the chest?) in prayer was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain.

[72] The narration prohibiting *mawasalah* (continuous connection) was attributed by Razin to al-Tirmidhi, but I did not find it in his collection. Al-Ghazali explained it as connecting the recitation to the *takbir*, or connecting the recitation to the bowing, and so on. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan* (good), and Ibn Majah reported from the narration of Samurah: "Two pauses which I memorized from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)..."

When one enters into prayer, after completing the recitation, and upon finishing the recitation of the Qur’an—and in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “He would pause between the takbir and the recitation, a pause…” [73] The hadith prohibiting prayer while needing to relieve oneself is reported by Ibn Majah and al-Daraqutni from the hadith of Abu Umamah: “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade a man to pray while he is restraining (urine or stool).” And Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “It is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to pray while he is restraining.” A similar version, which al-Tirmidhi graded as hasan, is from the hadith of Thawban, and Muslim from the hadith of ‘A’ishah: “There is no prayer when food is present, nor while one is resisting the two impurities.” [74] The hadith prohibiting prayer while restraining feces—I did not find it with this exact wording, and the author explained it, following al-Azhari, as resisting the call of nature; the hadith of ‘A’ishah mentioned before is relevant here. [75] The hadith prohibiting prayer while wearing tight shoes is attributed by Razin to al-Tirmidhi, but I did not find it there. What the lexicographers mention is the hadith: “There is no sound opinion from one wearing tight shoes,” referring to one with tight footwear. [76] The hadith prohibiting covering the mouth in prayer is reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a hasan chain: “He forbade a man to cover his mouth in prayer.” Al-Hakim reported and authenticated it, and al-Khattabi said it refers to veiling the mouth. [77] The hadith: “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones, and not to tuck up the hair or garment,” is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas. [78] The hadith: “When dinner is served and the prayer is called, begin with dinner,” is agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar and ‘A’ishah. [79] The hadith: “Let none of you enter prayer while frowning, nor pray while angry”—I did not find it. [80] The hadith: “Seven things in prayer are from Satan: nosebleed, drowsiness, whispering, yawning, turning the head,” and some added “forgetfulness and doubt.” Al-Tirmidhi reported it from the narration of ‘Adi ibn Thabit from his father from his grandfather, mentioning among them nosebleed, drowsiness, and yawning, adding three others, and said it is a gharib hadith. Muslim has from the hadith of ‘Uthman ibn Abi al-‘As: “O Messenger of Allah, Satan has come between me and my prayer…” Al-Bukhari has from the hadith of ‘A’ishah regarding turning in prayer: “It is a snatching that Satan snatches from the prayer of one of you.” The two Shaykhs have from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “Yawning is from Satan.” And both have from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “When one of you stands to pray, Satan comes and confuses him in his prayer until he does not know how much he has prayed.” [81] The hadith prohibiting interlacing the fingers is reported by Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah; and Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban have a similar version from the hadith of Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujrah. [82] The hadith prohibiting cracking the fingers in prayer is reported by Ibn Majah from the hadith of ‘Ali with a weak chain: “Do not crack your fingers in prayer.” [83] The hadith prohibiting covering the face is reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. [84] The hadith prohibiting placing the hands on the waist during bowing is agreed upon from the hadith of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas: “We used to do it, then we were forbidden and commanded to place the hands on the knees.” [85] The hadith: “How many a person praying gains nothing from his prayer but fatigue and weariness,” is reported by al-Nasa’i from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “Many a person standing (in prayer) gains nothing from his standing but sleeplessness.” Ahmad has: “Many a person praying gains nothing from his prayer but sleeplessness,” and its chain is hasan. [86] The hadith: “A servant has from his prayer only what he is mindful of”—I did not find it as marfu‘ (attributed to the Prophet). Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi reported in his book on prayer from the narration of ‘Uthman ibn Abi Dahhash as mursal: “Allah does not accept from a servant any deed until his heart witnesses along with his body.” Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, and Ibn al-Mubarak in al-Zuhd as mawquf (attributed to a Companion) from ‘Ammar: “A man is not credited from his prayer for what he was heedless of.” [87] The hadith: “The one praying is conversing with his Lord,” is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas.

[88] The hadith: "Verily, a servant may pray a prayer, yet not even a sixth or a tenth of it is recorded for him." Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban narrated it from the narration of 'Ammar ibn Yasir in a similar manner.

[89] The hadith: "I forgot to tell you to cover the two water-skins in the house." Abu Dawud narrated it from the narration of 'Uthman al-Hajabi, who is 'Uthman ibn Talhah, as found in the Musnad of Ahmad. The author mistakenly attributed saying that to 'Uthman ibn Abi Shaybah, which is an error.

[90] The hadith about removing the *khumaysah* (a striped garment) and saying, "Bring me the *anbajaniyyah* (a coarse garment) of Abu Jahm," is agreed upon (muttafaq 'alayh) from the narration of 'A'ishah, and it has preceded in the chapter on Knowledge.

[91] The hadith about him ordering the removal of the new shoelace and returning the old, worn shoelace when he saw it during his prayer. Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in *al-Zuhd* from the narration of Abu al-Nadr as a *mursal* report with a sound chain.

[92] The hadith: "He wore sandals, and their beauty pleased him, so he prostrated and said, 'I have humbled myself before my Lord.'" Abu 'Abdullah Ibn Haqiq narrated it in *Sharaf al-Fuqara'* from the narration of 'A'ishah with a weak chain.

[93] The hadith about him throwing the gold ring from his hand and saying, "This distracted me; a glance at it and a glance at you." Al-Nasa'i narrated it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a sound chain, but it does not specify that the ring was gold or silver; it is general.

[94] The hadith: "Verily, Abu Talhah prayed in an orchard of his containing trees, and the feathers of a bird in the tree pleased him..." The hadith about his forgetfulness in prayer and his giving the orchard in charity. Malik narrated it from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr that Abu Talhah al-Ansari... and he mentioned it similarly.

[95] The hadith: "With it, give us rest, O Bilal." Al-Daraqutni narrated it in *al-'Ilal* from the narration of Bilal, and Abu Dawud has a similar version from the narration of an unnamed Companion with a sound chain.

[96] The hadith: "When a servant stands for his prayer, and his face and his desire are directed to God, he departs (from it) like the day his mother bore him." I have not found it.

[97] The hadith: Abu Hurairah said, "How is shyness before God?" He said, "You feel shy before Him as you feel shy before a righteous man from your people." Al-Khara'iti narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Sa'id ibn Zayd as a *mursal* report similarly. Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it as *mursal* with an addition of Ibn 'Umar in the chain. In *al-'Ilal*, al-Daraqutni mentioned it from Ibn 'Umar and said it is the most likely to be correct due to its transmission from Sa'id ibn Zayd, one of the Ten (Companions promised Paradise).

[98] The hadith: "God, Exalted is He, said: 'There is no god but God is My fortress.'" Al-Hakim narrated it in *al-Tarikh* and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* through the route of the People of the House from the narration of 'Ali with a very weak chain. The statement of Abu Mansur al-Daylami that it is an established hadith is rejected.

[99] The hadith: "The prayer is divided between Me and My servant into two halves..." Muslim narrated it from Abu Hurairah.

[100] The hadith: "It will be said to the companion of the Qur'an: 'Recite and ascend...'" Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i narrated it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, and al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan sahih*.

[101] The hadith: "Verily, God turns towards the person praying as long as he does not turn away (his attention)." Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim narrated it, and he authenticated its chain from Abu Dharr.

[102] The hadith: "O God, rectify the shepherd and the flock." I have not found a source for it. The author interpreted it as (referring to) the heart and the limbs.

[103] The hadith: "Verily, when a servant stands in prayer, God lifts the veil between Him and His servant..." I have not found it.

[104] The hadith: "Verily, 'Ammar ibn Yasir prayed and made it light (short). It was said to him, 'You made it light, O Abu al-Yaqzan?'..." In it is: "Verily, a servant may pray a prayer, and not even half or a third of it is recorded for him, to the end." Ahmad narrated it with a sound chain. The *marfu'* (attributed to the Prophet) narration from him has preceded, and it is found in Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i.

[105] The hadith about compensating for the deficiencies of the obligatory prayers with the supererogatory ones. The compilers of the *Sunan* and al-Hakim narrated it, and he authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Hurairah: "The first thing for which the servant will be held accountable on the Day of Resurrection from his deeds is his prayer..." In it: "If anything is lacking from his obligation, the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, will say, 'Look, does My servant have any voluntary prayers?' Then they will complete with them what is lacking from the obligation."

[106] God Almighty said: "My servant shall not be saved from Me except by fulfilling what I have made obligatory upon him, which I have not found him doing."

[107] He prayed a prayer and omitted a verse from its recitation. When he turned, he said, "What did I recite?" The people remained silent, so he asked Ubayy ibn Ka'b... The hadith is narrated by Muhammad ibn Nasr in "The Book of Prayer" as mursal, and by Abu Mansur al-Daylami from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b. Al-Nasa'i narrated it in an abbreviated form from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza with a sound chain.

[108] "Three [people] whose prayer does not rise above their heads: the runaway slave..." The hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Umamah, and he said it is hasan gharib. Al-Bayhaqi considered it weak.

[109] "The Imam is a guarantor, and the Mu'adhdhin is entrusted." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. It is related from Ibn al-Madini that he did not confirm it. Ahmad narrated it from the narration of Abu Umamah with a hasan chain.

[110] "The Imam is an amin (trustee). So when he bows, then you bow..." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "The Imam is an amin." This addition is found in the Musnad of al-Humayri. It is agreed upon from the narration of Anas without this addition.

[111] "If he performs it completely, the reward is for him and for them. But if he is deficient, the sin is upon him and not upon them." Reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir. Al-Bukhari reported from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "They pray with you. If they are correct, it is for you, and if they err, it is for you and against them."

[112] "O God, guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhins." This is the remainder of the hadith "The Imam is a guarantor" and it was mentioned two hadiths earlier.

[113] "Whoever gives the call to prayer in a mosque for seven years, Paradise becomes obligatory for him. And whoever gives the call for forty years enters Paradise without reckoning." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a similar first part. Al-Tirmidhi said: "A gharib hadith."

[114] "A single day under a just ruler is better than the worship of seventy years." Reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a hasan chain, with the wording "sixty."

[115] "Your Imams are your delegates to God Almighty. So if you wish for your prayer to be purified, then appoint the best among you." Reported by al-Daraqutni and al-Bayhaqi, who considered its chain weak, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. Al-Baghawi, Ibn Qani', and al-Tabarani in their compilations, and al-Hakim from the narration of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad with a similar meaning, but it is disconnected and contains Yahya ibn Yahya al-Aslami, who is weak.

[116] The Companions gave precedence to Abu Bakr, saying, "We have chosen for our worldly affairs the one whom the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, chose for our religion." Reported by Ibn Shahin in "Explanation of the Doctrine of Ahl al-Sunnah" from the narration of 'Ali, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, indeed commanded Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer, and I was present, not absent nor ill. So we were content for our worldly affairs with what the Prophet, peace be upon him, was content with for our religion." The marfu' part of it is agreed upon from the narrations of 'A'ishah and Abu Musa in a hadith where he said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer."

[117] The Companions gave precedence to Bilal... [The statement of al-'Iraqi: "The Companions giving precedence to Bilal – perhaps the appropriate thing is not to give him precedence, so let it be pondered."] Their argument was that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, approved of him for the call to prayer. As for the marfu' part, it is reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who authenticated it, Ibn Majah, Ibn Khuzaymah, and Ibn Hibban from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Zayd concerning the origin of the call to prayer, in which is: "Stand with Bilal and convey to him what you have seen, so that he may call to prayer with it..." As for their giving him precedence after the death of the Prophet, peace be upon him, al-Tabarani reported that Bilal came to Abu Bakr and said, "O Successor of the Messenger of God, I wish to devote myself in the path of God until I die." Abu Bakr said, "I adjure you by God, O Bilal, and by my sanctity and my right over you. My age has advanced, my strength has weakened, and my term has drawn near." So Bilal stayed with him. When Abu Bakr died, he came to 'Umar and said to him the same as he said to Abu Bakr, but he refused him. 'Umar said, "Then to whom, O Bilal?" He said, "To Sa'd, for he gave the call to prayer in Quba' during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." So 'Umar entrusted the call to prayer to Sa'd and 'Uqbah. In its chain there is an unknown narrator.

[118] A man said to him, "O Messenger of God, direct me to a deed by which I may enter Paradise." He said, "Be a Mu'adhdhin..." Reported by al-Bukhari in "al-Tarikh," al-'Uqayli in "al-Du'afa'," and al-Tabarani in...

[119] The hadith regarding the superiority of the beginning of the prayer time over its end is like the superiority of the Hereafter over this world. Abu Mansur al-Daylami recorded it in Musnad al-Firdaws from Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[120] The hadith: "Indeed, a servant may pray a prayer at the end of its time, and it is not considered missed..." Al-Daraqutni recorded it from Abu Hurayrah with a similar wording and a weak chain.

[121] The hadith: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was delayed one day for the Fajr prayer while on a journey, and he was delayed only for purification. So they put 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf forward... This is agreed upon (muttafaq 'alayh) from the hadith of al-Mughirah.

[122] The hadith: He was delayed for the Zuhr prayer, so they put Abu Bakr forward... This is agreed upon (muttafaq 'alayh) from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd.

[123] The hadith: "Appoint a mu'adhdhin who does not take a wage for his call to prayer." The authors of the Sunan and al-Hakim recorded it, and he authenticated it, from the hadith of 'Uthman ibn Abi al-'As al-Thaqafi.

[124] The hadith: The Prophet, peace be upon him, remembered being in a state of major ritual impurity during his prayer, so he appointed a successor, performed the major ablution, and then returned. Abu Dawud recorded it from the hadith of Abu Bakrah with a sound chain, but it does not mention appointing a successor; it only says, "Then he motioned to them to stay in their places." The act of appointing a successor is reported from the practice of 'Umar and 'Ali. In al-Bukhari, there is the appointment of a successor by 'Umar in the story of his stabbing.

[125] The hadith: "Let the mu'adhdhin pause between the adhan and the iqamah for as long as it takes for an eater to finish his food and one relieving himself to finish his need." Al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim recorded it from the hadith of Jabir: "O Bilal, make the interval between your adhan and your iqamah sufficient for an eater to finish his meal, a drinker to finish his drink, and one relieving himself when he enters to relieve himself." Al-Tirmidhi said its chain is unknown (majhul). Al-Hakim said there is nothing in its chain that is criticized except for 'Amr ibn Qa'id. I say: Rather, it contains 'Abd al-Mun'im al-Diyaji, whose hadith is rejected (munkar al-hadith), as stated by al-Bukhari and others.

[126] The hadith prohibiting suppressing the urge to relieve oneself. Muslim recorded it from the hadith of 'A'ishah with the wording, "The prayer..." And al-Bayhaqi has: "None of you should pray..."

[127] The hadith commanding to begin with the evening meal before the evening prayer. It was mentioned previously from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar and 'A'ishah: "When the evening meal is presented and the prayer is established, begin with the meal." This is agreed upon (muttafaq 'alayh).

[128] The hadith about reciting "In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful" aloud. Al-Daraqutni and al-Hakim recorded it, and he authenticated it, from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas.

[129] The hadith about not reciting it aloud. Muslim recorded it from the hadith of Anas: "I prayed behind the Prophet, peace be upon him, Abu Bakr, and 'Umar, and I did not hear any of them recite 'In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful'." And in al-Nasa'i: "He would recite 'In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful' aloud for it."

[130] The hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub and 'Imran ibn Husayn regarding the pauses of the Imam. Imam Ahmad recorded it from the hadith of Samurah, who said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had pauses in his prayer." And 'Imran said: "I have memorized them from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him." So they wrote to Ubayy ibn Ka'b about that, and he wrote back: "Samurah has indeed memorized it." I found it in an unsound copy of the Musnad. What is well-known is that 'Imran denied that from Samurah. This is in more than one place in the Musnad. Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban recorded it. Al-Tirmidhi recorded it, and 'Imran denied it and said, "We memorized one pause," and he said it is a hasan hadith. This ends the note. In Samurah's hadith, there are only two pauses, but there is a difference reported from him regarding the location of the second one. It is reported from him that it was after the Opening Chapter (al-Fatihah), and it is reported from him that it was after the surah. Al-Daraqutni has from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he weakened it: "Whoever prays an obligatory prayer with the Imam, let him recite the Opening Chapter of the Book during his pauses."

[131] The hadith: He recited part of Surah Yunus, and when he reached the mention of Musa and Pharaoh, he stopped and bowed. Muslim recorded it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn al-Sa'ib. And he said: "Surah al-Mu'minun," and he said: "Musa and Harun." Al-Bukhari alluded to it.

[132] The hadith: He recited in Fajr: "Say, 'We have believed in Allah...'" (the verse), and in the second rak'ah: "Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed..." Muslim recorded it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "He would recite in the two rak'ahs of Fajr: in the first of them, 'Say, "We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us..."' the verse which is in al-Baqarah, and in the last of them, 'We have believed...'"

We believe in God and bear witness that we are Muslims. Abu Dawud narrated from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: Say, "We believe in God and in what has been sent down to us" — the verse. And in the last rak'ah: "Our Lord, we have believed in what You have sent down" or "Indeed, We have sent you with the truth."

[133] Hadith: He heard Bilal reciting from here and from there, so he asked him about that. He said, "I mix good with good." He said, "You have done well." Abu Dawud narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain, similar.

[134] Hadith: His recitation in Maghrib was Surah Al-Mursalat, and it was the last prayer he prayed. Agreed upon from the hadith of Umm al-Fadl.

[135] Hadith: When one of you leads the people in prayer, let him make it light. The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[136] Hadith: Mu'adh led people in the 'Isha prayer and recited Surah Al-Baqarah, so a man left the prayer. The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of Jabir, and it does not mention "By the sky and the night comer," and it is found in Al-Bayhaqi.

[137] Hadith of Anas: I have not seen a prayer lighter than that of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in completeness. Agreed upon.

[138] Hadith of Anas: He prayed behind 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz and said, "I have not prayed behind anyone whose prayer more closely resembled the prayer of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, than this young man." The hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i with a good chain, but Ibn al-Qattan weakened it.

[139] Hadith: We used to glorify behind the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in bowing and prostration ten times. I did not find a basis for it in the preceding hadith, and in it: We glorified in his bowing ten glorifications and in his prostration ten glorifications.

[140] Hadith: The Companions would not hasten to prostrate until the forehead of the Prophet, peace be upon him, touched the ground. Agreed upon from the hadith of Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib.

[141] Hadith: Seeking refuge in the tashahhud from the punishment of Hell and the punishment of the grave. The hadith was previously mentioned, and Al-Ghazali added here: "And if You intend a trial for a people, then take us to You without being afflicted by trial." I did not find it restricted to the end of the prayer. And in Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "And if You intend a trial for Your servants, then take me to You without being afflicted by trial." Al-Hakim narrated something similar from the hadith of Thawban and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'A'ish and authenticated them. It will come later in the chapter on supplication.

[142] Hadith: Remaining seated after the salutation. Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Umm Salamah.

[143] Hadith: He would only sit for the duration of saying: "O God, You are Peace, and from You is peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

[144] Hadith: Raising the hands in the supplication (qunut). Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of Anas with a good chain in the story of the killing of the reciters: "And I indeed saw the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, every time he prayed the morning prayer, raising his hands supplicating against them."

[145] Hadith: God has made the Friday prayer obligatory upon you on this day of mine. Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of Jabir with a weak chain.

[146] Hadith: Whoever neglects the Friday prayer three times without an excuse, God will seal his heart. Ahmad narrated it with this wording, and the authors of the Sunan; and Al-Hakim narrated it and authenticated it from the hadith of Abu al-Ja'd al-Damri.

[147] Hadith: Whoever neglects the Friday prayer three times without an excuse has cast Islam behind his back. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in Al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas.

[148] Hadith: The people of the two Scriptures were given Friday, but they differed concerning it. The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, similar.

[149] Hadith of Anas: Gabriel came to me holding a white mirror and said, "This is Friday." The hadith was narrated by Al-Shafi'i in Al-Musnad, Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, and Ibn Mardawayh in the Tafsir with weak chains and differences.

[150] Hadith: The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[151] Hadith: Indeed, God has in every Friday six hundred thousand freed from the Fire. Ibn 'Adi and Ibn Hibban narrated it in Al-Du'afa' and in Al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Anas. Al-Daraqutni said in Al-'Ilal: The hadith is not established.

[152] Hadith of Anas: If Friday is safe, the days are safe. Ibn Hibban narrated it in Al-Du'afa' and Abu...

[153] The narration that Hellfire is stoked every day before noon when the sun reaches its zenith... except on Friday. Abu Dawud transmitted it from the narration of Abu Qatadah, and it was deemed weak due to a break in the chain.

[154] The narration: "Whoever dies on a Friday, Allah records for him the reward of a martyr and protects him from the trial of the grave." Abu Nu'aym transmitted it in *al-Hilyah* from the narration of Jabir. Az-Zandi narrated something similar in brief from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar and said it is *gharib* (rare) and its chain is not connected. I say: At-Tirmidhi al-Hakim connected it in *an-Nawadir*.

[155] The narration: "May Allah have mercy on one who goes early and makes an early effort, and who washes and performs the major ablution..." The compilers of the *Sunan*, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim transmitted it from the narration of Aws ibn Aws: "...who washes and performs the major ablution on Friday, and goes early and makes an early effort..." At-Tirmidhi graded it as *hasan* (good).

[156] The narration: "Performing the major ablution on Friday is obligatory for every adult." Muttafaqun 'alayh (agreed upon) from the narration of Abu Sa'id.

[157] The narration from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever among men and women attends the Friday prayer should perform the major ablution." Muttafaqun 'alayh (agreed upon), and this is the wording of Ibn Hibban.

[158] The narration: "Whoever among men and women witnesses the Friday prayer should perform the major ablution." Ibn Hibban and al-Bayhaqi transmitted it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[159] The narration: "'Umar said to 'Uthman when he entered while he was delivering the sermon, 'Is it this time?'..." up to his saying: "...and the ablution also, and you know that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to command the major ablution." Muttafaqun 'alayh (agreed upon) from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and al-Bukhari did not name 'Uthman.

[160] The narration: "Whoever performs ablution on Friday, then it is good and excellent." Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and at-Tirmidhi graded it as *hasan*; an-Nasa'i transmitted it from the narration of Samurah.

[161] The narration: "The best perfume for men is that whose scent is apparent and its color is hidden, and the best perfume for women is that whose color is apparent and its scent is hidden." Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and at-Tirmidhi graded it as *hasan*; an-Nasa'i transmitted it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[162] The narration of Wathilah ibn al-Asqa': "Allah and His angels send blessings upon those who wear turbans on Friday." At-Tabarani and 'Adi transmitted it and said it is *munkar* (rejected) from the narration of Abu ad-Darda', and I have not seen it from the narration of Wathilah.

[163] The narration: "Whoever goes to the Friday prayer in the first hour, it is as if he has sacrificed a camel..." Muttafaqun 'alayh (agreed upon) from the narrations of Abu Hurayrah and Anas, and in it is: "...and the pens have been lifted." This wording is found in al-Bayhaqi from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather.

[164] The narration: "Three things, if people knew what is in them, they would race like racing camels to attain them: the call to prayer, the first row, and going early to Friday prayer." Abu ash-Shaykh transmitted it in *Thawab al-A'mal* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Three things, if people knew what is in them, they would not take them except by drawing lots, out of eagerness for the good and blessing in them..." He said: "...and going early to Friday prayer." In the two *Sahih* collections from his narration: "If people knew what is in the call to prayer and the first row, then they would find no way but to draw lots for them, they would draw lots. And if they knew what is in going early, they would race to it."

[165] The narration: "When Friday comes, the angels sit at the doors of the mosque with sheets of silver and pens of gold..." Ibn Mardawayh transmitted it in *at-Tafsir* from the narration of 'Ali with a weak chain: "When Friday comes, Jibril descends and plants a banner at the Sacred Mosque, and all the angels proceed to the mosques where the Friday prayer is held. They plant their banners and flags at the door of the mosque, then they spread out scrolls of silver and pens of gold."

[166] The narration: "The angels inquire about a servant if he is late for his time on Friday, asking one another, 'What has so-and-so done?'" Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather with some addition and omission, with a *hasan* (good) chain. Know that the author mentioned this; if he did not intend by it a *marfu'* (elevated) narration, then it is not within our condition, and we only mentioned it out of precaution.

[167] The narration: "Whoever steps over people's necks on Friday, a bridge to Hellfire is made for him." At-Tirmidhi transmitted it and deemed it weak, and Ibn Majah transmitted it from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas.

[168] The narration from Ibn Jurayj, *mursal* (with a link missing after the Successor): "The Prophet, peace be upon him, while he was delivering the sermon, saw a man stepping over people's necks..."

The people's narrations, and among them is: "What prevented you from joining us in prayer today?" Reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in al-Raqa'iq.
[169] The narration: "What prevented you from praying with us?" He replied, "Did you not see me?" He said, "I saw you turning away and causing disturbance." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Busr, in an abridged form.
[170] The narration: "For one to stand for forty years is better for him than to pass in front of a praying person." Reported by al-Bazzar from the narration of Zayd ibn Khalid. And in the two Sahihs from the narration of Abu Juhaym: "To stand for forty." Abu al-Nadr said, "I do not know whether it is forty days, months, or years." Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "A hundred years."
[171] The narration: "For a man to be ashes scattered by the wind is better for him than to pass in front of a praying person." Reported by Abu Nu'aym in Tarikh Asbahan and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Tamhid, attributed as a statement (mawquf) to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, with the addition: "intentionally."
[172] The narration: "If the one passing in front of a praying person and the praying person himself knew what is upon them in that..." The narration was reported thus by Abu al-'Abbas Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Sarraj in his Musnad from the narration of Zayd ibn Khalid with a sound chain.
[173] The narration of Abu Sa'id: "Then let him repel him; if he refuses, then let him confront him, for he is but a devil." Agreed upon.

[177] The narration of Abu al-Darda': "Indeed, this nation is shown mercy and is looked upon among the nations. And when Allah looks upon a servant in prayer, He forgives him and those behind him among the people." I have not found it.
[178] The narration: "Whoever says to his companion while the Imam is delivering the sermon, 'Be quiet,' has engaged in idle talk, and whoever engages in idle talk has no Friday (prayer)." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i from Abu Hurayrah. Al-Tirmidhi narrated his statement: "And whoever engages in idle talk has no Friday (prayer)." Al-Tirmidhi said it is a hasan sahih hadith. It is in the two Sahihs with the wording: "If you say to your companion..." Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of 'Ali: "Whoever says 'Hush' has engaged in idle talk, and whoever engages in idle talk has no Friday (prayer)."
[179] The narration of Abu Dharr when he asked Ubayy while the Prophet (peace be upon him) was delivering the sermon, saying, "When was this surah revealed?" The narration is reported by al-Bayhaqi, and he said in al-Ma'rifah its chain is sound. Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b with a sound chain that the questioner was Abu al-Darda' and Abu Dharr. And in Ahmad's version from the narration of Abu al-Darda' that he asked Ubayy. And in Ibn Hibban from the narration of Jabir that the questioner was 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud. And in Abu Ya'la from the narration of Jabir, he said: Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas said to a man, "You have no Friday (prayer)." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, "Why, O Sa'd?" He said, "Because he was talking while you were delivering the sermon." He said, "Sa'd has spoken the truth."
[180] The narration of Ibn 'Umar regarding the two rak'ahs after the Friday prayer is agreed upon.
[181] The narration of Abu Hurayrah regarding the four rak'ahs after the Friday prayer: Reported by Muslim: "When one of you prays the Friday prayer, let him pray four rak'ahs after it."
[182] The narration of 'Ali and 'Abdullah regarding praying six rak'ahs after the Friday prayer: Reported by al-Bayhaqi as elevated (marfu') from 'Ali. And he has it as a statement (mawquf) from Ibn Mas'ud: four. And Abu Dawud from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "When he was in Makkah, he would pray six rak'ahs after the Friday prayer."
[183] The narration: "A time will come upon my nation when their talk in their mosques will be about their worldly affairs..." Reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of al-Hasan as mursal. Al-Hakim reported it with a chain from the narration of Anas and declared its chain sound.

[190] Hadith: "Indeed, for your Lord during the days of your time are breezes..." Reported by al-Hakim in *al-Nawadir* and al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Muhammad ibn Maslamah. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr has something similar in *al-Tamhid* from the narration of Anas. Ibn Abi al-Dunya also reported it in *Kitab al-Faraj* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and its chain is disputed.

[191] Hadith regarding the difference between Ka'b and Abu Hurayrah about the hour of Friday. Abu Hurayrah said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'No servant encounters it while praying, nor is it during the time of prayer.'" Ka'b then said, "Did he not say, peace be upon him, 'Whoever sits waiting for the prayer is in a state of prayer'?" I stated in *al-Ihya* that Ka'b was the one who said it is the last hour, but that is not the case; it was rather 'Abdullah ibn Salam. As for Ka'b, he only said it occurs once every year, then he retracted. The hadith is reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and Ibn Majah has something similar from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Salam.

In *Thiqat Ibn Hibban*, the preserved narration is from Simak as *mursal* (with a broken chain). I say: It is not sound, neither with a connected chain nor as *mursal*.

[196] Hadith regarding recitation in Friday prayer: *"Friday"* and *"The Hypocrites,"* and in the Friday dawn prayer: *"The Prostration"* and *"Has there come..."* Reported by Muslim from the narrations of Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurayrah.

The correct version is from Mu'tamir from his father as *mursal*."

[200] Hadith of the Prayer of Glorification and his saying to his uncle al-'Abbas, "Pray it every Friday." Reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Khuzaymah, and al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-'Uqayli and others said, "There is no sound hadith concerning it."

[201] Hadith: "Whoever travels on Friday, the two angels invoke against him." Reported by al-Daraqutni in *al-Afrad* from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, and it contains Ibn Lahi'ah.

[203] Hadith of 'Abdullah ibn al-Sa'ib regarding the Prophet, peace be upon him, removing his sandals. Reported by Muslim.

[214] A hadith of Abu Ayyub: "He would not omit four rak'ahs after the zenith," narrated by Ahmad with a weak chain, and a similar narration is found in Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in an abridged form.

[215] A hadith of Umm Habibah: "Whoever prays twelve rak'ahs in a day..." narrated by al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain according to the conditions of Muslim. Muslim narrated it in an abridged form without specifying the times of the rak'ahs.

[218] A hadith of 'Ubadah or another, regarding the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, hastening to the pillars when the call for Maghrib prayer was given, agreed upon from the narration of Anas, not from 'Ubadah.

[227] A hadith: "When he intended to enter his bed, he would crawl towards it, then pray two rak'ahs..." narrated by...

[233] The hadith concerning Witr with thirteen rak'ahs has preceded in the previous one, and in Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Umm Salamah: "He would perform Witr with thirteen," and Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan. In Muslim from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "He would pray thirteen rak'ahs at night," with an addition in one narration: "including the two rak'ahs of Fajr."

[240] The hadith "He prayed between the two evening prayers six rak'ahs" was reported by Ibn Mandah in Duha and Al-Tabrani in Al-Awsat and Al-Asghar from the hadith of 'Ammar ibn Yasir with a weak chain, and Al-Tirmidhi deemed it weak from the hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Whoever prays six rak'ahs after Maghrib without speaking evil between them, it will be equated for him with worship of twelve years."

[245] The hadith of Jabir: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs on Monday at the ascent of the day" was reported by...

Abu Musa al-Madini reported from the hadith of Jabir from 'Umar, attributed to the Prophet, and it is a rejected hadith.
[246] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever prays twelve rak'ahs on Monday" – Abu Musa al-Madini mentioned this hadith without a chain, and it is rejected.
[247] The hadith of Yazid al-Raqashi from Anas: "Whoever prays ten rak'ahs on Tuesday at midday" – Abu Musa al-Madini transmitted it with a weak chain, and he did not specify "at midday" nor "at its peak."
[248] The hadith of Abu Idris al-Khawlani from Mu'adh: "Whoever prays twelve rak'ahs on Wednesday" – Abu Musa al-Madini transmitted it and said its narrators are trustworthy, but the hadith is fabricated. I say: Rather, it includes an unnamed narrator, Muhammad ibn Hamid al-Razi, one of the liars.
[249] The hadith of 'Ikrimah from Ibn 'Abbas: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs on Thursday between Zuhr and 'Asr" – Abu Musa al-Madini transmitted it with a very weak chain.
[250] The hadith of 'Ali: "On Friday, a prayer encompassing all; no believing servant stands when the sun has risen..." – I found no basis for it, and it is false.
[251] The hadith of Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever enters the mosque on Friday and prays four rak'ahs" – al-Daraqutni transmitted it in the rare reports of Malik and said it is not sound; 'Abdullah ibn Wasif is unknown. Al-Khatib mentioned it among the narrators from Malik and said it is very rare, and I know of no other version besides this.
[252] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever prays four rak'ahs on Saturday" – Abu Musa al-Madini transmitted it in his book "Duties of Nights and Days" with a very weak chain.
[253] The hadith: "Whoever prays twenty rak'ahs on Sunday night" – Abu Musa al-Madini mentioned it without a chain, and it is rejected. Abu Musa also reported from the hadith of Anas concerning the virtue of praying six rak'ahs and four rak'ahs therein, both of which are very weak.
[254] The hadith of al-A'mash from Anas: "Whoever prays four rak'ahs on Monday night" – Abu Musa al-Madini mentioned it thus from al-A'mash without a chain, from the narration of Yazid al-Raqashi from Anas, a hadith concerning praying six rak'ahs therein, and it is rejected.
[255] The hadith of praying two rak'ahs on Tuesday night – Abu Musa mentioned it without a chain, quoting from some authors, and he transmitted from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud and Jabir a hadith concerning praying four rak'ahs therein, all of which are rejected.
[256] The hadith: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs on Wednesday night" – I found nothing in it except the hadith of Jabir concerning praying four rak'ahs therein, which Abu Musa al-Madini reported. He also reported from the hadith of Anas thirty rak'ahs.
[257] The hadith of Fatimah: "Whoever prays six rak'ahs, meaning on Wednesday night" – Abu Musa al-Madini transmitted it with a very weak chain.
[258] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs on Thursday night between Maghrib and 'Isha'" – Abu Musa al-Madini and Abu Mansur al-Daylami in "Musnad al-Firdaws" transmitted it with a very weak chain, and it is rejected.
[259] The hadith of Jabir: "Whoever prays twelve rak'ahs on Friday night between Maghrib and 'Isha'" – the hadith is false, without basis.
[260] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever prays 'Isha' in congregation on Friday night, prays the two Sunnah rak'ahs, then prays ten rak'ahs afterward" – the hadith is false, without basis. Al-Muzaffar ibn al-Husayn al-Arjani in "The Virtues of the Qur'an" and Ibrahim ibn al-Muzaffar in "The Qur'an Reaching the Deceased" reported from the hadith of Anas: "Whoever prays two rak'ahs on Friday night, reciting in them al-Fatihah and 'Idha Zulzilat' fifteen times" – and Ibrahim ibn al-Muzaffar said fifty times – "Allah will protect him from the punishment of the grave and the terrors of the Day of Resurrection." Abu Mansur al-Dailami transmitted it in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from this source and also from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, all of which are weak and rejected. Nothing is sound regarding the days of the week and their nights, and Allah knows best.
[261] The hadith: "Increase prayers upon me on the radiant night and the bright day" – he transmitted it...

Al-Tabarani recorded in Al-Awsat from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, and in it is 'Abd al-Mun'im ibn Bashir, whom Ibn Ma'in and Ibn Hibban considered weak.

[262] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever prays on Saturday night between Maghrib and 'Isha' twelve rak'ahs..." — I found no basis for it.

[263] The hadith about going out on one path and returning on another, Muslim recorded it from the hadith of Abu Hurairah.

[264] The hadith: "He used to order the bringing out of adolescent girls and those in seclusion," agreed upon from the hadith of Umm 'Atiyyah.

[265] The hadith about hastening the 'Eid al-Adha prayer and delaying the 'Eid al-Fitr prayer, Al-Shafi'i recorded it from the narration of Abu al-Huwayrith, mursal, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, wrote to 'Amr ibn Hazm while he was in Najran: "Hasten the Adha and delay the Fitr."

[266] The hadith: "He sacrificed two horned, white rams and slaughtered with his own hand, saying, 'In the name of God, God is Greater. This is on my behalf and on behalf of anyone from my nation who did not sacrifice,'" agreed upon except for his saying "on my behalf..." etc., from the hadith of Anas. This addition is found in Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Jabir, and Al-Tirmidhi said it is ghareeb and munqati'.

[267] The hadith: "Whoever sees the crescent of Dhul-Hijjah and intends to sacrifice, let him not remove anything from his hair or nails," recorded from the hadith of Umm Salamah.

[268] The hadith of Abu Ayyub: "A man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of his family during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and they would eat and feed others," recorded by Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan sahih.

[269] Sufyan al-Thawri said: "It is from the Sunnah to pray twelve rak'ahs after 'Eid al-Fitr and six rak'ahs after 'Eid al-Adha." I found no basis for it being a Sunnah, and the authentic hadith contradicts it, which is that he, peace be upon him, did not pray before or after it. They have differed regarding the statement of a Successor, "It is from the Sunnah such and such," but as for the statement of a Successor of the Successors like al-Thawri, it is severed.

[270] The hadith about him going out for the night prayers in Ramadan for two or three nights, then not going out, saying, "I fear it would be made obligatory upon you," agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah with the wording, "I feared it would be prescribed for you."

[271] The hadith: "The virtue of voluntary prayer in one's house over his prayer in the mosque is like the virtue of the obligatory prayer in the mosque over his prayer in his house," narrated by Adam ibn Abi Iyas in the book Al-Qawwat from the hadith of Damrah ibn Habib, mursal. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated it in Al-Musannaf, making it from Damrah ibn Habib from a man among the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, mawquf. In the Sunan of Abu Dawud with a sound chain from the hadith of Zayd ibn Thabit: "A man's prayer in his house is better than his prayer in my mosque, except for the obligatory prayer."

[272] The hadith: "A prayer in this mosque of mine is better than one hundred prayers elsewhere, and a prayer in the Sacred Mosque is better than a thousand prayers in my mosque, and better than all of this is a man who prays two rak'ahs in a corner of his house that none knows but God," recorded by Abu al-Shaykh in Al-Thawab from the hadith of Anas: "A prayer in my mosque equals ten thousand prayers, and a prayer in the Sacred Mosque equals one hundred thousand prayers, and prayer in the land of ribat equals two million prayers, and more than all of that are two rak'ahs a servant prays in the depths of the night, desiring nothing by them but the Face of God, Mighty and Majestic." Its chain is weak. Abu al-Walid al-Saffar mentioned in the book Al-Salah, as a suspended report from the hadith of al-Awza'i, who said: "I entered upon Yahya and he related to me a hadith," and he mentioned it except he said for the first one thousand and for the second one hundred.

[273] The hadith: "There is no one who fasts the first Thursday of Rajab..." the hadith concerning the prayer of desires, Razeen cited it in his book, and it is a fabricated hadith.

[274] The hadith about the prayer on the night of mid-Sha'ban is a baseless hadith. Ibn Majah recorded it from the hadith of 'Ali: "When the night of mid-Sha'ban comes, stand its night in prayer and fast its day," and its chain is weak.

[275] The hadith: "Indeed the sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of God..." both recorded it from the hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah.

[276] The hadith: "Were it not for suckling infants and bowing elders..." Al-Bayhaqi recorded it and considered it weak from the hadith of Abu Hurairah.

[278] The hadith of 'Awf ibn Malik concerning the funeral prayer: "O Allah, forgive me and him, have mercy on me and him, and grant me and him well-being." Muslim transmitted it without the supplication for the one praying.
[279] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "There is no Muslim man who dies and forty [people] stand for his funeral prayer..." Muslim transmitted it.
[280] The hadith: "He prayed two rak'ahs after 'Asr." It was said to him, "Did you not forbid us from this?" He said, "They are two rak'ahs I used to pray after Dhuhr." Both [al-Bukhari and Muslim] transmitted it from the hadith of Umm Salamah, and Muslim transmitted it from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "He used to pray two rak'ahs before 'Asr, then he became preoccupied with them."
[281] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "When sleep or illness overcame him and he did not stand for prayer that night..." Muslim transmitted it.
[282] The hadith: "The deeds most beloved to Allah are the most consistent, even if few." Both transmitted it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.
[283] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "Whoever worships Allah with a devotion and then abandons it out of weariness, Allah detests him." Ibn al-Sunni narrated it in *Riyadat al-Muta'abbidin* as a statement stopped at 'A'ishah.
[284] The hadith: "I entered Paradise and saw Bilal in it. I said, 'O Bilal, by what did you precede me to Paradise?'" Both transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.
[285] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When you leave your home, pray two rak'ahs; they will protect you from an evil exit. And when you enter your home..." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Baskar ibn 'Amr from Safwan ibn Sulaym, who said, "Bakr, I think, from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah," and he mentioned it. Al-Khara'iti narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* and Ibn 'Adi in *al-Kamil* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When one of you enters his house, let him not sit until he has performed two rak'ahs, for Allah will make for him good from his two rak'ahs." Ibn 'Adi said, "It is rejected with this chain." Al-Bukhari said, "It has no basis."
[286] The hadith of the two rak'ahs of Ihram. Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.
[287] The hadith of praying two rak'ahs at the beginning of a journey. Al-Khara'iti transmitted it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* from the hadith of Anas: "No deputy left with his family is more beloved to Allah than four rak'ahs a servant prays in his house when he dons his travel garments." It is weak.
[288] The hadith of the two rak'ahs upon arrival from a journey. Both transmitted it from the hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik.
[289] The hadith: "Every matter of importance not begun with 'In the name of Allah' is deficient." Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban in his *Sahih* transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.
[290] The hadith of the prayer of seeking counsel (Istikharah). Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the hadith of Jabir. Ahmad said, "It is a rejected hadith."
[291] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud concerning the prayer of need: twelve rak'ahs. Abu Mansur al-Daylami transmitted it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* with two very weak chains containing 'Amr ibn Harun al-Balhi, whom Ibn Ma'in declared a liar, and other defects. The prayer of need has also been narrated as two rak'ahs. Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa, and al-Tirmidhi said, "It is a rare (gharib) hadith, and there is discussion about its chain."
[292] The hadith of the prayer of glorification (Tasbih) has preceded.
[293] The hadith: "The night prayer is two by two." Both transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.
[294] The hadith: "The sun rises with the horn of Satan. When it rises, he accompanies it..." Al-Nasa'i transmitted it from the hadith of 'Abdullah al-Sanabahi, and it is interrupted (mursal). Malik is the one who says 'Abdullah al-Sanabahi, and there is a mistake in it; the correct [name] is 'Abd al-Rahman. He did not see the Prophet ﷺ.
