The Secrets of Fasting
This is the Sixth Book of the Quarter of Devotions
In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

All praise is to God, who has bestowed the greatest favor upon His servants by repelling from them the cunning and artifice of Satan, thwarting his hopes and disappointing his expectations; for He has made fasting a fortress and a shield for His allies, and opened for them thereby the gates of Paradise. He has made known to them that Satan’s means of access to their hearts are the latent appetites, and that by suppressing these, the tranquil soul becomes manifest in strength, breaking its adversary and mighty in favor. And blessings upon Muhammad, the guide of creation and establisher of the Sunnah, and upon his family and companions, possessors of penetrating insight and sound intellects, abundant salutations.

Now then: Fasting constitutes a quarter of faith, by virtue of His saying ﷺ: “Fasting is half of patience,” and by virtue of His saying ﷺ: “Patience is half of faith.” Moreover, it is distinguished by the unique attribution to God Almighty among all the pillars, as God Almighty said, as reported by His Prophet ﷺ: “Every good deed is rewarded tenfold up to seven hundredfold, except fasting, for it is for Me and I shall reward for it.” And God Almighty has said: {Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account.} Since fasting is half of patience, its reward transcends the law of estimation and reckoning. Sufficient for you in knowing its merit is His saying ﷺ: “By Him in whose hand is my soul, the breath of the fasting person is more pleasant to God than the fragrance of musk. God Almighty says: ‘He leaves his appetite, food, and drink for My sake. Fasting is for Me, and I shall reward for it.’” And He ﷺ said: “For Paradise there is a gate called Ar-Rayyan, which none shall enter except those who fast, and it is promised the meeting with God Almighty in the portion of his fast.” And He ﷺ said: “The fasting person has two joys: a joy at the time of breaking his fast, and a joy at the time of meeting his Lord.” And He ﷺ said: “Everything has a gate, and the gate of worship is fasting.” And He ﷺ said: “The sleep of the fasting person is worship.” And Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: “When the month of Ramadan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hellfire are closed, the devils are chained, and a caller calls out: ‘O seeker of good, come forward! O seeker of evil, desist!’” And Waki’ said concerning God’s saying: {Eat and drink pleasantly for what you sent ahead in days gone by} – these are the days of fasting, for they refrained from food and drink therein. The Messenger of God ﷺ combined in the rank of divine boasting between renunciation of the world and fasting, saying: “God Almighty boasts to His angels of the worshipping youth, saying: ‘O youth who abandoned his appetite for My sake, who expended his youth for Me! You are to Me like some of My angels.’” And He ﷺ said concerning the fasting person: “God Almighty says: ‘Look, O My angels, at My servant; he left his appetite, his pleasure, his food, and his drink for My sake.’” It is said concerning His saying: {No soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for the eyes as reward for what they used to do} – it is said their deed was fasting, for He said: {Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account.} Thus, the fasting person’s reward is poured forth lavishly and given abundantly, not falling under estimation or reckoning. It is worthy of being so, because fasting is specifically for Him and ennobled by attribution to Him, even though all acts of worship are for Him. He ennobled the House in relation to Himself, while all the earth is His, for two reasons: First, fasting is restraint and abstention; it is in itself a secret, containing no observable action. All other acts of obedience are witnessed and seen by creation, but fasting is seen by none except God Almighty, for it is an inward act of pure patience. Second, it is a subduing of the enemy of God Almighty, for the means of Satan, may God curse him, are the appetites, and appetites are strengthened by eating and drinking. Therefore, He ﷺ said: “Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like blood; constrict his passages with hunger.” And therefore He ﷺ said to ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her: “Persist in knocking at the gate of Paradise.” She said: “With what?” He ﷺ said: “With hunger.” The merit of hunger will come later in the Book of the Evils of Food and Its Treatment from the Quarter of the Destructive Matters. Since fasting specifically suppresses Satan, blocks his pathways, and constricts his passages, it deserves the specific attribution to God Almighty. In suppressing the enemy of God lies victory for God, glorified be He, and the supporter of God Almighty is dependent upon supporting Him. God Almighty said: {If you support God, He will support you and make firm your feet.} The beginning is with effort from the servant, and the recompense is with guidance from God Almighty. Therefore, He said: {And those who strive in Our cause – We will surely guide them to Our ways.} And He said: {Indeed, God will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.} Change is but the multiplication of appetites; they are the pasture and grazing ground of devils. As long as they are fertile, their frequenting does not cease, and as long as they frequent, the majesty of God, glorified be He, is not unveiled to the servant, and he remains veiled from meeting Him. He ﷺ said: “Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would behold the kingdom of the heavens.” From this perspective, fasting became the gate of worship and became a shield. Since its merit has reached this extent, it is necessary to clarify its outward and inward conditions by mentioning its pillars, its Sunnahs, and its inward conditions. We shall explain this in three chapters.

(Chapter One: On the Obligations, Outward Sunnahs, and What Invalidates It)

As for the outward obligations, they are six:

First: Observing the beginning of the month of Ramadan by sighting the crescent. If it is obscured, then by completing thirty days of Sha’ban. By sighting we mean knowledge, which is attained by the testimony of one just witness. The crescent of Shawwal is not established except by the testimony of two just witnesses, as a precaution for the worship. Whoever hears a just witness and trusts his statement, and it becomes preponderant in his mind that he is truthful, fasting becomes obligatory upon him even if the judge does not rule by it. Every servant in his worship must follow what his mind preponderates towards. If the crescent is sighted in one town and not in another, and the distance between them is less than two stages, fasting is obligatory upon all. If it is more, each town has its own ruling, and the obligation does not extend.

Second: The intention. It is necessary for each night to have a specific, decisive intention made at night. If one intends to fast the month of Ramadan all at once, it does not suffice him. This is what we meant by saying “each night.” If one makes the intention during the day, it does not suffice for the fast of Ramadan nor for an obligatory fast, except for voluntary fasting. This is what we meant by saying “made at night.” If one intends fasting in general or obligatory fasting in general, it does not suffice until he intends the obligation of God Almighty, the fast of Ramadan. If one intends on the night of doubt to fast tomorrow if it is from Ramadan, it does not suffice him, for it is not decisive unless his intention is based on the statement of a just witness, and the possibility of the witness’s error or lying does not invalidate the decisiveness; or it is based on the continuation of the state, like doubt on the last night of Ramadan – that does not prevent a decisive intention; or it is based on personal reasoning, like one imprisoned in a cellar if it becomes preponderant in his mind that Ramadan has begun by his reasoning – his doubt does not prevent him from the intention. Whenever one is in doubt on the night of doubt, his decisiveness in intention by tongue does not benefit him, for the place of intention is the heart, and decisive resolve amidst doubt is inconceivable therein, just as if one said in the middle of Ramadan: “I will fast tomorrow if it is from Ramadan” – that does not harm him, for it is verbal repetition, but the place of intention does not admit repetition; rather, it is certain that it is from Ramadan. If one intends at night and then eats, his intention is not invalidated. If a woman intends during menstruation and then becomes pure before dawn, her fast is valid.

Third: Refraining from conveying anything to the interior deliberately while remembering the fast. His fast is invalidated by eating, drinking, nasal drops, and enema. It is not invalidated by bloodletting, cupping, applying kohl, inserting a probe into

[8] The hadith "The sleep of the fasting person is worship" we have reported in the *Amali* of Ibn Mandah from the narration of Ibn al-Mughirah al-Qawwas from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar with a weak chain—though it may be 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, for they only mention Ibn al-Mughirah narrating from him. Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from a narration by 'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa, but in its chain is Sulayman ibn 'Amr al-Nakha'i, one of the liars.

[9] The hadith "When the month of Ramadan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened..." was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is rare, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated it according to their conditions, from a narration by Abu Hurayrah. Al-Bukhari authenticated its attribution as a statement of Mujahid, and its origin is agreed upon without the phrase "and a caller calls out."

[10] The hadith "Indeed, Allah, exalted is He, boasts to His angels about a devout youth, saying: 'O youth who has forsaken his desires...'" was reported by Ibn 'Adi from a narration by Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.

[14] The hadith "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam..." was reported by Ahmad from a narration by Abu Hurayrah in a similar wording.

[15] The hadith "When the last ten [nights] would enter, he would roll up his bedding..." is agreed upon from a narration by 'A'ishah with the wording: "He would stay awake at night, awaken his family, strive, and tighten his waist-wrapper."

[16] The hadith "He would not go out except for a need, and he would not inquire about the sick except in passing..." The first part is agreed upon from a narration by 'A'ishah; the second part was reported by Abu Dawud in a similar wording with a lenient chain.

[17] The hadith "He would bring his head close to 'A'ishah..." is agreed upon from her narration.

[18] The hadith "A glance is a poisoned arrow from the arrows of Iblis..." was reported by al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from a narration by Hudhayfah.

[19] The hadith "Jabir from Anas: 'Five things break the fast of the fasting person...'" was reported by al-Azdi in *al-Du'afa'* from the narration of Jaban from Anas, and the mention of "Jabir" is a scribal error. Abu Hatim al-Razi said: "This is a liar."

[20] The hadith "Fasting is a shield; so when one of you is fasting..." was reported by both from a narration by Abu Hurayrah.

[21] The hadith "Two women were fasting during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him..." concerning backbiting against a fasting person was reported by Ahmad from a narration by 'Ubayd, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, with a chain containing an unknown narrator.

[22] The hadith "The backbiter and the listener are partners in sin" is rare. Al-Tabarani has from a narration by Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, forbade backbiting and listening to backbiting."

[23] The hadith "How many a fasting person has nothing from his fast but hunger and thirst..." was reported by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from a narration by Abu Hurayrah.

[24] The hadith "Fasting is but a trust, so let each of you safeguard his trust" was reported by al-Khara'iti in *Makarin al-Akhlaq* from a narration by Ibn Mas'ud in a hadith concerning trust and fasting, and its chain is sound.

[25] The hadith "When he recited the saying of Allah, exalted is He: 'Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due...' he placed his hand on his ear and his eye and said: 'Hearing is a trust and sight is a trust'" was reported by Abu Dawud from a narration by Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "Hearing is a trust."

[26] The hadith "He would frequently fast in Sha'ban..." is agreed upon from a narration by 'A'ishah.

[27] The hadith "The best fasting after the month of Ramadan is the month of Allah, al-Muharram" was reported by Muslim from a narration by Abu Hurayrah.

[28] The hadith "Fasting one day from a sacred month is better than fasting thirty..." I have not found it thus. In *al-Mu'jam al-Saghir* of al-Tabarani, from a narration by Ibn 'Abbas: "Whoever fasts a day from al-Muharram, for him is [the reward of] thirty days for each day."

[29] The hadith "Whoever fasts three days from a sacred month: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday..." was reported by al-Azdi in *al-Du'afa'* from a narration by Anas.

[30] The hadith "When half of Sha'ban has passed, then no fasting until Ramadan" was reported by the Four [Sunan compilers] from a narration by Abu Hurayrah. Ibn Hibban in his *Sahih* reported from him: "When half of Sha'ban has passed, then break your fast until Ramadan comes," and al-Tirmidhi authenticated it.

[31] The hadith "He would join Sha'ban to Ramadan once" was reported by the Four from a narration by Umm Salamah: "He would not fast a complete month from the year except Sha'ban, which he would join to Ramadan." Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported a similar narration from 'A'ishah.

[32] The hadith "He would separate Sha'ban from Ramadan on several occasions" was reported by Abu Dawud from a narration by 'A'ishah: She said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, would be cautious about the new moon of Sha'ban as he was not cautious about others. If it was obscured from him, he would count thirty days, then fast." Al-Daraqutni reported it and said its chain is sound, and al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the condition of the two Shaykhs.

[33] The hadith "There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days of Dhul-Hijjah..." was reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from a narration by Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "It was said: 'Not even jihad?' etc." In al-Bukhari, from a narration by Ibn 'Abbas: "There are no days in which deeds are better than in these ten." They said: "Not even jihad?" He said: "Not even jihad, except for
