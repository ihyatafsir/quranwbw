The Book of Censure of the World

This is the sixth book of the Quarter of the Perilous Matters from the book The Revival of the Religious Sciences.

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who has made His saints aware of the perils and afflictions of this world, and has unveiled for them its defects and blemishes, so that they may contemplate its signs and portents, and weigh its virtues against its vices. Thus they know that its evils outweigh its goods, its hoped-for benefits do not compensate for its feared harms, and its rising is never free from eclipse. Yet it appears in the guise of a beautiful woman, alluring people with her charm, while concealing vile secrets that destroy those who yearn for union with her. She flees from her suitors and is miserly with her favors; and when she does bestow them, her mischief and calamity are not to be trusted. If she grants a moment of goodness, she follows it with a year of harm; if she does wrong once, she makes it a habit. The cycles of her favor draw near only to vanish; the trade of her children ends in ruin and loss. Her afflictions rain down in succession upon the breasts of her seekers, and the courses of her conditions speak of the humiliation of those who pursue her. Every one beguiled by her is destined for degradation; every one made arrogant by her is bound for regret. Her nature is to flee from her pursuer and to pursue the one who flees. Whoever serves her is deprived, and whoever turns away from her is granted. Her purity is never free from the taint of impurities, nor her joy from causes of distress. Her health is followed by sickness, her youth leads to old age, and her pleasure yields nothing but remorse and regret. She is deceitful, treacherous, fleeting, and elusive, ever adorning herself for her suitors until, when they become her beloved, she bares her fangs at them, tangles the threads of their affairs, and reveals to them the hidden wonders of her store, making them taste the deadly poisons of her venom and striking them with the piercing arrows of her calamities. While her companions are in delight and bounty from her, she turns away as if it were but the stuff of dreams. Then she assails them with her tribulations, mowing them down like harvested crops and burying them in their shrouds beneath the dust. If she grants one of them all that the sun shines upon, she reduces him to stubble, as though he had never prospered yesterday. Her companions hope for joy, but she promises them delusion, so that they hope for much and build palaces—only for their palaces to become graves, their gatherings desolation, their striving scattered dust, and their supplication lamentation. Such is her description, and the decree of God is a determined fate. And blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, His servant and messenger, sent to all worlds as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, a shining lamp; and upon those of his family and companions who were his supporters in religion and helpers against the oppressors; and abundant peace be upon them.

Now then: The world is an enemy to God, an enemy to the friends of God, and an enemy to the enemies of God. As for its enmity to God, it is that it has blocked the path for the servants of God. For this reason, God has not looked upon it since He created it. As for its enmity to the friends of God, the Almighty: it adorned itself for them with its adornment and dazzled them with its splendor and freshness, so that they tasted the bitterness of patience in severing ties with it. As for its enmity to the enemies of God: it beguiled them with its guile and cunning, then ensnared them in its net until they placed their trust in it and relied upon it, only for it to abandon them when they were most in need of it. Thus, they reaped from it a regret that rends the hearts. Then it deprived them of happiness for all eternity. They lament its loss and cry out for help against its wiles, but no help comes. Rather, it is said to them: "Be driven away therein, and speak not. Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter; for them the punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be helped."

When the perils and evils of this world loom large, one must first understand the true nature of the world: what is it? What wisdom lies in its creation despite its hostility? And how do its deceptions and harms take hold? For whoever does not recognize evil cannot guard against it and is likely to fall into it. We shall now describe the censure of the world and its parables, its reality and the detailed meanings thereof, the various occupations connected to it, the reason for needing its foundations, and the cause that turns creation away from God—namely, preoccupation with its superfluities—if God Almighty wills. He is the Helper in achieving what pleases Him.

Exposition on the Censure of the Worldly Life

The verses condemning the worldly life and its examples are numerous. Most of the Quran encompasses censure of the worldly life, diverting creation from it, and summoning them to the Hereafter. Indeed, this was the objective of the prophets, upon them be prayers and peace, and they were sent for no other purpose. Thus, there is no need to cite Quranic verses due to their evident clarity; we shall instead relate some of the narrations transmitted concerning it.

It has been narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by a dead sheep and said, "Do you consider this sheep insignificant to its owners?" They said, "Due to its worthlessness, they discarded it." He said, "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the worldly life is more insignificant to God than this sheep is to its owners. If the worldly life were equal to the wing of a mosquito in the sight of God, He would not have given a disbeliever a single drink of water from it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The worldly life is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the disbeliever." And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The worldly life is accursed, and accursed is all within it except that which is for God's sake."

And Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever loves his worldly life harms his Hereafter, and whoever loves his Hereafter harms his worldly life. Therefore, prefer that which endures over that which perishes." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Love of the worldly life is the root of every sin."

And Zayd ibn Arqam said: We were with Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, and he called for a drink. He was brought water and honey. When he brought it near his mouth, he wept until he made his companions weep, and they fell silent while he did not cease. Then he wept again until they thought they could not ask him. Then he wiped his eyes and they said, "O Successor of the Messenger of God, what made you weep?" He said, "I was with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and I saw him pushing something away from himself, and I saw no one with him. I said, 'O Messenger of God, what is it that you are pushing away from yourself?' He said, 'This worldly life appeared to me, so I said to it: Away from me! Then it returned and said: If you escape from me, those after you will not escape from me.'"

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "How astonishing, utterly astonishing, is he who believes in the Abode of Permanence yet strives for the Abode of Delusion!" And it is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood by a rubbish heap and said, "Come to the worldly life," and he took some tattered rags that had decayed upon that rubbish heap and some bones that had rotted, and said, "This is the worldly life." This is an indication that the adornment of the worldly life will become worn like those rags, and the bodies seen through it will become decayed bones.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, the worldly life is sweet and green, and God is making you successors within it, so observe how you act. Verily, when the worldly life was spread out and made easy for the Children of Israel, they wandered astray in ornamentation, women, perfume, and garments."

And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Do not take the worldly life as a lord, lest it take you as slaves. Store your treasure with Him who does not lose it, for the owner of worldly treasure fears ruin for it, while the owner of God's treasure does not fear ruin for it." And he, upon him be the best prayers and peace, said: "O company of disciples, I have indeed overturned the worldly life for you on its face, so do not revive it after me. For among the evils of the worldly life is that God is disobeyed within it, and among the evils of the worldly life is that the Hereafter is not attained except by abandoning it. Behold, then, pass through the worldly life, do not build it up, and know that the root of every sin is love of the worldly life. And how many a momentary desire has bequeathed to its people lasting sorrow." And he also said: "I have spread the worldly life flat for you, and you have sat upon its back, so let not kings and women contend with you for it. As for kings, do not contend with them for the worldly life, for they will not oppose you if you leave them and their worldly life. As for women, guard against them through fasting and prayer." And he also said: "The worldly life is a seeker and a sought. The seeker of the Hereafter is sought by the worldly life until his provision within it is completed, and the seeker of the worldly life is sought by the Hereafter until death comes and seizes him by the neck."

And Musa ibn Yasar said: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, God, exalted is He, has not created a creation more detestable to Him than the worldly life, and since He created it, He has not looked upon it." And it is narrated that Solomon, son of David, upon them be peace, passed by in his procession, with birds shading him and jinn and humans on his right and left. He passed by a worshipper from the Children of Israel who said, "By God, O son of David, God has certainly given you a mighty kingdom." Solomon heard him and said, "A single glorification in the record of a believer is better than what was given to the son of David, for what was given to the son of David will vanish, while the glorification remains."

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Rivalry in worldly increase distracts you. The son of Adam says, 'My wealth, my wealth!' But do you have anything of your wealth except what you ate and thus consumed, or what you wore and thus wore out, or what you gave in charity and thus preserved?" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, the worldly life is the abode of him who has no abode, and the wealth of him who has no wealth. For it, he who has no intellect gathers; because of it, he who has no knowledge makes enemies; because of it, he who has no understanding feels envy; and for it, he who has no certainty strives." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever begins the day with the worldly life as his greatest concern is not from God in anything, and God will affix four traits to his heart: anxiety that never ceases from him, preoccupation that never frees him, poverty that never reaches sufficiency, and hope that never reaches its end."

And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me, "O Abu Hurayrah, shall I show you the entire worldly life and all that is within it?" I said, "Yes, O Messenger of God." He took my hand and brought me to a valley among the valleys of Medina, and there was a rubbish heap containing human skulls, excrement, rags, and bones. Then he said, "O Abu Hurayrah, these skulls were once as eager as your eagerness and hoped as your hope, yet today they are bones without skin, and they will become dust. This excrement is the various foods they earned from wherever they earned them, then they cast them into their bellies, and they became such that people shun them. These worn-out rags were their garments and clothing, and they became such that the winds flap them. These bones are the bones of their mounts upon which they would travel to the farthest lands. So let whoever would weep for the worldly life weep." He said: We did not depart until our weeping intensified.

And it is narrated that when God, exalted is He, sent Adam down to the earth, He said to him: Build for ruin and beget for extinction.

It is written in the scrolls of Abraham, peace be upon him: O world, how insignificant you are to the righteous who have adorned and beautified themselves for you. I have cast some of you into their hearts and turned their chests away from you, and I have not created a creation more insignificant to Me than you. All your affairs are trivial and destined for annihilation. I decreed upon you the day I created you that you would not endure for anyone, nor would anyone endure for you. And if your possessor is stingy with you and begrudges you, blessed are the righteous who have shown Me contentment from their hearts and sincerity and uprightness from their conscience. Blessed are they; what reward do they have with Me when they come forth to Me from their graves except light proceeding before them and angels surrounding them until I grant them what they hope for from My mercy. And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The world is suspended between the heaven and the earth; since God the Exalted created it, He has not looked upon it. And it will say on the Day of Resurrection, 'O Lord, grant me today a portion for the lowliest of Your allies.' He will say, 'Be silent, O nothing! I did not approve of you for them in the world; shall I approve of you for them today?'"

And it is narrated in the accounts of Adam, peace be upon him, that when he ate from the tree, his stomach stirred for the expulsion of waste, and this was not placed in any of the foods of Paradise except in this tree, and for that they were forbidden to eat from it. He said: So he began to wander in Paradise, and God the Exalted commanded an angel to address him. He said to him: Say to him, 'What do you want?' Adam said: I want to relieve the distress in my belly. It was said to the angel: Say to him, 'In which place do you wish to relieve it? Upon the furnishings, upon the couches, upon the rivers, or beneath the shade of the trees? Do you see here a place suitable for that? Descend to the world.'"

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There will certainly come people on the Day of Resurrection with deeds like the mountains of Tihamah, yet they will be commanded to the Fire." They said: "O Messenger of God, even though they prayed?" He said: "Yes, they used to pray, fast, and take a portion of the night [for worship], but when something of the world was presented to them, they would pounce upon it."

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in one of his sermons: "The believer is between two fears: a term that has passed, about which he does not know what God has decreed for him, and a term that remains, about which he does not know what God will decree for him. So let the servant provision himself from his own self for his self, from his world for his Hereafter, from his life for his death, and from his youth for his old age. For the world was created for you, and you were created for the Hereafter. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, after death there is no recourse, and after the world there is no abode except Paradise or Hell."

And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Love for the world and the Hereafter cannot coexist in a believer, just as water and fire cannot coexist in a single vessel." And it is narrated that Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to Noah, peace be upon him: "O longest-lived of the prophets, how did you find the world?" He said: "Like a house with two doors; I entered through one and exited through the other." It was said to Jesus, peace be upon him: "If only you would take a house to shelter you." He said: "The ruins of those before us suffice us." And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Beware of the world, for it is more bewitching than Harut and Marut."

And from Al-Hasan, he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came out to his companions one day and said: "Is there anyone among you who wishes for God to remove blindness from him and grant him sight? Indeed, whoever desires the world and has long hope in it, God will blind his heart to that extent. And whoever is ascetic toward the world and shortens his hope in it, God will grant him knowledge without learning and guidance without being guided. Indeed, there will come after you a people for whom authority will not be established except by killing and tyranny, nor wealth except through pride and miserliness, nor love except by following desires. However, whoever among you reaches that time and is patient with poverty while capable of wealth, and patient with hatred while capable of love, and patient with humiliation while capable of honor, desiring nothing but the Countenance of God the Exalted, God will grant him the reward of fifty truthful ones."

And it is narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, was severely affected by rain, thunder, and lightning one day, so he sought something to take refuge in. His eye fell upon a tent from afar, so he went to it, and behold, there was a woman inside, so he turned away from it. Then he saw a cave in a mountain, so he went to it, and behold, there was a lion inside. He placed his hand upon it and said: "My God, You have made a refuge for everything but have not made a refuge for me." So God the Exalted revealed to him: "Your refuge is in the abode of My mercy. I shall marry you on the Day of Resurrection to a hundred houris whom I created with My hand, and I shall feed at your wedding feast for four thousand years, a day of which is like the lifespan of the world, and I shall command a caller to call out: 'Where are the ascetics in the world? Come visit the wedding of the ascetic in the world, Jesus son of Mary.'"

And Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him, said: "Woe to the possessor of the world! How he dies and leaves it and what is in it! It deceives him, and he feels secure from it; he trusts in it, and it forsakes him. And woe to the deceived! How I show them what they dislike and separate them from what they love, and bring upon them what they are promised. And woe to him whose concern is the world and whose work is sins! How he will be disgraced tomorrow by his sin!" And it is said that God the Exalted revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, what have you to do with the abode of the wrongdoers? It is not an abode for you. Remove your concern from it and depart from it with your intellect. How evil an abode it is, except for a worker who works therein; then how good an abode it is. O Moses, I am lying in wait for the wrongdoer until I take from him for the wronged."

And it is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, and he came with wealth from Bahrain. The Ansar heard of Abu 'Ubaydah's arrival and attended the Fajr prayer with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, finished the prayer, he turned away, and they presented themselves to him. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, smiled when he saw them and then said: "I think you have heard that Abu 'Ubaydah has arrived with something." They said: "Yes, O Messenger of God." He said: "Then receive glad tidings and hope for what pleases you, for by God, it is not poverty I fear for you, but I fear that the world will be spread out for you as it was spread out for those before you, and you will compete for it as they competed for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them."

And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, the thing I fear most for you is what God brings forth for you from the blessings of the earth." It was said: "What are the blessings of the earth?" He said: "The adornment of the world."

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not occupy your hearts with remembrance of the world." Thus he forbade its remembrance, let alone attaining its essence.

And 'Ammar ibn Sa'id said: Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by a village, and behold, its people were dead in the courtyards and roads. He said: "O company of disciples, these people died under wrath, and if they had died otherwise, they would have been buried." They said: "O Spirit of God, we wish we knew their story." So he asked God the Exalted, and He revealed to him: "When night comes, call them, and they will answer you." When night came, he ascended a height and called out: "O people of the village!" A respondent answered him: "At your service, O Spirit of God!" He said: "What is your condition,

I see men content with the basest portion of religion, yet I do not see them content with the basest portion in life. So enrich yourself with religion as kings enrich themselves with their worldly dominion, and be independent of it.

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "O seeker of the world, more blessed is he who abandons the world than he who seeks it." And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There will certainly come to you after me a worldly life that will consume your faith just as fire consumes firewood." And God, the Exalted, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, do not incline to the love of the world, for you will not bring to me a sin greater than it." And Moses, peace be upon him, passed by a man weeping, and when he returned, he was still weeping. Moses said: "O Lord, Your servant weeps from fear of You." He said: "O son of Imran, even if his brain were to flow with the tears of his eyes and he were to raise his hands until they fell, I would not forgive him while he loves the world."

Narrations: Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever combines within himself six traits leaves no desire for Paradise nor escape from Hell: The first is he who knows God and obeys Him, knows Satan and disobeys him, knows the truth and follows it, knows falsehood and avoids it, knows the world and renounces it, and knows the Hereafter and seeks it." Al-Hasan said: "May God have mercy on a people for whom the world was a trust, so they delivered it to the one who entrusted it to them, and then departed light." He also said, may God have mercy on him: "Whoever competes with you in your religion, compete with him in his worldly life and cast it upon his neck." Luqman, peace be upon him, said to his son: "O my son, indeed the world is a deep sea in which many people have drowned. So let your ship therein be the fear of God, the Mighty and Majestic, its stuffing be faith in God, the Exalted, and its sail be reliance upon God, the Mighty and Majestic, so that perhaps you may be saved, though I do not see you saved." Al-Fudayl said: "I long pondered this verse: 'Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them as to which of them is best in deed. And indeed, We will make that which is upon it a barren ground.'" And one of the wise said: "You will not awaken to anything of the world except that it had people before you and will have people after you. You have nothing of the world but the supper of a night and the breakfast of a day, so do not perish in consuming it. Fast from the world and break your fast with the Hereafter, for the capital of the world is desire and its profit is the Fire." It was said to one of the monks: "How do you see time?" He said: "It wears out bodies, renews hopes, brings death near, and distances aspirations." It was said: "Then what is the state of its people?" He said: "Whoever attains it is wearied, and whoever misses it is exhausted." Concerning that, it was said:
And whoever praises the world, then by my life, for a life that pleases him,
He will soon, little by little, blame it.
When it turns away, it becomes a bitter regret,
And when it approaches, it brings many of its sorrows.

Some sages have said: The world existed when I was not in it, and it will depart while I am not in it, so I do not settle in it, for its life is vexation, its clarity is turbid, and its people are in constant fear—whether due to a vanishing blessing, an affliction, or a decree of death. Another said among the defects of this world is that it does not grant anyone what they deserve, but rather either increases or decreases. Sufyan remarked: Do you not see blessings as if they are objects of wrath, placed with those unworthy of them? Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: Whoever seeks the world out of love for it is given nothing but that he desires more. And whoever seeks the Hereafter out of love for it is given nothing but that he desires more, and there is no end to this. A man complained to Abu Hazim: I complain to you of the world’s attachment to me, though it is not my abode. He replied: Look at what God Almighty has given you from it, and take it only from what is lawful, and place it only in its rightful due. Love of the world will not harm you. He said this because if one were to hold himself to that, it would weary him until he becomes vexed with the world and seeks to depart from it. Yahya ibn Mu’adh said: The world is Satan’s shop, so do not steal anything from his shop, lest he come seeking it and seize you. Al-Fudayl said: If the world were of perishable gold and the Hereafter of lasting clay, it would still be fitting for us to choose lasting clay over perishable gold. How then, when we have chosen perishable clay over lasting gold? Abu Hazim said: Beware of the world, for I have heard that on the Day of Resurrection, a servant who held the world in high esteem will be made to stand and it will be said: This is what God deemed insignificant. Ibn Mas’ud said: No one begins a day except as a guest, with his wealth as a loan: the guest will depart, and the loan must be returned. Concerning this it was said:

Wealth and family are but deposits,
And one day deposits must be returned.

Rabia visited her companions, and they began speaking of the world, turning to censure it. She said: Be silent in mentioning it, for were it not for its place in your hearts, you would not speak of it so much. Does not one who loves something speak of it often? And it was said to Ibrahim ibn Adham: How are you? He replied:

We patch our worldly life by tearing our religion apart,
Yet what we patch does not last, nor does our religion remain.
So blessed is the servant who prefers his Lord, God,
In expectation of what He will bestow, and is generous with his worldly life.

It is also said regarding this:
I see the seeker of this world,
though his life be long,
as one who builds a structure,
then, when he has completed what he built,
he establishes it,
only for it to crumble.
And he attains from the world
joy and pleasures.

It is also said in this regard:
Suppose the world were brought to you freely—
Is not the end of that but a passing?
And your worldly life is naught save
Like a shadow that shades you, then announces its vanishing.

Luqman said to his son: O my son, sell your worldly life for your Hereafter, and you will profit both together; but do not sell your Hereafter for your worldly life, lest you lose them both. Mutarrif ibn al-Shikhkhir said: Do not look at the ease of the kings' living and the softness of their garments, but look at the swiftness of their departure and the evil of their end. Ibn Abbas said: Verily, God the Exalted has made this world into three portions: a portion for the believer, a portion for the hypocrite, and a portion for the disbeliever. The believer takes provision, the hypocrite adorns himself, and the disbeliever takes enjoyment. Some have said: The world is a carcass; whoever desires something from it must endure the company of dogs.

Concerning this, it was said:
O you who court the world, step aside from courting her, and you will be safe.
Indeed, she who is courted is fickle, her wedding feast close to the funeral.

Abu al-Darda said: Among the signs of this world’s insignificance before God is that disobedience is committed only within it, and what is with Him is attained only by abandoning it. Concerning this, it has been said:

When the world tests a person of understanding,  
The garments of a friend are stripped from an enemy.

It has also been said:
O you who sleep through the night, pleased with its beginning—indeed, events come knocking at the dawn.
It has consumed the ages that were in comfort, turning the two new moons, in their coming and going.
How many blows of time have destroyed a people, for in time there is benefit and harm.
O you who embrace a world with no permanence, evening and morning traveling in his worldly affairs.
Why not leave off embracing the world, so that you may embrace in Paradise the maidens?
If you desire the Gardens of Eternity to dwell therein, then it behooves you not to feel secure from the Fire.

Abu Umamah al-Bahili, may God be pleased with him, said: When Muhammad, peace be upon him, was sent, Satan’s armies came to him and said: “A prophet has been sent and a community has been brought forth.” He asked: “Do they love the world?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “If they love the world, I care not if they do not worship idols. I will assail them morning and evening with three things: taking wealth unlawfully, spending it unlawfully, and withholding it from its rightful due. All evil springs from this.”

A man said to Ali, may God honor his countenance: “O Commander of the Faithful, describe the world for us.” He said: “What shall I describe to you of an abode wherein the healthy fall ill, the secure regret, the poor grieve, and the rich are seduced? Its lawful entails reckoning, its unlawful entails punishment, and its ambiguous entails reproach.” It was said to him again, and he asked: “Shall I be lengthy or brief?” They said: “Be brief.” He said: “Its lawful is reckoning, its unlawful is torment.”

Malik ibn Dinar said: “Beware of the enchantress, for she bewitches the hearts of the learned,” meaning the world. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: “When the Hereafter resides in the heart, the world comes to contend with it. But when the world resides in the heart, the Hereafter does not contend with it, for the Hereafter is noble and the world is base.” This is a severe stricture, and we hope that what Siyar ibn al-Hakam mentioned is more accurate, for he said: “The world and the Hereafter can coexist in the heart; whichever prevails, the other follows it.” Malik ibn Dinar said: “To the extent you grieve for the world, concern for the Hereafter leaves your heart; and to the extent you grieve for the Hereafter, concern for the world leaves your heart.” This is derived from what Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: “The world and the Hereafter are co-wives; to the extent you please one, you displease the other.”

Al-Hasan said: “By God, I have known people to whom the world was lighter than the dust you tread upon. They cared not whether the world dawned or set, whether it went to this one or that.” A man said to al-Hasan: “What do you say of a man whom God has given wealth, and he gives charity from it and maintains ties of kinship with it—is it good for him to live luxuriously from it?” He said: “No. Even if he possessed the entire world, he would only be entitled to sufficiency from it, and he should advance that for the day of his poverty.”

Al-Fudayl said: “If the world in its entirety were offered to me lawfully, without being held accountable for it in the Hereafter, I would still loathe it as one of you loathes a carcass lest it soil his garment.” It is said: When Umar, may God be pleased with him, arrived in Syria, Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah met him on a camel bridled with a rope. He greeted him and inquired, then went to his home and saw nothing but his sword, shield, and saddle. Umar said to him: “Could you not have acquired some furnishings?” He replied: “O Commander of the Faithful, this suffices us until the midday rest.”

Sufyan said: “Take from the world for your body, and take from the Hereafter for your heart.” Al-Hasan said: “By God, the Children of Israel worshipped idols after worshipping the Merciful, due to their love for the world.” Wahb said: “I read in some scriptures: ‘The world is the prize of the wise and the heedlessness of the ignorant. They did not recognize it until they departed from it, then they sought to return but were not returned.’”

Luqman said to his son: “O my son, you have turned your back on the world from the day you entered it and have faced the Hereafter, so you are closer to the abode you approach than to the abode you recede from.” Said ibn Masud said: “If you see a servant whose worldly life increases and his Hereafter decreases, and he is content with that, then he is the deceived one who is played with while unaware.”

Amr ibn al-As said on the pulpit: “By God, I have never seen a people more desirous of what the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, renounced than you. By God, not three days passed for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, but what he owed was more than what he possessed.”

Al-Hasan, after reciting God’s words, ‘So let not the worldly life deceive you,’ said: “Who said this? He who created it and knows it best. Beware of what preoccupies you from the world, for the world is full of preoccupations. No man opens for himself a door of preoccupation but that door nearly opens ten doors upon him.” He also said: “Wretched is the son of Adam: he deems his wealth little and his deeds little; he rejoices at a loss in his religion and grieves at a loss in his worldly life.”

Al-Hasan wrote to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz: “Peace be upon you. To proceed: It is as if the last of those for whom death is decreed has died.” Umar replied: “Peace be upon you. It is as if the world never existed and the Hereafter has always been.”

Al-Fudayl ibn Iyad said: “Entering the world is easy, but exiting it is difficult.” Some said: “How astonishing for one who knows death is certain to rejoice! How astonishing for one who knows Hell is certain to laugh! How astonishing for one who sees the world’s vicissitudes with its people to be at ease with it! How astonishing for one who knows divine decree is certain to toil!”

A man from Najran, two hundred years old, came to Muawiyah, may God be pleased with him, who asked him: “How have you found the world?” He said: “Years of trial and years of ease, day by day and night by night; a child is born and a person perishes. Were it not for the newborn, creation would vanish; were it not for the deceased, the world would be too narrow for its inhabitants.” He said: “Ask what you wish.” He said: “Return past time or repel impending death.” He said: “I have no power over that.” He said: “I have no need of you.”

Dawud al-Tai, may God have mercy on him, said: “O son of Adam, you rejoice at attaining your hope, yet you only attained it by the expiration of your term. Then you delayed your deeds, whose benefit will be for another.” Bishr said: “Whoever asks God for the world is only asking for prolonged standing before Him.” Abu Hazim said: “There is nothing in the world that pleases you but that God has attached to it something that displeases you.”

Al-Hasan said: “The soul of the son of Adam does not depart the world except with three regrets: that he was not satiated with what he gathered, that he did not attain what he hoped for, and that he did not prepare good provision for what he advances toward.” It was said to an ascetic: “You have attained riches.” He said: “Only he who is freed from the bondage of the world attains riches.”

Abu Sulayman said: “None abstains from worldly desires except one who has in his heart what preoccupies him with the Hereafter.” Malik ibn Dinar said: “We have agreed upon love of the world, so we do not command one another nor forbid one another. God will not leave us in this state. I wonder, what punishment of God will descend upon us?” Abu Hazim said: “A little of the world distracts from much of the Hereafter.” Al-Hasan said: “Belittle the world, for by God, it is not more belittled for anyone than for he who belittles it.” He also said: “When God wills good for a servant, He gives him a gift from the world, then withholds. When it is exhausted, He restores it. And when a servant is degraded in His sight, He spreads the world out for him.”

One of them would say in his supplication: “O You who hold the sky from falling upon the earth except by Your permission, hold the world back from me.” Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: “What do you think if a man fasted perpetually without breaking, stood in prayer at night without sleeping, gave all his wealth in charity, fought in God’s cause, and avoided God’s prohibitions, yet on the Day of Resurrection he is brought and it is said: ‘This one magnified what God made small and made small what God magnified’—how do you think his state will be? Which of us is not like this? The world is great in our sight despite the sins and transgressions we have committed.”

Abu Hazim said: “The burden of the world and the Hereafter is severe. As for

Exposition of Admonitions Concerning the Censure and Description of This World

Some have said: O people, work with deliberation, and be in awe of God. Do not be deluded by hope and forgetfulness of the appointed term. Do not rely upon this world, for it is treacherous and deceitful. It adorns itself with its delusions for you and beguiles you with its false hopes. It has beautified itself for its suitors, becoming like a displayed bride towards whom eyes gaze, hearts are devoted, and souls are enamored. How many a lover has it slain, and how many a one secure in it has it abandoned! So look upon it with the eye of reality, for it is an abode of many calamities, and its Creator has censured it. Its newness decays, its dominion perishes, its mighty are humbled, its abundance diminishes, its possessor dies, and its good passes away. Awaken, may God have mercy on you, from your heedlessness, and rouse from your slumber before it is said: 'So-and-so is ill' or 'a gravely sick burden.' Is there any guide to the remedy? Is there any path to the physician? Then physicians are summoned for you, but no cure is hoped for. Then it is said: 'So-and-so has made a will' and 'his wealth has been accounted for.' Then it is said: 'His tongue has grown heavy, so he no longer speaks to his brothers nor recognizes his neighbors.' At that, your brow sweats, your groans follow one another, your certainty is confirmed, your eyelids strain, your suspicions prove true, your tongue falters, your brothers weep, and it is said to you: 'This is your son, so-and-so, and this is your brother, so-and-so.' You are prevented from speech, so you do not utter; a seal is placed upon your tongue, so it does not speak. Then the decree descends upon you, and your soul is extracted from your limbs. Then it is ascended to the heavens. At that, your brothers gather, and your shrouds are brought forth. They wash you, shroud you, your ties are severed, your enviers find rest, and your family turns to your wealth, while you remain held hostage by your deeds.

And one of them said to a certain king: The people most deserving to censure and despise the world are those to whom it is spread out and from whom his need is given, for he expects a calamity that may overtake his wealth and sweep it away, or come upon his gathering and scatter it, or come to his authority and demolish it from its foundations, or creep into his body and sicken it, or bereave him of something he is miserly with among his loved ones. The world is most deserving of censure; it is the taker of what it gives, the returner of what it bestows. While it laughs with its companion, it makes others laugh at him; while it weeps for him, it makes others weep over him; while it opens its hand in giving, it opens it to take back. It places the crown upon the head of its companion today and covers him in dust tomorrow. It is indifferent to what has gone and what remains; it finds in the remaining a substitute for the departed and is content with any replacement for anything. Al-Hasan al-Basri wrote to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz: To proceed: Indeed, the world is an abode of departure, not an abode of settlement. Adam, peace be upon him, was only sent down from Paradise as a punishment. So beware of it, O Commander of the Faithful, for the provision from it is to leave it, and the richness from it is its poverty. In every moment it has a slain one. It humbles whom it has honored and impoverishes whom it has enriched. It is like poison eaten by one who does not know it, and in it is his destruction. So be in it like one treating his wounds: he abstains a little, fearing what he dislikes for a long time, and he endures the severity of the medicine, fearing the prolonging of the illness. Beware of this treacherous, tottering, deceitful abode which has adorned itself with its deceptions, beguiled with its delusions, settled with its hopes, and beautified itself for its suitors. It has become like a displayed bride. Eyes gaze upon it, hearts are infatuated with it, and souls are enamored of it, while it is averse to all its spouses. So neither does the one who remains take warning from the one who has passed, nor does the later one take admonition from the earlier one, nor does the one who knows God, Mighty and Majestic, heed when He informs him about it. An enamored lover of it who has attained his desire from it becomes deluded and transgresses and forgets the appointed meeting, so he is preoccupied in it until his foot slips. Then his regret becomes great and his remorse increases, and the agonies of death and its pain and the regrets of loss gather upon him, despising him. And one desirous of it who does not attain what he sought from it and does not relieve his soul from toil departs without provision and arrives without a resting place. So beware of it, O Commander of the Faithful, and be most cautious of it when you are most at ease within it; for the companion of the world, whenever he feels secure in a joy from it, it dispatches him to a disliked thing. The one joyful among its people is one who will depart, the benefactor within it is treacherous and harmful. Ease from it has been connected to tribulation, and permanence within it has been made to lead to annihilation. Its joy is mixed with sorrows; what has turned away and receded does not return, nor does one know what is coming so he may await it. Its hopes are false, its aspirations are vain, its purity is turbid, and its life is wretched. The son of Adam within it is in peril. If he reasons and reflects, he is in peril from blessings and on guard against tribulation. If the Creator had not informed about it with a report and had not struck for it a similitude, the world itself would have awakened the sleeper and alerted the heedless. So how is it when from God, Mighty and Majestic, has come a deterrent concerning it and an admonisher within it? It has no worth with God, Glorified be His praise, and He has not looked upon it since He created it. It was presented to your Prophet, peace be upon him, with its keys and treasuries—that would not diminish him in the sight of God by a mosquito's wing—but he refused to accept it, disliking to oppose God's command, or to love what his Creator dislikes, or to elevate what his Master has lowered. So He withheld it from the righteous as a test and spread it out for His enemies as a delusion. Thus, the one deluded by it, empowered within it, thinks he is honored by it, and forgets what God, Mighty and Majestic, did with Muhammad, peace be upon him, when he tied a stone to his stomach. The narration has come from him, from his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, that He said to Moses, peace be upon him: 'When you see wealth approaching, say: "A sin whose punishment has been hastened." And when you see poverty, say: "Welcome, the emblem of the righteous."' If you wish, follow the companion of the Spirit and the Word, Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him, for he used to say: 'My constant state is hunger, my emblem is fear, my garment is wool, my lamp in winter is the rising sun and the moon, my mount is my two feet, my food and fruit are what the earth brings forth. I go to sleep possessing nothing, and I wake up possessing nothing, and there is no one on earth richer than I.' And Wahb ibn Munabbih said: When God, Mighty and Majestic, sent Moses and Aaron, peace be upon them, to Pharaoh, He said: 'Let not his attire that he wears from the world alarm you, for his forelock is in My hand; he does not speak, blink, or breathe except by My leave. And let not what he enjoys of it impress you, for it is merely the flower of the life of this world and the adornment of the wanton. If I wished to adorn you both with an adornment from the world such that Pharaoh, upon seeing it, would know his power is incapable of what you have been given, I would have done so. But I prefer for you to be averse to that, so I withhold that from you. Thus do I treat My allies; I indeed keep them from its pleasures as a compassionate shepherd drives his sheep away from pastures of destruction, and I keep them far from its delights as a compassionate shepherd keeps his camels away from dwellings of peril. That is not due to their being lowly in My sight, but so that they may receive their share of My honor, safe and complete. My allies only adorn themselves before Me with humility, fear, submission, and piety, which grow in their hearts and appear on their bodies. These are their garments that they wear, their covering that they show, their inner feeling that they sense, their salvation by which they succeed, their hope which they anticipate, their glory in which they take pride, and their mark by which they are

Know that you shall die and be resurrected after death, be held accountable for your deeds, and be recompensed accordingly. Let not the life of this world deceive you, for it is surrounded by tribulation, known for its transience, and described by betrayal. All within it is destined to vanish, shifting among its inhabitants like a revolving waterwheel—its conditions do not endure, and none who dwell in it are safe from its harm. While its people may be in ease and joy, suddenly they are in trial and delusion. Its states are ever-changing and its turns shifting. Life within it is blameworthy, and its prosperity does not last; its people are but targets, struck by its arrows and cut down by its fatalities. Each has his destined end within it and his allotted portion fulfilled.

Know, O servants of God, that you and what you possess in this world are on the path of those who have passed before you—those who lived longer lives, wielded greater power, built more enduring dwellings, and left more distant traces. Yet now their voices are silenced and stilled after much activity, their bodies decayed, their dwellings empty upon their foundations, and their traces erased. They have exchanged lofty palaces, couches, and cushioned seats for leaning stones and rocks in low, sunken graves. Their abode is near, yet its inhabitant is a stranger—lonely among the living, neglected by the preoccupied. They find no comfort in the company of the inhabited world, nor do they maintain the bonds of neighbors and brothers, despite the closeness of place and proximity of dwelling. How could there be connection between them when calamity has crushed them with its weight, and gravel and dust have consumed them? After life, they have become dead; after the freshness of living, mere dust. Loved ones grieve for them, and they dwell beneath the earth, departed with no return. Far, far indeed! "Nay, but it is a word that he speaks; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected." It is as if you have already reached what they reached of tribulation and solitude in the abode of eternity, pledged to that resting place and gathered in that repository.

How would it be for you if you witnessed the matters [of the Hereafter], the graves were overturned, what is within the breasts laid bare, and you were presented for reckoning before the Majestic King—hearts trembling in dread of past sins, veils and curtains torn away from you, and your faults and secrets exposed? There, every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. Indeed, God Almighty says: "That He may reward those who did evil with what they did, and reward those who did good with the best." And He says: "And the Record will be placed, and you will see the criminals fearful of what is in it." May God make us and you among those who act by His Book and follow His allies, until He settles us and you in the Abode of Permanence by His grace—verily, He is Praiseworthy, Glorious.

A sage said: The days are arrows and people are targets; time shoots you each day with its arrows and cuts you short with its nights and days until it consumes all your parts. How then can your safety remain with the days assailing you and the nights swiftly passing through your body? If what the days have wrought of diminishment within you were unveiled, you would dread every coming day and find the passing hour burdensome. Yet God’s management is above the management of reflection, and by turning away from the perils of the world, the taste of its pleasures is found. Indeed, it is a matter of bitterness when the wise kneads it, and its describer is wearied by the apparent faults of its actions. What it brings of wonders is more than any admonisher can encompass. O God, guide us to what is right.

Another sage, when asked to describe the world and estimate its permanence, said: The world is your moment in which your glance returns to you, for what has passed you is beyond your grasp, and what has not come, you have no knowledge of. Time is an approaching day whose night you lament and whose hours you fold away; its events succeed one another upon man with change and diminishment. Time is charged with scattering gatherings, severing ties, and shifting states. Hope is long, life is short, and to God all matters return.

Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, mercy be upon him, delivered a sermon saying: O people, you have been created for a matter—if you believe it true, then you are foolish; if you deny it, then you are ruined. You were created for eternity, yet you are transferred from one abode to another. O servants of God, you are in an abode where your food chokes you and your drink makes you gag. No blessing pleases you except by parting with another you hate to lose. So work for that to which you are proceeding and wherein you will abide forever. Then weeping overcame him, and he descended.

Ali, may God honor his countenance, said in his sermon: I counsel you to fear God and to abandon the world that is abandoning you, even if you do not love to leave it—the world that wears out your bodies while you seek to renew them. For your likeness and its likeness is like a people on a journey who traversed a path as if they had completed it, and they reached knowledge as if they had attained it. How long can the traveler proceed until he reaches the destination? And how long can one who has but a day in this world remain, with a swift pursuer seeking him until he departs from it? So do not grieve over its misery and afflictions, for they are bound to cease; and do not rejoice in its pleasures and comforts, for they are destined to vanish. I marvel at one who seeks the world while death seeks him, and at one who is heedless though he is not forgotten.

And Muhammad ibn al-Husayn said: When the people of virtue, knowledge, insight, and refinement learned that God, the Mighty and Majestic, had debased this world, that He did not deem it worthy for His close friends, that it is insignificant and paltry in His sight, and that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, renounced it and warned his companions of its trial, they consumed from it moderately and gave preference to surplus, they took from it what sufficed and left what distracts. They wore garments that merely covered their nakedness, they ate the humblest food that satisfied hunger, and they looked upon the world with the eye that it is perishing, and upon the Hereafter that it is enduring. So they took provision from the world like a traveler's provision, thereby ruining the world and building the Hereafter with it. They gazed upon the Hereafter with their hearts, knowing they would behold it with their eyes, and they journeyed to it with their hearts, knowing they would journey to it with their bodies. They toiled a little and enjoyed comfort for a long time—all of that by the grace of their Generous Lord, loving what He loved for them and disliking what He disliked for them.

An Exposition of the World's Nature Through Parables

Know that this world is swift to perish and near to passing away. It promises permanence, then fails in its pledge. You look upon it and see it still and settled, yet it is moving with violent motion and departing with rapid departure. However, the one who looks upon it may not perceive its movement, so he feels secure in it; he only perceives it at its passing. Its likeness is the shadow, for it is moving while still—moving in reality, still in appearance. Its motion is not grasped by the outward sight, but by the inward insight. And when the world was mentioned before al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, he recited and said:

The intelligent person is not deceived by the dreams of sleep, for they are like a fleeting shadow.

Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God honor his countenance, would often recite and say:

O people devoted to worldly pleasures, to be deceived by a fleeting shadow is sheer folly.

It is said that this is from His saying. And it is recounted: A Bedouin came to stay with a people, and they presented food to him, so he ate. Then he rose and went to the shade of their tent and slept there. They then pulled up the tent, and the sun struck him, so he awoke. He rose, saying:

Indeed, the world is but a fleeting shadow; inevitably, a day will come when your shadow vanishes.

And likewise it is said:

And indeed, the one who clings to his worldly life is grasping a rope of delusion, and his greatest concern is but vanity.

Another example of the worldly life, in terms of its deception through its illusions and then the bankruptcy that follows their escape. It resembles the visions of sleep and the confused fragments of dreams. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The worldly life is a dream, and its inhabitants are being requited and punished upon it." Yunus ibn 'Ubayd said: I have only likened myself in the worldly life to a man who slept and saw in his dream what he disliked and what he loved, and while he was in that state, he awoke. Likewise, people are asleep; when they die, they awaken, and then they have nothing in their hands of what they relied upon and rejoiced in. A sage was asked: What thing most resembles the worldly life? He replied: The dreams of a sleeper.

Another similitude of the worldly life in its enmity toward its people and its destruction of its children. Know that the nature of the world is to be subtle in gradual enticement at first and to proceed to destruction in the end. It is like a woman who adorns herself for suitors until, when she marries them, she slaughters them. It has been related that Jesus, peace be upon him, was granted insight into the world and saw it in the form of a toothless old woman, adorned with every ornament. He said to her, "How many have you married?" She said, "I cannot count them." He said, "Did they all die naturally, or did they all leave you?" She said, "Rather, I killed them all." Then Jesus, peace be upon him, said, "Woe to your remaining husbands! How do they not take heed from your past husbands! How you destroy them one after another, yet they are not wary of you!"

Another example of the world's deception, where its outward appearance contradicts its inner reality: Know that the world is adorned in its exteriors but ugly in its hidden secrets. It resembles an old woman who adorns herself to deceive people with her outward appearance. When they perceive her inner reality and lift the veil from her face, her ugliness becomes apparent to them, and they regret following her, ashamed of the weakness of their intellects in being deceived by her outward guise. Al-Ala ibn Ziyad said: I saw in a dream a very old woman with wrinkled skin, adorned with every ornament of the world, and people were gathered around her, admiring and gazing at her. I came and looked, astonished at their gazing upon her and their turning toward her, and I said to her: Woe to you, who are you? She said: Do you not know me? I said: I do not know! Who are you? She said: I am the world. I said: I seek refuge in God from your evil! She said: If you wish to be protected from my evil, then despise the dirham. Abu Bakr ibn 'Ayyash said: I saw the world in a dream as a disfigured, gray-haired old woman, clapping her hands, with a crowd behind her following her, clapping and dancing. When she was directly opposite me, she turned to me and said: If I could seize you, I would do to you what I have done to these. Then Abu Bakr wept and said: I saw this before I came to Baghdad. Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said: Ibn 'Abbas said: The world will be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a gray-haired, blue-eyed old woman, with protruding fangs and disfigured in her creation. She will look down upon the creatures, and it will be said to them: Do you recognize this? They will say: We seek refuge in God from knowing this! It will be said: This is the world over which you contended, because of it you severed ties of kinship, and because of it you envied, hated, and were deceived. Then she will be cast into Hellfire, and she will call out: O Lord, where are my followers and companions? And God, Mighty and Majestic, will say: Join her followers and companions to her. Al-Fudayl said: It reached me that a man's spirit was taken on a journey, and there was a woman on the side of the road adorned with every kind of ornament from jewelry and garments, and no one passed by her except that she wounded him. When she turned her back, she was the most beautiful thing people had seen, and when she turned forward, she was the ugliest thing people had seen—a gray-haired, blue-eyed, blind old woman. He said: So I said: I seek refuge in God from you! She said: No, by God. God will not protect you from me until you despise the dirham! He said: So I said: Who are you? She said: I am the world.

Another example of the world and man's passage through it: Know that states are three: a state in which you were not a thing—that is, what preceded your existence into eternity past; a state in which you will not be a witness to the world—that is, what follows your death into eternity future; and a state intermediate between eternity future and eternity past—which is the days of your life in the world. So look at the measure of its length and relate it to the two ends of eternity past and eternity future, until you know that it is less than a brief halt on a long journey. For this reason, the Prophet ﷺ said, "What have I to do with the world! My likeness and the likeness of the world is that of a rider traveling on a summer's day; he came upon a tree and rested in its shade for an hour, then departed and left it." Whoever sees the world with this eye will not rely upon it, nor will he care whether his days pass in hardship and constraint or in ease and comfort; rather, he will not lay brick upon brick. The Messenger of God ﷺ passed away without having laid brick upon brick or reed upon reed. And when he saw one of the Companions building a house of plaster, he said, "I see the matter as swifter than this," and disapproved of it. To this, Jesus, peace be upon him, alluded when he said: The world is a bridge, so cross it and do not build upon it. This is a clear example, for the life of this world is a passage to the Hereafter; the cradle is the first milestone at the head of the bridge, the grave is the other milestone, and between them is a limited distance. Among people, some have crossed half the bridge, some a third, some two-thirds, and some have but a single step remaining—and they are heedless of it. However it may be, crossing is inevitable; and to build upon the bridge and adorn it with all kinds of adornments while you are passing over it is the height of ignorance and loss.

Another example of the world in the softness of its approach and the harshness of its source: Know that the beginnings of the world appear soft and gentle, so that the one who wades into it imagines that the sweetness of its ease is like the sweetness of wading into it—but far from it! For wading into the world is easy, but emerging from it safely is difficult. ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, wrote to Salman al-Farsi with its likeness, saying: The likeness of the world is that of a snake—soft to the touch, but its venom kills. So turn away from what delights you in it due to the little that accompanies you from it, and cast off its worries by what you are certain of—your parting from it. Be most cautious of it when you are most at ease within it, for its companion, whenever he feels secure in it from a joy, is removed from it by an adversity. And peace.

Another example of the world in terms of the difficulty of escaping its consequences after plunging into it: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The likeness of the possessor of worldly life is that of one walking in water. Can one who walks in water avoid getting his feet wet?" This reveals to you the ignorance of people who imagined that they could immerse themselves in the pleasures of the world with their bodies while their hearts remained purified from it and its attachments severed from their innermost beings. That is a deception from Satan. Indeed, if they were to be removed from what they are in, they would be among the greatest grievers at parting from it. Just as walking on water inevitably entails moisture that clings to the feet, so too does involvement with the world entail attachment and darkness in the heart. Indeed, attachment to the world with the heart prevents the sweetness of worship. Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Truly I say to you, as a sick person looks at food but finds no pleasure in it due to the severity of pain, so too does the possessor of worldly life find no pleasure in worship nor taste its sweetness while he harbors love for the world. Truly I say to you, just as a beast, if not ridden and broken in, becomes unruly and its temperament changes, so too do hearts, if not softened by the remembrance of death and the rigor of worship, become hard and coarse. Truly I say to you, as a waterskin, unless it is punctured or dried out, is likely to become a vessel for honey, so too are hearts, unless pierced by desires, stained by greed, or hardened by comfort, destined to become vessels for wisdom." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "What remains of the world is but trial and tribulation. The likeness of the deeds of any one of you is like a vessel: if its top is good, its bottom is good, and if its top is corrupt, its bottom is corrupt."

Another example of what remains of this world and its fleeting nature compared to what has passed: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The likeness of this world is that of a garment torn from its beginning to its end, leaving only a thread holding it at its edge, and soon that thread will snap."

Another example of worldly attachments leading one to another until destruction: Jesus, peace be upon him, said: The likeness of a seeker of this world is that of one who drinks from the sea; the more he drinks, the more his thirst increases, until it kills him.

Another example of how the end of worldly life contradicts its beginning, and of the freshness of its early stages and the foulness of its outcomes: Know that the desires of this world are delightful in the heart, just as the pleasures of food are delightful in the stomach. Yet at the moment of death, the servant will find in his heart toward worldly desires such repulsion, stench, and ugliness as the stomach finds toward delicious foods when they reach their final stage in it. And just as food, the more delicious its taste, the richer its fat, and the more evident its sweetness, the filthier and more foul-smelling its waste becomes, so too every desire in the heart that is more appetizing, delightful, and powerful—its stench, repulsiveness, and the distress it causes at death are more severe. Indeed, this is observable even in this world: for if a person’s home is destroyed and his wealth and children are taken, his affliction, pain, and grief over everything he has lost are in proportion to the pleasure he took in it, his love for it, and his greed for it. Thus, whatever is more appetizing and delightful to him in its presence becomes more grievous and bitter in its absence. And death means nothing but the loss of what is in the world. It has been narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to al-Dahhak ibn Sufyan al-Kalabi: "Is your food not brought to you, seasoned and garnished, then you drink milk and water over it?" He said: "Yes." He said: "Then what does it become?" He said: "To what you know, O Messenger of God." He said: "Thus God Almighty has likened this world to what the food of the son of Adam becomes." And Ubayy ibn Ka‘b said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "This world has been likened to the son of Adam; so look at what comes out of the son of Adam, even if he seasons and garnishes it—what does it become?" And he (peace be upon him) said: "God has likened this world to the food of the son of Adam, and He has likened the food of the son of Adam to this world, even if he seasons and garnishes it." And al-Hasan said: "I have seen them flavor it with spices and perfume, then they throw it where you have seen." And God Almighty has said: "Let man look to his food." Ibn ‘Abbas said: "To its waste." And a man said to Ibn ‘Umar: "I want to ask you, but I feel ashamed." He said: "Do not be ashamed; ask." He said: "When one of us relieves himself, then stands and looks at that from him?" He said: "Yes, for the angel says to him: 'Look at what you were stingy with; look at what it has become.'" And Bishr ibn Ka‘b used to say: "Come, so that I may show you the world." Then he would take them to a rubbish heap and say: "Look at their fruits, their chickens, their honey, and their clarified butter."

Another example comparing this world to the Hereafter: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The world compared to the Hereafter is but like what one of you dips his finger into the sea—let him then see what returns with it."

Another example of the worldly life and its people in their preoccupation with worldly pleasures and their heedlessness of the Hereafter, and their immense loss because of it: Know that the people of this world, in their heedlessness, are like a group who boarded a ship, and it brought them to an island. The captain ordered them to disembark to relieve themselves, warning them not to linger and cautioning them about the ship's imminent departure. They scattered across the island. Some relieved themselves and hurried back to the ship, finding the place empty; they took the most spacious, comfortable, and suitable spot for their needs. Others lingered on the island, gazing at its wondrous lights, flowers, dense groves, the sweet melodies and strange, harmonious tunes of its birds, and observing from its wilderness its stones, jewels, and minerals of various colors and beautiful shapes, with marvelous engravings that captivate the eyes with the beauty of their emeralds and the wonders of their forms. Then they awoke to the danger of missing the ship and returned to it, finding only a narrow, cramped place, and settled there. Some became engrossed in those shells and stones, captivated by their beauty, and their souls could not bear to leave them, so they gathered a quantity to take along. On the ship, they found only a narrow space, and what they carried of stones made it even more cramped; it became a burden and a calamity for them. They regretted taking them but could not throw them away and found no place to put them, so they carried them on their necks in the ship, lamenting their acquisition, yet regret availed them nothing. Some plunged into the thickets, forgot the vessel, and wandered far in their sightseeing and amusement until they did not hear the captain's call, being preoccupied with eating those fruits, inhaling those scents, and strolling among those trees—all the while fearing for themselves from wild beasts, not free from stumbles and calamities, nor from thorns that snag their clothes, branches that wound their bodies, spines that pierce their feet, terrifying sounds that startle them, and brambles that tear their garments, expose their shame, and prevent them from turning back even if they wished. When the call of the ship's people reached them, they turned back burdened with what they had, but found no place on the vessel, so they remained on the shore until they died of hunger. Some never heard the call, and the ship sailed away; among them, some were devoured by beasts, some wandered lost until they perished, some died in the mire, some were bitten by snakes—thus they were scattered like rotting carcasses.

As for one who reaches the vessel burdened by the weight of the flowers and stones he has gathered, they have enslaved him and preoccupied him with grief in guarding them and fear of losing them, and they have constricted his space. It is not long before those flowers wither and those colors and stones grow dull, and the foulness of their scent appears, so that while being constricting upon him, they also harm him with their stench and repulsiveness. He finds no recourse except to cast them into the sea to flee from them, yet what he consumed of them has left its effect upon him. He does not reach the homeland except after ailments have appeared upon him from those odors, arriving sick and debilitated. One who turns back soon has missed nothing but spaciousness of place, and endures the constriction of space for a time, but when he reaches the homeland, he finds rest. And one who turns back first finds the ampler space and reaches the homeland safely. This is the likeness of the people of this world in their preoccupation with their immediate shares and their forgetfulness of their source and destination, and their heedlessness of the outcome of their affairs. How ugly it is for one who claims to be insightful and rational to be deceived by the stones of the earth—which are gold and silver—and the withered vegetation—which is the adornment of this world—when not a bit of that will accompany him at death; rather, it becomes a burden and a calamity upon him, while in the present it preoccupies him with grief and fear over it. This is the condition of all creation except whom God, Mighty and Majestic, has protected.

Another example of people's immersion in worldly life and their weak faith: Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, reported: It reached me that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to his companions: "My parable and your parable and the parable of this world is like that of a people who traversed a barren desert until they no longer knew whether they had covered more of it or more remained. They exhausted their provisions, lost their mounts, and were left stranded in the midst of the desert with no supplies and no beasts of burden, thus becoming certain of their destruction. While they were in that state, a man emerged before them, his head dripping with water, wearing fine garments. They said: 'This one is recently from cultivated lands, and he has only come to you from nearby.' When he reached them, he said: 'O people!' They replied: 'O you!' He asked: 'What is your condition?' They said: 'As you see.' He said: 'What if I guide you to abundant water and green gardens—what will you do?' They said: 'We will not disobey you in anything.' He said: 'Give me your pledges and covenants by God.' So they gave him their pledges and covenants by God that they would not disobey him in anything. Then he led them to abundant water and green gardens, and he stayed among them as long as God willed. Then he said: 'O people!' They replied: 'O you!' He said: 'Depart!' They asked: 'To where?' He said: 'To water unlike your water and to gardens unlike your gardens.' The majority of them said: 'By God, we did not find this until we thought we would never find it, and what could we do with a life better than this?' But a group—and they were the minority—said: 'Did you not give this man your pledges and covenants by God that you would not disobey him in anything? And he was truthful to you in the first part of his speech, so by God, he will surely be truthful in the last part.' So he departed with those who followed him, while the rest remained behind. Then an enemy overtook them, and they awoke as captives and slain."

Another example of people delighting in this world only to be afflicted by its departure: Know that the likeness of people in what they are given of this world is that of a man who prepared a dwelling and adorned it, then invited people to his home in succession, one after another. One entered his home, and he presented to him a golden platter upon which were incense and fragrant herbs for him to inhale and then leave for the one who would follow—not to possess it and take it. But the guest was ignorant of the custom and thought it had been gifted to him, so his heart clung to it, believing it was his. When it was taken back from him, he became vexed and grieved. Yet whoever was aware of the custom benefited from it, gave thanks, and returned it with a contented heart and an expanded breast. Similarly, whoever recognizes God’s way concerning this world knows that it is a house of hospitality laid out for wayfarers, not for permanent residents, so that they may take provision from it and benefit from what it contains, just as travelers benefit from borrowed items, without devoting their entire hearts to it, lest their calamity become immense when they part from it. These are the parables of this world, its harms, and its perils. We ask God, the Subtle, the All-Aware, for gracious assistance through His generosity and forbearance.

An Exposition on the True Nature and Reality of the World in Relation to the Servant

Know that merely understanding the censure of the world is insufficient unless you know what the censured world is? What from it must be avoided and what must not? Thus, it is necessary that we clarify what the censured world is—that which is commanded to be avoided because it is a cutting enemy blocking the path to God. We say: your world and your hereafter are expressions for two states among the states of your heart. That which is near and immediate is called the world, and it is everything before death; that which is delayed and distant is called the hereafter, and it is everything after death. So, everything in which you have a share, portion, aim, desire, and immediate pleasure before death is the world in your regard. However, not everything toward which you have an inclination and in which you have a portion and share is blameworthy; rather, it is of three divisions. The first division is that which accompanies you into the hereafter, and its fruit remains with you after death—and it is two things only: knowledge and action. By knowledge, I mean knowledge of God, His attributes, His actions, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the dominion of His earth and heaven, and knowledge of the law of His Prophet. By action, I mean worship performed purely for the sake of God, exalted be He. A knower may find intimacy in knowledge until it becomes the most delightful thing to him, so he abandons sleep, food, and marital relations for its pleasure, because it is more desirable to him than all of that—thus it has become an immediate share in the world. But when we mention the censured world, we do not count this as part of the world at all; rather, we say it is from the hereafter. Likewise, a worshiper may find intimacy in his worship and delight in it to such an extent that if he were prevented from it, it would be the greatest punishment for him. Indeed, one of them said: "I fear nothing from death except that it will come between me and standing in prayer at night." Another said: "O God, grant me the strength for prayer, bowing, and prostration in the grave." Thus, prayer has become among his immediate shares, and every immediate share can be called by the name "world" etymologically due to its nearness. However, we do not mean that by the censured world. And He (peace be upon him) said: "Three things from your world have been made beloved to me: women, perfume, and the coolness of my eye in prayer," thus including prayer among the pleasures of the world. Similarly, everything that enters into sense and observation is from the realm of testimony and is from the world, and the delight in moving the limbs in bowing and prostration occurs only in the world, hence he attributed it to the world. However, in this book we only address the censured world, so we say: this is not from the world.

The second category: that which stands opposite to it at the farthest extreme, encompassing all that contains an immediate share but bears no fruit whatsoever in the Hereafter. This includes taking pleasure in all acts of disobedience, indulging in permissible enjoyments that exceed the measure of needs, and the superfluities that fall under the umbrella of luxury and frivolities—such as delighting in heaped-up treasures of gold and silver, branded horses, cattle, tilled land, young male and female servants, steeds, livestock, palaces, dwellings, exquisite garments, and the pleasures of food. The servant's portion from all of this is the blameworthy worldly life. As for what is considered excess or within the realm of necessity, there is lengthy consideration. It is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, appointed Abu al-Darda' over Homs, and he constructed a lavatory upon which he spent two dirhams. 'Umar wrote to him: "From 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, Commander of the Faithful, to 'Uwaymir. You had in the constructions of the Persians and Romans that which should have sufficed you from worldly adornment when God decreed its ruin. So when this letter of mine reaches you, I have transferred you to Damascus, you and your household." He remained there until he died. This, he considered an excess from the worldly life—so reflect upon it.

The Third Category: This is the intermediate between the two extremes. Every share in the immediate world that assists in the works of the Hereafter, such as the measure of sustenance from food and a single coarse shirt, and everything indispensable for a person to attain survival and health, through which he gains access to knowledge and action. This is not from the worldly life like the first category, because it assists the first category and is a means to it. So whenever a servant partakes of it with the intention of seeking aid through it for knowledge and action, he has not thereby partaken of the worldly life, nor has he thereby become among the children of the worldly life. But if his motive is the immediate share without seeking aid for piety, he affiliates with the second category and becomes part of the worldly life. And there does not remain with the servant at death except three attributes: the clarity of the heart—meaning its purity from impurities; his intimacy with the remembrance of God, Exalted is He; and his love for God, Mighty and Majestic. The clarity and purity of the heart are not attained except by refraining from the desires of the worldly life. Intimacy is not attained except by abundant remembrance of God, Exalted is He, and persistence in it. Love is not attained except by knowledge. And knowledge of God is not attained except by constant reflection. These three attributes are the saviors, the bringers of happiness after death.

As for the purification of the heart from worldly desires, it is among the means of salvation, for it becomes a shield between the servant and the punishment of God, as conveyed in the reports: "Indeed, the deeds of a servant contend on his behalf; when punishment approaches from the direction of his feet, the standing in night prayer comes to repel it, and when it approaches from the direction of his hands, charity comes to repel it."

As for intimacy and love, they are among the means of felicity, and they are what convey the servant to the delight of meeting and witnessing. This happiness is hastened after death until the time of vision in Paradise arrives, so the grave becomes a garden from the gardens of Paradise. How could the grave not be a garden from the gardens of Paradise for him when he had but one Beloved? And when obstacles used to hinder him from perpetual intimacy through constant remembrance and contemplation of His beauty, then the obstacles are lifted, and he is freed from the prison and left alone with his Beloved, arriving before Him joyful, unharmed by barriers, secure from hindrances? And how could the lover of this world not be tormented at death when he had no beloved but the world, and it is wrested from him, and he is prevented from it, and the ways of stratagem to return to it are blocked against him? Thus it is said:

What is the state of one for whom there is but one,
When that One is absent from him?

Death is not annihilation; rather, it is a departure from the pleasures of this world and an arrival unto God, Exalted is He. Therefore, the traveler on the path of the Hereafter is one who consistently adheres to the means of these three qualities: remembrance, reflection, and action—which wean him from worldly desires, make its delights hateful to him, and sever him from them. All of this is only possible with sound health of the body, and sound health is only attained through sustenance, clothing, and shelter, each of which requires its means. The measure of these three that is indispensable, if a servant takes it from this world for the sake of the Hereafter, he is not among the children of this world, and the world in his regard becomes a field sown for the Hereafter. But if he takes it for the sake of his own immediate gratification and with the aim of indulgence, he becomes among the children of this world and those who crave its shares, except that craving for worldly shares is divided into that which exposes its possessor to the punishment of the Hereafter—and that is called unlawful—and into that which comes between him and the highest ranks and exposes him to prolonged reckoning—and that is called lawful. The insightful one knows that prolonged standing in the plains of Resurrection for the sake of reckoning is also a punishment, for whoever is subjected to detailed reckoning is punished, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Its lawful entails reckoning and its unlawful entails punishment." He also said, "Its lawful is a punishment," but it is a punishment lighter than the punishment of the unlawful. Indeed, even if there were no reckoning, what is missed of the highest ranks in Paradise and what befalls the heart of regret over missing them for the sake of paltry, base, and fleeting shares is also a punishment. Judge your own state in this world by this: when you look at your peers who have surpassed you in worldly happiness, how your heart is torn with regret over it, even though you know it is a transient happiness with no permanence, marred by impurities with no purity. So what would be your state upon missing a happiness whose greatness description cannot encompass and whose end eternity cannot reach? Thus, whoever indulges in this world, even by hearing the song of a bird, looking at greenery, or drinking cool water, diminishes his share in the Hereafter many times over. This is the meaning of his saying, peace be upon him, to 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, "This is from the comfort about which you will be questioned," referring to the cool water. Being subjected to answering the question entails humiliation, fear, ruin, hardship, and waiting—all of which are a diminution of one's share. Therefore, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Spare me its reckoning," when he was thirsty and was offered cool water with honey; he swirled it in his hand and then refrained from drinking it. Thus, the world, its little and its much, its unlawful and its lawful, is accursed except for what aids in the fear of God, for that measure is not of the world. Whoever's knowledge is stronger and more precise, his caution from the comforts of this world is more severe. So much so that Jesus, peace be upon him, placed his head on a stone when he slept, then cast it away when Satan appeared to him and said, "You have desired the world!" And so much so that Solomon, peace be upon him, in his kingdom, would feed people delicious foods while he himself ate barley bread, thus making his kingship, by this path, a means of self-abasement and austerity. For abstaining from delicious foods while having the ability and access to them is more severe. For this reason, it is related that God, Exalted is He, folded this world away from our Prophet, peace be upon him, so he would pass days [in hunger], and he would tie a stone to his stomach from hunger. For this reason, God subjected the prophets and the saints, then the next best and the next, to trials and tribulations—all of this as a consideration for them and a favor upon them, so that their share of the Hereafter would be abundant, just as a compassionate parent prevents his child from the pleasure of fruits and obliges him to the pain of phlebotomy and cupping out of compassion and love for him, not out of miserliness toward him. From this, you have come to know that everything that is not for God is of this world, and whatever is for God is not of this world.

If you ask: What then belongs to God? I say: Things are of three categories. First, that which cannot conceivably belong to God—namely, what is termed sins, prohibitions, and varieties of indulgence in permissible matters. This is the purely blameworthy world, both in form and meaning. Second, that whose form is for God but which may be directed to other than God. This is threefold: reflection, remembrance, and abstaining from desires. For if these three occur in secret, with no motive other than the command of God and the Hereafter, they are for God and are not of the world. But if the aim of reflection is to seek knowledge for prestige, or to gain acceptance among people by displaying learning; or if the aim of abandoning desire is to preserve wealth, or to guard one’s health for bodily well-being, or to gain fame for asceticism—then this has become of the world in meaning, even if its outward form is thought to be for God Almighty. Third, that whose form is for the gratification of the self but whose meaning may be for God, such as eating, marriage, and everything connected to one’s survival and the survival of one’s offspring. If the intention is merely self-preservation, it is of the world; but if the intention is to seek aid through it for God-consciousness, then it is for God in meaning, even if its form is the form of worldly life. He (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks the world lawfully, competing and boasting, will meet God while He is angry with him. And whoever seeks it to maintain chastity from begging and to protect himself will come on the Day of Resurrection with his face like the moon on the night of the full moon.” So observe how this differs according to intention. Therefore, the world is the immediate portion of your self that is not needed for the matter of the Hereafter, and it is expressed as “desire.” To this points His saying, exalted is He: “And restrain the soul from desire, for indeed Paradise is the abode.” The gathering places of desire are five matters, which God Almighty has gathered in His saying: “Indeed, the life of this world is but play and amusement, adornment and mutual boasting, and competition in increase of wealth and children.” The concrete things from which these five arise are seven, gathered in His saying, exalted is He: “Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire—of women and children, heaped-up heaps of gold and silver, fine branded horses, cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life.” Thus you have come to know that whatever is for God is not of the world. The necessary amount of sustenance and what is indispensable of shelter and clothing is for God if the aim therein is the Face of God; but increasing beyond that is indulgence and is for other than God. Between indulgence and necessity is a degree expressed as “need.” It has two extremes and a middle: one extreme approaches the limit of necessity and does no harm, for restricting oneself to the limit of necessity is not possible; the other extreme vies with the side of indulgence, draws near to it, and should be guarded against. Between them are similar intermediates, and whoever hovers around the forbidden pasture is likely to fall into it.

Prudence lies in caution, piety, and drawing as close as possible to the limit of necessity, following the example of the prophets and the saints, peace be upon them; for they would reduce themselves to the limit of necessity. Indeed, Uways al-Qarani was such that his family thought him insane due to the severity of his self-restriction. They built him a room at the gate of their house, and years would pass—one, two, three—without them seeing his face. He would leave at the first call to prayer and return to his dwelling after the last evening prayer. His food was date pits he would gather; whenever he found a dry date, he would hide it for his breakfast. If he found nothing to sustain him from such dry dates, he would sell the pits and buy with their price what would sustain him. His clothing was from what he gathered from rubbish heaps—pieces of woolen garments—which he would wash in the Euphrates, patch together, and then wear. That was his attire. Sometimes children would pass by and throw stones at him, thinking him mad. He would say to them, "O my brothers, if you must throw at me, then throw small stones, for I fear you will wound my heel, and the time of prayer will come while I find no water." Such was his conduct.

Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, magnified his status, saying, "I sense the breath of the Merciful coming from the direction of Yemen," alluding to him, may God have mercy on him. When Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, assumed the caliphate, he said, "O people, let whoever among you is from Iraq stand." They stood. He said, "Be seated, except those from Kufa." They sat except those. He said, "Be seated, except those from Murad." They sat except those. He said, "Be seated, except those from Qarn." They all sat except one man. Umar said to him, "Are you from Qarn?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Do you know Uways ibn Amir al-Qarani?" He described him. The man said, "And what of him? Why do you ask about him, O Commander of the Faithful? By God, there is none among us more foolish, more insane, more unsociable, or more lowly than he!" Umar, may God be pleased with him, wept and then said, "I only said what I said because I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say, 'There will enter into his intercession the likes of Rabi'ah and Mudar.'"

Harmala ibn Hayyan said: When I heard this statement from Umar ibn al-Khattab, I journeyed to Kufa, having no concern but to seek Uways al-Qarani and ask about him, until I came upon him sitting on the bank of the Euphrates at midday, performing ablution and washing his garment. I recognized him by the description given to me: a fleshy man, very dark-skinned, shaven-headed, with thick beard, greatly altered, of repulsive countenance and awe-inspiring appearance. I greeted him, and he returned the greeting and looked at me. I said, "God give you life, O man," and extended my hand to shake his, but he refused to shake it. I said, "May God have mercy on you, O Uways, and forgive you. How are you, may God have mercy on you?" Then tears choked me out of love for him and pity for him when I saw his condition as I saw, until I wept and he wept. He said, "And you, may God give you life, O Harmala ibn Hayyan. How are you, my brother, and who directed you to me?" I said, "God." He said, "There is no god but God, glory be to God. 'Indeed, the promise of our Lord is fulfilled.'" I was astonished that he knew me, for by God I had never seen him before, nor he me! I said, "From where do you know my name and my father's name, when I have never seen you before today?" He said, "'The All-Knowing, the All-Aware informed me.' And my spirit recognized your spirit when my soul spoke to your soul. Verily, spirits have souls like the souls of bodies, and indeed the believers recognize one another and love one another through the spirit of God, even if they do not meet. They become acquainted and converse, even if dwellings separate them and abodes scatter them."

I said, "Relate to me, may God have mercy on you, a hadith from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that I may hear from you." He said, "I did not reach the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, nor did I have companionship with him—my father and mother be his ransom—but I saw men who had accompanied him, and reports of his speech reached me as they reached you. I do not wish to open for myself this door—to become a narrator, a jurist, or a judge—for in myself I am occupied away from people, O Harmala ibn Hayyan!"

I said, "My brother, recite to me a verse from the Quran that I may hear from you, and pray for me with supplications, and counsel me with counsel that I may preserve from you, for I love you in God with intense love." He stood, took my hand on the bank of the Euphrates, and said, "I seek refuge in God, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan," then wept. Then he said, "My Lord has said, and true is the word of my Lord, and the truest speech is His speech." Then he recited, "'We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in play. We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know,'" until he reached, "'Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.'" Then he gasped a gasp such that I thought he had fainted. Then he said, "O son of Hayyan, your father Hayyan died, and soon you will die, either to Paradise or to the Fire. Your father Adam died, and your mother Eve died, and Noah died, and Abraham, the intimate friend of the Merciful, died, and Moses, the confidant of the Merciful, died, and David, the vicegerent of the Merciful, died, and Muhammad, peace be upon him and upon them, the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds, died, and Abu Bakr, the caliph of the Muslims, died, and Umar ibn al-Khattab, my brother and my confidant, died." Then he said, "O my Umar, O my Umar!" I said, "May God have mercy on you, Umar has not died." He said, "My Lord has announced his death to me, and announced it to my soul!" Then he said, "You and you are among the dead as if it has already occurred." Then he sent blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, then prayed with hidden supplications, then said, "This is my counsel to you, O Harmala ibn Hayyan: the Book of God and the path of the righteous believers. For death has been announced to me and to you. Be mindful of death; let it not leave your heart for the blink of an eye as long as you remain. And warn your people when you return to them, and counsel the entire community. Beware of separating from the community by even a handspan, lest you leave your religion without knowing and enter the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. Pray for me and for yourself."

Then he said, "O God, this one claims he loves me for Your sake and visited me for Your sake, so make me know his face in Paradise, and admit him to me in Your abode, the Abode of Peace. Protect him as long as he is in the world, wherever he may be. Gather his scattered affairs and his portion of the world with ease, and make easy for him what You have given him of the world, and make him among those grateful for the blessings You have bestowed, and reward him on my behalf with the best reward." Then he said, "I entrust you to God, O Harmala ibn Hayyan, and peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings. I will not see you after today, may God have mercy on you. Do not seek me, for I dislike fame, and solitude is more beloved to me. I am full of grief and intense sorrow among these people as long as I live. So do not ask about me nor seek me. Know that you are in my thoughts, even if I do not see you and you do not see me. Remember me and pray for me, for I will remember you and pray for you, God willing. Go you this way, until I go this way." I was eager to walk with him a while, but he refused me, and we parted. He wept and made me weep. I watched his back until he entered one of the alleys. Then I asked about him after that, but found no one to inform me of anything concerning him. May God have mercy on him and forgive him.

Thus was the way of those brethren who turned away from worldly pursuits.

From what has preceded in clarifying the nature of this world and from the conduct of the prophets and the saints, you have come to know that the definition of the world is everything beneath the green sky and borne by the dusty earth, except that portion of it which is for the sake of God, Exalted is He. The opposite of the world is the Hereafter, which is everything intended for God, the Most High, that is taken from the world out of sheer necessity for the sake of strengthening obedience to God—and that is not considered part of the world. This is clarified by an example: When a pilgrim vows that during his journey for Hajj he will not occupy himself with anything other than the Hajj, but will devote himself solely to it, and then he busies himself with safeguarding his provisions, feeding his camel, or mending his water-skin—and everything indispensable for the Hajj—he does not break his oath, nor is he considered occupied with other than the Hajj. Similarly, the body is the vehicle of the soul, traversing the distance of a lifetime. Therefore, tending to the body with what maintains its strength for traversing the path through knowledge and action is from the Hereafter, not from the world. Indeed, if one intends the body's pleasure and enjoyment through any of these means, he has deviated from the Hereafter, and it is feared that his heart may harden. Al-Tanafisi said: "I was at the gate of Banu Shaybah in the Sacred Mosque for seven days, fasting. On the eighth night, I heard a caller while I was between wakefulness and sleep, proclaiming: 'Beware! Whoever takes from the world more than he needs, God will blind the eye of his heart.'" This, then, is the clarification of the true nature of the world in relation to you. Know this, and you will be rightly guided, if God, the Most High, wills.

An Exposition of the True Nature of the World in Itself and Its Occupations

which consumed the concerns of creation to such an extent that it made them forget their own selves, their Creator, their Origin, and their final Return.

Know that the world is an expression for existing entities, and man has a share in it, and he has an occupation in its rectification. These are three matters: one might think that the world is an expression for its individual parts, but it is not so. As for the existing entities that the world expresses, they are the earth and what is upon it. God Almighty has said, "We have made what is on the earth an adornment for it, that We may test them as to which of them is best in deed." Thus, the earth is a carpet for humankind, a cradle, a dwelling, and a resting place; and what is upon it is for them clothing, food, drink, and marriage.

All that exists on Earth is gathered into three categories: minerals, plants, and animals. As for plants, man seeks them for sustenance and healing. As for minerals, he seeks them for tools and vessels, such as copper and lead; for currency, such as gold and silver; and for other purposes besides. As for animals, they are divided into humans and beasts. As for beasts, their flesh is sought for food, their backs for riding, and their appearance for adornment. As for humans, a person may seek to possess the bodies of people to employ and command them, like servants; or to take pleasure in them, like concubines and women. And he may seek the hearts of people to possess them by planting within them reverence and honor—which is expressed as "status," for the meaning of status is the possession of human hearts. These are the entities expressed as "the world," and God the Exalted has gathered them in His saying: "Beautified for people is the love of desires—from women and children" (this is from humankind), "and heaped-up treasures of gold and silver" (this is from jewels and minerals—and within it is an allusion to other things like pearls, rubies, and the like), "and branded horses, and cattle" (these are beasts and animals), "and tilled land" (which is plants and crops).

These are the entities of the world, except that they have two relations with the servant: a relation with the heart, which is his love for them, his share in them, and the turning of his concern toward them, until his heart becomes like a slave or a heedless lover of the world. Into this relation enter all the heart's attributes attached to the world, such as arrogance, malice, envy, ostentation, reputation, ill thoughts, flattery, love of praise, love of abundance, and boasting—this is the inward world. As for the outward, it is the entities we have mentioned.

The second relationship is with the body; which is its preoccupation with rectifying these entities so that they become suitable for its own shares and the shares of others. This encompasses all the crafts and professions with which creation is occupied. Indeed, creation has forgotten themselves, their ultimate return, and their final destination because of this world, due to these two relationships: the relationship of the heart with love, and the relationship of the body with occupation. Had one known oneself, known one's Lord, and known the wisdom and secret of this world, one would have understood that these entities we have called the world were created for nothing but as fodder for the mount by which one journeys to God Almighty. By 'the mount' I mean the body, for it does not endure except with food, drink, clothing, and shelter, just as a camel on the pilgrimage route does not endure except with fodder, water, and a covering.

The example of the servant in this world, in his forgetfulness of himself and his purpose, is like that of a pilgrim who halts at the stations of the journey and constantly feeds his camel, tends to it, cleans it, adorns it with various garments, brings it different kinds of fodder, and cools its water with ice—until the caravan departs while he is heedless of the pilgrimage, of the caravan's passing, and of his remaining in the wilderness as prey for wild beasts, both he and his camel. The insightful pilgrim is not concerned with his camel except to the extent that it strengthens him for the walk; he tends to it while his heart is directed toward the Kaaba and the pilgrimage. He only turns his attention to the camel out of necessity. Similarly, the insightful traveler on the journey to the Hereafter does not occupy himself with tending to the body except out of necessity, just as he does not enter the water-closet except out of necessity. There is no difference between putting food into the belly and expelling it from the belly, in that each is a necessity of the body. Whoever's primary concern is what enters his belly, his worth is what exits from it. The greatest distraction from God Almighty is the belly, for its neglect is essential, while matters of dwelling and clothing are lesser. If people knew the reason for the need for these things and limited themselves to that, the occupations of the world would not consume them. They are consumed only due to their ignorance of the world and its wisdom, and their desires from it. But they are ignorant and heedless, and worldly occupations have multiplied upon them, linked one to another, collapsing into an endless chain. Thus, they are lost in the multitude of occupations and forget their purposes.

We shall detail the occupations of this world, how the need for them arises, and how people err in their purposes regarding them, so that the worldly occupations may become clear to you—how they divert creation from God Almighty and how they make them heedless of the ultimate consequences of their affairs. Thus we say: Worldly occupations are the crafts, trades, and labors you see creation engrossed in. The reason for their abundance is that man is compelled toward three things: sustenance, shelter, and clothing. Sustenance is for nourishment and survival. Clothing is to ward off heat and cold. Shelter is to ward off heat and cold and to protect family and property from causes of destruction. God did not create sustenance, shelter, and clothing in a perfected state such that man could dispense with his own labor in them.

Indeed, He created that for beasts, for vegetation nourishes animals without cooking. Heat and cold do not affect their bodies, so they have no need for shelter and are content with the open desert. Their clothing is their hair and hides, so they have no need for garments.

Man is not thus, so the need arose for five crafts that are the foundations of crafts and the primary worldly occupations: agriculture, animal husbandry, acquisition, weaving, and construction. As for construction, it is for dwelling. Weaving and what it encompasses of spinning and sewing are for clothing. Agriculture is for sustenance. Animal husbandry, for livestock and horses, is also for sustenance and mounts. By acquisition, we mean obtaining what God has created of game, minerals, plants, or firewood. Thus, the farmer obtains plants, the herdsman preserves and breeds animals, and the acquirer obtains what grows and propagates by itself without human craft, and likewise takes from the earth's minerals what was created therein without human craft. We mean by acquisition this, and under it fall several crafts and occupations. Then these crafts require tools and instruments, such as for weaving, agriculture, construction, and acquisition. The instruments are taken either from plants, which is wood, or from minerals like iron, lead, and others, or from the skins of animals. So the need arose for three other types of crafts: carpentry, blacksmithing, and leatherworking. These are the makers of instruments. By carpentry, we mean every worker in wood, however it may be. By blacksmithing, every worker in iron and mineral substances, including copper, needles, and others. Our aim is to mention the general categories, for the individual trades are many. As for leatherworking, we mean by it every worker in the skins and parts of animals. These are the mother crafts.

Then, man was created such that he cannot live alone, but is compelled to associate with others of his own kind. This is for two reasons. First, his need for progeny to ensure the continuation of the human race, which cannot be achieved except through the union of male and female and their companionship. Second, cooperation in procuring the means of sustenance and clothing, and in raising children. For association inevitably leads to offspring, and a single individual cannot occupy himself with the care of a child and the procurement of provisions. Moreover, it is not sufficient for him to associate only with his family and children in the home; indeed, he cannot live in such a manner unless a large community comes together, with each person undertaking a specific craft. For how can a single person undertake farming by himself when he needs its tools, and the tools require a blacksmith and a carpenter, and the food requires a miller and a baker? Likewise, how can he alone obtain clothing when he needs the cultivation of cotton, the tools of weaving and sewing, and many other implements? Therefore, it became impossible for man to live alone, and the need for society arose. Then, if they were to gather in an open wilderness, they would suffer from heat, cold, rain, and thieves, and thus would require sturdy buildings and dwellings where each household can be secluded with its tools and furnishings. The dwellings ward off heat, cold, and rain, and protect against the harm of neighbors from theft and other evils. However, dwellings may be targeted by a group of thieves from outside, so the inhabitants of the dwellings require mutual aid, cooperation, and fortification with a wall surrounding all the dwellings. Thus, cities came into being out of this necessity.

Then whenever people gather in dwellings and towns and interact with one another, disputes arise among them, for leadership and authority emerge—the husband’s authority over the wife, and the parents’ authority over the child because he is weak and in need of someone to sustain him. And whenever authority is established over a rational being, it leads to dispute, unlike authority over animals, for they lack the power to dispute even if wronged. As for the woman, she disputes with her husband, and the child disputes with his parents. This is within the household.

As for the inhabitants of a town, they also engage in transactions over necessities and dispute them. Were they left in such a state, they would fight and perish. Likewise, herders and farmers converge upon pastures, lands, and waters, which are insufficient for their needs, inevitably leading to contention. Then, some may become incapable of farming or craft due to blindness, illness, or extreme old age, and various calamities befall them. Were such a one left destitute, he would perish. If his care were entrusted to the collective, they would neglect it. Yet, if one individual were singled out without a specific reason, others would not submit to him.

From the necessary occurrence of these incidental matters arising from social interaction, other crafts emerged. Among them is the craft of surveying, through which the measurements of land are known to enable its fair division among people. Another is the craft of soldiery, for guarding the city with the sword and repelling thieves from them. Also, the craft of governance and the means to adjudicate disputes, and the need for jurisprudence, which is knowledge of the law by which creation should be regulated, and they must adhere to its limits so that conflict does not multiply—this is knowledge of the boundaries set by God Almighty in transactions and their conditions. These are political matters that are indispensable, and none engage in them except those endowed with specific qualities of knowledge, discernment, and guidance. When they occupy themselves with these, they have no leisure for another craft and require sustenance, and the people of the city need them, for if the city's inhabitants were to engage in war with enemies, for example, the crafts would be neglected, and if the warriors and arms-bearers were to engage in crafts to seek livelihood, the lands would be left without guards and people would suffer harm. Thus, the need arose to allocate to their livelihoods and provisions the lost properties that have no owner, if such exist, or to allocate spoils to them if the enmity is with disbelievers. If they are people of piety and scrupulousness, they content themselves with little from public funds, but if they seek expansion, the need inevitably arises for the people of the city to support them with their wealth so that they may provide protection, leading to the need for taxation.

Then, due to the need for taxation, the need for other crafts arises; for there is a need for someone to impose the tax justly on the farmers and property owners—these are the administrators. And for someone to collect it from them gently—these are the tax collectors and officials. And for someone to gather it and safeguard it until the time of distribution—these are the treasurers. And for someone to distribute it among them justly—this is the one who apportions for the soldiers. If these tasks were undertaken by a number of people not united by a bond, order would be disrupted, and from this arises the need for a king to manage them and an obeyed commander who appoints a person for each task, chooses for each what suits them, and observes fairness in taking and giving the tax, employing the soldiers in war, distributing their weapons, designating the directions of war, appointing commanders and leaders over each group among them, and so on to other crafts of kingship. From this, after the soldiers who are the people of arms, and after the king who watches over them with a vigilant eye and manages them, arises the need for scribes, treasurers, accountants, tax collectors, and administrators. These also require livelihood and cannot engage in trades, so the need arises for capital wealth, which is called the branch of taxation. At this point, people in the crafts become three groups: the farmers, herders, and professionals; the second: the soldierly protectors with swords; and the third: those who move between the two groups in taking and giving, such as administrators, tax collectors, and their like. Observe how the matter began from the need for sustenance, clothing, and shelter, and to what it has led. Such are worldly affairs: no door is opened from them except that others open because of it. Thus, they extend to no confined limit, as if they are an abyss with no end to its depth; whoever falls into one pit of them drops from it to another, and so on successively. These are the trades and crafts, yet they are not completed except with wealth and tools.

Wealth refers to the substances of the earth and what is upon it from which benefit is derived, the highest of which are foods, then the places to which a person retreats, which are dwellings, then the places in which one strives for livelihood such as shops, markets, and farms, then clothing, then household furnishings and tools, then tools of tools. Among the tools may be living beings, such as the dog as a tool for hunting, the ox as a tool for plowing, and the horse as a tool for riding in war. Then from this arises the need for selling, for the farmer may reside in a village without farming tools, and the blacksmith and carpenter may reside in a village where agriculture is not possible. Necessarily, the farmer needs them and they need the farmer, so one needs to offer what they have to the other to obtain their desire, which is through exchange. However, if the carpenter, for example, requests food from the farmer in exchange for his tool, the farmer may not need his tool at that time and thus not sell to him, and if the farmer requests the tool from the carpenter in exchange for food, the carpenter may have food at that time and not need it, so desires are hindered. Thus, they were compelled to establish shops that gather the tools of every craft so that their owner may await those in need; and to houses where what the farmers bring is gathered, so the owner of the houses buys from them to await those in need. Hence, markets and storehouses appeared for this reason: the farmer carries grains, and if he does not encounter a needy person, he sells them at a low price to merchants who store them awaiting those in need, hoping for profit, and likewise with all commodities and wealth.

Then, inevitably, travel between cities and villages occurs, so people travel to buy food from villages and tools from cities, transporting these and living thereby, so that the affairs of people in the cities are organized because of them; for every city may not have every tool, and every village may not have every food, so some need others, necessitating transport, giving rise to merchants who undertake transportation, and their motive for it is inevitably the greed to accumulate wealth. They toil day and night in journeys for the purpose of others, and their share from it is accumulating wealth that others inevitably consume—either a highway robber or an oppressive ruler. But God Almighty has placed in their heedlessness and ignorance an order for the cities and a benefit for the servants. Indeed, all worldly affairs are organized by heedlessness and lowly ambition. If people were discerning and their ambitions elevated, they would renounce the world, and if they did that, livelihoods would cease, and if they ceased, they would perish, and the renunciants would also perish.

Then these possessions that are transferred, a person cannot carry them himself, so he needs beasts of burden to transport them. The owner of the wealth may not have a beast, so a transaction occurs between him and the owner of the beast, called hiring, and the hire becomes another form of earning. Then, due to buying and selling, the need arises for the two currencies (gold and silver). For whoever wishes to buy food with a garment—how can he know the quantity of food that equals it? Transactions occur with different kinds of goods, as a garment is sold for food, or an animal for a garment, and these matters are not commensurate. Thus, there must be a just arbitrator who mediates between the two parties in a sale, equating one with the other, and that justice is sought from the tangible forms of wealth. Then there arises a need for wealth that endures, because the need for it persists. The most enduring forms of wealth are minerals, so coins were made from gold, silver, and copper. Then the need arose for minting, engraving, and valuation, and thus the need arose for the mint and the money-changers. And so occupations and tasks call upon one another in succession until they culminate in what you see. These are the occupations of creation, and they are their livelihood. And none of these crafts can be undertaken except through a kind of learning and toil at the outset.

Among people are those who neglect this in youth, thus not occupying themselves with it, or are prevented by some hindrance, remaining incapable of earning due to their inability in a craft. Consequently, they need to consume from what others toil for, giving rise to two base occupations: theft and beggary; for both share in consuming the labor of others. Then, since people guard against thieves and beggars and protect their wealth from them, they are compelled to divert their intellects to devising schemes and stratagems.

As for the thieves: among them are those who seek accomplices and possess in their hands a thorn and strength, so they gather and multiply, cutting off the roads like the Bedouins and Kurds. As for the weak among them, they resort to tricks—either by tunneling or climbing, seizing an opportunity of heedlessness, or by being a pickpocket or a sneak thief—to other such types of theft that arise according to what the minds, directed toward extracting them, produce.

As for the beggar, when he seeks what others have striven for and is told, "Exert yourself and work as others have worked; what have you to do with idleness?" he is given nothing. Thus they are compelled to devise means to extract wealth and to prepare excuses for their idleness. They contrive to plead incapacity, either genuinely—as a group who blind their children and themselves through trickery so they may be excused on account of blindness and thus receive alms—or through feigning blindness, lameness, madness, or illness, displaying these by various artifices while making clear that such affliction has befallen them undeservedly, so that it may become a cause for mercy. Another group seeks out sayings and actions that astonish people, so that their hearts soften upon witnessing them, and they become generous in relinquishing a little wealth in a state of wonder—though they may later regret it when the astonishment fades, and regret avails them nothing. This may be through jesting, imitation, jugglery, and ridiculous acts, or through strange poetry and rhymed prose accompanied by a pleasant voice. Metrical poetry has a stronger effect on the soul, especially when it contains partisanship related to doctrines, such as poems extolling the Companions or the virtues of the Household, or that which stirs the impulse of passion among the frivolous, like the craft of drummers in markets, and the craft resembling exchange but not truly exchange, such as selling amulets and herbs whose seller pretends they are medicines, thereby deceiving children and the ignorant, as well as the practitioners of lot-casting and omens among astrologers. Into this category fall preachers and beggars upon pulpits when there is no substantial knowledge behind them and their aim is to win the hearts of the common people and take their wealth through various forms of begging—and its types exceed a thousand or two thousand. All this has been devised through subtle contrivance for the sake of livelihood. These are the occupations and works of creation upon which they have bent, and what has drawn them to all of this is the need for sustenance and clothing. But in the midst of this they have forgotten themselves, their purpose, their return, and their final abode, so they have wandered astray and become lost. To their feeble minds, after the bustle of worldly occupations has clouded them, corrupt imaginings have come, and thus their doctrines have divided and their opinions have differed in several ways: A group whom ignorance and heedlessness have sealed—their eyes have not opened to consider the outcome of their affairs—so they say, "The aim is that we live some days in this world; thus we strive to earn our sustenance, then we eat to gain strength for earning, then we earn to eat." So they eat to earn and earn to eat. This is the refined view of peasants, craftsmen, and those who have no luxury in this world nor footing in religion; for he toils by day to eat by night and eats by night to toil by day, like the ox turning the waterwheel—a journey that does not cease except with death.

Another group claimed they had discerned the matter, asserting that the aim is not for man to toil in misery nor to be deprived of worldly pleasures; rather, happiness lies in fulfilling one's craving for worldly desires—namely the appetites of the belly and the private parts. These individuals have forgotten themselves and diverted their ambitions to pursuing women and amassing culinary delights, eating as cattle eat, imagining that if they attain this, they have reached the ultimate happiness. Thus, they are preoccupied with it, neglecting God Almighty and the Final Day.

A group believed that happiness lies in abundant wealth and self-sufficiency through hoarded treasures, so they spent their nights sleepless and exhausted their days in accumulation. They toil through journeys long into night and day, laboring in arduous tasks to earn and gather, yet they eat only out of sheer necessity, grudgingly and stingily, fearing any decrease in their store. This is their pleasure, and in this lies their constant striving and activity until death overtakes them; then it remains beneath the earth or is seized by one who consumes it in passions and pleasures—so the gatherer bears the toil and ruin, while the eater enjoys the delight. Yet those who gather look upon the wealth of such people and do not take heed.

And a group believed that happiness lies in a good reputation and tongues freely offering praise and commendation through adornment and chivalry; thus, they toil in earning a livelihood and restrict themselves in food and drink, and they direct all their wealth toward fine garments and precious mounts, and they embellish the doors of their homes and what falls upon the sight of people, so that it may be said he is wealthy and he possesses fortune, and they imagine that this is happiness. Their concern, by day and by night, is in tending to where people's gazes fall.

And another group believed that happiness lies in prestige and honor among people, and in the submission of creation through humility and reverence. Thus, they directed their efforts toward drawing people into obedience in pursuit of positions and assuming governmental roles, so that their commands might be enforced over a group of people. They imagine that if their authority expands and their subjects submit to them, they have indeed attained a great happiness, and that this is the ultimate goal. This is the predominant desire over the hearts of the heedless among people. These individuals are preoccupied with the love of people’s humility toward them, to the neglect of humility before God, His worship, and reflection on their Hereafter and final return.

Beyond these are numerous sects too many to enumerate, exceeding seventy groups, all of whom have strayed and led others astray from the straight path. What drew them into all of this was the need for food, clothing, and shelter, and they forgot the purpose for which these three matters are sought and the sufficient measure thereof. The initial causes dragged them to their ends, and this led them into depths from which they could not ascend. So whoever recognizes the true need for these means and occupations and knows the ultimate aim thereof will not engage in any occupation, craft, or work except with knowledge of its purpose and awareness of his share and portion from it, knowing that the ultimate aim is to maintain his body with sustenance and clothing so that it does not perish. If he follows the path of moderation in this, occupations will recede from him, his heart will become free, remembrance of the Hereafter will prevail over him, and his aspiration will turn toward preparing for it. But if he exceeds the measure of necessity, occupations multiply, one leading to another in an endless chain, so that worries branch out for him. And for whom worries branch out in the valleys of this world, Allah cares not in which valley He destroys him. Such is the state of those immersed in worldly occupations.

A group became aware of this and turned away from the world, but Satan envied them and did not leave them, misleading them even in their renunciation until they divided into sects. One group thought that this world is a place of trial and tribulation, and the Hereafter a place of happiness for everyone who reaches it, whether they worshipped in this world or not. So they believed that the correct course was to kill themselves to escape the tribulation of this world. To this end went groups of ascetics from the people of India: they throw themselves into fire and kill themselves by burning, thinking that this is their deliverance from the trials of this world.

Another group believed that mere killing does not suffice; rather, it is necessary first to mortify the human attributes and sever them from the soul entirely, and that felicity lies in cutting off desire and anger. So they turned to strenuous striving and imposed severe austerities upon themselves, until some perished due to the intensity of their discipline, some had their minds corrupted and went insane, some fell ill and found the path of worship blocked to them, and some proved incapable of completely suppressing the attributes. Thus, they thought that what the Sacred Law has obligated is impossible and that the Law is a deception without foundation, so they fell into heresy. It became apparent to some of them that all this toil is for God, and that God, exalted is He, is independent of His servants—neither is He diminished by the disobedience of a disobedient one, nor increased by the worship of a worshipper. So they returned to their desires and adopted the path of permissiveness, rolling up the carpet of the Sacred Law and its rulings. They claimed that this was from the purity of their monotheism, since they believed that God is independent of the worship of His servants.

A group believed that the purpose of acts of worship is striving until the servant thereby attains knowledge of God, the Exalted. Once knowledge is attained, he has arrived, and after arrival he dispenses with the means and the effort. Thus they abandoned striving and worship, claiming that their station in knowing God, glorified be He, had risen above being demeaned by religious obligations, for obligation is only upon the common people.

Beyond this lie false doctrines and immense deviations too numerous to count, reaching over seventy sects. The saved among them is but a single group: those who follow the path of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his Companions. This path is to neither abandon the world entirely nor suppress all desires entirely. As for the world, one takes from it what suffices as provision. As for desires, one suppresses those that lead away from obedience to the Sacred Law and reason. One does not follow every desire nor abandon every desire, but rather follows justice and does not abandon everything of the world, nor seek everything of the world. Instead, one understands the intended purpose for which each worldly thing is created and preserves it within the limit of its purpose. Thus, one takes from sustenance what strengthens the body for worship, from shelter what protects from thieves, heat, and cold, and from clothing likewise. When the heart is thus freed from preoccupation with the body, it turns wholly to God Almighty with the fullness of its aspiration and occupies itself with remembrance and reflection for a lifetime, remaining constantly vigilant in managing and monitoring desires so they do not transgress the bounds of piety and God-consciousness. The detailed knowledge of this is only attained by emulating the saved group—the Companions. For when he (peace be upon him) said, "The saved among them is one," they asked, "O Messenger of God, who are they?" He replied, "The people of the Sunnah and the Community." It was said, "And who are the people of the Sunnah and the Community?" He said, "Those who follow what I and my Companions are upon." They adhered to the moderate way and the clear path we have previously detailed. They did not take the world for the sake of the world, but for the sake of religion. They did not become monastic and abandon the world entirely, nor were they excessive or negligent in matters. Rather, their affair was balanced between the two, upright. That is justice and the middle way between two extremes, and it is the most beloved of matters to God Almighty—as mentioned previously in various places. And God knows best.

The book on the censure of this world is completed, and all praise is due to God, first and last. And may God bless our master Muhammad, his family, and his companions, and grant them peace.
