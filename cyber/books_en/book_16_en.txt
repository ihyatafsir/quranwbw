Book of the Etiquettes of Seclusion  
This is the Sixth Book of the Quarter of Customs from the Books of the Revival of the Religious Sciences  

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful  

Praise be to God, who has bestowed the greatest favor upon the choicest and purest of His creation by turning their aspirations toward intimacy with Him, granting them abundant share in the delight of witnessing His signs and majesty, and enlivening the secrets of their hearts through intimate discourse and gentle communion with Him. He has made the sight of worldly pleasures and its glitter contemptible in their hearts, so that everyone whose veils have been lifted from the currents of his thought rejoices in his seclusion, finding companionship in contemplating the splendors of His Countenance—Exalted is He—in solitude, and thereby feels estranged from the companionship of people, even if they are among his closest intimates. And blessings be upon our master Muhammad, the master of His prophets and His chosen one, and upon his family and companions, the masters of truth and its guides.  

Now then, people differ greatly concerning seclusion and social interaction, and in preferring one over the other. Yet each of them is not free from dangers that repel from it and benefits that invite toward it. Most worshippers and ascetics have inclined toward choosing seclusion and preferring it over social interaction, while what we mentioned in the Book of Companionship regarding the virtue of social interaction, brotherhood, and harmony almost contradicts what the majority have leaned toward—choosing estrangement and solitude. Therefore, lifting the veil from the truth in this matter is important, and this is achieved by outlining two chapters:  

Chapter One: On transmitting the schools of thought and arguments concerning it.  
Chapter Two: On lifting the veil from the truth by enumerating the benefits and dangers.  

Chapter One: On transmitting the schools of thought and statements, and mentioning the arguments of both groups in this matter.  

As for the schools of thought, they have differed in this, and this difference became apparent among the Successors. Those who inclined toward choosing seclusion and preferring it over social interaction include Sufyan al-Thawri, Ibrahim ibn Adham, Dawud al-Ta’i, Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad, Sulayman al-Khawwas, Yusuf ibn Asbat, Hudhayfa al-Mar’ashi, and Bishr al-Hafi.  

Most of the Successors advocated the desirability of social interaction, increasing acquaintances and brothers, and fostering affection and love toward the believers, seeking their assistance in religion as cooperation in righteousness and piety. Those who leaned toward this include Sa’id ibn al-Musayyib, al-Sha’bi, Ibn Abi Layla, Hisham ibn ‘Urwa, Ibn Shubruma, Shurayh, Sharik ibn ‘Abd Allah, Ibn ‘Uyayna, Ibn al-Mubarak, al-Shafi’i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and a group of scholars.  

The transmitted words from the scholars are divided into absolute statements indicating a leaning toward one of the two opinions, and statements coupled with what points to the reason for that leaning. Let us now transmit the absolute statements to clarify the schools of thought in this matter, and what is coupled with mentioning the reason we will present when addressing the dangers and benefits.  

Thus, we say: It has been narrated from ‘Umar—may God be pleased with him—that he said, “Take your share of seclusion.” Ibn Sirin said, “Seclusion is worship.” Fudayl said, “God suffices as a beloved, the Qur’an as a companion, and death as an admonisher.” It was said, “Take God as a companion and leave people aside.” Abu al-Rabi’ al-Zahid said to Dawud al-Ta’i, “Admonish me.” He replied, “Fast from the world and make your breaking of the fast the Hereafter, and flee from people as you would flee from a lion.” Al-Hasan—may God have mercy on him—said, “I have memorized these words from the Torah: ‘Be content, O son of Adam, and you will be independent; seclude yourself from people and you will be safe; abandon desires and you will be free; abandon envy and your nobility will appear; endure a little and enjoy much.’” Wahb ibn al-Ward said, “It reached us that wisdom consists of ten parts: nine of them are in silence, and the tenth is in seclusion from people.” Yusuf ibn Muslim said to ‘Ali ibn Bakkar, “How patient you are with solitude,” for he had confined himself to his house. He replied, “When I was young, I was more patient than this: I would sit with people and not speak to them.” Sufyan al-Thawri said, “This is the time for silence and staying in one’s house.”  

Some said, “I was on a ship, and with us was a young man from the family of ‘Ali. He stayed with us for seven days without us hearing a word from him. We said to him, ‘O young man, God has brought us together with you for seven days, and we do not see you mixing with us or speaking to us.’ He then recited: ‘Little concern—no child dies, no affair he fears passes away; he has fulfilled the desire of youth and gained knowledge, so his ultimate aim is solitude and silence.’” Ibrahim al-Nakha’i said to a man, “Learn jurisprudence, then seclude yourself.” Similarly said al-Rabi’ ibn Khuthaym. It was said that Malik ibn Anas used to attend funerals, visit the sick, and fulfill the rights of his brothers, then he abandoned them one by one until he abandoned them all, and he would say, “A person cannot manage to polish every excuse he has.” It was said to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, “If only you would free yourself for us.” He replied, “Leisure has gone; there is no leisure except with God—Exalted is He.” Fudayl said, “I find that a man has a claim on me if, when he meets me, he does not greet me, and if I fall ill, he does not visit me.” Abu Sulayman al-Darani said, “While al-Rabi’ ibn Khuthaym was sitting at the door of his house, a stone came and struck his forehead, wounding him. He began wiping the blood and said, ‘You have been admonished, O Rabi’.’ Then he stood up and entered.”

He remained in his home and never again sat at his door until his funeral was carried out. Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ and Sa‘īd ibn Zayd confined themselves to their houses in al-‘Aqīq and did not come to Medina for Friday prayer or anything else until they died in al-‘Aqīq. Yūsuf ibn Asbāṭ said: I heard Sufyān al-Thawrī say, “By God—there is no god but He—seclusion has indeed become lawful.” Bishr ibn ‘Abd Allāh said, “Keep your acquaintances few, for you do not know what will be on the Day of Resurrection. If there is disgrace, let those who know you be few.” A certain ruler visited Ḥātim al-Aṣamm and said to him, “Do you have any need?” He replied, “Yes.” He asked, “What is it?” He said, “That you do not see me, I do not see you, and you do not know me.” A man said to Sahl, “I wish to keep your company.” He replied, “When one of us dies, who will keep the other company?” The man said, “God.” Sahl said, “Then let Him keep him company now.” Al-Fuḍayl was told, “Your son ‘Alī says, ‘I wish I were in a place where I could see people but they could not see me.’” Al-Fuḍayl wept and said, “Woe to ‘Alī! Why did he not complete it?” He said, “That I not see them and they not see me.” Al-Fuḍayl also said, “Among the marks of a man’s frivolity is the multitude of his acquaintances.” Ibn ‘Abbās—may God be pleased with them both—said, “The best gathering is a gathering in the depths of your house where you are not seen and do not see.” These are the sayings of those inclined to seclusion.

Now, the arguments of those inclined to mixing and the weakness of their position: They argue with His words—Exalted is He—“And be not like those who became divided and differed” [Qur’an 3:105] and with His words—Exalted is He—“He united their hearts. Had you spent all that is on earth, you could not have united their hearts” [Qur’an 8:63]. This is weak, because what is meant by it is the division of opinions and the disagreement of schools regarding the meanings of the Book of God and the principles of the Sacred Law. What is meant by “uniting” is removing rancor from hearts—those causes that stir up strife and provoke disputes. Seclusion does not contradict that.

They argue with his saying—peace and blessings be upon him—“The believer is sociable and befriended, and there is no good in one who neither befriends nor is befriended.” The hadith “The believer is sociable and befriended” has preceded in the first chapter of the Book of Companionship. This is weak because it points to the blameworthiness of bad character, which prevents affection; it does not include good character, for if one with good character mixes, he befriends and is befriended. But he may abandon mixing to occupy himself with his own soul and seek safety from others.

They argue with his saying—peace and blessings be upon him—“Whoever separates from the community by a handspan has cast off the yoke of Islam from his neck,” and he said, “Whoever separates from the community and dies, his death is a death of ignorance.” The hadith “Whoever abandons the community and dies, his death is a death of ignorance” is reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah, and it has preceded in the fifth chapter of the Book of the Lawful and the Unlawful. And with his saying—peace and blessings be upon him—“Whoever splits the unity of the Muslims while they are united in Islam has cast off the yoke of Islam from his neck.” The hadith “Whoever splits the unity of the Muslims while they are united in Islam has cast off the yoke of Islam” is reported by al-Ṭabarānī and al-Khaṭṭābī in al-‘Uzlah from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbās with a sound chain. This is weak because what is meant by it is the community whose opinions have agreed upon an imam through the contract of allegiance; to rebel against them is oppression, and that is opposition in opinion and rebellion against them, which is forbidden because creation is compelled to have an imam who is obeyed and unites their opinion, and that only occurs through allegiance by the majority. Opposition causes confusion that stirs up strife. There is no reference to seclusion in this.

They argue with his prohibition—peace and blessings be upon him—against shunning for more than three days, when he said, “Whoever shuns his brother for more than three days and then dies enters the Fire.” The hadith “Whoever shuns his brother for more than three days and then dies enters the Fire” is reported by Abū Dāwūd from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah with a sound chain. And he said—peace and blessings be upon him—“It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days, and the one who initiates reconciliation enters Paradise.” The hadith “It is not lawful for a man to shun his brother for more than three days, and the one who initiates reconciliation enters Paradise” is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas, without the words “and the one who initiates reconciliation.” Al-Ṭabarānī added, “And the one who begins with reconciliation hastens to Paradise.” And he said, “Whoever shuns his brother for a year, it is as if he has shed his blood.” The hadith “Whoever shuns his brother for a year, it is as if he has shed his blood” is reported by Abū Dāwūd from the hadith of Abū Kharāsh al-Sulamī—his name is Ḥadrad ibn Abī Ḥadrad—with a sound chain. They say, “Seclusion is shunning entirely.” This is weak because what is meant by it is anger toward people and obstinacy in it by cutting off speech and the greeting and customary interaction. It does not include abandoning mixing altogether without anger. Moreover, shunning for more than three days is permissible in two situations: one, when one sees in it a reform for the one shunned, and two, when one sees safety for oneself in it. Although the prohibition is general, it is understood to apply beyond the two specified situations, as evidenced by what is reported from ‘Ā’ishah—may God be pleased with her—that the Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—shunned her during Dhū al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram, and part of Ṣafar. The hadith that he—peace and blessings be upon him—shunned ‘Ā’ishah during Dhū al-Ḥijjah, Muḥarram, and part of Ṣafar. I say: He only shunned Zaynab for this period.

As narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Aisha, and he remained silent about it, so it is sound according to him. It is narrated from Umar that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, withdrew from his wives and vowed to abstain from them for a month. He ascended to his upper room, which was his storeroom, and remained there for twenty-nine days. When he descended, it was said to him, "You were there for twenty-nine days." He said, "The month can be twenty-nine." The hadith of Umar that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, withdrew from his wives and vowed to abstain from them for a month is agreed upon. And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days, except for one whose mischief is not safe." The hadith of Aisha, "It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three, except for one whose mischief is not safe," was reported by Ibn Adi, who said its text and chain are rare. The hadith of Aisha in Abu Dawud is without the exception, with a sound chain. This is explicit in specification. Upon this is understood the statement of Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, when he said, "Shunning the fool is a means of nearness to God," for that lasts until death, since foolishness is not expected to be cured. It was mentioned before Muhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi that a man shunned another until he died, and he said, "This is something in which a people preceded." Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas was shunning Ammar ibn Yasir until he died, and Uthman ibn Affan was shunning Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, and Aisha was shunning Hafsa, and Tawus was shunning Wahb ibn Munabbih until they both died. All of that is understood according to their view of their safety in shunning, and they argued with what was narrated that a man came to the mountain to worship there, and he was brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, who said, "Do not do that, nor any of you, for the patience of one of you in some places of Islam is better for him than the worship of one of you alone for forty years." The hadith that a man came to the mountain to worship there and was brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, who said, "Do not do that," was reported by Al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of As'as ibn Salamah. Ibn Abd al-Barr said they say his hadith is interrupted, and likewise Ibn Hibban mentioned him among the reliable successors. The apparent meaning is that this was due to what it contained of abandoning jihad despite its severe obligation in the beginning of Islam, as indicated by what was narrated from Abu Huraira, may God be pleased with him, that he said, "We raided with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and we passed by a valley with a spring of sweet water. One of the men said, 'If I were to withdraw from people in this valley,' and he would not do that until he mentioned it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, who said, 'Do not do that, for the standing of one of you in the path of God is better than his prayer with his family for sixty years. Do you not love that God forgives you and you enter Paradise? Fight in the path of God, for whoever fights in the path of God for the duration of a camel's milking, God will admit him to Paradise.'" The hadith of Abu Huraira, "We raided in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and we passed by a valley with a spring of sweet, abundant water. One of the men said, 'If I were to withdraw from people in this valley,'" was reported by Al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih, and Al-Hakim, who said it is sahih according to the condition of Muslim, except that Al-Tirmidhi said seventy years. And they argued with what Mu'adh ibn Jabal narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed Satan is the wolf of man like the wolf of sheep; he takes the isolated, the remote, and the stray. Beware of the valleys and adhere to the community, the congregation, and the mosques." The hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal, "Satan is the wolf of man like the wolf of sheep; he takes the isolated," was reported by Ahmad and Al-Tabarani, and its narrators are reliable except that there is an interruption. This is intended for one who withdraws before the completion of the raid, and the explanation of that will come, and that it is forbidden except out of necessity. The arguments of those inclined to prefer seclusion: they argued with His saying, exalted is He, narrating from Abraham, peace be upon him, "And I will withdraw from you and what you invoke besides God, and I will invoke my Lord," then God said, "So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides God, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a prophet," indicating that that was due to the blessing of seclusion. This is weak, for mixing with disbelievers has no benefit except calling them to the religion, and when despairing of their response, there is no option but to shun them. The discussion is about mixing with Muslims and the blessing in it, as narrated that it was said, "O Messenger of God, is ablution from a covered vessel more beloved to you or from these public places from which people purify themselves?" He said, "Rather from these public places," seeking the blessing of the hands of Muslims. The hadith, "It was said to him, peace and blessings be upon him, 'Is ablution from a covered vessel more beloved to you or from these public places from which people purify themselves?' He said, 'Rather from these public places,'" was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from the hadith of Ibn Umar, and there is weakness in it. And it was narrated that when he, peace and blessings be upon him, circumambulated the House, he turned to...

He went to Zamzam to drink from it, and there was soaked dates in leather basins that people had stirred with their hands, taking from it and drinking. He asked for a drink, saying, "Give me to drink." Al-‘Abbas said, "This is a beverage that has been stirred and mixed by hands; shall I not bring you a cleaner drink from a sealed jar in the house?" He replied, "Give me to drink from this which the people are drinking, seeking the blessing of the Muslims' hands." So he drank from it. A narration states that when he circumambulated the House, he turned to Zamzam to drink from it, and there were soaked dates in leather basins that people had stirred with their hands. In it, he said, "Give me to drink from this which the people are drinking." Al-Azraqi narrated it in the History of Mecca from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas with a weak chain, and from the narration of Tawus as a mursal hadith similarly.

So then, how can one argue for seclusion from the disbelievers and idols as evidence for seclusion from Muslims, given the abundant blessings among them? They also argued with the saying of Moses, peace be upon him, "And if you do not believe me, then keep away from me," and that he resorted to seclusion when he despaired of them. And Allah said regarding the Companions of the Cave, "And when you withdraw from them and that which they worship other than Allah, then seek refuge in the cave; your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy." He commanded them to seclude. And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, withdrew from Quraysh when they harmed and shunned him, and he entered the ravine, and ordered his companions to withdraw from them and emigrate to the land of Abyssinia. The narration of his withdrawal, peace and blessings be upon him, from Quraysh when they harmed and shunned him, and he entered the ravine, and ordered his companions to withdraw from them and emigrate to Abyssinia, was narrated by Musa ibn ‘Uqbah in Al-Maghazi, and through his chain by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Dala’il from Ibn Shihab as a mursal hadith. Ibn Sa‘d narrated it in Al-Tabaqat from the narration of Ibn Shihab from ‘Ali ibn Abi Bakr ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham, also as a mursal hadith, and connected it from the narration of Abu Salamah al-Hadhrami from Ibn ‘Abbas, except that Ibn Sa‘d mentioned that the polytheists besieged Banu Hashim in the ravine, and Musa ibn ‘Uqbah mentioned that Abu Talib gathered Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib and ordered them to bring the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, into their ravine. The Maghazi of Musa ibn ‘Uqbah is the most authentic of the Maghazi. Musa ibn ‘Uqbah also mentioned that he ordered his companions when he entered the ravine to go out to the land of Abyssinia. Abu Dawud has from the hadith of Abu Musa: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us to set out for the land of the Negus." Al-Bayhaqi said its chain is sound. Ahmad has from the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ud: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, sent us to the Negus." Ibn Ishaq narrated with a good chain, and through his chain Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Dala’il from the hadith of Umm Salamah: "In the land of Abyssinia there is a king under whom no one is wronged; so go to his land." Then they joined him in Medina after Allah had exalted His word. This too is seclusion from the disbelievers after despairing of them, for he, peace and blessings be upon him, did not seclude from Muslims nor from those disbelievers from whom he anticipated conversion. And the Companions of the Cave did not seclude from each other, for they were believers; they only secluded from the disbelievers. The consideration is regarding seclusion from Muslims.

They argued with his saying, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amir al-Juhani when he said, "O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation?" He said, "Let your house suffice you, restrain your tongue, and weep over your sin." And it is narrated that he was asked, peace and blessings be upon him, "Who are the best of people?" He said, "A believer who strives with his soul and wealth in the way of Allah." It was said, "Then who?" He said, "A man secluded in a ravine among the ravines, worshiping his Lord and leaving people safe from his evil." And he said, peace and blessings be upon him, "Indeed, Allah loves the servant who is pious, pure, and hidden." The hadith "Indeed, Allah loves the servant who is pious, pure, and hidden" was transmitted by Muslim from the hadith of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas. There is consideration in citing these hadiths as evidence. As for his saying to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amir, it cannot be applied except to what he, peace and blessings be upon him, knew through the light of prophethood regarding his condition, and that staying at home was more suitable and safer for him than mixing, for he did not command all the Companions to do that. Many a person finds safety in seclusion, not in mixing, just as his safety may lie in staying at home and not going out for jihad, and that does not indicate that abandoning jihad is superior. In mixing with people there is striving and endurance, and for that reason he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The one who mixes with people and endures their harm is better than the one who does not mix with people and does not endure their harm." The hadith "The one who mixes with people and does not endure their harm" was transmitted by Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, and Al-Tirmidhi did not name the Companion, saying a shaykh from the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the chain is one. Upon this is based his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "A man secluded, worshiping his Lord and leaving people safe from his evil." This refers to one who is evil by nature, and people are harmed by mixing with him. And his saying, "Indeed, Allah loves the pious, the hidden."

A reference to preferring obscurity and avoiding fame, which is not connected to seclusion. For how many a reclusive monk is known by all people, and how many a mingling person is obscure, having no mention or fame. This pertains to a matter unrelated to seclusion. They argued with what has been narrated: that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to his companions, "Shall I not inform you of the best of people?" They said, "Yes, O Messenger of God." He gestured with his hand toward the west and said, "A man holding the reins of his horse in the path of God, waiting to raid or be raided upon. Shall I not inform you of the best of people after him?" He gestured with his hand toward the Hijaz and said, "A man among his sheep, establishing prayer, giving zakah, and knowing God's right over his wealth, who withdraws from the evils of people." The hadith: "Shall I not inform you of the best of people?" They said, "Yes." He gestured with his hand toward the west and said, "A man holding the reins of his horse in the path of God, waiting to raid or be raided upon." Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the hadith of Umm Mubashshir, except he said "toward the east" instead of "west," and in it is Ibn Ishaq, who narrated it with 'an'anah. Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Nasa'i have something similar, abbreviated from the hadith of Ibn Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi said it is a hasan hadith. So when it becomes clear that these proofs offer no cure from both sides, it is necessary to lift the veil by explicitly stating the benefits of seclusion and its dangers, and comparing some with others, so the truth in it may become evident.

Chapter Two: On the Benefits of Seclusion and Its Dangers, and Unveiling the Truth Regarding Its Virtue. Know that people's disagreement in this resembles their disagreement regarding the virtue of marriage and celibacy. We have mentioned that this varies according to differing circumstances and individuals, based on what we detailed of the harms and benefits of marriage. The same applies to the matter at hand. So let us first mention the benefits of seclusion, which are divided into religious and worldly benefits.

The religious benefits are divided into what can be achieved in solitude: the attainment of acts of obedience, consistency in worship and contemplation, cultivation of knowledge, and deliverance from committing prohibitions that one is exposed to through mingling, such as ostentation, backbiting, silence in enjoining good and forbidding evil, and the stealthy acquisition of vile character traits and wicked deeds from bad companions.

As for worldly benefits, they are divided into what can be attained through solitude, such as the craftsman's proficiency in his solitude, and deliverance from perils encountered through mingling, such as gazing at the adornment of the world and people's attraction to it, his coveting from people and people's coveting from him, the exposure of his veil of honor through mingling, and the harm from a companion's bad character in his argumentation, his ill suspicion, his tale-bearing, his envy, or the harm from his heaviness and unsightly appearance. To this return the collective benefits of seclusion. Let us summarize them in six benefits.

The first benefit: Devoting oneself to worship and contemplation, and finding intimacy in communion with God Almighty instead of communion with creation, and occupying oneself with discovering the secrets of God Almighty concerning the matters of this world and the Hereafter, and the dominion of the heavens and the earth. For that requires leisure, and there is no leisure with mingling. Thus, seclusion is a means to it. For this reason, some wise men said, "No one can achieve solitude except by holding fast to the Book of God Almighty." Those who hold fast to the Book of God are those who have found rest from the world through the remembrance of God—those who remember God through God. They lived by remembering God, died by remembering God, and will meet God by remembering God. There is no doubt that mingling prevents these people from contemplation and remembrance, so seclusion is more appropriate for them.

Therefore, at the beginning of his mission, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would devote himself in the cave of Hira' and withdraw to it until the light of prophethood grew strong within him. The hadith: "At the beginning of his mission, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would devote himself in the cave of Hira' and withdraw to it," agreed upon from the hadith of Aisha, something similar. So he would seclude himself in the cave of Hira', engaging in devotion therein. Thus, creation did not veil him from God. He was with his body among creation, but with his heart turned toward God Almighty, to the extent that people thought Abu Bakr was his intimate friend. But the Prophet (peace be upon him) informed of his total absorption in God, saying, "If I were to take an intimate friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend, but your companion is the intimate friend of God." The hadith: "If I were to take an intimate friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend, but your companion is the intimate friend of God," transmitted by Muslim from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, and it has preceded. Combining outward mingling with people and inward turning to God in secret is only possible through the strength of prophethood. So every weak person should not be deceived by himself and aspire to that. Yet it is not far-fetched that some saints may reach that degree. It is reported from Junayd that he said, "I have been speaking with God for thirty years, while people think I am speaking with them." This is only facilitated for one utterly absorbed in the love of God to such an extent that no room remains for others, and that is not denied. Among those famously known for love of creation are those who mingle with people physically while unaware of what they say or what...

It is said of one whose love for the Beloved is excessive—nay, who is utterly overwhelmed by it—that no worldly affair disturbs him. Indeed, grief may so consume him that he mingles with people yet does not perceive them nor hear their voices, due to his profound absorption. And the affair of the Hereafter is greater in the sight of the wise, so such a state is not impossible therein. Yet for most, seeking aid in solitude is preferable. Thus, when a certain sage was asked, “What did they intend by seclusion and choosing solitude?” he replied, “They sought thereby the continuity of contemplation and the firm establishment of knowledge in their hearts, that they might live a goodly life and taste the sweetness of divine knowledge.”

A monk was asked, “How patient you are in solitude!” He answered, “I am not alone; I am in the company of God Most High. When I wish Him to speak to me, I read His Book; and when I wish to speak to Him, I pray.”

Another sage was asked, “To what has asceticism and seclusion led you?” He said, “To intimacy with God.”

Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah said, “I met Ibrahim ibn Adham, God have mercy on him, in the lands of Syria and said to him, ‘O Ibrahim, you have left Khorasan?’ He replied, ‘I have not enjoyed life except here, fleeing with my religion from peak to peak, so that whoever sees me says, “He is a deluded one, or a porter, or a sailor.”’”

It was said to Ghazwan al-Raqqashi, “Suppose you do not laugh—what prevents you from sitting with your brothers?” He said, “I find comfort for my heart in the company of One in whose presence my need is met.”

Al-Hasan was told, “O Abu Sa‘id, here is a man whom we have never seen sitting except alone behind a pillar.” Al-Hasan said, “When you see him, inform me.” One day they saw him and said to Al-Hasan, “This is the man we told you about,” pointing him out. Al-Hasan went to him and said, “O servant of God, I see you have grown fond of solitude. What prevents you from sitting with people?” He replied, “A matter that preoccupies me from people.” He asked, “What prevents you from coming to this man called Al-Hasan and sitting with him?” He said, “A matter that preoccupies me from people and from Al-Hasan.” Al-Hasan said, “And what is that preoccupation, may God have mercy on you?” He answered, “I begin and end my day between a blessing and a sin, so I saw fit to occupy myself with thanking God Most High for the blessing and seeking forgiveness for the sin.” Al-Hasan said to him, “You, O servant of God, are more insightful in my sight than Al-Hasan. Persist in what you are upon.”

It is related that while Uways al-Qarani was sitting, Hirm ibn Hayyan came to him and said, “O Uways, what brings you?” He replied, “I came to find companionship in you.” Uways said, “I did not think that one who knows his Lord would seek companionship in another.”

Al-Fudayl said, “When I see night approaching, I rejoice and say, ‘I shall be alone with my Lord.’ And when dawn reaches me, I feel regret at meeting people and that someone might come to distract me from my Lord.”

‘Abdullah ibn Zaid said, “Blessed is he who lives in this world and lives in the Hereafter.” He was asked, “How is that?” He replied, “He communes with God in this world and dwells near Him in the Hereafter.”

Dhu al-Nun al-Misri said, “The joy and delight of the believer is in solitude, communing with his Lord.”

Malik ibn Dinar said, “Whoever does not find intimacy in conversing with God, glorified and exalted, over conversing with creatures, his knowledge is little, his heart blind, and his life wasted.”

Ibn al-Mubarak said, “How beloved to me is the state of one who withdraws to God Most High.”

It is narrated from a righteous man that he said, “While I was traveling in a part of Syria, I came upon an ascetic emerging from one of those mountains. When he saw me, he withdrew to the base of a tree and concealed himself. I said, ‘Glory to God! Do you begrudge me a look at you?’ He said, ‘I have dwelt in this mountain a long time, striving with my heart to be patient with the world and its people. My toil was prolonged and my life spent therein. I asked God Most High not to make my portion of days in struggling with my heart, so God stilled it from agitation and accustomed it to solitude and seclusion. When I saw you, I feared falling back into the first state. So keep away from me, for I seek refuge from your harm with the Lord of the knowers and the Beloved of the devout.’ Then he cried out, ‘Woe to me from long abiding in this world!’ He turned his face from me, shook his hands, and said, ‘Away from me, O world—adorn yourself for another and beguile him!’ Then he said, ‘Glory to Him who has given the hearts of the knowers to taste the delight of service and the sweetness of devotion to Him, such that it distracts their hearts from remembrance of the Gardens and the fair maidens, and gathers their concern in His remembrance. Nothing is more delightful to them than communing with Him.’ Then he departed, saying, ‘Holy, Holy!’

Thus, in solitude one finds intimacy in remembrance of God and increase in knowledge of God. In this vein it was said:

‘I feign sleep, though no drowsiness is upon me,
Perhaps a phantom from You might meet a phantom of mine.
And I withdraw from the gathering,
Perhaps I might secretly converse with my soul about You, alone.’

Therefore, a sage said, ‘Man feels lonely only because his soul is empty of virtue, so he then frequents people and drives away loneliness by being with them. But when his soul is virtuous, he seeks solitude to aid him in contemplation and to draw forth knowledge and wisdom.’ It has been said, ‘Seeking companionship is a sign of spiritual bankruptcy.’”

A great benefit, yet it pertains to some of the elect and those for whom it is made easy through constant remembrance to attain intimacy with God, or through constant reflection to attain realization in the knowledge of God. For such a one, detachment for His sake is superior to all that pertains to social interaction. For the ultimate aim of acts of worship and the fruit of spiritual transactions is that a person dies loving God, knowing God. But there is no love except through the intimacy gained by constant remembrance, and no knowledge except through constant reflection. An empty heart is a condition for each of these, and there is no emptiness with social interaction.

The second benefit is deliverance, through seclusion, from the sins to which a person is mostly exposed through social interaction and from which he is safe in solitude. They are four: backbiting, tale-bearing, ostentation, and silence concerning enjoining good and forbidding evil; and the stealthy acquisition by one's nature of vile character traits and foul actions which are necessitated by greed for this world.

As for backbiting, if you learn its aspects from the Book of the Afflictions of the Tongue in the Quarter of the Destroyers, you will know that guarding against it while mixing with people is immensely difficult; none are saved from it except the truthful ones. For the common habit of people altogether is to rinse their mouths with people's honor, to relish it, and to take delight in its sweetness. It is their relish and their pleasure, and to it they resort for relief from the loneliness of solitude. If you mix with them and agree with them, you sin and expose yourself to the displeasure of God Almighty. If you remain silent, you are a partner, and the listener is one of the backbiters. If you object, they will hate you, abandon that backbiter, and backbite you, thus adding backbiting to backbiting. Perhaps they will go beyond backbiting and reach mockery and abuse.

As for enjoining good and forbidding evil, it is among the foundations of the religion and is obligatory, as will be explained at the end of this Quarter. Whoever mixes with people cannot avoid witnessing evil deeds. If he remains silent, he disobeys God thereby. If he objects, he exposes himself to various kinds of harm, for perhaps his attempt to extricate himself from them will lead him to sins greater than the one he initially forbade. In seclusion there is deliverance from this, for the matter is severe in its neglect and burdensome in its performance.

Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, once stood as an orator and said, "O people, you recite this verse: 'O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided,' and you place it in other than its proper place. For I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say, 'When people see evil and do not change it, God is about to envelop them all in punishment.'" The hadith of Abu Bakr: "You recite this verse: 'O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided,' and you place it in other than its proper place." The hadith was reported by the compilers of the Sunan. At-Tirmidhi said it is hasan sahih.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "God will question the servant until He says to him, 'What prevented you, when you saw evil, from denouncing it?' When God provides the servant with his excuse, he will say, 'My Lord, I hoped in You and I feared the people.'" The hadith: "God will question the servant until He says, 'What prevented you, when you saw evil in the world, from denouncing it?'" The hadith was reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with a good chain. This is when one fears beating or something unbearable. Knowing the limits of that is problematic and involves danger. In seclusion there is deliverance.

In enjoining good and forbidding evil there is the stirring of disputes and the agitation of the perils within breasts, as it is said: "How many a sincere counsel I have driven into your tracks, yet the advisor may earn hatred." Whoever has tried enjoining good has often regretted it, for it is like a leaning wall which a person wants to straighten, but it is likely to fall upon him. When it falls upon him, he says, "If only I had left it leaning." Indeed, if he found helpers to hold the wall until he secured it with a support, it would become straight. But today you do not find the helpers, so leave them and save yourself.

As for ostentation, it is the chronic disease from which even the substitutes and the pegs find it difficult to guard themselves. Whoever mixes with people indulges them, and whoever indulges them shows off to them, and whoever shows off to them falls into what they have fallen into and perishes as they have perished. The least that it entails is hypocrisy. For if you mix with two adversaries and do not meet each of them with a countenance that pleases him, you become hateful to both of them. If you humor them both, you are among the worst of people. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "You will find among the worst of people the double-faced one who comes to these with one face and to those with another face." The hadith: "You will find among the worst of people the double-faced one" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Among the worst of people is the double-faced one who comes to these with one face and to those with another face." The hadith: "Among the worst of people is the double-faced one" was reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it is the previous one.

The least that is required in mixing with people is showing eagerness and exaggerating in it, and that is not free from falsehood, either in its origin or in its increase; and showing compassion by asking about conditions, saying, "How are you? How is your family?" while in your innermost heart you are empty.

Among his concerns, and this is pure hypocrisy, Sari said: "If a brother of mine entered and I smoothed my beard with my hand upon his entry, I would fear being inscribed in the register of the hypocrites." And al-Fudayl was sitting alone in the Sacred Mosque when a brother came to him and said, "What brought you?" He replied, "For companionship, O Abu Ali." He said, "By God, it is more akin to mutual vexation. Do you desire anything but that you adorn yourself for me and I adorn myself for you, and you lie to me and I lie to you? Either you depart from me, or I depart from you." And some of the scholars said: "When God loves a servant, He loves that he not be noticed."

Tawus entered upon the Caliph Hisham and said, "How are you, O Hisham?" He became angry with him and said, "Why did you not address me as 'Commander of the Faithful'?" He replied, "Because all the Muslims have not agreed upon your caliphate, and I feared I would be a liar." So whoever is able to take this precaution, let him mix with people; otherwise, let him be content with having his name inscribed in the register of the hypocrites. Indeed, the early predecessors would meet and be cautious in their speech, saying, "How have you become in the morning?" and "How have you become in the evening?" and "How are you?" and "How is your condition?" and in the response to it. Their inquiry was about the states of religion, not the states of the world. Hatim al-Asamm said to Hamid al-Laffaf, "How are you within yourself?" He replied, "Safe and sound." Hatim disliked his answer and said, "O Hamid, safety is beyond the Bridge, and well-being is in Paradise."

And when it was said to Jesus, peace be upon him, "How have you become in the morning?" he would say, "I have become in the morning not possessing the ability to advance what I hope for, nor able to repel what I dread, and I have become mortgaged by my deeds, and all good is in the hand of other than me, and no poor person is poorer than I." And when it was said to al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym, "How have you become in the morning?" he would say, "I have become in the morning among the weak sinners, receiving our provisions and awaiting our appointed terms." And when it was said to Abu al-Darda', "How have you become in the morning?" he would say, "I have become in the morning in good state if I am saved from the Fire." And when it was said to Sufyan al-Thawri, "How have you become in the morning?" he would say, "I have become in the morning thanking this one to that one, blaming this one to that one, and fleeing from this one to that one." And it was said to Uways al-Qarani, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "How does a man become in the morning when he reaches evening not knowing he will reach morning, and when he reaches morning not knowing he will reach evening?" And it was said to Malik ibn Dinar, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "I have become in the morning with a lifespan decreasing and sins increasing." And it was said to one of the wise men, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "I have become in the morning not pleased with my life for my death, nor with my soul for my Lord." And it was said to a sage, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "I have become in the morning eating the provision of my Lord and obeying His enemy, Iblis." And it was said to Muhammad ibn Was'i, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "What do you think of a man who journeys every day a stage toward the Hereafter?" And it was said to Hamid al-Laffaf, "How have you become in the morning?" He said, "I have become in the morning desiring well-being from day to night." It was said to him, "Are you not in well-being every day?" He said, "Well-being is a day in which I do not disobey God, the Exalted." And it was said to a man as he was giving up his soul, "What is your state?" He said, "And what is the state of one who intends a distant journey without provision, enters a desolate grave without a companion, and proceeds to a just king without proof?" And it was said to Hassan ibn Abi Sinan, "What is your state?" He said, "What is the state of one who dies, then is resurrected, then is called to account?" And Ibn Sirin said to a man, "How is your state?" He replied, "And what is the state of one upon whom is a debt of five hundred dirhams while he has dependents?" So Ibn Sirin entered his house, brought out a thousand dirhams, gave them to him, and said, "Five hundred, repay your debt with it, and five hundred, provide for yourself and your family with it"—and he had nothing else. Then he said, "By God, I will never ask anyone about his state again." He only did that because he feared his inquiry might be without genuine concern for his affair, thus being a show-off and a hypocrite. Indeed, their inquiry was about matters of religion and the states of the heart in dealing with God. And if they inquired about worldly matters, it was out of concern and resolve to fulfill whatever need became apparent to them.

And some of them said: "I know people who, if they met, even if one of them were to claim all that his companion possessed, he would not withhold it. And now I see people who meet and inquire even about the chicken in the house, yet if one of them were to stretch out his hand for a single seed of his companion's wealth, he would withhold it. Is this not mere ostentation and hypocrisy? A sign of that is that you see this one saying, 'How are you?' and the other saying, 'How are you?'—the questioner does not await the answer, and the questioned is preoccupied with the question and does not answer. That is because they know it is from ostentation and affectation, and perhaps the hearts are not free from grudges and resentments, while the tongues utter the question." Al-Hasan said: "They used to say, 'Peace be upon you,' when hearts were surrendered to God. But now, 'How have you become in the morning, may God grant you well-being?' 'How are you, may God set you right?' If we take their saying, it is an innovation, not an honor. If they wish, they become angry with us, and if they wish, they do not." He only said that because beginning with "How have you become in the morning?" is an innovation. And a man said to Abu Bakr ibn 'Ayyash, "How have you become in the morning?" but he did not answer him and said, "Leave us from this innovation." And he said, "This only occurred in the time of the plague that was called the plague of 'Amwas in Syria, due to the swift death. A man would meet his brother in the morning and say, 'How...'"

One becomes afflicted with the plague of ostentation, and when evening comes upon him, he says, "How did you spend your evening?" The intended meaning is that social interaction, in most customary practices, is not free from various forms of affectation, hypocrisy, and dissimulation. All of this is blameworthy, some of it forbidden and some of it detestable. In seclusion lies salvation from this, for whoever meets people and does not conform to their manners is hated, deemed burdensome, slandered, and they gird themselves to harm him. Thus, their religion is lost in that, and his religion and worldly life are lost in seeking vengeance against them.

As for the stealthy influence of the nature from what it observes of people's manners and actions, this is a hidden malady that the discerning rarely perceive, let alone the heedless. A person does not sit with a corrupt individual for a period while inwardly disapproving of him, except that if he were to compare his state to before his companionship, he would perceive a difference in his aversion to corruption and his feeling of its weight. For through frequent observation, corruption becomes light upon the nature, diminishing its impact and one's awe of it. The deterrent from it is the severity of its impact on the heart. When it becomes trivialized through prolonged observation, the restraining force is nearly dissolved, and the nature submits to inclining toward it or toward what is lesser than it.

Whenever one's observation of major sins from others is prolonged, he belittles the minor sins from himself. Therefore, one who looks at the wealthy belittles God's blessing upon himself, so sitting with them influences him to deem small what he possesses. And sitting with the poor influences him to magnify the blessings that have been made available to him. Likewise is looking at the obedient and the disobedient. This is its effect on the nature.

Whoever restricts his gaze to observing the states of the Companions and the Successors in worship and abstention from the world, he continually looks at himself with an eye of belittlement and at his worship with an eye of contempt. As long as he sees himself as deficient, he is not free from an urge to strive diligently, out of desire for completion and perfecting emulation.

Whoever looks at the prevalent states of the people of his time—their turning away from God, their turning toward the world, and their habituation to sins—magnifies the matter of his own self with the slightest desire for good he encounters in his heart, and that is perdition. Merely hearing of good and evil is sufficient to change the nature, let alone witnessing it.

Through this subtle point, the secret of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, is known: "When the righteous are mentioned, mercy descends." The hadith "When the righteous are mentioned, mercy descends" has no established source among the elevated narrations; rather, it is from the saying of Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah, as Ibn al-Jawzi narrated it in the introduction to *Safwat al-Safwah*. The mercy is entry into Paradise and meeting God. That very thing does not descend at the mention, but its cause does—which is the arousal of desire from the heart and the movement of eagerness to emulate them, and the disdain for what is associated with oneself of shortcoming and deficiency. The origin of mercy is doing good, the origin of doing good is desire, and the origin of desire is mentioning the states of the righteous. This is the meaning of the descent of mercy.

What is understood from the implication of this speech by the perceptive is like what is understood from its opposite: that when the corrupt are mentioned, a curse descends, because frequent mention of them makes the matter of sins light upon the nature. The curse is distance, and the origin of distance from God is sins and turning away from God by turning toward immediate interests and present desires, not in the legislated manner. The origin of sins is the falling away of their weight and enormity from the heart, and the origin of the falling away of the weight is the occurrence of familiarity with them through frequent hearing.

If this is the state regarding *mentioning* the righteous and the corrupt, then what do you suppose about *witnessing* them? Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, has explicitly stated that, where he said: "The example of an evil companion is like the bellows: if it does not burn you with its sparks, it will affix to you its smell." The hadith "The example of an evil companion is like the bellows..." is agreed upon, from the narration of Abu Musa. Just as the smell affixes to the garment without one being aware, so too does corruption become easy upon the heart without one being aware. And he said: "The example of a righteous companion is like the seller of musk: if he does not give you some, you find its fragrance."

For this reason, I say: Whoever knows of a slip from a scholar, it is forbidden for him to narrate it for two reasons. One: it is backbiting. The second, and it is greater: that narrating it makes the matter of that slip light upon the listeners, and the awe they have in their hearts for daring to commit it falls away. This becomes a cause for trivializing that sin. For whenever one falls into it and it is denounced, he repels the denunciation and says, "How can this be considered remote from us when all of us are compelled to its like, even the scholars and worshippers?" Whereas if he believed that the like of that is not dared by a scholar nor undertaken by a considered, successful person, it would be difficult for him to dare it.

How many a person eagerly pursues the world, is greedy to amass it, is desperate in love of leadership and adorning it, makes its ugliness light upon himself, and claims that the Companions, may God be pleased with them, did not purify themselves from the love of leadership. He may even cite as evidence for that the fighting between 'Ali and Mu'awiyah, and he suspects within himself that it was not...

For seeking not the truth but leadership, this belief is erroneous, making the pursuit of leadership and its attendant sins seem trivial to him. A base disposition inclines toward following missteps and turning away from good deeds, even to deeming a misstep where none exists by interpreting matters according to desire, to use it as a pretext. This is among the subtle snares of Satan. Therefore, God described those who repel Satan therein with His words: "Those who listen to speech and follow the best of it." The Prophet (peace be upon him) gave an example for this, saying: "The likeness of one who sits and listens to wisdom, then acts only upon the worst of what he hears, is like a man who came to a shepherd and said, 'O shepherd, give me a sheep from your flock.' He said, 'Go and take the best sheep in it.' So he went and took hold of the ear of the sheepdog." The hadith: "The likeness of one who hears wisdom, then carries from it only the worst of what he hears, is like a man who came to a shepherd and said, 'O shepherd, give me a sheep from your flock'..." was narrated by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurairah with a weak chain. And whoever transmits the missteps of the imams, this is also his example.

Among what indicates the diminishing impact of something upon the heart due to its repetition and frequent observation is that most people, if they see a Muslim breaking the fast during the day in Ramadan, deem it far from him, to the point of nearly leading them to believe in his disbelief. Yet they may observe one who delays prayers beyond their times, and their natures are not repelled from him as they are repelled from delaying the fast, even though abandoning a single prayer necessitates disbelief according to some, and severing the neck according to others, while abandoning the fast of Ramadan entirely does not necessitate that. There is no reason for this except that prayer is repeated, and negligence in it becomes common, so its impact diminishes in the heart through frequent observation. Therefore, if a jurist were to wear a garment of silk, or a ring of gold, or drink from a silver vessel, souls would deem it far from him and their disapproval would be severe. Yet one may be observed in a lengthy gathering speaking only by backbiting people, and it is not deemed far from him, while backbiting is more severe than fornication. How then could it not be more severe than wearing silk? But the frequent hearing of backbiting and observing backbiters diminishes its impact upon hearts and makes its matter trivial to the soul. So be alert to these subtleties and flee from people as you would flee from a lion, for you witness from them only what increases your greed for this world and your heedlessness of the Hereafter, makes sin seem trivial to you, and weakens your desire for obedience. If you find a companion whose sight and conduct remind you of God, then cling to him, do not leave him, seize the opportunity, and do not belittle him, for he is the gain of the wise and the lost property of the believer. Realize that a righteous companion is better than solitude, and solitude is better than an evil companion. Whenever you understand these meanings, observe your own nature, and consider the state of whom you intend to keep company with, it will not be hidden from you whether withdrawal through seclusion is preferable or drawing near through companionship. Beware of judging absolutely for seclusion or companionship that one is preferable, for every detailed matter: an absolute statement therein with a 'no' or 'yes' is mere contradictory speech, and there is no truth in a detailed matter except detailed consideration.

The third benefit: Deliverance from trials and disputes, and safeguarding religion and the self from plunging into them and exposing oneself to their dangers. Lands are seldom free from partisanships, trials, and disputes, so one who withdraws from them is safe from them. Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As said when the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) mentioned trials and described them, saying: "When you see people's covenants violated, their trusts betrayed, and they become like this"—and he interlaced his fingers—I said, "What do you command me?" He said, "Adhere to your house, control your tongue, take what you know, leave what you disapprove, and concern yourself with your own specific affairs, leaving the affairs of the common people." The hadith of Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As: "When you see people's covenants violated and their trusts betrayed..." was narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" with a good chain. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that he (peace be upon him) said: "A time is soon coming when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he follows to the mountain peaks and places of rainfall, fleeing with his religion from trials from one peak to another." The hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "A time is soon coming when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he follows to the mountain peaks and places of rainfall, fleeing with his religion from trials"—narrated by al-Bukhari. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported that he (peace be upon him) said: "A time will come upon people when no one with religion will retain his religion except one who flees with his religion from village to village, from peak to peak, and from burrow to burrow, like a fox that slips away." It was said to him, "When is that, O Messenger of God?" He said, "When livelihood is attained only through disobedience to God Almighty. When that time comes, celibacy becomes permissible." They said, "How, O Messenger of God, when you have commanded us to marry?" He said, "When that time comes, a man's destruction will be at the hands of his parents. If he has no parents, then at the hands of his wife and child. If he has none, then at the hands of his relatives." They said...

And how is that, O Messenger of God? He said: They reproach him for his straitened means, so he undertakes what he cannot afford, until that leads him to the paths of ruin. The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: There will come upon people a time when no one with religion will keep his religion safe except one who flees with his religion from village to village and from mountain peak to mountain peak. This was mentioned in the chapter on marriage, and this hadith, though concerning celibacy, implies seclusion, for the married person cannot do without livelihood and mixing with people. Yet he will not attain livelihood except by disobeying God Almighty. I do not say this, or that such a time is now, for indeed this existed in ages before this age. And because of this, Sufyan said: By God, seclusion has become necessary. And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned the days of tribulation and the days of slaughter. I asked: What is the slaughter? He said: When a man does not feel safe from his companion. I said: What do you command me if I live to see that time? He said: Restrain your tongue and your hand, and enter your house. I said: O Messenger of God, what if he enters my house? He said: Then enter your room. I said: What if he enters my room? He said: Then enter your mosque and do like this—and he grasped his wrist—and say: My Lord is God, until you die. The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned tribulation and the days of slaughter. I asked: What is the slaughter? He said: When a man does not feel safe from his companion. Abu Dawud transmitted it in an abbreviated form, and al-Khattabi transmitted it in full in his work on seclusion. In its chain according to al-Khattabi there is an interruption, but Abu Dawud connected it with the addition of a man named Salim, whose status needs to be known. And Sa'd, when called to go out during the days of Mu'awiyah, said: No, unless you give me a sword with two seeing eyes and a tongue that speaks, so that I may strike the disbeliever and withhold from the believer. And he said: Our likeness and yours is like a people who were upon a clear white path. While they were traveling thus, a dust-storm arose, and they lost the way and became confused. Some of them said: The path is to the right—so they took it and became lost and astray. Some said: To the left—so they took it and became lost and astray. Others dismounted and halted until the wind subsided and the path became clear, then they journeyed on. So Sa'd and a group with him withdrew; they parted from the tribulations and did not mix with them except after they had ceased. And from Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, that when he heard that al-Husayn, may God be pleased with him, was heading for Iraq, he followed him and caught up with him after a journey of three days. He said to him: Where are you going? He said: To Iraq. And he had with him scrolls and letters. He said: These are their letters and their pledge of allegiance. He said: Do not look at their letters, and do not go to them. But he refused. So he said: I will tell you a narration: Gabriel came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and gave him the choice between this world and the Hereafter, and he chose the Hereafter over this world. And you are a part of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. By God, none of you will ever attain it, and it has only been diverted from you for that which is better for you. But he refused to turn back. So Ibn 'Umar embraced him and wept, and said: I entrust you to God from being killed or taken captive. The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: When he heard that al-Husayn was heading for Iraq, he caught up with him after a journey of three days... and in it is that he, peace and blessings be upon him, was given the choice between this world and the Hereafter, and he chose the Hereafter. Al-Tabarani narrated it, limiting it to the elevated part. He narrated it in al-Awsat with a brief mention of al-Husayn's story, and did not say "after a journey of three days." Similarly, al-Bazzar narrated something like it, and their chains are good. Among the Companions there were ten thousand, yet during the days of tribulation no more than forty men remained light (i.e., did not become heavy with sin). And Tawus sat in his house. He was asked about that, and he said: The corruption of the time and the injustice of the rulers. And when 'Urwah built his palace at al-'Aqiq and remained there, it was said to him: You have clung to the palace and abandoned the mosque of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. He said: I saw your mosques as places of diversion, your markets as places of idle play, and indecency rampant in your open roads, while over there is well-being from what you are in. Therefore, caution from disputes and the stirrings of tribulation is one of the benefits of seclusion. The fourth benefit is deliverance from the evil of people, for they harm you sometimes with backbiting, sometimes with ill suspicion and accusation due to false expectations and desires that are difficult to fulfill, and sometimes with slander or lies. Perhaps they see from you actions or words whose reality their intellects cannot grasp, so they take that as a store they keep for a time when an opportunity for evil appears. If you withdraw from them, you become free from guarding against all of that. For this reason, one of the wise men said to another: I will teach you two lines better than ten thousand dirhams. He asked: What are they? He said: Lower your voice if you speak by night, and look around by day before speaking, for speech cannot be retrieved once it emerges, whether it be ugly or beautiful. And undoubtedly, whoever mixes with people and shares in their affairs will not be free from an envier and an enemy who thinks ill of him, imagines that he is preparing to oppose him, and plots a snare against him and lays an ambush behind him. For people, whenever their eagerness for a matter intensifies, consider everyone...

A cry is raised against them—they are the enemy, so beware of them. Their greed for this world has intensified, so they suspect none but greed in others. Al-Mutanabbi said: When a person’s deeds are vile, his suspicions become vile, and what he habitually imagines he believes to be true. He turns against his loved ones with the words of his foes, and thus he finds himself in a night darkened by doubt. It has been said: Keeping company with the wicked begets ill thoughts of the righteous. The kinds of harm a person encounters from acquaintances and those he mingles with are many, and we shall not prolong detailing them, for what we have mentioned points to their collective nature. In seclusion lies deliverance from all of them. To this, most of those who chose seclusion alluded. Abu al-Darda’ reported—and it is narrated as elevated—and a poet said: He who praises people without testing them, then tests them, will blame those he praised. And he becomes so accustomed to solitude that both the near and the distant become a source of estrangement. Umar, may God be pleased with him, said of seclusion: It is rest from a bad companion. Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr was asked, “Will you not come to Medina?” He replied, “None remain there except one who envies blessings or rejoices in calamity.” Ibn al-Sammak wrote to a companion of ours: “To proceed: People used to be a remedy by which one was cured, but they have become a disease with no cure. So flee from them as you would flee from a lion.” A certain Bedouin would keep to a tree, saying, “It is a companion possessing three traits: if it hears from me, it does not betray me; if I vent before it, it bears with me; and if I act unruly toward it, it does not become angry.” Al-Rashid heard this and said, “It made me disdain companions.” Another had taken to books and graves. When asked about it, he said, “I have seen nothing safer than solitude, nothing more admonishing than a grave, and no companion more beneficial than a book.” Al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, intended to perform Hajj. Thabit al-Bunani heard of this—he too was among the friends of God—and said, “I heard you intend Hajj, and I wished to accompany you.” Al-Hasan replied, “Woe to you! Leave us to associate under the veil God has placed over us. I fear that if we accompany one another, each might see in the other what would cause mutual aversion.” This points to another benefit of seclusion: preserving the veil over one’s religion, integrity, character, poverty, and all other private shortcomings. God Most High praised those who conceal their needs, saying, “The ignorant suppose them wealthy because of their restraint.” And a poet said: No disgrace if blessings depart from the noble, but disgrace lies in the loss of outward grace. A person is not free, in religion, worldly affairs, character, or deeds, from private shortcomings; the best course is to conceal them, for safety does not endure once they are exposed. Abu al-Darda’ said: “People used to be leaves without thorns, but people today are thorns without leaves.” If this was the judgment of his time—the late first century—then one ought not doubt that later times are worse. Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah reported that Sufyan al-Thawri said to him, in wakefulness during his life and in a dream after his death: “Reduce your acquaintances, for extricating oneself from them is difficult. I do not think I have seen anything I dislike except from those I knew.” Another said: “I came to Malik ibn Dinar while he was sitting alone, and a dog had placed its chin on his knee. I went to drive it away, but he said, ‘Leave it, O this one; it does no harm nor injury, and it is better than a bad companion.’” Someone was asked, “What moved you to seclude yourself from people?” He answered, “I feared my religion would be stripped from me without my noticing.” This alludes to the stealthy influence of a bad companion’s character upon one’s nature. Abu al-Darda’ said: “Fear God and beware of people, for they have mounted no camel’s back but made it turn away, spurred no steed but lamed it, and entered no believer’s heart but ruined it.” Another said: “Reduce your acquaintances, for it is safer for your religion and heart, and lighter in relieving you of obligations, because the more acquaintances increase, the greater the obligations become, and fulfilling all becomes difficult.” Another said: “Disown those you know, and do not acquaint yourself with those you do not know.” The fifth benefit is that people’s expectations of you cease, and your expectations of them cease. As for the cessation of people’s expectations, it contains benefits: pleasing people is an unattainable goal, so occupying oneself with rectifying one’s own soul is preferable. Among the lightest and easiest obligations are attending funerals, visiting the sick, and attending weddings and feasts—yet these involve wasting time and exposure to harms. Moreover, obstacles may prevent some, and excuses must be offered, but one cannot display every excuse, so they will say, “You fulfilled so-and-so’s right but fell short in ours,” and that becomes a cause of enmity. It has been said: “Who does not visit a sick person at the time of visitation secretly wishes his death, fearing embarrassment if he recovers despite his neglect.” If you deny all people equally, they all become content with you; but if you single some out, they feel estranged. To extend all rights to everyone is beyond the capacity of one devoted to it night and day—how much more so for one preoccupied with important matters of religion or worldly life? Amr ibn al-‘As said: “Many friends mean many creditors.” Ibn al-Rumi said: “Your enemy is derived from your friend, so do not multiply companions excessively, for illness most often comes from food or drink.”

Imam al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, said: The root of every enmity is showing kindness to the base. As for cutting off your hope from them, that too is a great benefit. For whoever looks upon the bloom and adornment of this world, his greed is stirred, and from the force of greed his covetousness is roused; yet in most circumstances he sees nothing but disappointment, and is pained by it. Whenever he withdraws, he does not behold; and when he does not behold, he does not desire, nor does he covet. Therefore God Almighty said: “And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them.” And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Look at those who are beneath you and do not look at those who are above you, for that is more likely to keep you from belittling God’s favor upon you.” The hadith, “Look at those who are beneath you…” was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And ‘Awn ibn ‘Abdullah said: “I used to sit with the wealthy and I was constantly distressed; I would see a garment finer than mine and a mount better than mine. Then I sat with the poor and found relief.” It is related that al-Muzani, may God have mercy on him, went out from the gate of the mosque of al-Fustat when Ibn ‘Abd al-Hakam approached in his procession. He was dazzled by what he saw of his fine state and handsome appearance, so he recited God’s words: “And We have made some of you a trial for others: will you be patient?” Then he said: “Yes, I will be patient and content.” And he was poor and destitute. So one who remains in his home is not tested by such trials. For whoever beholds the adornment of this world, either his religion and certainty grow strong so that he endures until he swallows the bitterness of patience—and patience is difficult—or his desire is stirred and he schemes in pursuit of the world, thus perishing an everlasting ruin. In this world, it is through covetousness that mostly ends in disappointment, for not everyone who seeks the world finds it easy. And in the Hereafter, it is because he prefers the enjoyment of the world over the remembrance of God Almighty and drawing near to Him. Therefore Ibn al-A‘rabi said: “If the door of humiliation lies on the side of wealth, I soar to the heights from the side of poverty.” He indicated that covetousness immediately brings about humiliation. The sixth benefit is deliverance from seeing the burdensome and foolish and from enduring their folly and their manners. For looking at a burdensome person is the lesser blindness. Al-A‘mash was asked: “Why are your eyes weak?” He said: “From looking at the burdensome.” It is related that Abu Hanifah visited him and he said in the report: “Whoever is deprived by God of his two precious things, God compensates him with what is better than them.” The hadith, “Whoever is deprived by God of his two precious things, God compensates him with what is better than them,” was transmitted by al-Tabarani with a weak chain from the narration of Jarir: “Whoever is deprived of his two precious things, I compensate him with Paradise for them.” A similar version with a good chain is found in Ahmad from the narration of Abu Umamah, and in al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas: God, blessed and exalted, says: “If I test My servant with his two beloved ones and he is patient, I compensate him with Paradise for them,” meaning his two eyes. So he was asked: “What has He compensated you with?” He replied in a jesting manner: “God compensated me for them by sparing me the sight of the burdensome—and you are among them!” And Ibn Sirin said: “I heard a man say: ‘I looked at a burdensome person once and I fainted.’” And Galen said: “Everything has a sanctuary, and the sanctuary of the soul is not looking at the burdensome.” And al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, said: “Never did I sit with a burdensome person except that I felt the side of my body next to him as if it were heavier upon me than the other side.” These benefits, apart from the first two, pertain to worldly, immediate aims, but they also relate to religion. For whenever a person is harmed by seeing a burdensome one, he is not safe from backbiting him or disapproving of what is God’s doing. If he is harmed by another through backbiting, ill opinion, envy, tale-bearing, or the like, he cannot refrain from retaliating, and all of that leads to corruption of religion. And in seclusion there is safety from all of that. Now understand the harms of seclusion. Know that among the religious and worldly aims are those attained by seeking help from others, and that is only achieved through mixing. So whatever benefit is gained from mixing is lost through seclusion, and its loss is among the harms of seclusion. Consider, then, what the benefits of mixing and the motives for it are: they are teaching and learning, benefiting and being benefited, disciplining and being disciplined, companionship and providing it, attaining reward and enabling others to attain it through fulfilling rights, accustoming oneself to humility, and gaining experience by observing conditions and taking lesson from them. Let us detail these, for they are among the benefits of mixing, and they are seven. The first benefit is teaching and learning. We have mentioned their merit in the Book of Knowledge, and they are the greatest acts of worship in this world. They are inconceivable except through mixing, except that the sciences are many, and from some there is a way to abstain, while some are necessary in this world. So one who needs to learn what is obligatory upon him is disobedient if he remains in seclusion. But if he has learned the obligatory and is not inclined to delve into the sciences and sees engagement in worship as preferable, then let him seclude himself. If he is capable of excelling in the sciences of revelation and reason, then seclusion in his case before learning is the utmost loss.

For this reason, al-Nakha‘i and others said: "Acquire religious understanding, then withdraw." For whoever withdraws before learning will, in most cases, waste his time in sleep or in frivolous thought. At best, he will consume his time with litanies he can complete, yet he will not be free in his physical and spiritual works from types of delusion that ruin his striving and nullify his deeds. Consequently, he will not know, nor will his belief concerning God and His attributes be free from the illusions he imagines and finds comfort in, or from corrupt thoughts that assail him therein. Thus, in most of his states, he becomes a plaything for Satan while he sees himself among the worshippers. Knowledge is the foundation of the religion, so there is no good in the seclusion of the common folk and the ignorant—meaning one who does not perform worship well in solitude nor knows all that is required therein. The soul is like a sick person in need of a gentle, skillful physician to treat him. If an ignorant sick person isolates himself from the physician before learning medicine, his illness will inevitably worsen. Therefore, seclusion is only fitting for the learned. As for teaching, there is immense reward in it, provided the intention of the teacher and the student is sound. But if the aim is to establish prestige and multiply companions and followers, it is the ruin of the religion. We have explained the aspect of this in the Book of Knowledge. The ruling for the learned person in this time is to withdraw if he desires the safety of his religion, for he sees no one seeking benefit for his religion. Rather, there is no seeker except for embellished speech to attract the common folk in the arena of preaching, or for intricate argumentation to silence peers and draw near to rulers, used in the arena of rivalry and ostentation. The most sought-after knowledge is jurisprudence, and it is mostly sought only to gain precedence over peers, assume positions of authority, and amass wealth. All these people necessitate, for the sake of religion and prudence, withdrawal from them. If one encounters a seeker for God's sake, drawing near to God through knowledge, then to withdraw from him and conceal knowledge from him is among the greatest sins. This is encountered in a large city no more than one or two, if encountered at all. One should not be deceived by the saying of Sufyan: "We learned knowledge for other than God, but knowledge refused to be for other than God." For jurists learn for other than God, then they return to God. Look at the latter part of most of their lives and take them as a lesson, for they died while they were ruined in pursuit of the world, greedily clinging to it, or they turned away from it and were ascetic towards it. Hearing is not like seeing. Know that the knowledge Sufyan referred to is the knowledge of Hadith, interpretation of the Quran, and knowing the biographies of the prophets and companions, for in them is intimidation and warning, which is a cause for arousing fear of God. If it does not have an effect immediately, it will have an effect ultimately. As for speculative theology and pure jurisprudence pertaining to legal rulings on transactions and settling disputes—its doctrines and disagreements—it does not turn one who is desirous of the world back to God. Rather, he continues plunging deeper in his greed until the end of his life. Perhaps what we have placed in this book, if a student learns it out of desire for the world, it may be permissible to be lenient regarding it, for it is hoped he will be deterred by it at the end of his life, for it is replete with intimidation by God, encouragement regarding the Hereafter, and warning against the world. That is what is found in the Hadiths and interpretation of the Quran, and is not found in speculative discourse, nor in disagreements, nor in doctrine. One should not deceive himself, for the negligent one who is aware of his negligence is in a happier state than the ignorant, deluded one, or the willfully ignorant, cheated one. Every learned person whose eagerness for teaching intensifies is likely to have as his aim acceptance and prestige, and his share is the immediate pleasure of the soul in feeling superiority over the ignorant and being arrogant towards them. The affliction of knowledge is arrogance. The known Hadith, "The affliction of knowledge is arrogance," is what Mutayyan narrated in his Musnad from the Hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib with a weak chain: "The affliction of knowledge is forgetfulness, and the affliction of worship is arrogance," as the Prophet, peace be upon him, said. For that reason, it is narrated from Bishr that he buried seventeen chests of Hadith books he had heard, and he would not narrate, saying, "I desire to narrate, therefore I do not narrate. If I desired not to narrate, I would narrate." For that reason, he said, "‘He narrated to us’ is a door from the doors of the world. When a man says ‘He narrated to us,’ he is only saying ‘Make room for me.’" And Rabi‘ah al-‘Adawiyyah said to Sufyan al-Thawri, "You are an excellent man, were it not for your desire for the world." He said, "In what?" She said, "In Hadith." For that reason, Abu Sulayman al-Darani said, "Whoever marries, or seeks Hadith, or occupies himself with travel, has leaned towards the world." These are afflictions we have alerted to in the Book of Knowledge. Prudence dictates precaution through seclusion and avoiding multiplying companions as much as possible. Indeed, for one who seeks the world through his teaching and instruction, the correct course for him, if he is heedless in such a time as this, is to abandon it. Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi spoke truthfully when he said: "Leave those who desire your companionship and learning from you, for you have from them neither wealth nor beauty; they are brothers of outward show."

The enemies of secrets, when they meet you, flatter you; but when you are absent from them, they slander you. Whoever among them comes to you becomes a watcher over you, and when he leaves, he becomes an orator against you. People of hypocrisy, tale-bearing, malice, and deceit—do not be deceived by their gathering around you. For their aim is not knowledge, but rather status and wealth, and to take you as a ladder to their goals and desires, and as a beast of burden for their needs. If you fall short in any of their aims, they become your fiercest enemies. Then they consider their frequenting you as a claim upon you, and they regard it as a right obligatory upon you, and they impose on you that you expend your honor, your influence, and your religion for them: that you oppose their enemy, aid their relative, their servant, and their ally, and rise up for them as a fool when you were a jurist, and become for them a lowly follower after you were a followed leader. Therefore it is said: "Avoiding the common people is complete nobility." This is the meaning of his speech, even if it differs in some wording, and it is true and correct. For you see teachers in constant bondage, under a necessary duty and a heavy obligation from those who frequent them, as if he brings them his gifts and considers his right obligatory upon them. Perhaps he does not attend unless he is guaranteed a continuous provision. Then the poor teacher may be unable to fulfill that from his own wealth, so he continually goes to the doors of rulers and endures humiliation and hardships like a lowly, despised one, until he writes for himself, through some forms of unlawful gain, forbidden wealth. Then the agent continually steals from him, employs him, degrades him, and humiliates him until he delivers to him what he considers a renewed favor from himself upon him. Then he remains in the ordeal of division among his companions: if he treats them equally, the discerning despise him and attribute him to foolishness, lack of discernment, and inability to grasp the distributions of merit and to uphold the measures of rights with justice; and if he differentiates between them, the fools slander him with sharp tongues and rise against him like lions. So he remains in their ordeals in this world, and in the reckoning for what he takes and distributes among them in the hereafter. The wonder is that with all this tribulation, he deludes himself with falsehoods and lowers himself with the rope of delusion, saying to himself: "Do not refrain from your action, for you, by what you do, intend the Face of God Almighty, disseminate the law of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), spread the knowledge of God's religion, and fulfill the sufficiency of the seekers of knowledge among God's servants. And the wealth of rulers is not owned by them; it is allocated for interests, and what interest is greater than increasing the people of knowledge? Through them, the religion is made manifest and its people are strengthened." Were it not a mockery of Satan, he would know with the slightest reflection that the corruption of the age has no cause except the abundance of such jurists who consume whatever they find and do not distinguish between the lawful and the unlawful, so the eyes of the ignorant look upon them, and they become emboldened to commit sins by their boldness, emulating them and following in their footsteps. Therefore it is said: "The subjects are not corrupted except by the corruption of the kings, and the kings are not corrupted except by the corruption of the scholars." We seek refuge in God from delusion and blindness, for it is the disease that has no cure.

The second benefit: Benefit and being benefited. As for being benefited by people, it is through earning and transactions, and that is not attainable except through mixing, and the one in need is compelled to abandon seclusion, thus falling into a struggle in mixing if he seeks conformity to the Sacred Law therein, as we mentioned in the Book of Earning. If he has wealth that would suffice him contentedly, then seclusion is better for him if the paths of earnings are mostly closed except through sins, unless his aim is earning for charity. If he earns from a lawful source and gives it in charity, it is better than seclusion for occupying oneself with supererogatory acts, but it is not better than seclusion for occupying oneself with realization in the knowledge of God and the knowledge of the Sacred Law, nor than turning with the core of one's aspiration to God Almighty and devoting it to the remembrance of God—I mean for one who has attained intimacy in communion with God through unveiling and insight, not through false illusions and fantasies. As for benefit, it is that he benefits people either with his wealth or with his body, fulfilling their needs as a voluntary duty, for in undertaking to fulfill the needs of Muslims there is reward, and that is not attained except through mixing. Whoever is capable of it while upholding the limits of the Sacred Law, it is better for him than seclusion if in his seclusion he would only occupy himself with supererogatory prayers and bodily acts. But if he is one for whom the path of heart-work has opened through constant remembrance or reflection, then nothing else equals it at all.

The third benefit: Discipline and being disciplined. We mean by it training through enduring people and striving to bear their harm, as a breaking of the ego and a subduing of desires. It is among the benefits gained through mixing, and it is better than seclusion for one whose character is not refined and whose desires do not submit to the limits of the Sacred Law. For this reason, the servants of the Sufis in the retreats volunteer to mix with people through serving them and with the people of the market by asking from them, to humble the insolence of the ego and to seek aid.

Among the blessings of the supplication of the Sufis, who direct their aspirations wholly to God, exalted is He—and this was the principle in bygone eras—now, corrupt motives have mingled with it, and it has deviated from its proper rule, just as other religious rites have deviated. Thus, it has come to seek humility through service only to multiply followers, and to use this as a means to amass wealth and gain strength through numerous adherents. If the intention is such, then seclusion is better than that, even if it leads to the grave. If the intention is to discipline the soul, then it is better than seclusion for one in need of such discipline, which is required at the beginning of spiritual resolve. After attaining discipline, one should understand that the purpose of training a mount is not the training itself, but to make it a conveyance to traverse stages and cover the path upon its back. The body is a mount for the heart to ride, that it may travel the path of the Hereafter. Within it are desires; if not broken, they will bolt with it on the journey. Thus, whoever spends a lifetime occupied with discipline is like one who spends the entire life of a mount training it but never rides it, gaining from it only immediate relief from its biting, kicking, and butting—a benefit, indeed, but the same is obtained from a dead beast. The mount is sought for a benefit derived from its life. Likewise, immediate relief from the pain of desires can be obtained through sleep or death, and one should not be content with that, like the monk who, when addressed, "O monk," replied, "I am not a monk; I am a vicious dog who has restrained myself so as not to bite people." This is good relative to one who bites people, but it should not be the limit, for one who kills himself also does not bite people. Rather, one should aspire to the ultimate goal intended. Whoever understands this and is guided to the path, and is capable of traversing it, will find that seclusion is more helpful for him than mixing with people. Thus, for such a person, mixing first and seclusion later is superior.

As for discipline, we mean by it training others, which is the state of the Sufi master with his disciples, for he cannot refine them except by mixing with them, his state being that of a teacher, with its rulings. Subtle afflictions and hypocrisy may infiltrate this, as they do in spreading knowledge, except that the signs of worldly desire are farther from seekers of discipline than from seekers of knowledge, hence they are fewer in number compared to students of knowledge. Therefore, one should weigh what is available of solitude against what is available of mixing and refining people, comparing one with the other, and choosing the better. This is perceived through subtle diligence and varies with circumstances and individuals, so a universal judgment negating or affirming benefit cannot be made.

The fourth benefit is companionship and solace, which is the aim of those who attend feasts, invitations, and places of socializing and intimacy. This returns to the immediate gratification of the soul and may occur in a forbidden manner by keeping company with those whose company is not permissible, or in a permissible manner. It may also be religiously recommended, as in the case of those whose states and words in religion bring solace, such as the intimacy with shaykhs steadfast in the demeanor of piety. It may relate to the soul's gratification and be recommended if the purpose is to refresh the heart to stir motives of vigor in worship, for when hearts are forced, they become blind. Whenever there is loneliness in solitude and solace in companionship that refreshes the heart, the latter is preferable, as harmony in worship is part of the wisdom of worship. Thus, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, Allah does not tire until you tire." This is something indispensable, for the soul does not consistently embrace the truth unless refreshed, and imposing constant adherence invites lassitude. This is alluded to in his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Indeed, this religion is firm, so enter it gently," and entering it gently is the practice of the insightful. Therefore, Ibn Abbas said, "Were it not for the fear of whispers, I would not sit with people," and once said, "I would enter lands where there is no companion." Do not people corrupt except people? Thus, the one in seclusion cannot do without a companion to find solace in seeing and conversing with for an hour of the day and night. Let him strive to seek one who does not corrupt him in that hour to the detriment of all his other hours, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A person is upon the religion of his close friend, so let one of you look at whom he befriends." Let him strive that their conversation upon meeting be about matters of religion, recounting the states of the heart, its complaints, and its shortcomings in steadfastness upon truth and guidance to righteousness, for in that is relief and refreshment for the soul, offering ample scope for anyone occupied with rectifying himself, for his complaints never cease even over long lifetimes, and he who is satisfied with himself is certainly deluded. This type of solace at some times of the day may be better than seclusion for some.

Let one examine within it the states of the heart and the states of the companion first, then let him keep company for benefit. The fifth benefit is in attaining and granting reward. As for attaining, it is by attending funerals, visiting the sick, and attending the two Eids. As for attending the Friday prayer, it is obligatory, and attending the congregation for all other prayers is also obligatory; there is no concession to leave it except for fear of an apparent harm that counterbalances what is missed from the virtue of the congregation and exceeds it, and that rarely occurs. Likewise, in attending gatherings and invitations, there is reward because it brings joy to the heart of a Muslim. As for granting reward, it is that one opens the door for people to visit him, or to console him in calamities, or congratulate him on blessings, for they thereby attain reward. Similarly, if he is from the scholars and he permits them to visit, they attain the reward of visitation, and he, by enabling it, is a cause in it. Therefore, one should weigh the reward of these interactions against their harms, which we have mentioned, and at that point, seclusion may be preferable, or interaction may be preferable. It has been narrated from a group of the predecessors, like Malik and others, that they would decline invitations, visiting the sick, and attending funerals; rather, they were fixtures of their homes, not leaving except for the Friday prayer or visiting graves. Some of them left the cities and withdrew to the mountain peaks to devote themselves to worship and flee from distractions. The sixth benefit of interaction is humility, for it is among the highest stations, and one cannot achieve it in solitude. Pride may be a reason for choosing seclusion. It has been narrated in the Isra'iliyat that a wise man among the wise authored three hundred and sixty scrolls on wisdom until he thought he had attained a station with God. So God revealed to His prophet: "Say to so-and-so: 'You have filled the earth with hypocrisy, and I do not accept anything from your hypocrisy.'" He said: So he withdrew and secluded himself in a tunnel under the earth and said, "Now I have attained the pleasure of my Lord." So God revealed to His prophet: "Say to him: 'You will not attain My pleasure until you mix with people and endure their harm.'" So he went out, entered the markets, mixed with people, sat with them, ate with them, ate food among them, and walked in the markets with them. Then God Almighty revealed to His prophet: "Now he has attained My pleasure." How many a recluse in his home is driven by pride, and what prevents him from gatherings is that he is not honored or given precedence, or he sees elevating himself above mixing with them as raising his status and preserving the freshness of his mention among people. One may also seclude himself fearing that his faults would appear if he mixed, so he would not be thought of as ascetic and devoted to worship. Thus, he takes the house as a veil over his faults, preserving people's belief in his asceticism and devotion, without immersing the time of seclusion in remembrance or reflection. The sign of these people is that they love to be visited and do not love to visit, and they rejoice at the common people and rulers drawing near to them and gathering at their door and their path, and kissing their hands for blessing. If being occupied with himself were what made interaction and visiting people hateful to him, he would hate their visits to him, as we narrated from al-Fudayl when he said, "Have you come to me except that I adorn myself for you and you adorn yourself for me?" And from Hatim al-Asamm, that he said to the ruler who visited him, "My need is that I do not see you and you do not see me." Whoever is not occupied with himself in the remembrance of God, his seclusion from people is due to his intense occupation with people, because his heart is devoted to turning to their view of him with eyes of reverence and respect. Seclusion for this reason is ignorance from several aspects. One: Humility and interaction do not diminish the status of one who is arrogant due to his knowledge or religion, for 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, used to carry dates and salt in his garment and his hand and say, "The complete one is not diminished in his completeness by what he drags of benefit to his dependents." And Abu Hurayrah, Hudhayfah, Ubayy, and Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with them, used to carry bundles of firewood and sacks of flour on their shoulders. And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, while he was the governor of Medina with firewood on his head, would say, "Make way for your commander." And the master of the messengers, peace and blessings be upon him, would buy something and carry it to his house himself. His companion would say to him, "Let me carry it," and he would say, "The owner of the thing is more entitled to carry it." A narration: He would buy something and carry it to his house himself. His companion would say to him, "Let me carry it," and he would say, "The owner of the goods is more entitled to carry it." Abu Ya'la narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain regarding his carrying the trousers he bought. And al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both, would pass by beggars with pieces of bread before them, and they would say, "Come to the meal, O son of the Messenger of God." He would dismount and sit on the road and eat with them and ride, saying, "Indeed, God does not love the arrogant." The second aspect: He who occupies himself with seeking people's pleasure with him and improving their belief about him is deluded, for if he knew God as He truly should be known, he would know that the creation cannot avail him anything against God, and that his harm...

Its benefit lies solely with God, and there is no benefactor nor harm-bringer except Him. Whoever seeks the pleasure and love of people through God's displeasure, God will be displeased with him and will turn the people against him. Indeed, the pleasure of people is an unattainable goal, so seeking God's pleasure is more worthy of pursuit. For this reason, Al-Shafi‘i said to Yunus ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la, "By God, I only advise you sincerely: there is no path to safety from people. Therefore, consider what is right for you and do it." Hence, it is said: "Whoever is preoccupied with people dies in anguish, while the bold attains delight."

Sahl looked at one of his companions and instructed him to do something he had ordered. The companion replied, "O master, I cannot do it because of people." Sahl turned to his companions and said, "A servant does not attain the reality of this matter until he possesses one of two qualities: either he is a servant from whose eyes people have fallen, so he sees in this world only his Creator, and no one has the power to harm or benefit him; or he is a servant from whose heart his own self has fallen, so he does not care in what state people see him."

Al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, said, "There is no one except that he has lovers and haters. Since this is the case, be with the people of obedience to God." It was said to Al-Hasan, "O Abu Sa‘id, there are people who attend your gathering whose only aim is to catch slips in your speech and trouble you with questions." He smiled and said to the speaker, "Be gentle with yourself, for I have promised my soul the abode of Paradise and proximity to the Merciful, so I aspire to that. But I have not promised my soul safety from people, for I know that their Creator, Provider, Giver of life, and Causer of death was not safe from them."

Moses, peace be upon him, said, "O Lord, restrain the tongues of people from me." He replied, "O Moses, this is something I have not chosen for Myself, so how could I do it for you?" And God, glorified and exalted, revealed to ‘Uzayr, "If your soul is not content that I make you a morsel in the mouths of chewers, I would not have recorded you among the humble with Me."

Therefore, whoever confines himself in his house to ensure people’s good opinions and words about him is in present distress in this world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if only they knew. Thus, seclusion is not recommended except for one who is completely absorbed in his Lord through remembrance, reflection, worship, and knowledge, such that mixing with people would waste his time, increase his afflictions, and disturb his worship. These are hidden dangers in choosing seclusion that must be guarded against, for they are destructive in the guise of salvation.

The seventh benefit is experiences, which are gained through mixing with creation and observing their affairs. Innate intellect is insufficient for understanding the interests of religion and worldly life; rather, experience and practice provide this. There is no good in the seclusion of one not seasoned by experiences. A youth who secludes himself remains ignorant and immature. Rather, he should engage in learning and acquire during his period of study what he needs of experiences, and that suffices him. The rest of the experiences he gains by hearing of conditions, without needing to mix. Among the most important experiences is to test oneself, one’s character, and inner qualities, which cannot be achieved in solitude. For everyone tested in isolation is at ease, and every angry, resentful, or envious person, when alone with himself, does not manifest his corruption. These qualities are destructive in themselves and must be removed and subdued; merely calming them by distancing from what provokes them is insufficient.

The heart filled with these corruptions is like an abscess filled with pus and matter. Its owner may not feel its pain unless it is moved or touched by another. If no hand touches it, no eye sees its form, and no one stirs it, he may assume he is safe and unaware of the abscess within, believing it absent. But if a mover stirs it or a cupper’s lancet pierces it, the pus would burst forth and gush like something choked when released. Similarly, the heart filled with resentment, stinginess, envy, anger, and other blameworthy traits only spews its corruptions when agitated. For this reason, those traversing the path of the Hereafter, seeking purification of hearts, test themselves. Whoever senses pride in himself strives to remove it, to the extent that some would carry a water-skin on their back among people or a bundle of firewood on their head and walk through markets to test themselves with that. For the dangers of the soul and the tricks of Satan are subtle; few perceive them. Thus, it is related from one of them that he said, "I repeated a prayer for thirty years, though I used to pray in the first row. But one day I was delayed for a reason and found no place in the first row, so I stood in the second. I felt my soul sensing shame from people looking at me, as I had been accustomed to the first row. Then I knew that all my prayers I had been offering were tainted with ostentation, mixed with the pleasure of people looking at me and seeing me among the foremost in good."

Mixing has a great and apparent benefit in extracting and revealing corruptions. Hence, it is said, "Travel unveils character," for it is a type of continuous mixing. The dangers of these meanings will come later.

And its subtleties in the quarter of destructive traits, for through ignorance of them, much action is rendered vain, and through knowledge of them, little action is made to flourish. Were it not for this, knowledge would not be superior to action, since it is impossible for knowledge of prayer—when prayer is intended only for the sake of something superior to prayer—to be considered. For we know that what is intended for the sake of something else, that other thing is nobler than it. The Sacred Law has decreed the superiority of the scholar over the worshiper, to the point that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like my superiority over the lowest of my Companions." The meaning of the superiority of knowledge reverts to three aspects. The first is what we have mentioned. The second is the generality of benefit, for its benefit extends, whereas the benefit of action does not extend. The third is that what is intended by it is knowledge of God, His attributes, and His acts, for that is superior to every action. Indeed, the aim of actions is to turn the hearts away from creation to the Creator, so that they may thereafter be stirred towards Him through knowing Him and loving Him. Thus, action and the knowledge of action are intended for the sake of this knowledge, and this knowledge is the ultimate goal of the seekers, while action is like a condition for it. To this is the allusion in His Exalted saying: "To Him ascends the goodly word, and the righteous deed raises it." The goodly word is this knowledge, and the action is like the carrier that raises it to its intended goal. Thus, what is raised is superior to the raiser. This is an interjected discourse not fitting for this discussion, so let us return to the intended point.

We say: When you know the benefits of seclusion and its perils, you realize that issuing an absolute judgment on it, whether by negation or affirmation, is an error. Rather, one must look at the individual and his state, at the companion and his state, at the motive for mixing with him, and at what is lost due to mixing with him from these mentioned benefits. What is lost is measured against what is gained. At that point, the truth becomes clear and the superior course evident. The statement of Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, is the decisive word, for he said: "O Yunus, withdrawing from people earns enmity, and mingling with them attracts evil companions. So be between the withdrawn and the mingling." Therefore, moderation in mixing and seclusion is obligatory, and this varies according to circumstances. By observing the benefits and harms, the superior course becomes clear. This is the plain truth, and all that is mentioned besides this is deficient, for it is merely each person informing of a particular state he is in, and it is not permissible to judge others by it who differ in circumstance.

The difference between the scholar and the Sufi in the outward aspect of knowledge reverts to this: The Sufi speaks only from his own state, hence their answers in matters differ. The scholar is he who comprehends the truth as it truly is and does not look to his own state, thus he unveils the truth therein. That is something in which there is no difference, for the truth is always one, while those falling short of the truth are countless. Therefore, when the Sufis were asked about poverty, not one of them answered except with an answer different from the other's, and all of that is true relative to his state, but it is not true in itself, for the truth cannot be but one. Hence, Abu 'Abdullah al-Jalla' was asked about poverty and said: "Strike your head against the wall and say, 'My Lord is God,' that is poverty." And Al-Junayd said: "The poor man is he who does not ask anyone, does not dispute, and if disputed with, remains silent." And Sahl ibn 'Abdullah said: "The poor man is he who does not ask and does not store." And another said: "It is that you have nothing; if you have something, then you do not have it from where it was not for you." And Ibrahim al-Khawwas said: "It is abandoning complaint and not showing the effect of affliction." The point is that if a hundred of them were asked, you would hear a hundred different answers, with two rarely agreeing. All of that is true from a certain perspective, for it is each one's report of his own state and what dominates his heart. Therefore, we do not see two of them affirming for his companion a footstep in Sufism or praising him. Rather, each one of them claims that he is the one who has reached the truth and stands upon it, because most of their discourse follows the exigencies of the states that occur to their hearts, so they occupy themselves only with themselves and do not turn to others. When the light of knowledge shines, it encompasses all, lifts the veil, and removes disagreement.

The analogy of the view of these people is like what I have seen of a group looking at evidence for the sun's zenith by observing the shadow. Some said: "In summer it is two feet." It was narrated from another that it is half a foot, and another would refute him, saying it is seven feet in winter. It was narrated from another that it is five feet, and another would refute him. This resembles the answers of the Sufis and their differences, for each one of these informed about the shadow he saw in his own land, so he was truthful in his statement but mistaken in correcting his companion, thinking the entire world is his land or like his land. Similarly, the Sufi does not judge the world except by what is his own state. The scholar of the zenith is he who knows the cause of the shadow's length and shortness, and the cause of its variation across lands, so he gives different rulings for different lands and says...

Some shadows do not remain, in some they lengthen, and in some they shorten. This is what we intended to mention regarding the virtue of seclusion and social interaction. If you ask: "For one who chooses seclusion and deems it better and safer for himself, what are his etiquettes in seclusion?" We say: The discussion of etiquettes for social interaction is lengthy, and we have mentioned them in the Book of the Etiquettes of Companionship. As for the etiquettes of seclusion, they are not lengthy. The one in seclusion should intend, by his seclusion, firstly to restrain his own evil from people, then secondly to seek safety from the evil of the wicked, then thirdly to be free from the shortcoming of failing to fulfill the rights of Muslims, then fourthly to devote his utmost effort to the worship of God. These are the etiquettes of his intention. Then, in his solitude, let him be constant in knowledge, action, remembrance, and reflection, to reap the fruit of seclusion. And let him prevent people from frequently visiting him, which would disturb most of his time. And let him refrain from asking about their news and from listening to the rumors of the town and what preoccupies people. For all of that becomes implanted in the heart until it emerges during prayer or reflection unexpectedly. The falling of news upon the hearing is like the falling of seeds upon the earth; they must sprout, their roots and branches spread, and they call to one another. One of the important tasks of the secluded is to cut off the whisperings that divert from the remembrance of God, and news is the source and origin of whisperings. And let him be content with little in livelihood, otherwise expansion would compel him to people and he would need to mix with them. And let him be patient with whatever harm he encounters from neighbors, and let him close his hearing from listening to what is said about him, whether praise for his seclusion or criticism for abandoning social interaction, for all of that affects the heart, even for a short while, and while the heart is occupied with it, it necessarily halts from its journey on the path of the Hereafter. For the journey is either through persistence in litanies and remembrance with presence of heart, or through reflection on the majesty of God, His attributes and actions, and the dominion of His heavens and earth, or through contemplation of the subtleties of deeds and the corrupters of hearts, seeking ways to guard against them. All of this requires leisure, and listening to all that disturbs the heart at present, and its remembrance may renew during constant remembrance unexpectedly. And let him have righteous people or a righteous companion so that his soul may find rest in him for an hour a day from the toil of constant devotion, for in that is assistance for the remaining hours. And patience in seclusion will not be complete for him except by cutting off desire for this world and what people are engrossed in. And his desire will not be cut off except by shortening hope, by not presuming a long life for himself, but rather waking as if he will not reach the evening and evening as if he will not reach the morning. Then patience for a day becomes easy for him, but resolve for patience for twenty years would not be easy if he presumed a distant term. And let him frequently remember death and the loneliness of the grave whenever his heart feels constricted by solitude. And let him realize that whoever does not attain in his heart from the remembrance and knowledge of God what comforts him will not be able to bear the loneliness of solitude after death, and whoever finds comfort in the remembrance and knowledge of God, death does not remove his comfort, for death does not destroy the place of comfort and knowledge. Rather, he remains alive with his knowledge and comfort, rejoicing in God's favor and mercy upon him, as God Almighty said regarding the martyrs: "And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of God as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision, rejoicing in what God has given them of His bounty." And everyone who devotes himself to God in struggling against his soul is a martyr whenever death reaches him advancing, not retreating. For the struggler is he who struggles against his soul and his desires. The hadith: "The struggler is he who struggles against his soul and his desires" was narrated by al-Hakim from the hadith of Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd, and he authenticated it without the phrase "and his desires." It has preceded in the third chapter of the Etiquettes of Companionship, as explicitly stated by the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. And the greater struggle is the struggle against the soul, as some of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, said: "We have returned from the lesser struggle to the greater struggle," meaning the struggle against the soul. Here ends the Book of Seclusion, and following it is the Book of the Etiquettes of Travel, and praise be to God alone.
