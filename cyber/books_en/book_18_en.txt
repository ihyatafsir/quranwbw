The Book of the Etiquettes of Listening and Spiritual Ecstasy
          Being the Eighth Book of the Quarter of Habitual Practices from the Books of the Revival of the Religious Sciences
                           In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Praise be to God, who has burned the hearts of His intimate friends with the fire of His love, captivated their aspirations and their spirits with yearning for meeting Him and witnessing Him, and fixed their gazes and their inner sights upon observing the beauty of His presence, until they became intoxicated from breathing the spirit of union, and their hearts became bewildered from observing the flashes of Majesty and Divinity. They saw nothing in the two worlds save Him, and they remembered nothing in the two abodes except Him. If an image presented itself to their eyes, their inner sights passed to the Fashioner. If a melody struck their ears, their innermost secrets raced to the Beloved. If there came upon them a sound, whether disturbing, unsettling, exhilarating, sorrowful, stirring, yearning, or arousing, their disturbance was only towards Him, their exhilaration only by Him, their unease only for Him, their sorrow only in Him, their yearning only for what is with Him, their rising only for Him, and their turning only around Him. From Him is their hearing, and to Him is their listening. Thus, He has closed their eyes and ears to other than Him. Those are the ones whom God has chosen for His guardianship and selected from among His chosen and intimate ones. And blessings upon Muhammad, sent with His message, and upon his family and his companions, the leaders of truth and its guides, and abundant peace.

Now then, the hearts and innermost selves are treasuries of secrets and mines of jewels. Their jewels are concealed within them, just as fire is concealed within iron and stone, and as water is hidden beneath soil and clay. There is no way to stir their hidden depths except with the sparks of listening, and no access to the hearts save through the vestibule of the ears. Harmonious, delightful melodies draw out what is within them and reveal their beauties or their flaws. Thus, nothing emerges from the heart when stirred except what it contains, just as a vessel exudes only what is within it. Listening is for the heart a true touchstone and a speaking measure. The very act of listening does not reach it without stirring within it that which is predominant over it.

Since hearts, by their nature, are obedient to the ears—so much so that they reveal their hidden contents through what reaches them, uncover their flaws thereby, and display their beauties—it becomes necessary to expound upon listening and spiritual ecstasy, to clarify the benefits and harms within them, the etiquettes and states recommended for them, and the scholarly disagreement that arises concerning them, as to whether they are among the prohibitions or the permissible matters. We shall elucidate this in two chapters: the first chapter on the permissibility of listening, and the second chapter on the etiquettes of listening and its effects on the heart through ecstasy, and on the limbs through dancing, shouting, and tearing garments.

The First Chapter: On Mentioning the Disagreement of the Scholars Regarding the Permissibility of Listening and Unveiling the Truth Within It.
A Clarification of the Statements of the Scholars and the Sufis Concerning Its Permissibility and Prohibition.
Know that listening is the primary matter, and listening yields a state in the heart called spiritual ecstasy. Spiritual ecstasy yields the movement of the limbs: if the movement is unrhythmic, it is called agitation; if rhythmic, it is called clapping and dancing. Let us begin with the ruling on listening, which is the primary matter. We shall transmit therein the statements expressing the various schools of thought on it, then mention the evidence for its permissibility, then follow that with a response to what those who argue for its prohibition rely upon.

As for transmitting the schools of thought: Judge Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari narrated from al-Shafi'i, Malik, Abu Hanifah, Sufyan, and a group of scholars expressions from which it is deduced that they held it to be prohibited. Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said in his book *The Etiquettes of Judging*: "Singing is a frivolity that is disliked, resembling falsehood. Whoever indulges much in it is foolish, and his testimony is rejected." Judge Abu al-Tayyib said: "Listening to a woman who is not a lawful relative is not permissible according to the companions of al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, under any circumstance—whether she is unveiled or behind a veil, and whether she is free or enslaved." He said: "Al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, said: 'The owner of a slave-girl who gathers people to listen to her is foolish, and his testimony is rejected.'" And he said: "It was narrated from al-Shafi'i that he disliked tapping with a stick and said, 'The heretics introduced it to busy people away from the Quran.'" Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said: "Playing with dice is more disliked from the standpoint of the report than playing with any other amusement. I do not like playing chess, and I dislike everything with which people play, for playing is not the practice of people of religion nor of manly virtue."

As for Malik, may God have mercy on him, he forbade singing and said: "If someone buys a slave-girl and finds her to be a singer, he has the right to return her." This is the doctrine of all the people of Medina except Ibn Sa'd alone.

As for Abu Hanifah, may God be pleased with him, he disliked that and considered listening to singing to be among the sins. Likewise, all the people of Kufa: Sufyan al-Thawri, Hammad, Ibrahim, al-Sha'bi, and others. All of this was transmitted by Judge Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari.

Abu Talib al-Makki permitted listening to spiritual audition (sama') from a group, saying: Among the Companions who listened were Abdullah ibn Ja'far, Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah, Mu'awiyah, and others. He said: Many of the righteous predecessors, both Companions and Successors who followed with excellence, did this. He said: The people of the Hijaz, in our presence in Mecca, would continuously listen to spiritual audition during the best days of the year, which are the numbered days in which God commanded His servants to remember Him, such as the Days of Tashriq. And the people of Medina have continuously persisted, like the people of Mecca, in listening up to our time. Thus, we met Abu Marwan the judge, who had female singers who would chant melodies for people; he had prepared them for the Sufis. He said: 'Ata' had two female singers who would chant, and his brothers would listen to them. He said: It was said to Abu al-Hasan ibn Salim: "How can you reject spiritual audition when Junayd, Sari al-Saqati, and Dhu al-Nun used to listen?" He replied: "How can I reject spiritual audition when one better than me permitted it and listened? For Abdullah ibn Ja'far al-Tayyar used to listen. Indeed, God only rejects frivolity and play in audition." It is narrated from Yahya ibn Mu'adh that he said: "We have lost three things, and we do not see them, nor do I see them increasing except in scarcity: a handsome face with chastity, good speech with piety, and sincere brotherhood with faithfulness." I saw in some books this very statement narrated from al-Harith al-Muhasibi, and in it is evidence of his allowance of audition despite his asceticism, his careful piety, and his earnest striving in religion. He said: Ibn Mujahid would not accept an invitation unless there was audition at it. More than one person narrated that he said: "We gathered at an invitation, and with us were Abu al-Qasim Ibn Bint Mani', Abu Bakr Ibn Dawud, and Ibn Mujahid among their peers. Audition was present, so Ibn Mujahid began to urge Ibn Bint Mani' against Ibn Dawud regarding listening. Ibn Dawud said: 'My father narrated to me from Ahmad ibn Hanbal that he disliked audition, and my father disliked it, and I follow my father's school.' Abu al-Qasim Ibn Bint Mani' said: 'As for my grandfather, Ahmad Ibn Bint Mani', he narrated to me from Salih ibn Ahmad that his father would listen to the saying of Ibn al-Khabbazah.' Ibn Mujahid said to Ibn Dawud: 'Leave me alone from your father,' and said to Ibn Bint Mani': 'Leave me alone from your grandfather. What do you say, O Abu Bakr, concerning one who recites a line of poetry—is it forbidden?' Ibn Dawud said: 'No.' He said: 'If he has a beautiful voice, is it forbidden for him to recite?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'If he recites it and lengthens the shortened and shortens the lengthened, is it forbidden for him?' He said: 'I cannot withstand one devil, so how could I withstand two?'" He said: Abu al-Hasan al-'Asqalani al-Aswad, one of the saints, would listen and become ecstatic during audition, and he authored a book on it, refuting its deniers. Likewise, a group among them authored refutations against its deniers. It is narrated from some shaykhs that he said: "I saw Abu al-'Abbas al-Khidr, peace be upon him, and I said to him: 'What do you say about this audition over which our companions have differed?' He said: 'It is the pure, clear water upon which only the feet of the learned stand firm.'" It is narrated from Mumshad al-Dinawari that he said: "I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in a dream, and I said: 'O Messenger of God, do you reject anything from this audition?' He said: 'I do not reject anything from it, but tell them to begin with the Quran before it and conclude with the Quran after it.'" It is narrated from Tahir ibn Bilal al-Hamdani al-Warraq, who was among the people of knowledge, that he said: "I was in retreat in the mosque of Jeddah by the sea, and one day I saw a group in one of its corners saying words and listening. I disapproved of that in my heart and said: 'In one of the houses of God, they are reciting poetry?' Then I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that night, sitting in that direction, and next to him was Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him. Abu Bakr was saying some words, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was listening to him, placing his hand on his chest as one who finds ecstasy. I said to myself: 'It was not fitting for me to disapprove of those who were listening, for here is the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, listening, and Abu Bakr is speaking.' He turned to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: 'This is truth by truth'—or he said: 'truth from truth'—I am uncertain about it." Junayd said: "Mercy descends upon this group in three places: during eating, because they only eat out of need; during spiritual discourse, because they only converse in the stations of the truthful; and during audition, because they listen with ecstasy and witness truthfully." From Ibn Jurayj, it is narrated that he would permit audition. He was asked: "Will it come on the Day of Resurrection among your good deeds or your bad deeds?" He said: "Neither among the good deeds nor the bad deeds, for it is akin to idle talk, and God Almighty said: 'God will not take you to task for idle talk in your oaths.'" This is what has been transmitted from the sayings. Whoever seeks truth in imitation, whenever he exhausts [the search], these sayings will conflict before him, and he will remain perplexed.

Or to incline towards certain statements based on mere whim—and all of that is deficiency. Rather, one ought to seek the truth by its proper path, and that is by investigating the grounds for prohibition and permissibility, as we will mention in clarifying the evidence for the permissibility of listening (to music).

Know that the statement of one who says, "Listening is forbidden," means that God, exalted is He, punishes for it. This is a matter not known by mere reason, but only through revealed tradition (al-samʿ). Knowledge of legal rulings is confined to either textual evidence (al-naṣṣ) or analogy (al-qiyās) based on what is textually established. By "textual evidence," I mean what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, made clear through his saying or his action. By "analogy," I mean the meaning understood from his words and actions. If there is no textual evidence concerning it, and no valid analogy can be made to a textually established ruling, then the claim of its prohibition is invalidated, and it remains an action in which there is no blame, like all other permissible matters. There is no textual evidence or analogy that indicates the prohibition of listening. This will become clear in our response to the arguments of those inclined towards prohibition. Whenever a complete response is given to their proofs, that constitutes a sufficient method for establishing this objective. However, we shall begin and say: Textual evidence and analogy both indicate its permissibility.

As for analogy, it is that singing combines meanings about which one should investigate individually and then collectively. For in it is the listening to a pleasant, rhythmic sound with an intelligible meaning that stirs the heart. The most general description is that it is a pleasant sound. Then, "pleasant" is divided into the rhythmic and the non-rhythmic. The rhythmic is divided into the intelligible, like poetry, and the non-intelligible, like the sounds of inanimate objects and other animals. As for listening to a pleasant sound insofar as it is pleasant, it should not be forbidden; rather, it is lawful by textual evidence and analogy.

As for the analogy, it reverts to the delight of the sense of hearing in perceiving what is specific to it. A human being has intellect and five senses. Each sense has its perceptions, and among the perceptions of that sense are things that are pleasurable. The pleasure of sight in beautiful visible things, like greenery, flowing water, a handsome face, and in sum, all beautiful colors—these are in contrast to disliked, turbid, ugly colors. For smell, there are pleasant fragrances, in contrast to repulsive stenches. For taste, there are delicious flavors like richness, sweetness, and sourness, in contrast to abhorrent bitterness. For touch, there is the pleasure of softness, smoothness, and sleekness, in contrast to roughness and coarseness. For the intellect, there is the pleasure of knowledge and understanding, in contrast to ignorance and dullness. Similarly, sounds perceived by hearing are divided into the pleasurable, like the sound of nightingales and flutes, and the repulsive, like the braying of donkeys and the like. How clear is the analogy of this sense and its pleasures to the other senses and their pleasures!

As for textual evidence, it indicates the permissibility of listening to a beautiful sound through God's favor upon His servants, as He said, "He increases in creation what He wills." It was said this refers to the beautiful voice. And in the hadith: "God did not send any prophet except that he had a beautiful voice." (The hadith "God did not send any prophet except that he had a beautiful voice" was reported by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shamāʾil from Qatādah, who added: "And your Prophet had a handsome face and a beautiful voice." We have also reported it with a connected chain in al-Ghaylāniyyāt from the narration of Qatādah from Anas. Al-Dāraquṭnī said the first is correct. Ibn Mardawayh reported it in his Tafsīr from the hadith of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, though all its chains are weak.)

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God is more attentive to the man with a beautiful voice in reciting the Qur'an than the owner of a singing-girl is to his girl." (The hadith "God is more attentive to the man with a beautiful voice in reciting the Qur'an than the owner of a singing-girl is to his girl" was mentioned earlier in the Book of Reciting the Qur'an.)

And in a hadith, in the context of praising David, peace be upon him, it is said that he had a beautiful voice in lamenting himself and in reciting the Psalms, so much so that humans, jinn, wild beasts, and birds would gather to listen to his voice, and four hundred biers—or a number close to that—would be present in his gathering. (The hadith "David had a beautiful voice in lamenting himself and in reciting the Psalms" — I did not find a source for it.)

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said in praise of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī: "He has indeed been given a flute from the flutes of the family of David." (The hadith "He has indeed been given a flute from the flutes of the family of David," said in praise of Abū Mūsā, was mentioned earlier in the Book of Reciting the Qur'an.)

And the saying of God, exalted is He, "Indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the braying of donkeys," implies by its understood meaning the praise of the beautiful sound.

If it were permissible to say that this was only permitted on the condition that it be in the Qur'an, it would necessarily follow that listening to the sound of the nightingale is forbidden because it is not from the Qur'an. And if it is permissible to listen to a meaningless, idle sound, then why should it not be permissible to listen to a sound from which wisdom and sound meanings are understood? For indeed, in some poetry there is wisdom.

This is the consideration regarding the sound insofar as it is pleasant and beautiful. The second level is the consideration of the pleasant, rhythmic sound. For rhythm is beyond mere pleasantness. How many pleasant sounds are outside of rhythm, and how many rhythmic sounds are not pleasing? Rhythmic sounds, according to their sources, are of three types: They either emanate from an inanimate object, like the sound of...

Psalms, strings, striking the rod, the drum, and other instruments, or that which emerges from the throat of an animal—that animal being either a human or other, like the sound of nightingales, ringdoves, and melodious birds—these, despite their pleasantness, are measured and harmonious in their openings and closings, hence their hearing is found delightful. The origin of sounds lies in the throats of animals, and wind instruments were fashioned in imitation of the sounds of throats, which is to liken craftsmanship to creation. There is nothing that artisans strive to depict through their craft except that it has a counterpart in the creation which God, exalted is He, has reserved for His own invention; from it artisans learn and by it they intend to emulate. Elaborating on this would be lengthy. Thus, hearing these sounds cannot possibly be prohibited merely because they are pleasant or rhythmic, for no one goes so far as to prohibit the sound of the nightingale and other birds. There is no distinction between one throat and another, nor between inanimate and animate, so the sounds emanating from other bodies by human choice—such as that which comes from one's throat, or from the rod, drum, tambourine, and others—should be analogized to the sound of the nightingale. Excepted from this are only the musical instruments, strings, and wind instruments that the sacred law has prohibited. The hadith prohibiting musical instruments, strings, and wind instruments was reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik al-Ash'ari: "There will be among my community people who will consider lawful silk, brocade, and musical instruments." Its form in al-Bukhari is that of a suspended narration, and for this reason Ibn Hazm deemed it weak, while Abu Dawud and al-Isma'ili reported it with a connected chain. "Al-Ma'azif" means musical instruments, as stated by al-Jawhari. Ahmad reported from the narration of Abu Umamah: "God commanded me to abolish wind instruments and kiyarat," meaning lutes and musical instruments. And from the narration of Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah: "My Lord has forbidden me wine, the kubah, and the qinin." And in a narration from Abu Umamah regarding their considering wines lawful and their striking tambourines—all of these are weak. Abu al-Shaykh reported from a mursal narration: "Listening to musical instruments is disobedience." Abu Dawud reported from the narration of Ibn 'Umar that he heard a wind instrument and placed his fingers in his ears. Abu Dawud said it is rejected, not because of its pleasure, for if it were due to pleasure, then everything that brings pleasure to a person would be measured against it. But wines were prohibited, and the people's addiction to them necessitated an extreme weaning from them, to the point that initially it led to smashing the wine vessels. Thus, along with them, what became emblematic of drinkers—namely strings and wind instruments—were prohibited. Their prohibition was due to following, just as seclusion with a non-mahram woman is prohibited because it is a prelude to intercourse, and looking at the thigh is prohibited due to its connection to the private parts, and a small amount of wine is prohibited even if it does not intoxicate because it leads to intoxication. There is no prohibition except that it has a surrounding forbidden zone, and the ruling of prohibition extends to its zone to serve as a protection for the forbidden, a safeguard for it, and a barrier preventing approach, as the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Every king has a sanctuary, and God's sanctuary is His prohibitions." The hadith "Every king has a sanctuary, and God's sanctuary is His prohibitions" was previously mentioned in the Book of the Lawful and the Forbidden. Thus, they are prohibited secondarily due to the prohibition of wine for three reasons: First, they lead to drinking wine, for the pleasure attained through them is only complete with wine, and for a similar reason a small amount of wine is prohibited. Second, for one recently accustomed to drinking wine, they remind of gatherings of conviviality with drinking, so they are a cause of remembrance, and remembrance is a cause of arousing longing, and when the arousal of longing becomes strong, it is a cause of taking action. For this reason, it is forbidden to prepare nabidh in pitched vessels, jugs, and hollowed trunks—the hadith prohibiting jugs, pitched vessels, and hollowed trunks is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas—these being vessels specifically associated with it. The meaning of this is that seeing their form reminds one of them. This reason differs from the first, as it does not consider pleasure in the remembrance, for there is no pleasure in seeing the flask and drinking vessels, but rather from the aspect of being reminded by them. If listening reminds of drinking in a way that arouses longing for wine in one accustomed to that with drinking, then it is forbidden to listen due to this specific reason within it. Third, gathering for them, since it has become a habit of the immoral, thus it is forbidden to imitate them, for whoever imitates a people is one of them. For this reason, we say to abandon a sunnah practice whenever it becomes emblematic of innovators, out of fear of resembling them. For this reason, striking the kubah—a long drum, narrow in the middle and wide at the ends—is prohibited, as striking it is a habit of effeminate men. Were it not for the imitation involved, it would be like the drum of pilgrims and military expeditions. For this reason, we say: if a group were to gather and adorn their gathering, bring forth drinking vessels and their cups, pour sherbet into them, appoint a cupbearer to circulate among them and serve them, so they take from the cupbearer and drink, and enliven each other with their customary words among themselves, that would be forbidden for them even if the drink were lawful in itself.

For one should not imitate the corrupt, which is why wearing the qabā' cloak and shaving parts of the head while leaving other hair (qaza') are prohibited in lands where the qabā' has become the attire of the corrupt, but not beyond the river, where the righteous are accustomed to it. It is due to these meanings that the Iraqi flute and all stringed instruments—such as the oud, cymbals, rebab, barbat, and others—are forbidden. What falls outside this category, like the shepherds' shahin, the pilgrims' shahin, the drummers' shahin, the drum, the qadib, and every instrument that produces a pleasant, rhythmic sound, except what is customary among drinkers, is not associated with wine, does not evoke it, nor incites desire for it, nor necessitates imitation of its devotees; thus, it does not share the same prohibition and remains permissible by analogy to the sounds of birds and others. Indeed, I say that listening to strings played without harmonious rhythm, even if pleasing, is also forbidden. This clarifies that the reason for their prohibition is not merely pleasant enjoyment, for by analogy all good things are permissible except what entails corruption. God Almighty said: "Say, 'Who has forbidden the adornment of God which He has produced for His servants and the good things of sustenance?'" These sounds are not forbidden merely for being rhythmic sounds; they are forbidden due to an incidental factor, as will come in the third category of forbidden incidents: the rhythmic and meaningful, which is poetry. This emerges only from the human throat, so its permissibility is affirmed, for it adds nothing but meaningfulness, and meaningful speech is not forbidden, nor is a pleasant, rhythmic sound forbidden. If the individual elements are not forbidden, how can their combination be forbidden? However, consideration is given to what is understood from it; if it contains something prohibited, its prose and poetry are forbidden, and uttering it is forbidden whether set to melodies or not. The truth in this is what al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said: "Poetry is speech; its good is good and its bad is bad." Whenever reciting poetry without melody is permissible, reciting it with melodies is permissible, for when permissible individual elements combine, that combination remains permissible. Whenever a permissible element joins another permissible element, it does not become forbidden unless the combination entails a prohibition not present in the individual elements, and there is no prohibition here. How can reciting poetry be denounced when it was recited in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him? The hadith about reciting poetry in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: 'Umar passed by Hassan while he was reciting poetry in the mosque, and he glanced at him. He said, "I have recited poetry in the presence of one better than you," and the hadith continues. In Muslim's version from 'A'ishah: Hassan's recitation, "I satirized Muhammad, so I responded on his behalf, and with God is the reward for that," the poem, and Hassan's recitation also: "The pinnacle of glory among the Hashimites are the sons of the daughter of Makhzum, and your father is a servant." In Bukhari: the recitation of Ibn Rawahah: "Among us is the Messenger of God reciting His Book when the known dawn splits, shining," the verses. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, in poetry there is wisdom," a hadith narrated by Bukhari from Ubayy ibn Ka'b, previously mentioned in the chapter on knowledge. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, recited: "Gone are those in whose protection one lived, and I remain among successors like the skin of a mangy camel." It is narrated in the two Sahihs from 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she said: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, arrived in Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal, may God be pleased with them, fell ill with fever, and there was an epidemic there. She said, "O my father, how do you feel? And O Bilal, how do you feel?" When the fever seized Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, he would say: "Every man is among his family in the morning, and death is nearer than his sandal's thong." And when the fever subsided from Bilal, he would raise his voice and say: "Would that I knew, shall I spend a night in a valley surrounded by idhkhir and jalil plants? And shall I one day visit the waters of Majannah? And shall Shammah and Tufayl appear to me?" 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: I informed the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, of that, and he said, "O God, make Medina beloved to us as we love Mecca, or more." The hadith of 'A'ishah in the two Sahihs: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, arrived in Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal fell ill with fever, the hadith includes Abu Bakr's recitation: "Every man is among his family in the morning, and death is nearer than his sandal's thong," and Bilal's recitation: "Would that I knew, shall I spend a night in a valley surrounded by idhkhir and jalil plants? And shall I one day visit the waters of Majannah? And shall Shammah and Tufayl appear to me?" I say: It is in the two Sahihs as the author mentioned, but the origin of the hadith and the poetry is only in Bukhari, not in Muslim. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to carry clay bricks with the people in building the mosque, saying: "This burden is not the burden of Khaybar; this is purer, our Lord, and cleaner." And he also said, peace and blessings be upon him, on another occasion: "O God, indeed the true life is the life of the Hereafter, so have mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajireen." The hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, used to carry clay bricks with them.

The people were building the mosque while he was saying, "This carrier is not the carrier of Khaybar; this is more pious and purer to our Lord." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said on another occasion, "O Allah, indeed the true life is the life of the Hereafter, so have mercy upon the Ansar and the Muhajireen." The author said: Both verses are in the two Sahih collections. I said: The first verse is uniquely reported by al-Bukhari in the story of the Hijrah from the narration of 'Urwah, as a mursal report, and it contains the second verse as well, except that he said "al-ajr" (reward) instead of "al-'aysh" (life). He quoted the poetry of a Muslim man whose name was not given to me. Ibn Shihab said: "It has not reached us in the narrations that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, ever quoted a complete line of poetry other than this line." The second verse is in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Anas: They were chanting, and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was with them, saying, "O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter, so grant victory to the Ansar and the Muhajireen." The second verse is not metrically perfect. In the two Sahih collections also, it is reported that he said during the digging of the trench with the wording, "So bless the Ansar and the Muhajireen," and in a narration, "So forgive," and in a narration of Muslim, "So honor." Both have from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "So forgive the Muhajireen and the Ansar." These are in the two Sahih collections. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to place a pulpit in the mosque for Hassan, upon which he would stand, defending or championing the cause of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, Allah supports Hassan with the Holy Spirit as long as he defends or champions the cause of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him." The hadith about him placing a pulpit for Hassan in the mosque, upon which he would stand defending or championing the cause of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was reported by al-Bukhari as a mu'allaq report, and by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim as a connected chain from the hadith of 'A'ishah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan sahih." Al-Hakim said: "Its chain is sahih." In the two Sahih collections, she said that he used to defend the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. And when al-Nabighah recited his poetry to him, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "May Allah not break your teeth." The hadith that he said to al-Nabighah when he recited poetry to him, "May Allah not break your teeth," was reported by al-Baghawi in Mu'jam al-Sahabah and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Isti'ab with a weak chain from the hadith of al-Nabighah, whose name is Qays ibn 'Abdullah. He said: I recited to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "Our glory and our forefathers have reached the sky, and we hope for a manifestation beyond that," the verses. Al-Bazzar reported it with the wording, "We have surpassed the servants in chastity and generosity," the verses, and in it he said, "You have done well, O Abu Layla, may Allah not break your teeth." Al-Hakim has from the hadith of Khuzaym ibn Aws: I heard al-'Abbas saying, "O Messenger of Allah, I wish to praise you." He said, "Speak, may Allah not break your teeth." So al-'Abbas said, "Before that you were pure in the shades and in the repository where the leaves are woven," the verses. And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "The companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to recite poetry in his presence, and he would smile." The hadith of 'A'ishah: "The companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to recite poetry, and he would smile," was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah, and he authenticated it, but I have not found it from the hadith of 'A'ishah. And from 'Amr ibn al-Sharid from his father, he said: I recited to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, one hundred verses from the poetry of Umayyah ibn Abi al-Salt, and each time he would say, "Go on, go on." Then he said, "He nearly embraced Islam through his poetry." The hadith of al-Sharid: "I recited to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, one hundred verses from the poetry of Umayyah ibn Abi al-Salt, and each time he would say, 'Go on, go on,'" was reported by Muslim. And from Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to have singing for him on journeys, and that Anjashah used to sing for the women, and al-Bara' ibn Malik used to sing for the men. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "O Anjashah, gently, you are driving the delicate ones." The hadith of Anas: "He used to have singing for him on journeys, and Anjashah used to sing for the women, and al-Bara' ibn Malik used to sing for the men," was reported by Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi. The two Shaykhs agreed on the story of Anjashah without mentioning al-Bara' ibn Malik. Singing to camels has always been, along with beauty, a custom of the Arabs during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and the time of the companions, may Allah be pleased with them. It is nothing but poetry delivered with pleasant voices and rhythmic melodies. No disapproval has been transmitted from any of the companions; rather, they sometimes sought it to urge the camels on and sometimes for enjoyment. Therefore, it is not permissible to prohibit it insofar as it is intelligible speech that is enjoyable, delivered with pleasant voices and rhythmic melodies. The fourth perspective: Considering it from the angle that it stirs the heart and excites what is predominant within it. So I say: To Allah belongs the secret in the correspondence of rhythmic melodies to the spirits, such that they have a wondrous effect upon them. Among sounds, some bring joy, some bring sorrow, some induce sleep, some cause laughter and delight, and some...

From the limbs are drawn movements in rhythm with the hand, foot, and head, and one should not think that this is for understanding the meanings of poetry. Rather, it courses through the strings [of the heart] such that it is said: "Whoever is not moved by spring and its blossoms, by the lute and its strings, is of corrupt temperament and has no cure." How could this be for understanding the meaning, when its effect is witnessed in the infant in its cradle? For a pleasant sound soothes it from its crying, and its soul turns away from what makes it weep to listening intently to it. The camel, despite its dull nature, is affected by the camel-driver's song to such a degree that it lightens heavy burdens and shortens, due to the strength of its vigor upon hearing it, the long distances. There is stirred within it such vigor that intoxicates and distracts it. Thus, you see them when the deserts have grown long upon them and weariness and exhaustion have overcome them under the litters and loads—if they hear the caller of the *huda'* (camel song), they stretch their necks, incline the tips of their ears to the singer, and hasten in their pace until their loads and litters shake upon them. Perhaps they destroy themselves from the intensity of the pace and the heaviness of the load, while they are unaware of it due to their vigor. Indeed, Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Dawud al-Dinawari, known as al-Raqqi (may God be pleased with him), narrated: I was in the desert and came upon a tribe from the tribes of the Arabs. A man among them hosted me and brought me into his tent. I saw in the tent a black slave bound with a chain, and I saw camels that had died in front of the dwelling, with only one camel remaining, and it was emaciated, withered, as if its soul were being drawn out. The slave said to me, "You are a guest and have a right, so intercede for me with my master, for he honors his guest and will not refuse your intercession in this matter. Perhaps he will release the chain from me." When they brought the food, I refrained and said, "I will not eat unless I intercede for this slave." He said, "This slave has impoverished me and destroyed all my wealth." I said, "What did he do?" He replied, "He has a beautiful voice, and I used to live from the backs of these camels. He loaded them with heavy burdens and would sing the *huda'* to them until they traversed a three-day journey in a single night due to the beauty of his melody. When I unloaded them, they all died except this one camel. But you are my guest, and for your honor, I have given him to you." I said, "I wished to hear his voice." When we awoke in the morning, he ordered him to sing the *huda'* upon a camel fetching water from a well there. When he raised his voice, that camel became infatuated, broke its ropes, and I fell upon my face. I do not think I have ever heard a voice more beautiful than his. Thus, the effect of listening upon the heart is palpable. Whoever is not moved by listening is deficient, deviating from equilibrium, far from spirituality, and exceeds in coarseness and density of nature camels and birds—indeed, all beasts, for all of them are affected by measured melodies. It is for this reason that the birds would alight upon the head of David (peace be upon him) to listen to his voice. Whenever consideration of listening is with regard to its effect upon the heart, it is not permissible to judge it absolutely as permissible or forbidden. Rather, that differs according to circumstances, persons, and the differing modes of melodies. Its ruling is the ruling of what is in the heart. Abu Sulayman said, "Listening does not place in the heart what is not in it, but it stirs what is within it." The chanting of rhymed, measured words is customary in specific places for particular purposes, with which effects in the heart are connected. They are seven places: The first is the singing of the pilgrims. For they, at first, travel through the lands with drum, *shahin* (a type of flute?), and singing, and that is permissible because they are poems composed in description of the Kaaba, the Station [of Abraham], the *Hatim*, Zamzam, and all the sacred sites, and description of the desert and other things. The effect of that incites longing to perform the pilgrimage to the House of God Almighty and kindles its flames if longing is already present, or arouses and attracts longing if it is not present. Since the pilgrimage is an act of devotion and longing for it is praiseworthy, then inciting to it by all that incites is praiseworthy. Just as it is permissible for the preacher to compose his speech in admonition and adorn it with rhyme and incite people to pilgrimage by describing the House and the sacred sites and describing the reward for it, so it is permissible for others to do so by composing poetry. For when meter is added to rhyme, speech becomes more impactful upon the heart. If a pleasant voice and measured melodies are added to it, its impact increases. If drum, *shahin*, and rhythmic movements are added to it, the effect increases. All of that is permissible as long as flutes and strings, which are among the emblems of the wicked, do not enter into it. Yes, if the intention is to incite one who is not permitted to depart for pilgrimage—such as one who has had the obligation dropped from himself and his parents have not given him permission to depart—then his departure is forbidden, and it is forbidden to incite him to pilgrimage through listening by any speech that incites to departure, for inciting to the forbidden is forbidden. Likewise, if the route is unsafe and destruction is likely, it is not permissible to stir hearts and treat them by incitement. The second is what the warriors customarily do to urge people to *jihad*, and that is also permissible, as for the pilgrim, but it should...

Their poems and melodies differ from those of the pilgrims because inciting the call to jihad through encouragement, stirring rage and anger against the unbelievers, glorifying bravery, and belittling one's self and wealth in relation to it with encouraging verses—such as the words of al-Mutanabbi: "If you do not die honorably beneath the swords, you will die and taste humiliation without honor," and his saying: "The cowards see cowardice as prudence, but that is the deception of a vile nature," and the like—and the rhythms that encourage differ from the melodies that stir longing. This too is permissible at a time when jihad is permissible and recommended when jihad is recommended. However, it applies to those who are permitted to go out for jihad. Third: the rajaz poems used by the brave at the time of encounter, their purpose being to encourage oneself and the supporters, to stir vigor in them for fighting, and to boast of courage and valor. If expressed with elegant words and a pleasant voice, it has a stronger impact on the soul. This is permissible in every permissible combat, recommended in recommended combat, and forbidden in fighting against Muslims and the protected people, and in every forbidden combat, because inciting motives toward the forbidden is forbidden. This is transmitted from the brave Companions, may God be pleased with them, such as Ali and Khalid, may God be pleased with them, and others. Therefore, we say: one should prevent the beating of the shahin drum in the camp of the warriors, for its sound is tender and sorrowful; it loosens the knot of bravery, weakens the firmness of the soul, stirs longing for family and homeland, and induces slackness in fighting. Likewise, all sounds and melodies that soften the heart: the tender, sorrowful melodies contrast with the stirring, encouraging melodies. Whoever does this with the intention of changing hearts and weakening resolve for obligatory combat is disobedient, and whoever does it to weaken resolve for forbidden combat is thereby obedient. Fourth: the sounds of lamentation and their melodies, and their effect in provoking grief and weeping, and the persistence of sorrow and grief. There are two kinds: praiseworthy and blameworthy. As for the blameworthy, it is like grieving over what is lost, as God Almighty said: "So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you," and grieving over the dead is of this kind, for it is discontent with God's decree and regret over what cannot be recovered. Since this grief is blameworthy, provoking it through lamentation is blameworthy. Therefore, the explicit prohibition of lamentation has been transmitted—the hadith prohibiting lamentation is agreed upon, from the hadith of Umm 'Atiyyah: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, took a pledge from us in the oath of allegiance not to wail." As for the praiseworthy grief, it is a person's grief over his shortcomings in matters of his religion and his weeping over his sins. Weeping, feigning weeping, grief, and inducing grief over that are praiseworthy. Upon this was the weeping of Adam, peace be upon him. Provoking and strengthening this grief is praiseworthy because it spurs one to strive for recovery. Therefore, the lamentation of David, peace be upon him, was praiseworthy, as it was with constant grief and prolonged weeping due to sins and faults. For he, peace be upon him, would weep and weep and grieve until the biers were raised from his gatherings of lamentation, and he would do that with his words and melodies. This is praiseworthy because what leads to the praiseworthy is praiseworthy. Accordingly, it is not forbidden for a preacher with a good voice to recite on the pulpit with his melodies sorrowful poems that soften the heart, nor to weep and feign weeping to thereby lead others to weep and stir their grief. Fifth: listening at times of joy to affirm the joy and provoke it. It is permissible if that joy is permissible, such as singing on the days of Eid, at weddings, upon the arrival of an absent one, at feasts, the 'aqiqah, upon the birth of a child, at his circumcision, and when he memorizes the Noble Qur'an. All of that is permissible for the sake of displaying joy for it. The justification for its permissibility is that among melodies are those that stir happiness, joy, and delight. So, whatever joy is permissible, it is permissible to stir joy in it. Indicated by transmission is the singing of women on the rooftops with the duff and melodies upon the arrival of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him—the hadith of the women singing upon the arrival of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him: "The full moon has risen over us from the valley of al-Wada', gratitude is incumbent upon us for as long as one calls to God." Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah from the hadith of 'A'ishah, disconnected, and it does not mention the duff and melodies: "The full moon has risen over us from the valley of al-Wada', gratitude is incumbent upon us for as long as one calls to God." This is displaying joy for his arrival, peace and blessings be upon him, and it is a praiseworthy joy, so displaying it with poetry, melodies, dancing, and movements is also praiseworthy. It has been transmitted from a group of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, that they danced in joy that befell them—the hadith of a group of the Companions dancing in joy that befell them, narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'Ali, and it will come in the second chapter as will be mentioned.

Concerning the rulings on dancing, it is permissible upon the arrival of anyone whose coming is a cause for permissible joy, and for every lawful reason for happiness. Evidence for this is what is narrated in the two Sahih collections from ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she said: "I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, covering me with his cloak while I watched the Abyssinians playing in the mosque, until I was the one who grew weary." The narration of ‘A’ishah, "I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, cover me with his cloak while I watched the Abyssinians playing in the mosque," is as the author mentioned, also in the two Sahih collections. However, his statement that it is in both via the narration of ‘Uqayl from al-Zuhri is not as he mentioned; rather, it is in al-Bukhari as he mentioned, and in Muslim via the narration of ‘Amr ibn al-Harith from him. So, gauge the capacity of the young girl eager for amusement, alluding to the lengthy duration she stood. Al-Bukhari and Muslim also narrated in their Sahih collections the hadith of ‘Uqayl from al-Zuhri from ‘Urwah from ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, that Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, entered upon her while there were with her two young girls during the days of Mina, beating a drum and singing, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was covering himself with his garment. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, rebuked them, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, uncovered his face and said, "Leave them, O Abu Bakr, for these are the days of Eid." And ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, cover me with his cloak while I watched the Abyssinians playing in the mosque. ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, scolded them, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Be at ease, O sons of Arfadah.'" The narration of ‘A’ishah, "I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, cover me with his garment while I watched the Abyssinians playing in the mosque. ‘Umar scolded them, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Be at ease, O sons of Arfadah,'" is preceded by a hadith without ‘Umar scolding them, to its end. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah without his saying "Be at ease, O sons of Arfadah," but rather he said, "Leave them, O ‘Umar." Al-Nasa’i added, "For they are the sons of Arfadah." And in both from the hadith of ‘A’ishah: "Go on, O sons of Arfadah." The author mentioned it after this, meaning from the aspect of security, and from the hadith of ‘Amr ibn al-Harith from Ibn Shihab similarly, and in it: "They were singing and beating." The hadith of ‘Amr ibn al-Harith from Ibn Shihab similarly, and in it: "They were singing and beating," was narrated by Muslim, and it is in al-Bukhari via the narration of al-Awza’i from Ibn Shihab. And in the hadith of Abu Tahir from Ibn Wahb: "By God, I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, standing at the door of my chamber while the Abyssinians were playing with their spears in the mosque of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he was covering me with his garment or his cloak so that I could watch their play. Then he stood for my sake until I was the one to turn away." The hadith of Abu Tahir from Ibn Wahb: "By God, I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, standing at the door of my chamber while the Abyssinians were playing with their spears," was also narrated by Muslim. And it is narrated from ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she said: "I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." She said: "My girlfriends would come to me, and they would veil themselves from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was pleased with their coming to me to play with me." The hadith of ‘A’ishah, "I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him," is in the two Sahih collections as the author mentioned, but abbreviated to her saying, "to play with me." As for the extended narration which the author mentioned with his statement, "And in a narration," it is not from the two Sahih collections; rather, Abu Dawud narrated it with a sound chain. And in a narration: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her one day, 'What is this?' She said, 'My dolls.' He said, 'And what is this that I see in their midst?' She said, 'A horse.' He said, 'What is this upon it?' She said, 'Two wings.' He said, 'A horse with two wings?' She said, 'Have you not heard that Solomon, son of David, peace be upon him, had horses with wings?' She said, 'So the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, laughed until his molars showed.'" This hadith is understood by us as referring to the custom of children in making images from pottery and rags without perfecting its form, as evidenced by what is narrated in some narrations that the horse had two wings made of rags. And ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon me while there were with me two young girls singing the song of Bu’ath. He lay down on the bed and turned his face away. Then Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, entered and rebuked me, saying, 'Satan's flute in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him!' The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, turned to him and said, 'Leave them.' When he was inattentive, I signaled to them, and they left." The hadith of ‘A’ishah, "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon me while there were with me two young girls singing the song of Bu’ath," is in the two Sahih collections as the author mentioned. The narration he attributed to Muslim is uniquely narrated by Muslim as he mentioned, and it was a day of Eid for play.

Therein were the Ethiopians with shields and spears. Either I asked the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, or he said, "Do you wish to watch?" I said, "Yes." So he positioned me behind him, my cheek upon his cheek, and he was saying, "Carry on, O sons of Arfadah," until I grew weary. He said, "Is that enough for you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Then go." And in Sahih Muslim: I placed my head upon his shoulder and began to look at their play until I was the one who turned away. All these narrations are in the two Sahih collections, and they constitute explicit proof that singing and play are not unlawful. They also indicate various types of concessions.

The first is the play itself, and the customary practice of the Ethiopians in dancing and playing is well-known. The second is performing this in the mosque. The third is his statement, peace and upon him, "Carry on, O sons of Arfadah," which is a command to play and a seeking of it. So how can it be deemed unlawful? The fourth is his preventing Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them, from objecting and changing it, and his explanation that it was a day of Eid—meaning a time of joy, and this is among the causes of joy. The fifth is his standing for a long time observing and listening to it, in accommodation to Aisha, may God be pleased with her. In this is evidence that good character in gladdening the hearts of women and children by letting them watch play is better than the harshness of asceticism and austerity in abstaining and preventing it. The sixth is his statement, peace and blessings be upon him, initiating to Aisha, "Do you wish to watch?" This was not out of necessity to assist a family member for fear of anger or estrangement, for if a request is made first, a refusal might cause estrangement, which is to be avoided, so one potential harm is given precedence over another. But initiating the question was not necessary. The seventh is the concession regarding singing and beating the tambourine by the two young female singers, even though he likened it to the pipes of Satan. This clarifies that the unlawful pipe is other than that. The eighth is that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, allowed the sound of the two young female singers to reach his hearing while he was reclining. If stringed instruments were being played in that place, he would not have permitted sitting there, for then the sound of the strings would have reached his hearing. This indicates that the sound of women's voices is not unlawful in the same way the sound of pipes is unlawful; rather, it is only unlawful when there is fear of temptation.

These measures and texts indicate the permissibility of singing, dancing, beating the tambourine, playing with shields and spears, and watching the dancing of Ethiopians and black people during times of joy, all by analogy to the day of Eid, for it is a time of joy. In its meaning are also the day of the wedding feast, the banquet, the *'aqiqah*, the circumcision, the day of returning from a journey, and all other causes of happiness—meaning everything in which it is legally permissible to rejoice. It is also permissible to rejoice at visiting brothers, meeting them, and gathering them in one place for food or conversation; this is also an occasion for listening.

The sixth type is the listening of lovers to stir longing, incite passion, and console the soul. If it is while beholding the beloved, the aim is to intensify pleasure. If it is during separation, the aim is to incite longing. And longing, though painful, contains a kind of pleasure when coupled with the hope of union, for hope is delightful and despair is painful. The strength of the pleasure of hope corresponds to the strength of the longing and love for the hoped-for thing. In this listening is the incitement of passion, the stirring of longing, and the attainment of the anticipated pleasure of hope in union, along with elaboration in describing the beauty of the beloved. This is lawful if the one longed for is someone whose union is permissible, such as one who is passionate about his wife or his bondwoman, so he listens to her singing to multiply his pleasure in meeting her. Thus, the eye attains the sight, the ear the hearing, and the heart comprehends the subtleties of the meanings of union and separation, so the causes of pleasure follow one another. These are types of enjoyment from among the lawful pleasures and comforts of this world, and the life of this world is but diversion and play, and this is part of it. Likewise, if his bondwoman is angry with him or he is prevented from her for some reason, he may stir his longing through listening and use it to arouse the pleasure of hoping for union. But if he sells her or divorces her, that becomes unlawful for him afterward, for it is not permissible to stir longing where its realization through union and meeting is not permissible.

As for one who conjures in his soul the image of a youth or a woman he is not permitted to look upon, and applies what he hears to what he has conjured in his soul, this is unlawful, because it stirs thought toward forbidden actions and incites the impulse toward what one is not permitted to attain. Most passionate lovers and foolish youths, in the time of surging desire, do not refrain from harboring something of that, and it is prohibited for them due to the hidden malady therein, not due to something pertaining to the listening itself. Therefore, a sage was asked about passionate love and said, "It is a smoke that rises to a person's brain; intercourse removes it and listening incites it."

The seventh type is the listening of one who loves God, is passionate for Him, and longs to meet Him. He does not look upon anything except that he sees Him, glorified is He, in it, and no sound strikes his hearing except that he hears it from Him or concerning Him. Listening, in his case, incites his longing, intensifies his passion and love, fans the embers of his heart, and extracts...

From it arise states of unveilings and intimate subtleties which description cannot encompass. They are known to one who has tasted them, and denied by one whose senses are deprived of that taste. These states are termed, in the language of the Sufis, *wajd* (ecstasy), derived from *wujud* (finding/being) and *musadifah* (encountering), meaning he encountered within himself states he did not encounter before the audition. Then these states become causes for subsequent and attendant effects, burning the heart with their fires and purifying it from impurities, just as fire purifies the jewels placed upon it from dross. Then, following the purity attained thereby, come visions and unveilings, which are the ultimate aim of those who love God Almighty and the final fruit of all acts of nearness. That which leads to them is from the category of acts of nearness, not from the category of sins or permissible matters.

The occurrence of these states in the heart through audition has as its cause God Almighty's secret in the correspondence of measured melodies to the spirits, and the subjugation of the spirits to them, and their being affected by them with longing, joy, sorrow, expansion, and contraction. Knowledge of the cause for the spirits being affected by sounds is from the subtleties of the sciences of unveilings. The dull, rigid, hard-hearted one, deprived of the pleasure of audition, is astonished at the listener's delight, ecstasy, agitation of state, and change of color, like the astonishment of a beast at the pleasure of sweetmeats, the astonishment of the impotent at the pleasure of intimacy, the astonishment of a child at the pleasure of leadership and the expansion of means of status, and the astonishment of the ignorant at the pleasure of knowing God Almighty and knowing His majesty, greatness, and the wonders of His craftsmanship. All of this has a single cause, which is that pleasure is a kind of perception, and perception requires an object of perception and requires a perceiving faculty. Thus, one whose faculty of perception is not complete cannot conceive of experiencing pleasure. How can one perceive the pleasure of flavors who has lost taste? How can one perceive the pleasure of melodies who has lost hearing? And the pleasure of intelligibles who has lost intellect? Likewise, the tasting of audition with the heart, after the sound reaches the hearing, is perceived by an inner sense within the heart. One who lacks it is inevitably devoid of its pleasure.

Perhaps you will say: How can passionate love (*'ishq*) be conceived in relation to God Almighty, such that audition stirs it? Know that whoever knows God inevitably loves Him. And whose knowledge is intensified, his love is intensified to the degree his knowledge is intensified. When love is intensified, it is called *'ishq* (passionate love). Thus, *'ishq* means nothing but intense, excessive love. For this reason, the Arabs said, "Muhammad has passionately loved his Lord," when they saw him secluding himself for worship in the cave of Hira'.

Know that all beauty is beloved to the perceiver of that beauty, and God Almighty is Beautiful and loves beauty. However, if beauty lies in the proportion of creation and purity of color, it is perceived by the sense of sight. If beauty lies in majesty, greatness, loftiness of rank, beauty of attributes and character, and the will to bestow goodness upon all creation and pour it forth upon them perpetually, and other such inner attributes, it is perceived by the sense of the heart. The term "beauty" may also be borrowed for these, so it is said, "So-and-so is good (*hasan*) and beautiful (*jamil*)," not intending his form, but rather meaning he is beautiful in character, praiseworthy in attributes, good in conduct. Indeed, a man may be loved for these inner qualities due to admiration for them, just as the outward form is loved. This love may intensify and be called *'ishq*. How many are extreme in their love for the masters of schools of thought, like al-Shafi'i, Malik, and Abu Hanifah (may God be pleased with them), to the point of expending their wealth and souls in supporting and befriending them, exceeding every passionate lover in extremism and exaggeration.

It is strange that one can conceive passionate love for a person whose form one has never seen—whether he is beautiful or ugly—and who is now dead, but it is due to the beauty of his inner form, his pleasing conduct, the goodness resulting from his work for the people of religion, and other such qualities. Yet one cannot conceive passionate love for Him from whom you see all goodness? Nay, in truth, there is no good, no beauty, and no beloved in the world except that it is a bounty from His bounties, an effect from the traces of His generosity, and a drop from the ocean of His munificence. Rather, every beauty and loveliness in the world, perceived by intellects, sights, hearings, and all senses, from the beginning of the world to its end, and from the zenith of the Pleiades to the depths of the earth, is but an atom from the treasuries of His power and a gleam from the lights of His presence. How I wish I knew: How can love for One so described not be conceived? And how can His love not intensify among those who know His attributes, to the point of surpassing a limit where applying the name *'ishq* to Him would be an injustice to His right, due to its inadequacy in expressing the excess of love for Him?

Glory be to Him who is veiled from manifestation by the intensity of His manifestation, and concealed from sights by the radiance of His light! Were it not for His veiling by seventy veils of His light, the splendors of His Countenance would burn the sights of the observers due to the beauty of His presence. And were it not that His manifestation is the cause of His hiddenness, intellects would be bewildered, hearts astonished, powers incapacitated, and limbs scattered. And were hearts made of stone and iron, they would become, under the beginnings of the lights of His majestic manifestation, pulverized dust. How can the eyes of bats endure the very essence of the sun's light? More will come.

The verification of this indication is in the Book of Love, and it becomes clear that love for other than God, exalted be He, is deficiency and ignorance. Indeed, the one established in true knowledge knows nothing other than God, exalted be He, for there is nothing in existence truly realized except God and His acts. And whoever knows the acts merely as acts does not transcend knowledge of the Actor to anything else. Thus, whoever knows al-Shafi'i, for example—may God have mercy on him—and his knowledge and his authored works *inasmuch as they are his authored works*, and not inasmuch as they are whiteness, skin, ink, paper, composed speech, and Arabic language, has indeed known him and has not transcended knowledge of al-Shafi'i to another, nor has his love for him transcended to another. Therefore, every existent other than God, exalted be He, is God's authored work and His act and the marvel of His acts. So whoever knows them as the craft of God, exalted be He, and sees in the craft the attributes of the Craftsman—just as one sees from the excellence of a composition the merit and majestic rank of its author—his knowledge and his love are confined to God, exalted be He, not transcending to any other. And the definition of this passionate love is that it does not accept partnership, and everything besides this passionate love does accept partnership, for every beloved besides Him can be conceived to have a counterpart, either in existence or in possibility. As for this Beauty, no second can be conceived for It, neither in possibility nor in existence. Therefore, applying the name 'passionate love' to love for other than Him is purely metaphorical, not real. Indeed, the deficient one, close in his deficiency to a beast, may perceive from the term 'passionate love' nothing but the desire for union, which is an expression for the contact of bodily surfaces and the fulfillment of the urge for copulation. Such an ass ought not to have the terms 'passionate love', 'longing', 'union', and 'intimate familiarity' used with him. Rather, these expressions and meanings should be kept from him, just as the beast is kept from narcissus and basil and is specialized for straw, hay, and willow leaves. For expressions are only permissible to apply in relation to God, exalted be He, if they do not imply a meaning from which God must be sanctified. And implications differ according to differences in understanding. So one must be alert to this subtlety regarding such expressions. Indeed, it is not far-fetched that merely from hearing the attributes of God, exalted be He, an overwhelming ecstasy may arise that thereby severs the heart's tendons. Abu Hurayra—may God be pleased with him—narrated from the Messenger of God—peace and blessings of God be upon him—that he mentioned a youth who was among the Children of Israel on a mountain. He said to his mother, "Who created the sky?" She said, "God, the Mighty, the Majestic." He said, "Who created the earth?" She said, "God, the Mighty, the Majestic." He said, "Who created the mountains?" She said, "God, the Mighty, the Majestic." He said, "Who created the clouds?" She said, "God, the Mighty, the Majestic." He said, "Verily, I hear of God a great matter!" Then he threw himself from the mountain and was torn apart. The narration of Abu Hurayra: "A youth was among the Children of Israel on a mountain. He said to his mother, 'Who created the sky?' She said, 'God...' the hadith, and in it: 'Then he threw himself from the mountain and was torn apart.'" Ibn Hibban narrated it. This is as if he heard what indicated the majesty of God, exalted be He, and the perfection of His power, so he rejoiced in that and was overcome by ecstasy, and threw himself because of the ecstasy. And the Books were only sent down that they might rejoice in the remembrance of God, exalted be He. Some of them said, "I saw written in the Gospel: 'We sang for you, but you did not rejoice; we played the flute for you, but you did not dance.'" That is: We stirred longing in you by the remembrance of God, exalted be He, but you did not yearn. This is what we intended to mention regarding the categories of audition, its incentives, and its requisites. And it has become decisively clear that it is permissible in some instances and recommended in others. If you say: "Is there a state in which it is forbidden?" I say: It is forbidden due to five intervening factors: a factor pertaining to the one heard, a factor pertaining to the instrument of hearing, a factor pertaining to the arrangement of sound, a factor pertaining to the listener himself or his persistence, and a factor pertaining to the person being from the common folk. For the pillars of audition are: the one heard, the listener, and the instrument of hearing. The first intervening factor is that the one heard be a woman whom it is not permissible to look at and from whose being heard temptation is feared—and in the same meaning, the beardless youth whose temptation is feared. This is forbidden due to the fear of temptation, and that is not because of the singing itself. Rather, if the woman were such that one would be tempted by her voice in ordinary conversation without melodies, it would not be permissible to converse and speak with her, nor to hear her voice even in Quranic recitation. Likewise, the youth whose temptation is feared. If you say: "Do you say that is forbidden in all cases to close the door, or is it not forbidden except where temptation is feared for one who fears tribulation?" I say: This is a jurisprudentially ambiguous issue, pulled between two principles. One is that seclusion with a non-mahram woman and looking at her face is forbidden, whether temptation is feared or not, because it is generally a likely cause of temptation, so the Law ruled to close the door without regard to specific circumstances. The second is that looking at youths is permissible except when fearing temptation, so youths are not equated with women in the general closing of the door; rather, the situation is followed in their case. The voice of a woman revolves between these two principles. If we analogize it to looking at her, closing the door becomes obligatory, and that is a close analogy, but there is a difference between them, since...

Desire initially urges one to gaze, not to listen to sound, and the movement of the gaze due to the desire for contact is not like the movement induced by listening; rather, it is stronger. A woman's voice, apart from singing, is not considered 'awrah (something to be concealed). Women in the time of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, would converse with men for greetings, seeking legal opinions, asking questions, consultation, and other matters. However, singing has an added effect in stirring desire. Thus, analogizing this to gazing at beardless youths is more appropriate, for they were not commanded to veil themselves, just as women were not commanded to cover their voices. Therefore, prohibition should follow the source of temptation and be restricted to it. This is the most sound analogy in my view, and it is supported by the hadith of the two singing servant girls in the house of 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, for it is known that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, heard their voices and did not guard against it, but temptation was not feared for him. Hence, he did not guard against it. Therefore, this varies according to the conditions of the woman and the man, whether he is young or old. It is not far-fetched that the ruling in such matters differs according to circumstances. For we say that an old man may kiss his wife while fasting, but a young man may not, because kissing leads to intercourse during fasting, which is prohibited, and listening leads to gazing and intimacy, which is forbidden. This also varies among individuals.

The second incidental factor pertains to the instrument, if it is from the emblems of the dissolute or the effeminate, such as flutes, stringed instruments, and the kubah drum. These three types are forbidden. What remains other than these retains its original permissibility, such as the tambourine—even with its jingles—the drum, the shahin, striking with a stick, and all other instruments.

The third incidental factor pertains to the composition of the sound, which is poetry. If it contains obscenity, indecency, satire, falsehood against God Almighty, His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, or the Companions, may God be pleased with them—as the Rafidah have arranged in satirizing the Companions and others—then listening to it, whether set to melodies or not, is forbidden, and the listener is a partner to the speaker. Likewise, what describes a specific woman is not permissible, for it is not allowed to describe a woman among men. As for satirizing disbelievers and innovators, that is permissible. Indeed, Hassan ibn Thabit, may God be pleased with him, would defend the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and satirize the disbelievers, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded him to do so. The hadith of his command to Hassan ibn Thabit to satirize the polytheists is agreed upon, from the narration of Al-Bara' that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Hassan: "Satirize them, and Gabriel is with you."

As for love poetry (al-nasib), which involves similes describing cheeks, temples, beauty of form and stature, and other descriptions of women, this requires consideration. The correct view is that composing and reciting it, whether with melody or without, is not forbidden. However, the listener must not apply it to a specific woman. If he does apply it, let him apply it to one who is lawful for him, such as his wife or his slave woman. If he applies it to a stranger, he is sinful due to the application and the direction of thought toward it. From this category is its description, so one should avoid listening to it altogether. For whoever is dominated by passionate love applies everything he hears to it, whether the wording is suitable or not, since there is no wording that cannot be applied to meanings through metaphor. One whose heart is dominated by love for God Almighty may, for example, recall the darkness of disbelief from the mention of dark temples, the light of faith from the freshness of the cheek, the meeting with God Almighty from the mention of union, the veil from God Almighty among the rejected from the mention of separation, and the obstacles and afflictions of this world that disturb the constancy of intimacy with God Almighty from the mention of the watchful disturber of the spirit of union. He does not need deduction, reflection, or time to apply this; rather, the meanings dominating the heart precede to his understanding along with the wording.

It is narrated that a certain shaykh passed through the market and heard someone saying, "Cucumbers are ten for a grain." Ecstasy overwhelmed him. When asked about it, he said, "If cucumbers are ten for a grain, then what is the value of the wicked?" Another passed through the market and heard a seller calling, "O thyme, for a penny!" Ecstasy overwhelmed him. When asked about the cause of his ecstasy, he said, "I heard it as if he were saying, 'Hasten, you will see the Creator.'" Even a non-Arab may be overwhelmed by ecstasy from Arabic verses, for some of their letters correspond to non-Arabic letters, so he understands other meanings from them. Someone recited, "None visited me at night but his phantom," and a non-Arab man was overcome with ecstasy. When asked about the cause of his ecstasy, he said, "He is saying, 'None visited us' (ma zari-na)." For indeed, the word "zar" in his language indicates being on the brink of destruction, so he imagined it meant, "We are all on the brink of destruction," and he then felt the peril of the destruction of the Hereafter. One burning with love for God Almighty experiences ecstasy according to his understanding, and his understanding is according to his imagination. It is not a condition for his imagination to conform to the poet's intent or language. This ecstasy is true and sincere. And whoever feels the peril of destruction...

The Hereafter is so deserving that his intellect becomes disturbed and his limbs agitated. Therefore, altering the specific words themselves holds little benefit. Rather, the one dominated by love for a created being must guard against listening, regardless of the wording. As for the one dominated by love for God, exalted is He, words do not harm him nor prevent him from understanding the subtle meanings related to the currents of his noble aspiration.

The fourth condition in the listener is that desire is dominant over him, he is in the heedlessness of youth, and this trait is more prevalent in him than others. Listening is forbidden for him, whether love for a specific person dominates his heart or not. For however it may be, whenever he hears descriptions of the temple, cheek, separation, or union, it stirs his desire and he applies it to a specific image. Satan then blows into his heart through it, igniting the fire of lust within him and intensifying the motives of evil. That is aiding the party of Satan and incapacitating the restraining intellect, which is the party of God, exalted is He. The battle in the heart is constant between the soldiers of Satan, which are the desires, and the party of God, which is the light of intellect, except in a heart that one of the two armies has opened and completely seized. Most hearts nowadays have been opened by Satan's army and overpowered, thus they then require the causes of battle to be renewed to dislodge them. So how can it be permissible to multiply their weapons and sharpen their swords and spears? Listening sharpens the weapons of Satan's army for such a person. Therefore, such a one should leave the gathering of listening, for he is harmed by it.

The fifth condition is that the person is from the common folk and love for God, exalted is He, does not dominate him. Thus, listening is beloved to him, even if a desire overcomes him, making it prohibited in his regard. However, it is permitted for him like all other types of permissible pleasures, except that if he makes it his constant habit and preoccupation, dedicating most of his time to it, then this is the fool whose testimony is rejected. For persistence in amusement is a transgression. Just as a minor sin through persistence and continuity becomes a major one, so too do some permissible matters through continuity become minor sins. It is like persistently following Negroes and Abyssinians and constantly watching their games, for it is prohibited even though its origin is not prohibited, since the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did it. Of this category is playing chess, for it is permissible, but persistence in it is strongly disliked. Whenever the purpose is play and taking pleasure in amusement, that is only permitted for what it contains of refreshing the heart, for the heart's relaxation is a treatment for it at some times so that its motives may surge and it may occupy itself at other times with earnestness—in worldly matters like earning and trade, or in religious matters like prayer and recitation. Appreciating that amidst the folds of earnestness is like appreciating a beauty spot on a cheek; if beauty spots covered the entire face, it would disfigure it, and how ugly that would be! Thus beauty returns to ugliness due to excess. Not every beautiful thing is beautified by its abundance, nor is every permissible thing permitted in abundance. Even bread is permissible, yet excessive consumption of it is forbidden. This permissible matter is like all other permissible matters.

If you say: "The course of this discussion has led to it being permissible in some circumstances and not others, so why did you initially make a general statement of permissibility? For a general statement regarding something detailed, without a 'no' or 'yes,' is contradictory and erroneous." Know that this is a mistake, for a general statement is only impermissible due to a detail arising from something other than the subject under consideration. As for what arises from external, incidental conditions connected to it, it does not prevent the general statement. Do you not see that if we are asked about honey, whether it is lawful or not, we say it is lawful in general, even though it is forbidden for the feverish person who is harmed by it? And if we are asked about wine, we say it is forbidden, even though it becomes lawful for one choking on a morsel to drink it if he finds nothing else. However, it is forbidden insofar as it is wine, and it is only permitted due to the incidental factor of need. Honey is lawful insofar as it is honey, and it is only forbidden due to the incidental factor of harm. What is due to an incidental factor is not taken into account. For sale is lawful, yet it becomes forbidden due to the incidental factor of occurring at the time of the call to prayer on Friday and similar incidental factors. Listening is among the permissible matters insofar as it is listening to a pleasant, measured, comprehensible sound. Its prohibition is only due to an external factor incidental to its essential reality. So when the veil is lifted from the evidence for its permissibility, we do not concern ourselves with whoever opposes after the evidence has become clear.

As for Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, the prohibition of singing is not from his school at all. Al-Shafi'i explicitly stated, regarding the man who takes it as a profession, that his testimony is not acceptable, because it is from the disliked amusement that resembles falsehood. Whoever takes it as a craft is ascribed to folly and the loss of manly virtue, even if it is not explicitly declared forbidden. However, if he does not ascribe himself to singing, is not sought for it, and does not come for its sake, but is merely known to sometimes feel joy in the moment and thus chant with it, this does not cause him to lose his manly virtue nor invalidate his testimony. He argued with a hadith...

The two slave-girls who were singing in the house of ʿĀʾishah, may God be pleased with her. And Yūnus ibn ʿAbd al-Aʿlā said: I asked al-Shāfiʿī, may God have mercy on him, about the permissibility of listening to music as held by the people of Madinah. Al-Shāfiʿī said: I do not know of any scholar from the Ḥijāz who disapproved of listening to music, except for that which involves descriptions (of women, etc.). As for chanting (ḥidāʾ), the mention of ruins and dwelling places, and beautifying the voice with the melodies of poetry, it is permissible. Where he said that it is a disapproved diversion (lahw) resembling falsehood, his statement that it is a diversion is correct. However, a diversion, insofar as it is a diversion, is not forbidden. The play of the Abyssinians and their dancing is a diversion, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to watch it and did not disapprove of it. Rather, diversion and idle talk are not things for which God the Exalted holds one accountable—if what is meant by it is doing something that has no benefit. For if a person obligated himself to place his hand on his head a hundred times a day, this is frivolity with no benefit, and it is not forbidden. God the Exalted said: "God will not take you to task for idle talk in your oaths." If mentioning the name of God the Exalted over something, as in the manner of an oath, without binding intention or resolve—and breaking it—though it has no benefit, is not held accountable, then how could one be held accountable for poetry and dancing? As for his statement "resembling falsehood," this does not indicate a belief in its prohibition. Even if he had said it is plainly falsehood, it would not indicate prohibition; it only indicates that it is devoid of benefit. For falsehood is that which has no benefit. Like a man saying to his wife, for example, "I have sold myself to you," and her saying, "I have bought," is a false contract if the intent is play and amusement, and it is not forbidden unless the intent is actual transfer of ownership, which the law prohibits. As for his statement "disapproved" (makrūh), it applies to some of the situations I mentioned to you, or it applies to a recommendation of avoidance (tanzīh). For he explicitly stated the permissibility of playing chess and mentioned why he disapproves of playing it, and his explanation indicates this. He said: "That is not the habit of people of religion and integrity." This indicates a recommendation of avoidance. His rejection of testimony due to constant engagement in it does not indicate its prohibition either. Indeed, testimony may be rejected for eating in the market and for what violates integrity. Even weaving is permissible, though it is not among the crafts of people of integrity, and the testimony of one professionally engaged in a base craft may be rejected. So his explanation indicates that by "disapproval" he meant a recommendation of avoidance. This is also the likely interpretation for other great Imams. If they intended prohibition, then what we have mentioned is an argument against them.

An exposition of the arguments of those who prohibit listening to music and the response to them: They argued with His saying, the Exalted: "And among the people is he who buys idle talk..." Ibn Masʿūd, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, and al-Nakhaʿī, may God be pleased with them, said that "idle talk" is singing. ʿĀʾishah, may God be pleased with her, reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "God the Exalted has forbidden the female singer (qaynah), her sale, her price, and her teaching." The ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: "God has forbidden the qaynah, her sale, her price, and her teaching," was transmitted by al-Ṭabarānī in al-Awsaṭ with a weak chain. Al-Bayhaqī said it is not preserved. We say: As for the qaynah, what is meant is the female slave who sings for men in drinking gatherings. We have mentioned that the singing of a non-related woman for corrupt people and those who fear temptation is forbidden, and they only intend by "temptation" what is prohibited. As for a slave-girl singing for her owner, the prohibition of this is not understood from this ḥadīth. Rather, for someone other than her owner to listen to her in the absence of temptation is evidenced by what is reported in the two Ṣaḥīḥ collections regarding the singing of the two slave-girls in the house of ʿĀʾishah, may God be pleased with her. As for buying idle talk with religion, exchanging it to lead astray from the path of God, that is forbidden and blameworthy, and there is no dispute about it. Not all singing is an exchange for religion, bought with it, and leading astray from the path of God the Exalted, which is what is intended in the verse. If one were to recite the Qurʾān to lead others astray from the path of God, it would be forbidden. It is narrated that some hypocrite used to lead people in prayer and would only recite Sūrat ʿAbasa because of the reproach in it concerning the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. ʿUmar intended to kill him and considered his action forbidden due to its leading astray. Leading astray with poetry and singing is more deserving of prohibition.

They argued with His saying, the Exalted: "Do you then wonder at this discourse, and laugh and do not weep, while you amuse yourselves?" Ibn ʿAbbās, may God be pleased with them both, said it is singing, in the language of Ḥimyar, meaning samd (amusement). We say: Then laughing and not weeping should also be forbidden, because the verse includes that. If it is said that this is specific to laughing at the Muslims for their Islam, then this is also specific to their poetry and singing in the context of mocking the Muslims, as God the Exalted said: "And the poets—the deviators follow them." He meant the poets of the disbelievers, and that does not indicate the prohibition of composing poetry in itself.

They argued with what Jābir, may God be pleased with him, reported: that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Iblīs was the first to wail and the first to sing." The ḥadīth of Jābir: "Iblīs was the first to wail and the first to sing"—I found no basis for it from the narration of Jābir, and it is mentioned...

The narrator of Al-Firdaus cites a hadith from Ali ibn Abi Talib, which his son did not include in his Musnad, for it combines lamentation and singing. We said: Indeed, just as the lamentation of David, peace be upon him, and the lamentation of sinners over their faults were exempted, so too is singing exempted when its purpose is to stir joy, grief, or longing in contexts where such stirring is permissible. Indeed, just as the singing of the two young maidens on the day of Eid in the house of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was exempted, and their singing upon his arrival, peace and blessings be upon him, with their words, "The full moon has risen upon us from the valley of farewell," was exempted. They argued with what Abu Umamah reported from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "No one raises his voice in song but that God sends two devils upon his shoulders, striking his chest with their heels until he stops." The narration of Abu Umamah: "No one raises his voice in song but that God sends two devils upon his shoulders, striking his chest with their heels until he stops," was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Dhamm al-Malahi" and by al-Tabarani in "Al-Kabir," and it is weak. We said: This applies to some types of singing we previously mentioned, which stir in the heart what Satan desires—lust and infatuation with created beings. As for what stirs longing for God, joy on Eid, the birth of a child, or the arrival of an absent one, all this opposes Satan's intent, as evidenced by the story of the two maidens and the Abyssinians, and the sound reports we transmitted. Permissibility in one instance is a clear text for allowance, while prohibition in a thousand instances is open to interpretation and contextual application. As for action, there is no interpretation for it, for what is forbidden in action is only made lawful under compulsion, and what is permitted in action can become forbidden due to many circumstances, even intentions and purposes. They argued with what 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain except for training his horse, shooting his bow, and playing with his wife." The narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir: "Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain except for training his horse, shooting his bow, and playing with his wife," was reported by the compilers of the four Sunan, and there is inconsistency in it. We said: His saying "vain" does not indicate prohibition but rather lack of benefit, and this may be conceded. Moreover, amusement by watching the Abyssinians falls outside these three and is not forbidden; rather, it is analogous to the unrestricted inferred from the restricted, like his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "It is not lawful to shed the blood of a Muslim except for one of three reasons." The hadith: "It is not lawful to shed the blood of a person except for one of three reasons," is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, to which a fourth and fifth may be added. Similarly, playing with one's wife has no benefit except pleasure, and in this is evidence that strolling in gardens, listening to birdsong, and various amusements with which a man entertains himself are not forbidden to him, even if they may be described as vain. They argued with the saying of 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him: "I have not sung, nor have I wished, nor have I touched my penis with my right hand since I pledged allegiance with it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." We said: Let wishing and touching the penis with the right hand be forbidden if this is evidence for the prohibition of singing, but from where is it established that 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him, only abstained from what is forbidden? They argued with the saying of Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him: "Singing grows hypocrisy in the heart," and some added: "as water grows plants." The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Singing grows hypocrisy in the heart as water grows plants." The author said: The marfu' (elevated) narration is not sound, for in its chain is an unnamed narrator. Abu Dawud reported it, and in the narration of Ibn al-'Abd it is not in the narration of al-Lu'lui. Al-Bayhaqi reported it as marfu' and as mawquf (stopped), and some elevated it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, but it is not sound. They said: A group of pilgrims passed by Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, and among them was a man singing, so he said: "Behold, may God not hear you! Behold, may God not hear you!" And from Nafi' that he said: I was with Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, on a road when he heard the flute of a shepherd, so he put his two fingers in his ears, then turned away from the road, and kept saying: "O Nafi', do you hear that?" until I said no, then he took out his fingers and said: "Thus I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, do." The hadith of Nafi': I was with Ibn 'Umar on a road when he heard the flute of a shepherd, so he put his two fingers in his ears—the hadith—and Abu Dawud elevated it and said: This is a rejected hadith. And al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad, may God have mercy on him, said: "Singing is the spell of fornication." And some said: "Singing is a herald of depravity." And Yazid ibn al-Walid said: "Beware of singing, for it diminishes modesty, increases desire, and destroys chivalry; indeed, it substitutes for wine and does what drunkenness does. If you must do it, then keep it away from women, for singing invites fornication." We say: The saying of Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, "It grows hypocrisy," intended it in the context of the singer, for he is in...

Its proper nature cultivates hypocrisy, for its entire aim is to present oneself to others and promote one's voice over them. One continually acts hypocritically and ingratiates oneself with people so that they may desire one's singing. This also does not necessitate prohibition, for wearing fine garments, riding adorned horses, all types of adornment, and boasting of tillage, livestock, crops, and the like cultivate hypocrisy and ostentation in the heart, yet the ruling of prohibition is not applied to all of that. The cause for hypocrisy appearing in the heart is not only sins, but permissible matters which are the focus of people's gaze have greater effect. For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, dismounted from an adorned horse beneath him and cut its tail because he sensed within himself pride due to the excellence of his mount. This hypocrisy is from permissible matters.

As for the statement of Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, "Indeed, let me not hear God for you," it does not indicate prohibition from the perspective that it is singing. Rather, they were in a state of ritual consecration (ihram), and frivolity was not fitting for them. It became apparent to him from their indications that their listening was not due to spiritual ecstasy and longing to visit the House of God Almighty, but merely for amusement, so he censured them for that, as it was reprehensible relative to their state and the state of consecration. Narrations of circumstances are abundant with aspects of probability.

As for him placing his two fingers in his ears, it is countered by the fact that he did not command Nafi' to do that, nor did he censure him for his listening. He only did that himself because he deemed it proper to purify his hearing in that moment, and his heart, from a sound that might stir amusement and distract him from a thought he was engaged in or a remembrance more worthy for him. Similarly, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did so, although he did not prevent Ibn 'Umar. This also does not indicate prohibition, but rather indicates that abstaining is preferable. We hold that abstaining is preferable in most circumstances. Indeed, most permissible matters of the world, abstaining is preferable if one knows it affects the heart. For the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, removed the garment of Abu Jahm after completing the prayer because it had markings that preoccupied his heart. The hadith of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, removing the garment of Abu Jahm after completing the prayer because it had markings that preoccupied his heart preceded in the prayer. Do you think that indicates the prohibition of markings on garments? Perhaps he, peace and blessings be upon him, was in a state where the sound of the shepherd's flute would have preoccupied him from that state, just as the marking preoccupied him from the prayer.

Rather, the need to stir noble spiritual states within the heart through the stratagem of listening is a shortcoming relative to one who is perpetually witnessing the Truth, even if it is a perfection relative to others. For this reason, al-Husri said, "What shall I do with a listening that ceases when the one from whom I listen dies?" alluding that listening from God Almighty is the perpetual one. The prophets, peace be upon them, are perpetually in the delight of listening and witnessing, so they have no need for stimulation by stratagem.

As for the statement of al-Fudayl, "It is the incantation of fornication," and other similar sayings close to it, they pertain to the listening of the dissolute and lustful youths. If it were general, the two young female singers in the house of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would not have been listened to.

As for analogical reasoning, the utmost mentioned therein is to analogize it to stringed instruments, and the distinction has already preceded. Or it is said it is amusement and play, and it is so, but the entire world is amusement and play. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said to his wife, "You are but a plaything in the corner of the house." All playful interaction with women is amusement, except for intercourse which is the cause of the child's existence. Similarly, jesting without obscenity is lawful, as narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and from the Companions, as its details will come, God willing, in the Book of the Afflictions of the Tongue. The hadith of his jesting, peace and blessings be upon him, will come in the Afflictions of the Tongue, as the author said. And what amusement exceeds the amusement of the Abyssinians and blacks in their play, when its permissibility is established by textual evidence?

However, I say: Amusement refreshes the heart and lightens it from the burdens of thought, for hearts, when compelled, become blind, and refreshing them is an aid to them for seriousness. For example, one who constantly engages in jurisprudence should take a break on Friday, for a day's break incites vigor on other days. One who constantly performs supererogatory prayers at all times should take a break at some times. For this reason, prayer was disliked at some times. Thus, the break is an aid to work, and amusement is an aid to seriousness. None can endure pure seriousness and bitter truth except the souls of the prophets, peace be upon them. Therefore, amusement is a medicine for the heart from the ailment of fatigue and boredom, so it should be permissible. But one should not indulge in it excessively, just as one does not take medicine excessively. If amusement is with this intention, it becomes an act of devotion.

This is regarding one whose listening does not stir within his heart a praiseworthy quality he seeks to stir; rather, he has only pure pleasure and rest. Therefore, it should be recommended for him so that he may thereby attain...

The intended meaning we have mentioned—indeed, this indicates a shortfall from the peak of perfection. For the perfect one is he who has no need to refresh his soul with anything other than the Truth. Yet, the good deeds of the righteous are the misdeeds of those brought near. And whoever encompasses the knowledge of treating hearts and the ways of gentleness in guiding them to the Truth knows with certainty that refreshing them with such matters is a beneficial remedy, indispensable.

**The Second Chapter: The Effects and Etiquettes of Listening**

Know that the first degree of listening is understanding what is heard and applying it to a meaning that occurs to the listener. Then understanding yields spiritual state, and spiritual state yields movement of the limbs. So reflect on these three stations.

**The First Station: Understanding**

It varies according to the conditions of the listener. The listener has four conditions:

The first is listening by mere natural disposition—that is, with no consideration in the listening except delighting in melodies and tunes. This is permissible, and it is the lowest rank of listening, for the camel is his partner in it, as are all beasts. Indeed, this taste requires nothing but life, for every animal has a kind of delight in pleasant sounds.

The second condition is that he listens with understanding, but applies it to the form of a created being, whether specific or unspecified. This is the listening of youth and people of base desires. Their application of what is heard is according to their desires and the demands of their states. This condition is too base for us to speak of, except to clarify its baseness and prohibit it.

The third condition is that he applies what he hears to the states of his own soul in his dealings with God Almighty and the fluctuation of his conditions between capability at times and incapability at others. This is the listening of the seekers, especially the beginners. For the seeker inevitably has an object of desire that is his aim, and his aim is knowing God, glorified is He, meeting Him, and reaching Him through the path of witnessing with the innermost secret and the lifting of the veil. He has, in his aim, a path he treads, transactions he perseveres in, and states that meet him in his transactions. So when he hears mention of reproach, address, acceptance, rejection, union, abandonment, nearness, distance, lamentation over what is lost, thirst for what is awaited, longing for what arrives, hope, despair, estrangement, intimacy, fulfillment of promise, breaking of covenant, fear of separation, joy of union, mention of the Beloved's observation and the repelling of the watcher, the flowing of tears, the succession of regrets, the length of separation, the promise of union, or other such matters that poetry encompasses in description—it must correspond to some of the seeker's states in his quest. Then it flows like the spark that strikes the flint of his heart, so its fires blaze, and it strengthens the rising and agitation of longing. Because of it, states contrary to his habit assail him, and he has ample scope for applying the words to his conditions. The listener is not required to observe the poet's intent in his speech; rather, every speech has aspects, and everyone with understanding has shares in deriving meaning from it.

Let us give examples for these applications and understandings, lest the ignorant think that the listener to verses mentioning the mouth, cheek, and temple only understands their outward meanings. We have no need to mention how meanings are understood from verses, for in the accounts of the people of listening there is what reveals that. It has been narrated that one of them heard a singer saying: "The Messenger said, 'Tomorrow you will visit.' So I said, 'Do you understand what you say?'" The melody and the saying stirred him, and he entered a spiritual state. He began repeating it, replacing the 't' with an 'n,' saying: "The Messenger said, 'Tomorrow we will visit,'" until he fell unconscious from the intensity of joy, delight, and happiness. When he recovered, he was asked about the cause of his state. He said, "I remembered the saying of the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Indeed, the people of Paradise visit their Lord every Friday once.'" (A hadith: "Indeed, the people of Paradise visit their Lord every Friday," reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. In its chain is 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Habib ibn Abi al-'Ishrin, who is disputed. Al-Tirmidhi said, "We do not know it except from this direction." He said, "And Suwayd ibn 'Amr reported from al-Awza'i something of this.")

And al-Raqqi narrated from Ibn al-Durays that he said: "Ibn al-Futi and I were passing by the Tigris between Basra and Ubulla, and there was a beautiful palace with a balcony, and upon it a man before whom a slave-girl was singing, saying: 'Every day you change, other than this, you are more beautiful.' And there was a handsome youth beneath the balcony, with a water-skin in his hand and wearing a patched garment, listening. He said, 'O slave-girl, by God and the life of your master, repeat this verse for me.' So she repeated it. And the youth said, 'This, by God, is my changing with the Truth in my state!' Then he gasped a gasp and died." He said, "So we said, 'We have encountered an obligation.' So we stopped. The owner of the palace said to the slave-girl, 'You are free for the sake of God Almighty.'" He said, "Then the people of Basra came out, and this palace was for public use." He said, "Then he threw off his clothes, wrapped himself in a waist-wrapper, draped another garment, and went on his way while people looked at him until he disappeared from their sight while they wept. And no news was heard of him afterward."

The intended meaning is that this person was utterly absorbed in the moment.

In his state with God Almighty, and his awareness of his inability to remain steadfast in good conduct within the transaction, and his regret over the fluctuation of his heart and its inclination away from the path of truth—when his ear was struck by what corresponded to his state, he heard it from God Almighty as though He were addressing him, saying to him each day: "You change, unlike this; I am better." And whoever hears from God Almighty, and upon God and within Him, ought to have firmly established the law of knowledge in knowing God Almighty and His attributes; otherwise, there may occur to him from the hearing regarding God Almighty what is impossible for Him and constitutes disbelief. Thus, in the hearing of the novice seeker there is danger, unless he does not apply what he hears except to his own state, in a manner that does not pertain to the description of God Almighty. An example of the error in this is precisely this verse. If he heard it within himself while addressing his Lord, Mighty and Glorious, and thus attributed changeability to God Almighty, he would disbelieve. This can occur from sheer, absolute ignorance unmixed with realization, or it may stem from an ignorance led to it by a kind of realization—that he sees the fluctuation of his heart's states, indeed the fluctuation of the states of the entire world, as being from God, which is true. For at times He expands his heart and at times constricts it; at times illuminates it and at times darkens it; at times hardens it and at times softens it; at times establishes him in obedience and strengthens him in it, and at times empowers Satan over him to divert him from the path of truth. All of this is from God Almighty. And from whom various states issue in close succession, it is commonly said that he is prone to moods and is changeable. Perhaps the poet intended nothing but attributing changeability to his beloved in acceptance and rejection, drawing near and distancing—this is the meaning. Hearing this likewise regarding God Almighty is pure disbelief. Rather, one should know that He, Glorified and Exalted, causes change but does not change; He alters but is not altered, unlike His servants. That knowledge is attained by the seeker through a traditional, faith-based conviction, and it is attained by the insightful knower through a true, unveiling certainty. That is among the wonders of the attributes of Lordship—He is the Changer without change, and this cannot be conceived except in relation to God Almighty. Indeed, every changer other than Him does not change unless he himself changes. Among the masters of spiritual states are those overwhelmed by a state like bewildering intoxication, so their tongues are loosened in reproach with God Almighty, and they object to His overpowering of hearts and His apportioning of noble states with disparity. For He is the One who selects the hearts of the truthful and distances the hearts of the deniers and the deluded. There is no preventer of what He gives and no giver of what He withholds. He did not cut off success from the disbelievers due to a prior transgression, nor did He extend the Prophets, peace be upon them, with His success and the light of His guidance due to a prior means. Rather, He said: "And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers," and He, Mighty and Glorious, said: "But the word from Me will come true: 'I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind all together.'" And He, Exalted, said: "Indeed, those for whom the best from Us has preceded will be far removed from it." If it occurs to your mind: "Why did the precedence differ while they are partners in the bond of servitude?" you are called from the pavilions of Majesty: "Do not exceed the bounds of propriety, for He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned." By my life, disciplining the tongue and outward appearance is within the capacity of most people. But disciplining the inner secret from harboring astonishment at this apparent disparity in drawing near and distancing, causing misery and happiness, while bliss and wretchedness remain for all eternity—none can withstand that except the scholars firmly rooted in knowledge. For this reason, Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, said when asked about hearing in dreams: "It is the pure, clear water upon which only the feet of scholars stand firm, for it stirs the secrets and hidden places of hearts and disturbs them like the disturbance of bewildering intoxication, which nearly loosens the knot of propriety from the secret, except for those whom God Almighty has protected with the light of His guidance and His subtle preservation." Therefore, some said: "Would that we were delivered from this hearing head for head." For in this category of hearing there is a danger greater than the danger of hearing that stirs desire, for the utmost of that is sin, and the utmost of error here is disbelief. Know that understanding may differ according to the states of the listener, so spiritual ecstasy may overcome two listeners of a single verse—one is correct in understanding and the other is mistaken, or both are correct, having understood two different, opposing meanings, but relative to the difference in their states, it is not contradictory. As narrated regarding 'Utbah the youth: he heard a man say, "Glory be to the Compeller of the heavens! Indeed, the lover is in hardship," and he said, "You have spoken truthfully." Another man heard it and said, "You have lied." Some of the insightful said: "Both were correct, and it is the truth." For affirmation is the speech of a lover who is not granted access to the Beloved, but is rather repelled, wearied by rejection and abandonment; and denial is the speech of one intimate with love, delighting in what he endures due to the intensity of his love, unaffected by it, or the speech of a lover not currently repelled from his desire nor sensing the danger of rejection in the outcome, due to the dominance of hope and good expectation over his heart.

Through the variance of these states, understanding differs. It is narrated that Abu al-Qasim ibn Marwan—who had accompanied Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz, may God have mercy on him, and had forsaken attending musical audition for many years—once attended a gathering where a person was reciting the verse: "A thirsty one standing in water, yet not given to drink." The people rose and were overcome by ecstasy. When they settled, he asked them about the meaning that had stirred within them from the verse. They pointed to a thirst for noble spiritual states and deprivation from them despite the presence of their means. This did not satisfy him, so they said, "What then is your understanding?" He replied, "That one may be amidst spiritual states and honored with divine gifts, yet not be granted an atom of them." This alludes to affirming a Reality beyond states and spiritual gifts; states are their precursors, and gifts appear at their beginnings, but the Reality has not yet been attained. There is no difference between the meaning he understood and what they mentioned except in the disparity of the rank of the one thirsting for it. For he who is deprived of noble states first thirsts for them; if granted them, he thirsts for what lies beyond. Thus, there is no difference in understanding between the two meanings, but rather a difference between the two ranks.

Al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, would often be moved to ecstasy by this verse: "Your affection is abandonment, your love is aversion, your union is severance, your peace is war." This verse can be heard in various ways, some true and some false. The most apparent is to understand this in relation to creation, indeed in the entire world, indeed in everything other than God Almighty. For the world is deceitful, treacherous, slaying its masters, hostile to them inwardly while displaying a guise of affection. No house is filled with its adornment but is filled with sorrow. As the hadith states: "No house is filled with adornment but is filled with sorrow," reported by Ibn al-Mubarak from 'Ikrimah ibn 'Ammar from Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, as transmitted in the report. And as al-Tha'labi said in describing the world: "Turn away from the world, do not seek its hand, nor let a slayer seek your hand in marriage. Its hope does not fulfill its fear and its harm. Have you not considered? Indeed, the describers have spoken of it abundantly, and I have for it a description, by my life, apt: its final draught is poison, and a mount delightful when tamed, yet it is unruly; a beautiful form whose beauty people admire, but it holds secrets of evil, vile." 

The second meaning is to apply it to oneself in relation to God Almighty. For when one reflects, his knowledge is ignorance, since "they did not esteem God as He deserves," and his obedience is hypocrisy, since he does not fear God as He deserves, and his love is tainted, since he does not abandon a desire of his desires for His love. And whom God wishes good for, He shows him the faults of his soul, so he sees the truth of this verse in himself, even if it is relative to the heedless. Thus, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I cannot enumerate praise of You; You are as You have praised Yourself," a hadith reported by Muslim, as previously mentioned. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, I seek forgiveness from God seventy times a day and night," a hadith previously mentioned in the second chapter of Remembrances. His seeking forgiveness was for states that are degrees of nearness relative to what is beyond them, even if they are nearness relative to what precedes them. For there is no nearness but that beyond it remains a nearness without end, since the path of journeying to God Almighty is endless, and attaining the furthest degrees of nearness is impossible.

The third meaning is to look at the beginnings of his states and be pleased with them, then look at their outcomes and disdain them due to his awareness of the hidden delusions within them, and to see that from God Almighty. Thus, he hears the verse in relation to God Almighty as a complaint against divine decree and predestination—and this is disbelief, as previously explained. There is no verse but that it can be applied to meanings according to the abundance of the listener's knowledge and the purity of his heart.

The fourth state is the audition of one who has transcended states and stations, so that everything other than God Almighty is absent from his understanding, even absent from himself, his states, and his transactions. He is like one stunned, submerged in the ocean of the eye of witnessing, his state resembling that of the women who cut their hands upon beholding the beauty of Joseph, peace be upon him, until they were stunned and lost sensation. Of such a state the Sufis express that he has passed away from himself, and whenever one passes away from himself, he is more so passed away from others. It is as if he has passed away from everything except the One Witnessed, and has also passed away from witnessing itself. For the heart, if it turns to witnessing and to itself as the witness, has become heedless of the Witnessed. The one enraptured by the seen has no attention in his state of immersion to his seeing, nor to the eye with which he sees, nor to the heart with which he delights. The intoxicated has no awareness of his intoxication, and the one delighting has no awareness of his delight; his awareness is only of the One in whom he delights. Its analogy is knowledge of a thing, for it is distinct from knowledge in reality.

The created being, and they also occur in relation to the Creator, but they are mostly like a fleeting flash of lightning that does not remain or endure. And if it does endure, human strength cannot bear it, such that one may be convulsed under its burdens with a convulsion that destroys his very self. As is related concerning Abu al-Hasan al-Nuri: he attended a gathering and heard this verse: "I have not ceased to descend from the abode of Your affection a descent at which intellects are bewildered." He arose, was overcome by spiritual emotion, and wandered distraught until he fell into a thicket of reeds that had been cut, their remaining bases like swords. He began to run back and forth within it, repeating the verse until morning, with blood flowing from his legs until his feet and shins swelled. He lived a few days after that and died, may God have mercy on him. This is the station of the truthful ones in understanding and spiritual emotion (wajd). It is the highest of stations, for audition (sama') according to [varying] states is lower than the stations of perfection, being intermixed with human attributes—a kind of deficiency. Perfection is rather to be utterly annihilated from one's self and one's states—meaning he forgets them so that no attention to them remains for him, just as the women had no attention for their hands and knives. Thus he hears for God, by God, in God, and from God. This is the rank of one who has plunged into the ocean of realities, crossed the shore of states and deeds, become united with the purity of Divine Oneness, and realized pure sincerity, so that nothing of him remains therein at all. Rather, his humanity is entirely extinguished, and his attention to human attributes is utterly annihilated. I do not mean by his annihilation the annihilation of his body, but the annihilation of his heart. And I do not mean by the heart the flesh and blood, but a subtle secret which has a hidden relation to the outward heart, behind which is the secret of the spirit, which is from the command of God, Glorified and Exalted is He. Those who know it, know it; those who are ignorant of it, are ignorant. That secret has an existence and a form, and that existence is what is present within it. When something else is present within it, it is as if no existence exists except for that which is present. Its similitude is a polished mirror, for it has no color in itself; rather, its color is the color of what is present within it. Similarly, a glass vessel: it reflects the color of its contents, and its color is the color of what is present within it. It has no form in itself; rather, its form is the receptivity to forms, and its color is the disposition to receive colors. The poet expressed this reality—meaning the secret of the heart in relation to what is present within it—saying: "The glass became refined and the wine became delicate, so they resembled one another, and the matter became alike, as if there were wine and no cup, and as if there were a cup and no wine." This is one of the stations of the sciences of unveiling. From it arose the fancy of those who claimed incarnation and union, saying "I am the Truth," and around which revolves the discourse of the Christians in their claim of the union of divinity with humanity, or its assumption of it, or its indwelling within it, according to the differences in their expressions. This is pure error, resembling the error of one who judges the mirror to have the form of redness when the color of redness appears in it from what is opposite it. Since this is not fitting for the science of spiritual transaction, let us return to the purpose. We have mentioned the disparity of stations in understanding what is heard. The second station after understanding and interpretation is spiritual emotion (wajd). The people—meaning the Sufis and the sages who contemplate the aspect of the suitability of audition for the spirits—have lengthy discourse concerning the reality of wajd. Let us transmit some expressions from their statements, then uncover the reality therein. As for the Sufis, Dhu al-Nun al-Misri, may God have mercy on him, said concerning audition: "It is a true divine influx that comes to agitate the hearts toward the Truth. So whoever gives ear to it with truth attains realization, and whoever gives ear to it with his [lower] self falls into heresy." Thus he expressed wajd as the agitation of hearts toward the Truth, which is what one finds upon the arrival of the influx of audition, for he called audition "a true influx." And Abu al-Husayn al-Darraj, reporting what he found in audition, said: "Wajd is an expression for what is found during audition." And he said: "Audition made me roam in the fields of splendor, so it caused me to find the existence of the Truth at the moment of bestowal. It gave me to drink from the cup of purity, so I attained thereby the abodes of contentment, and it brought me out to the gardens of transcendence and expanse." And al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, said: "Audition is outwardly a trial and inwardly a lesson. So whoever knows the allusion, listening to the expression is lawful for him; otherwise, he has summoned trial and exposed himself to affliction." And some said: "Audition is nourishment for the spirits of the people of gnosis, because it is a description that is subtler than all other works and is apprehended by the refinement of nature due to its refinement, and by the purity of the secret due to its purity and subtlety among its people." And 'Amr ibn 'Uthman al-Makki said: "No expression can alight upon the modality of wajd, for it is God's secret among His believing, certain servants." And some said: "Wajd is unveilings from the Truth." And Abu Sa'id ibn al-A'rabi said: "Wajd is the lifting of the veil, the witnessing of the Watchful, the presence of understanding, the observation of the Unseen, the converse of the secret, and the familiarity with the Lost. It is your annihilation from where you are." He also said: "Wajd is the first of the degrees of special nearness, and it is the inheritance of belief in the Unseen. When they tasted it and the light of it shone in their hearts, every doubt and uncertainty vanished from them." He also said: "That which veils from wajd is seeing the traces of the self and attachment to connections and causes, for the self is veiled by its causes."

When the means are severed, remembrance becomes pure, the heart awakens, softens, and clarifies, the admonition succeeds within it, and it settles in a place of intimacy during intimate communion, it is addressed and hears the address with a listening ear, a witnessing heart, and an unveiled secret essence. Then it witnesses what it had been empty of—that is the spiritual state of finding, for it has found what was absent to it. It has also been said: The spiritual state is what occurs upon hearing a stirring reminder, or a distressing fear, or a reproach for a slip, or a gentle conversation, or an allusion to a benefit, or a longing for an absent one, or sorrow for a loss, or regret for the past, or an invitation to a state, or a summons to an obligation, or an intimate communion with a secret. It is the correspondence of the outward with the outward, the inward with the inward, the unseen with the unseen, and the secret with the secret. It is the extraction of what is due from you by the Sovereign for what preceded in striving for it, so it is recorded for you after originating from you. Thus, a station is established for you without a station, and a remembrance without remembrance, since He is the Initiator of blessings and the Guardian, and to Him all matters return. This is the apparent knowledge of the spiritual state.

The sayings of the Sufis on this subject regarding the spiritual state are many. As for the philosophers, some said concerning the heart: It is a noble virtue which the faculty of speech could not express in words, so the soul expressed it through melodies. When it appeared, it moved and delighted in it, so listen from the soul and commune with it, and leave communing with outward forms. Another said: The outcomes of listening are rousing the incapable from opinion, attracting the distant from thoughts, and sharpening the dull from understandings and views, until what was distant returns, what was incapable rises, what was turbid clarifies, and it moves joyfully in every opinion and intention, so it hits the mark and does not err, it comes and does not delay. Another said: Just as thought conveys knowledge to the known, so listening conveys the heart to the spiritual world. Another, when asked about the cause of the limbs moving naturally to the measure of melodies and rhythms, said: That is intellectual love, and the intellectual lover does not need to converse with his beloved with corporeal speech; rather, he converses and communes with a smile, a glance, a subtle movement of the eyebrow and eyelid, and a gesture. These are all utterances, but they are spiritual. As for the bestial lover, he uses corporeal speech to express the fruit of his weak outward longing and his false love. Another said: Whoever is sorrowful, let him listen to melodies, for when sorrow enters the soul, its light is dimmed, and when it rejoices, its light is ignited and its joy appears. Longing manifests according to the capacity of the receiver, and that is according to its purity and clarity from adulteration, filth, and established doctrines.

The established sayings on listening and the spiritual state are many, and there is no point in multiplying their citation. Let us occupy ourselves with explaining the meaning which the spiritual state expresses. We say it is an expression for a state produced by listening—a true, new influx immediately following listening, which the listener finds within himself. That state is not devoid of two categories: either it reverts to unveilings and witnessings that are of the kind of knowledge and alerts, or it reverts to changes and states that are not from knowledge, but rather like longing, fear, sorrow, agitation, joy, regret, remorse, expansion, and contraction. These states are stirred and strengthened by listening. If it is so weak that it does not affect moving or stilling the outward aspect, or changing its state to move contrary to its habit, or to become still from looking, speaking, and moving contrary to its habit, it is not called a spiritual state. If it appears outwardly, it is called a spiritual state, either weak or strong according to its manifestation and its changing of the outward aspect and moving it, according to the strength of its influx, and the preservation of the outward aspect from change according to the strength of the experiencer and his ability to control his limbs. For the spiritual state may be strong inwardly while the outward does not change due to the strength of its possessor, or it may not appear due to the weakness of the influx and its insufficiency to move and loosen the knot of cohesion.

To the meaning of the first, Abu Sa'id ibn al-A'rabi alluded when he said of the spiritual state: It is witnessing the Watchful, the presence of understanding, and observing the unseen. It is not far-fetched that listening be a cause for unveiling what was not unveiled before it, for unveiling occurs through causes, among them alerting—and listening is an alert—and among them the changing of states and witnessing and perceiving them, for perceiving them is a kind of knowledge that clarifies matters not known before the influx. Among them is the clarity of the heart, and listening affects the purification of the heart, and purity causes unveiling. Among them is the arousal of the heart's vigor by the power of listening, so it is strengthened by it to witness what its strength fell short of before, just as a camel is strengthened to carry what it could not carry before. The work of the heart is investigation and observing the secrets of the dominion, just as the work of the camel is carrying heavy loads. Through these means, it becomes a cause for unveiling. Indeed, when the heart becomes clear, perhaps the Truth is represented to it in the form of a vision, or in an arranged word that strikes its hearing, expressed as the voice of the caller if in wakefulness, and as a dream if in sleep. That is part of forty-six.

A portion of prophethood, and the knowledge of verifying this lies beyond the knowledge of practical conduct. This is as narrated from Muhammad ibn Masruq al-Baghdadi, who said: "I went out one night during the days of my ignorance, while I was intoxicated, and I was singing this verse to the tune of Mount Sinai: 'So gracious is what I passed by, that I marveled at one who drinks water.' Then I heard a voice saying: 'And in Hell there is water; no creature swallows it but it leaves intestines within his belly.' That," he said, "became the cause of my repentance and my devotion to knowledge and worship." Observe, then, how the song affected the purification of his heart, until the reality of the Truth was manifested to him in the description of Hell, in comprehensible, measured words, and that struck his outward hearing.

And it is narrated from Muslim al-'Abadani that he said: "Salih al-Murri, 'Utbah al-Ghulam, 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zayd, and Muslim al-Aswari came to us and stayed on the shore." He said: "So I prepared food for them one night and invited them to it. They came, and when I placed the food before them, suddenly a voice rose, reciting this verse: 'And distractions from the Abode of Permanence are foods, and the pleasure of a soul whose folly is of no benefit.' Then 'Utbah al-Ghulam cried out a cry and fell down unconscious, and the people wept. So I removed the food, and by God, they did not taste a single morsel of it."

And just as the voice of the caller is heard when the heart is purified, so too is the form of al-Khidr, peace be upon him, beheld with the sight, for he appears to the possessors of hearts in various forms. And in such a state, the angels appear to the prophets, peace be upon them, either in the reality of their form or in a likeness that approximates their form somewhat. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saw Gabriel, peace be upon him, twice in his true form and reported of him that he filled the horizon—a hadith: "He saw Gabriel, peace be upon him, twice in his form," and he reported that he filled the horizon, agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah. This is what is intended by His saying, exalted is He: "Taught to him by one of intense power, endowed with strength. He rose, while he was on the highest horizon," to the end of these verses.

And in such states of purity, insight into the secrets of hearts occurs, and that insight is sometimes expressed as 'firāsah' (discernment). For this reason, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Beware the discernment of the believer, for he sees by the light of God"—a hadith: "Beware the discernment of the believer, for he sees by the light of God, exalted is He," transmitted by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id, who said it is a rare hadith. And it is recounted that a man from the Magians would go around among the Muslims saying: "What is the meaning of the Prophet's saying, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Beware the discernment of the believer'?" They would explain its interpretation to him, but he was not satisfied until he came to one of the Sufi shaykhs and asked him. He said to him: "Its meaning is that you should cut the girdle that is around your waist beneath your garment." He said: "You have spoken the truth; this is its meaning," and he embraced Islam, saying: "Now I know that you are a believer and that your faith is true."

And as narrated from Ibrahim al-Khawwas, who said: "I was in Baghdad in a gathering of the poor in the mosque, when a youth of pleasant fragrance and handsome face approached. I said to my companions: 'It occurs to me that he is a Jew.' All of them disliked that. I left, and the youth left, then returned to them and said: 'What did the shaykh say?' They were too shy, but he insisted, so they said: 'He said you are a Jew.' He came to me, fell upon my hand, kissed my head, embraced Islam, and said: 'We find in our books that the discernment of the truthful one does not err. So I said: I will test the Muslims. I observed them and said: If there is a truthful one among them, it is in this group, for they mention His hadith and recite His speech. So I disguised myself among you. When he observed the shaykh and discerned, I knew he was truthful.'" He said: "And the youth became one of the great Sufis."

And to such unveiling is the allusion in his saying, peace be upon him: "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze upon the kingdom of the heavens"—a hadith: "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze upon the kingdom of the heavens," mentioned previously regarding fasting. The devils only hover around hearts when they are filled with blameworthy attributes, for they are the pasture of Satan and his troops. And whoever purifies his heart from those attributes and cleanses it, Satan does not circle around his heart. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Except Your chosen servants among them," and His saying: "Indeed, over My servants you have no authority."

And listening is a cause for the purification of the heart; it is a net for the Truth by means of purity. This is indicated by what is narrated that Dhu al-Nun al-Misri, may God have mercy on him, entered Baghdad, and a group of Sufis gathered to him, and with them was a singer. They sought his permission for him to sing something, so he permitted them. He began to say: "Small was your love, yet it tormented me; how then when it becomes intense? And you have gathered in my heart a love that was once shared. Do you not pity one who is sorrowful, when the intimate laughs, he weeps?" Dhu al-Nun stood up and fell upon his face. Then another man stood and said: "Dhu al-Nun, the One who sees you when you stand..." So that man sat down, and that was an insight from Dhu al-Nun into his heart that he was forcing himself and feigning ecstasy, so he made him know that the one who sees him when he stands is the adversary in his standing.

For other than God Most High, even if a man were truthful, he would not have sat. When the spiritual state of ecstasy (wajd) returns, it yields unveilings and conditions. Know that each of these divides into what can be expressed upon recovery from it, and into what cannot be expressed at all. Perhaps you might deem improbable a condition or knowledge whose reality you do not know and which cannot be expressed in its essence. Do not deem it improbable, for you will find in your own proximate states evidence for it.

As for knowledge: how many a jurist is presented with two questions similar in form, yet the jurist perceives through his inner taste (dhawq) that there is a difference in their legal ruling. When tasked with stating the aspect of difference, his tongue fails to assist him in expression, even if he is among the most eloquent of people. He perceives the difference through his taste but cannot express it. This perception of the difference is a knowledge he encounters in his heart through taste, and he does not doubt that its occurrence in his heart has a cause and that it has a reality with God Most High, yet he cannot inform of it—not due to a deficiency in his tongue, but due to the subtlety of the meaning within his soul, which expression cannot attain. This is something those who persistently contemplate difficult matters become aware of.

As for the condition (hāl): how many a person perceives in his heart at the time he awakens a state of constriction (qabḍ) or expansion (basṭ), without knowing its cause. A person may reflect upon something, which then leaves an effect upon his soul. He forgets that cause, yet the effect remains in his soul, and he feels it. The condition he feels may be a joy established in his soul through reflecting on a cause that induces joy, or a sorrow; then he forgets the object of reflection and feels the effect afterward. That condition may be a strange state which the words 'joy' and 'sorrow' do not convey, and for which no matching expression is found that clearly articulates the intent. Rather, the taste for measured poetry and the distinction between it and non-measured verse is specific to some people and not others. It is a condition the possessor of taste perceives in such a way that he has no doubt about it—I mean the distinction between the measured and the irregular—yet he cannot express it in a way that clarifies his intent to one who has no taste. Within the soul are strange states of this description.

Indeed, the well-known meanings such as fear, sorrow, and joy are only attained in listening to comprehensible song. As for string instruments and other melodies that are not comprehensible, they affect the soul in a wondrous way, and it is impossible to express the marvels of those effects. One might express it as longing (shawq), but a longing whose possessor does not know the object longed for—this is wondrous. He whose heart is agitated by hearing string instruments, or the shahin (a type of bird call) and the like, does not know for what he longs. He finds within himself a condition as if it demands something, but he does not know what it is. This even occurs among the common folk and those whose hearts are not dominated by love for a human or love for God Most High.

This has a secret: every longing has two pillars. One is the attribute of the one who longs, which is a type of affinity with the object longed for. The second is knowledge of the object longed for and knowledge of the form of attaining it. If the attribute which causes the longing is found, and knowledge of the form of the object longed for is found, the matter is clear. But if knowledge of the object longed for is not found, yet the longing attribute is found and stirs your heart, and its fire is ignited, this inevitably gives rise to bewilderment and perplexity.

If a human were raised alone such that he never saw the form of women nor knew the form of intercourse, then reached puberty and lust overpowered him, he would feel within himself the fire of lust, but he would not know that he longs for intercourse, because he does not know the form of intercourse nor the form of women. Similarly, within the human soul there is an affinity with the Supreme World and the delights promised at the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary and the lofty Gardens, except that he has not imagined from these matters except the attributes and names—like one who has heard the word 'intercourse' and the name 'women' but has never witnessed the form of a woman, nor the form of a man, nor his own form in a mirror to know by analogy. Thus, hearing stirs within him longing, while extreme ignorance and preoccupation with the world have made him forget himself, forget his Lord, and forget his abode to which he naturally yearns and longs. So his heart demands something he does not know what it is, and he becomes bewildered, perplexed, and agitated, like one suffocating who does not know the way of escape.

This and its like are among the conditions whose complete realities are not perceived, and the one characterized by them cannot express them. Thus, the division of ecstatic spiritual state (wajd) into what can be manifested and what cannot be manifested has become clear.

Know also that ecstatic spiritual state (wajd) divides into that which assaults (hājim) and that which is contrived (mutakallaf), which is called 'seeking ecstasy' (tawājud). This contrived seeking of ecstasy is of two kinds: one is blameworthy, which is that intended for ostentation and displaying noble states while being bankrupt of them. The other is praiseworthy, which is the means to summon, acquire, and attract noble states through stratagem, for acquisition has an entry in attracting noble states. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded whoever...

When weeping is present during the recitation of the Quran, one should induce weeping and cultivate sorrow. The discussion on weeping during Quranic recitation has preceded in the second chapter concerning the recitation of the Quran. For these states may initially be contrived, then their latter stages become genuine. How could contrivance not be a cause for the contriver to ultimately possess it as a natural disposition? Everyone who learns the Quran, or does not memorize it, does so through effort and recites it through effort, with complete reflection and presence of mind. Then this becomes a constant habit for the tongue, flowing consistently until his tongue recites it in prayer and other times while he is heedless, completing the entire chapter, and his soul returns to him after he finishes its end, knowing he recited it in a state of heedlessness. Similarly, a scribe writes initially with great exertion, then his hand becomes practiced in writing, so writing becomes natural for him, and he writes many pages while his heart is absorbed in another thought. Thus, all attributes that the soul and limbs can bear have no path to acquisition except through initial contrivance and affectation, then through habit it becomes natural. This is the meaning of the saying of some: "Habit is a second nature." Likewise, with noble spiritual states, one should not fall into despair upon losing them; rather, one should strive to attract them through listening and other means. Indeed, it has been observed in mundane matters that one who desired to love a person, yet did not love them, persisted in recalling them, constantly looking at them, and affirming to themselves the beloved qualities and praiseworthy morals in them until they loved them, and it became firmly rooted in their heart beyond the realm of choice. Then they desired deliverance from it but could not escape. Similarly, the love of God Almighty, yearning to meet Him, fear of His displeasure, and other such noble states—if a person loses them, they should strive to attract them by keeping company with those described by them, observing their conditions, beautifying their attributes within themselves, sitting with them in spiritual listening sessions, and through supplication and entreaty to God Almighty to grant them that state by facilitating its causes. Among its causes are listening, keeping company with the righteous, the fearful, the virtuous, the yearning, and the humble. For whoever keeps company with a person, their qualities flow to him without his awareness. Evidence for the possibility of attaining love and other states through means is the saying of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in his supplication: "O God, grant me Your love, and the love of those who love You, and the love of that which brings me nearer to Your love." The hadith "O God, grant me Your love and the love of those who love You" has preceded in the chapter on supplications. Thus, he, peace be upon him, resorted to supplication in seeking love. This clarifies the division of spiritual experience into unveilings and states, and its division into what can be expressed and what cannot, and its division into the contrived and the innate. If you say: Why is it that these people do not manifest spiritual experience upon hearing the Quran, which is the speech of God, yet manifest it upon hearing singing, which is the speech of poets? If that were truly from the subtle grace of God and not false from the deception of Satan, then the Quran would be more deserving of it than singing. We say: True spiritual experience is that which arises from intense love of God Almighty, sincerity in desiring Him, and yearning to meet Him. That is also stirred by hearing the Quran. What is not stirred by hearing the Quran is love of creation and infatuation with the created. Evidence for this is His saying, "Unquestionably, by the remembrance of God hearts are assured," and His saying, "Its verses are distinct, at which the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver, then their skins and their hearts soften at the remembrance of God." Everything that occurs in the soul following listening is spiritual experience. Thus, tranquility, shivering, awe, and softening of the heart are all spiritual experience. God Almighty has said, "The believers are only those who, when God is mentioned, their hearts tremble," and He said, "If We had sent down this Quran upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of God." Trembling and humility are spiritual experiences from the category of states, even if not from the category of unveilings, but they may become a cause for unveilings and awakenings. For this reason, he, peace be upon him, said, "Adorn the Quran with your voices." The hadith "Adorn the Quran with your voices" has preceded in the chapter on recitation. And he said to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, "You have been given a flute from the flutes of the family of David, peace be upon him." The hadith "He has been given a flute from the flutes of the family of David" was said regarding Abu Musa; it has preceded. As for the narratives indicating that the possessors of hearts manifested spiritual experience upon hearing the Quran, they are many. His saying, peace be upon him, "Surah Hud and its sisters have aged me"—the hadith "Surah Hud and its sisters have aged me" was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Juhaifah, and similarly by al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan*, and al-Hakim said it is *sahih* according to the condition of al-Bukhari. It is a report about spiritual experience, for graying occurs from grief and fear, and that is spiritual experience. It is narrated that Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, recited Surah an-Nisa to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him.

When he reached the words of God Almighty, "How will it be when We bring from every nation a witness and bring you as a witness against these?" he said, "Enough," and his eyes overflowed with tears. A narration states that Ibn Mas'ud recited to him, and when he reached the words, "How will it be when We bring from every nation a witness and bring you as a witness against these?" he said, "Enough." The hadith is agreed upon from his narration. In another version, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, recited this verse, or it was recited in his presence: "Indeed, with Us are shackles and a Blaze, and food that chokes and a painful punishment," and he fell unconscious. A narration states that it was recited in his presence: "Indeed, with Us are shackles and a Blaze, and food that chokes and a painful punishment," and he fell unconscious. It was narrated by Ibn 'Adi in Al-Kamil and Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab through his chain from Abu Harb ibn Abi Al-Aswad as mursal. In another version, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, recited, "If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants," and he wept. A narration states that he recited, "If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants," and he wept. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he passed by a verse of mercy, would supplicate and rejoice. A narration states that when he passed by a verse of mercy, he would supplicate and rejoice. It was previously mentioned in the recitation of the Quran without the words "and rejoice," and rejoicing is a state of spiritual ecstasy. God Almighty has praised those who experience spiritual ecstasy from the Quran, saying, "And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth." And it is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would pray while his chest emitted a sound like the boiling of a cauldron. A narration states that he would pray while his chest emitted a sound like the boiling of a cauldron. It was narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Shama'il from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Al-Shikhkhir, and it was previously mentioned. As for what is transmitted regarding spiritual ecstasy from the Quran among the Companions, may God be pleased with them, and the Successors, it is abundant. Among them were those who fell unconscious, those who wept, those who fainted, and those who died in their fainting. It is narrated that Zararah ibn Awfa, who was among the Successors, was leading the people in prayer in Al-Raqqah, and when he recited, "And when the Horn is blown," he fell unconscious and died in his prayer niche, may God have mercy on him. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, heard a man reciting, "Indeed, the punishment of your Lord will occur; there is no preventer of it," and he cried out a cry and fell unconscious. He was carried to his house and remained ill there for a month. Abu Jarir, among the Successors, had Salih Al-Murri recite to him, and he gasped and died. Al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, heard a reciter reciting, "That is a Day on which they will not speak, nor will it be permitted for them to make excuses," and he fainted. 'Ali ibn Al-Fudayl heard a reciter reciting, "The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds," and he fell unconscious. Al-Fudayl said, "May God reward you for what He knows of you." Likewise, it is transmitted from a group among them, and likewise the Sufis. Indeed, Al-Shibli was in his mosque one night in Ramadan, praying behind an imam, and the imam recited, "And if We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you," and Al-Shibli let out a cry such that the people thought his soul had departed. His face reddened, and his limbs trembled. He would say, "With such words are the beloved addressed," repeating it many times. Al-Junayd said, "I entered upon Al-Sari Al-Saqati and saw before him a man who had fainted. He said to me, 'This is a man who heard a verse of the Quran and fainted.' I said, 'Recite to him that very verse.' It was recited, and he regained consciousness. He said, 'From where did you say this?' I said, 'I saw that Jacob, peace be upon him, his blindness was due to a creature, so by a creature he regained sight. Had his blindness been due to the Truth, he would not have regained sight by a creature.' He approved of that." What Al-Junayd said is alluded to by the poet's words: "A cup I drank for pleasure, and another by which I was cured from it." And one of the Sufis said, "I was reciting one night this verse, 'Every soul will taste death,' and I kept repeating it. Then a caller called to me, 'How long will you repeat this verse? You have killed four of the jinn who have not raised their heads to the sky since they were created.'" Abu 'Ali Al-Maghazili said to Al-Shibli, "Sometimes a verse from the Book of God Almighty reaches my hearing and draws me to turn away from the world, then I return to my affairs and to the people, and I do not remain in that state." He said, "What reaches your hearing from the Quran and draws you to Him by it, that is an inclination from Him toward you and a gentleness from Him to you. And if He returns you to yourself, it is compassion from Him toward you, for nothing is suitable for you except disavowal of power and strength in turning to Him." A man from the people of Sufism heard a reciter reciting, "O reassured soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing," and he asked the reciter to repeat it, saying, "How often do I say to her, 'Return,' and she does not return?" He experienced spiritual ecstasy and let out a cry, and his soul departed. Bakr ibn Mu'adh heard a reciter reciting, "And warn them of the Day of the Approaching," and he became agitated, then cried out, "Have mercy on one whom You have warned and who has not turned to You in obedience after the warning," then he fainted. Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, when he heard someone reciting, "When the sky has split," his limbs would tremble until he shook. And from Muhammad ibn Subayh, he said, "A man was bathing in the Euphrates, and a man passed by on the shore reciting..."

And be distinguished today, O criminals! The man continued to struggle until he drowned and died. It is mentioned that Salman al-Farsi saw a youth reciting and came upon a verse, so his skin shuddered, and Salman loved him and missed him. He inquired about him and was told he was ill, so he went to visit him, finding him at the point of death. The youth said, "O servant of God, do you see that shuddering that was in me? It came to me in the most beautiful form and informed me that God has forgiven all my sins because of it." In summary, the possessor of a heart is not devoid of spiritual emotion upon hearing the Quran. If the Quran does not affect him at all, his likeness is that of one who calls to what hears nothing but calls and cries—deaf, dumb, and blind, so they do not understand. Rather, the possessor of a heart is affected by a word of wisdom he hears. Ja'far al-Khuldi said: A man from Khorasan entered upon al-Junayd while a group was with him. He said to al-Junayd, "When does the servant become equal in his view to one who praises him and one who blames him?" One of the elders said, "When he enters the hospital and is bound with two chains." Al-Junayd said, "This is not your concern," then turned to the man and said, "When he realizes that he is a created being." The man gasped a gasp and died. If you say, "If hearing the Quran is beneficial for spiritual emotion, why do they gather to listen to singing from singers rather than reciters? It would be fitting for their gathering and spiritual emotion to be in the circles of reciters, not the circles of singers, and it would be fitting to seek a reciter for every gathering, at every invitation, for the words, since the speech of God Almighty is undoubtedly superior to singing." Know that singing stirs spiritual emotion more intensely than the Quran for seven reasons. The first reason is that not all verses of the Quran correspond to the state of the listener nor are suitable for his understanding and application to what concerns him. For one overcome by grief, longing, or regret, how can his state correspond to God's saying, "God instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females," or His saying, "And those who accuse chaste women," and likewise all verses that clarify rulings on inheritance, divorce, legal punishments, and others? What stirs what is in the heart is what corresponds to it. Verses are composed by poets to express the states of the heart, so understanding the state from them requires no strain. Indeed, one overcome by a dominant, overwhelming state that leaves no room for anything else, and who possesses alertness and penetrating intelligence to discern distant meanings from words, may find his emotion stirred by anything heard, like one who is reminded upon hearing God's saying, "God instructs you concerning your children," of the state of death necessitating a will, and that every person must leave behind his wealth and children, the two beloved things of this world, leaving one beloved for the other and abandoning both, so fear and anguish overcome him. Or he hears the mention of God in His saying, "God instructs you concerning your children," and is awestruck by the Name alone, oblivious to what precedes and follows. Or he is reminded of God's mercy upon His servants and His compassion in personally overseeing the division of their inheritances, caring for them in life and death, so he says, "If He looks after our children after our death, we have no doubt He looks after us," and this stirs a state of hope, bringing him gladness and joy. Or he is reminded from God's saying, "for the male, what is equal to the share of two females," of the preference of the male for being a man over the female, and that excellence in the Hereafter is for men whom trade and sale do not divert from the remembrance of God, and that whoever is diverted by other than God from God is among the females, not the men, truly, so he fears being veiled or delayed in the bliss of the Hereafter as the female is delayed in worldly wealth. Such examples may stir emotion, but only for one with two qualities: one, a dominant, all-encompassing, overwhelming state; and two, profound discernment and complete, keen alertness to infer distant meanings from proximate matters. This is rare. Therefore, one resorts to singing, which consists of words suited to states, so their agitation hastens. It is narrated that Abu al-Husayn al-Nuri was with a group at an invitation, and a scholarly question arose among them while Abu al-Husayn was silent. Then he raised his head and recited to them: "O Lord, a cooing turtledove at forenoon, with a mournful note, sang on a branch, remembering a beloved and a bygone virtuous time, and wept in sorrow, stirring my sorrow. My weeping perhaps keeps her awake, and her weeping perhaps keeps me awake. I complain, but she does not understand me, and she complains, but I do not understand her, except that I know her through passion, and she also knows me through passion." Not one of the company remained but stood and was moved with spiritual emotion, and they did not attain this emotion from the knowledge they had delved into, even though knowledge is serious and true. The second reason is that the Quran is preserved by most, repeated to ears and hearts. Whenever it is heard initially, its effect on hearts is great; on the second repetition, its effect weakens; on the third, its effect nearly vanishes. If one with overwhelming emotion were tasked to maintain his emotion upon a single verse constantly...

When recitations occur in close succession in time, whether within a day or a week, one may not achieve that effect. Yet, if the verse were replaced with another, it would renew its impact on the heart, even if it expresses the same meaning. However, the novelty of the composition and wording, compared to the former, stirs the soul, despite the meaning being one and the same. A reciter cannot always recite a novel Quran, for the Quran is finite, with no possibility of addition, all of it preserved and repeated. To this, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, alluded when he saw Bedouins coming forward to listen to the Quran and weep. He said, "We were once as you are, but our hearts have hardened." Do not think that the heart of al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, was harder than the hearts of the rough Arabs, or that it was emptier of love for God Almighty and His speech than their hearts. Rather, repetition upon his heart led to familiarity and diminished sensitivity due to the comfort gained from frequent listening. For it is contrary to habit that a listener hears a verse he has not heard before and weeps, then continues weeping over it for twenty years, then repeats it and weeps, with the only difference between the first and last being its novelty and freshness. Every new thing has delight, and every sudden occurrence has a shock, while with every familiar thing there is a comfort that counteracts the shock. Hence, Umar, may God be pleased with him, considered preventing people from excessive circumambulation, saying, "I feared that people would become heedless of this House," meaning they would grow accustomed to it. For when a pilgrim first sees the House, he weeps and cries out, and may even faint upon sighting it, yet he may reside in Mecca for a month without feeling any such effect in himself. A singer, however, can produce novel verses at any time, but cannot produce a novel verse of the Quran at every moment.

The third aspect is that the rhythm of speech, with the taste of poetry, has an effect on the soul. A melodious, rhythmic sound is not like a melodious sound without rhythm. Rhythm is found in poetry, not in verses. If the singer alters the meter of the verse he chants, or modulates it, or deviates from the limits of that melodic method, the listener's heart becomes disturbed, his earnestness and listening cease, and his nature recoils due to the lack of harmony. When nature recoils, the heart becomes agitated and confused. Thus, rhythm is influential, which is why poetry is pleasing.

The fourth aspect is that rhythmic poetry affects the soul differently through melodies known as methods and modes. The variation in these methods lies in prolonging the short, shortening the long, pausing mid-word, and separating or joining some parts. Such manipulation is permissible in poetry but not in the Quran, where only recitation as revealed is allowed. Shortening, prolonging, pausing, joining, or separating it contrary to proper recitation is forbidden or disliked. When the Quran is recited as revealed, the effect caused by the rhythm of melodies—an independent cause of influence, even if not understood, as with strings, flute, falcon, and other sounds that are not comprehended—is lost.

The fifth aspect is that rhythmic melodies are supported and emphasized by other rhythmic sounds and beats external to the throat, such as striking with a rod or a tambourine, because a weak ecstasy is not aroused except by a strong cause, and it is strengthened by the combination of these factors, each contributing to the effect. It is obligatory to protect the Quran from such accompaniments, for in the view of the common people, their form is that of amusement and play, while the Quran is entirely serious in the eyes of all creation. Thus, it is not permissible to mix pure truth with what is considered amusement by the general public, nor with what appears as amusement to the elite, even if they do not regard it as such. Rather, the Quran should be revered, not recited on public streets but in a tranquil gathering, nor in a state of major impurity, nor without purification. None can fulfill the due respect of the Quran's sanctity in every state except those vigilant over their conditions, so one turns to singing, which does not require such vigilance and care. Therefore, it is not permissible to strike the tambourine with Quran recitation on the wedding night, even though the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded striking the tambourine at weddings, saying, "Make the marriage public, even with the beating of a sieve." The command to strike the tambourine at weddings has been mentioned in the chapter on marriage, or with similar meaning. This is permissible with poetry but not with the Quran. Hence, when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered the house of al-Rabīʿ bint Muʿawwidh and there were girls with her, he heard one of them saying, "Among us is a prophet who knows what is in tomorrow," in a singing manner. He said, peace and blessings be upon him, "Leave this and say what you were saying." The hadith of the Messenger entering the house of al-Rabīʿ bint Muʿawwidh, with girls singing, is reported by al-Bukhārī from her narration and has been mentioned in the chapter on marriage. This was a testimony to prophethood, yet he forbade her from it and returned her to singing, which is amusement, because this is pure seriousness and should not be coupled with the appearance of amusement. Thus, strengthening it through such means becomes impossible.

The reasons that make listening a mover of the heart necessitate, out of reverence, turning to singing instead of the Qur'an, just as that slave-girl was obliged to turn from testifying to prophethood to singing. The sixth aspect is that a singer may sing a verse that does not match the listener's state, so he dislikes it and forbids it, calling for another. Not every speech suits every state. If they gathered in supplications with a reciter, he might recite a verse that does not match their state, since the Qur'an is a healing for all people despite their differing conditions. Verses of mercy are healing for the fearful, and verses of punishment are healing for the deluded and secure. Detailing this would be lengthy. Thus, one cannot be sure that what is recited will match the state, and the soul may dislike it, thereby exposing oneself to the danger of disliking the speech of God Almighty with no way to repel it. Guarding against that danger is extreme prudence and an obligatory duty, for there is no escape from it except by applying it according to one's state, and it is not permissible to apply the speech of God Almighty except to what God Almighty intended. As for the poet's saying, it may be applied contrary to his intent, so therein lies the danger of dislike or the danger of erroneous interpretation due to the state's conformity. Therefore, it is necessary to venerate the speech of God and protect it from that. This is what sparks the reasons for the elders turning to listening to singing over listening to the Qur'an. And here is a seventh aspect mentioned by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj al-Tusi in apologizing for that. He said: The Qur'an is the speech of God and an attribute of His attributes, and it is truth that humanity cannot bear because it is uncreated, so created attributes cannot bear it. If an atom of its meaning and awe were unveiled to hearts, they would shatter, be stunned, and bewildered. Pleasant melodies are suitable to natural dispositions, and their relation is one of incidental shares, not one of inherent rights. Poetry's relation is also one of incidental shares. So when melodies and voices are attached to the allusions and subtleties in the verses, they resemble each other, becoming closer to incidental shares and lighter on hearts due to the resemblance of the created to the created. As long as humanity remains, and we, with our attributes and shares, delight in poignant melodies and pleasant voices, our expansion in witnessing the permanence of these shares through odes is more appropriate than our expansion toward the speech of God Almighty, which is His attribute and His speech, from which it began and to which it returns. This is the essence of his intended meaning and his apology. And it is narrated from Abu al-Hasan al-Darraj that he said: I intended to visit Yusuf ibn al-Husayn al-Razi from Baghdad to greet him. When I entered Rayy, I kept asking about him, and everyone I asked said, "What do you want with that heretic?" They distressed my heart until I resolved to turn back. Then I said to myself, "I have traversed all this way, so at the very least I should see him." I kept asking until I entered upon him in a mosque, sitting in the mihrab, with a man before him holding a mus'haf, reciting. He was an elder, impressive, with a handsome face and beard. I greeted him, and he turned to me and said, "From where have you come?" I said, "From Baghdad." He said, "And what brought you?" I said, "I intended to greet you." He said, "If someone in one of these towns said to you, 'Stay with us until we buy you a house or a slave-girl,' would that prevent you from coming?" I said, "God has not tested me with anything like that, and if He tested me, I would not know how I would be." Then he said to me, "Can you recite something well?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Recite." So I began to say: "I see you constantly building in my ruin, and if you were resolute, you would demolish what you build. It is as if I see you, and 'if only' is the best of your speech: 'If only we were...' when 'if only' avails not." He then closed the mus'haf and wept until his beard became wet and his garment soaked, so I pitied him for his excessive weeping. Then he said, "O my son, you blame the people of Rayy who say Yusuf is a heretic? Here I am, from the dawn prayer reciting in the mus'haf, not a drop has fallen from my eyes, yet the Resurrection has occurred for these two verses." Thus, hearts, even if burning in love for God Almighty, are stirred by the rare verse in a way that the recitation of the Qur'an does not stir them, due to the meter of poetry and its conformity to natural dispositions. Because it conforms to natural disposition, humans are capable of composing poetry. As for the Qur'an, its composition is outside the methods and patterns of speech, and it is therefore miraculous, not within human power due to its lack of conformity to their nature. And it is narrated that Israfil, the teacher of Dhu al-Nun al-Misri, entered upon a man and saw him tapping the ground with his finger while humming a verse. He said, "Can you hum something?" He said, "No." He said, "Then you are without a heart," indicating that whoever has a heart and knows its nature knows that verses and melodies move it in a way not encountered otherwise, so he strives for a means of stirring, whether with his own voice or another's. We have already mentioned the ruling of the first station regarding understanding what is heard and applying it, and the ruling of the second station regarding the ecstasy encountered in the heart. Now let us mention the effect...

Ecstasy—by which I mean that which overflows into outward expression through swooning, weeping, movement, tearing of garments, and the like—constitutes the third station of audition. Here we shall discuss the etiquette of audition, both outwardly and inwardly, what is praiseworthy among the effects of ecstasy, and what is blameworthy.

As for the etiquette, it comprises five main points. The first is consideration of time, place, and companions. Junayd said, “Audition requires three things; otherwise, do not listen: the right time, the right place, and the right companions.” This means that engaging in audition at a time when food is being served, during a dispute, during prayer, or when the heart is distracted by some preoccupation is of no benefit. This is the meaning of considering the time: one must consider the heart’s state of readiness for it. As for place, it may be a public thoroughfare, an unsightly location, or a place containing something that distracts the heart—such should be avoided. As for companions, the reason is that if someone of a different kind is present—one who disapproves of audition, outwardly ascetic but bankrupt in the subtleties of the heart—he becomes a burden in the gathering, and the heart becomes occupied with him. Likewise, if a worldly arrogant person is present, requiring one to watch and accommodate him, or an affected pretender among the Sufis who displays ecstasy, dancing, and tearing clothes for show—all these are disturbances. Therefore, abstaining from audition when these conditions are absent is preferable. In these conditions lies the listener’s consideration.

The second point of etiquette is the consideration of those present: if the shaykh has disciples around him whom audition would harm, he should not listen in their presence. If he does listen, he should occupy them with something else. The disciple who is harmed by audition is of three types. The lowest in rank is one who has attained only the outward works of the path and has no taste for audition; his engagement with audition is engagement with what does not concern him, for he is neither among those given to diversion so as to divert himself, nor among those of taste so as to delight in the taste of audition. Let him occupy himself with remembrance or service; otherwise, it is a waste of his time. The second is one who has a taste for audition but still retains remnants of worldly interests, attention to desires, and human attributes, and has not yet been broken in a way that secures him from his perils. Perhaps audition may stir in him an impulse toward diversion and desire, cutting off his path and hindering his completion. The third is one whose desire has been broken, whose peril is secured, whose insight has opened, and whose heart is dominated by love for God Almighty, but who has not mastered the outward knowledge and does not know the names and attributes of God Almighty, what is permissible and what is impossible concerning Him. If the door of audition is opened to him, what is heard concerning God Almighty may settle upon him in terms of what is permissible and what is not, so his harm from those thoughts—which are unbelief—is greater than the benefit of audition. Sahl, may God have mercy on him, said, “Any ecstasy not witnessed by the Book and the Sunnah is void.” Therefore, audition is not suitable for such a person, nor for one whose heart is still stained with love of the world and love of praise and acclaim, nor for one who listens for the sake of sensual pleasure and natural enjoyment, so that it becomes a habit for him, distracting him from his worship and attention to his heart, and cutting off his path. Audition is a slippery foothold; the weak must be guarded from it. Junayd said, “I saw Iblis in a dream and said to him, ‘Do you gain any advantage over our companions?’ He said, ‘Yes, at two times: the time of audition and the time of gazing, for I enter upon them through these.’” Some shaykhs said, “If I had seen him, I would have said, ‘How foolish you are! Whoever listens to you when he listens and gazes at you when he gazes—how can you gain advantage over him?’” Junayd said, “You have spoken truly.”

The third point of etiquette is to be attentive to what the speaker says, with a present heart, seldom turning to the sides, guarding against looking at the faces of the listeners and what appears upon them of states of ecstasy, occupied with oneself and attention to one’s heart, observing what God Almighty opens for him of mercy in his secret self, careful of any movement that disturbs the hearts of his companions. Rather, he should be outwardly still, calm in his limbs, refraining from clearing his throat and yawning, sitting with head bowed as if in deep thought, his heart absorbed, restraining himself from clapping, dancing, and all other movements done in affectation, pretense, and show, silent from speaking during the recitation except when absolutely necessary. If ecstasy overcomes him and moves him involuntarily, he is excused and not blamed. Whenever choice returns to him, let him return to his calm and stillness. He should not prolong it out of shame that it might be said his ecstasy has ceased nearness, nor should he feign ecstasy for fear of being called hard-hearted, lacking purity and tenderness. It is related that a youth accompanied Junayd, and whenever he heard something of the remembrance, he would cry out. Junayd said to him one day, “If you do that again, you will not accompany me.” Thereafter, he restrained himself until water dripped from every hair of his body, yet he did not cry out. It is related that one day he choked from the intensity of restraining himself, gasped a gasp, and his heart split, and his soul perished. And it is narrated that Moses, peace be upon him, recounted a story among the Children of Israel, and one of them tore his garment.

Or his shirt, so God Almighty revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "Say to him: 'Rend your heart for Me, and do not rend your garment.'" Abu al-Qasim al-Nasrabadhi said to Abu 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd: "I say that when people gather and there is a singer among them who says something good, it is better for them than backbiting." Abu 'Amr replied: "Hypocrisy in listening—that is, to see from yourself a state that is not truly in you—is worse than backbiting for thirty years or so. For if you say the superior one is he whom listening does not move nor affect his outward appearance, or he upon whom it shows, then know that the absence of manifestation is sometimes due to the weakness of the incoming spiritual state (wajd), which is a deficiency; and sometimes it is with a powerful inner spiritual state, yet it does not manifest due to the perfection of strength in controlling the limbs, which is a perfection; and sometimes it is because the state of spiritual finding is constant and accompanies all conditions, so no additional effect from the listening is discerned, and this is the ultimate perfection. For the one with spiritual finding, in most conditions, his finding does not last. But he who is in a perpetual state of finding, then he is the one steadfast in truth and constantly adhering to the essence of witnessing. Such a one is not altered by the vicissitudes of conditions. It is not far-fetched that the allusion in the saying of al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, 'We were as you are, then our hearts hardened,' means our hearts strengthened and became firm, so they became capable of adhering to spiritual finding in all conditions. Thus, we are in a state of listening to the meanings of the Qur'an perpetually, so the Qur'an is not new to us, occurring to us such that we are affected by it.' So then, the strength of spiritual finding moves, and the strength of intellect and self-possession controls the outward appearance. One may overcome the other, either due to the intensity of its strength or the weakness of its counterpart, and deficiency and perfection are according to that. So do not suppose that he who trembles and throws himself upon the ground has a more complete spiritual finding than the one who is still, due to his agitation. Nay, many a still one has a more complete finding than the agitated. For Junayd used to be moved during listening in his beginning, then he ceased to be moved. When asked about that, he said: 'And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they pass like the passing of the clouds—the work of God, who has perfected everything'—alluding to that the heart is agitated, roaming in the dominion, while the limbs are disciplined outwardly, remaining still." And Abu al-Hasan Muhammad ibn Ahmad—and he was in Basra—said: "I accompanied Sahl ibn 'Abdullah for sixty years, and I never saw him change at anything he heard of remembrance or the Qur'an. Then, at the end of his life, a man recited before him: 'That Day no ransom will be taken from you...' [the verse], and I saw him tremble and nearly fall. When he returned to his state, I asked him about that, and he said: 'Yes, my beloved, we have weakened.' And likewise, he once heard His saying, may He be exalted: 'Sovereignty that Day is for the Most Merciful...' and he became agitated. Ibn Salim, who was among his companions, asked him, and he said: 'I have weakened.' It was said to him: 'If this is from weakness, then what is the strength of the state?' He said: 'That no incoming spiritual state reaches him except that he meets it with the strength of his own state, so the incoming states do not alter him, even if they are strong.' And the reason for the ability to control the outward appearance while experiencing spiritual finding is the equilibrium of conditions through constant witnessing, as is narrated from Sahl, may God have mercy on him, that he said: 'My state before prayer and after it is one,' because he was vigilant over the heart, present in remembrance with God in every condition. So likewise it is before listening and after it, for his finding is perpetual, his thirst continuous, and his drinking constant, such that listening does not affect an increase in it." As is narrated that Mumshed al-Dinwari looked upon a gathering in which there was a singer, and they became still. He said: "Return to what you were doing, for if all the amusements of the world were gathered in my ear, they would not distract my concern nor quench some of what is within me." And Junayd, may God have mercy on him, said: "The deficiency of spiritual finding does not harm when there is the excellence of knowledge, and the excellence of knowledge is more complete than the excellence of spiritual finding." If you say: "Such a one did not attend listening sessions," then know that among these are those who abandoned listening in their old age and would attend only rarely, to assist a brother among the brethren and to bring joy to his heart. And perhaps he attended to make the people recognize the perfection of his strength, so they would know that perfection is not in outward spiritual finding, and thus they would learn from him the control of the outward appearance from affectation, even if they could not emulate him in making it their natural disposition. And if they happened to attend with those not of their kind, they would be with them in body but absent from them in heart and inner being, just as they sit without listening with those not of their kind due to incidental reasons that necessitate sitting with them. And some of them are reported to have abandoned listening, and it is thought that the reason for his abandonment was his sufficiency from listening by what we have mentioned. And some of them were among the ascetics and had no spiritual share in listening, nor were they of the people of diversion, so he abandoned it lest he be occupied with what does not concern him. And some of them abandoned it due to the loss of brethren. It was said to one of them: "Why do you not listen?" He said: "With whom and from whom?" The fourth etiquette is not to stand nor raise one's voice in weeping while one is capable of controlling oneself. But if he dances or feigns weeping, it is permissible if he does not intend hypocrisy by it, for feigning weeping is to summon grief, and dancing is a cause for stirring joy.

And vigor: every permissible joy may be stirred, even if that were forbidden, for ‘Ā’ishah (may God be pleased with her) watched the Abyssinians with the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) while they were dancing. The narration of ‘Ā’ishah watching the Abyssinians dance with the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) while they were dancing has preceded in the chapter before this—these are the words of ‘Ā’ishah (may God be pleased with her) in some narrations. And it has been reported from a group of the Companions (may God be pleased with them) that they hopped (in joy) when a happiness came upon them that warranted it, and that was in the story of the daughter of Ḥamzah when ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, his brother Ja‘far, and Zayd ibn Ḥārithah (may God be pleased with them) disputed over her and contended in raising her. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to ‘Alī, “You are from me and I am from you,” and ‘Alī hopped. And he said to Ja‘far, “You resemble my character and my form,” so Ja‘far hopped after ‘Alī’s hopping. And he said to Zayd, “You are our brother and our freedman,” so Zayd hopped after Ja‘far’s hopping. Then he (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “She is for Ja‘far, because her maternal aunt is with him, and the maternal aunt is like a mother.” The narration of ‘Alī, Ja‘far, and Zayd ibn Ḥārithah disputing over the daughter of Ḥamzah, and he said to ‘Alī, “You are from me and I am from you,” so he hopped; and he said to Ja‘far, “You resemble my character and my form,” so he hopped; and he said to Zayd, “You are our brother and our freedman,” so he hopped—this ḥadīth was transmitted by Abū Dāwūd from the narration of ‘Alī with a sound chain, and it is in al-Bukhārī without the hopping. And in a narration, he said to ‘Ā’ishah (may God be pleased with her), “Would you like to watch the dancing of the Abyssinians?” And dancing and hopping are forms of movement, which occur due to joy or longing, so its ruling is the ruling of its stimulus: if the joy is praiseworthy, and dancing increases and confirms it, then it is praiseworthy; if it is permissible, then it is permissible; and if it is blameworthy, then it is blameworthy. However, it is not fitting for those in positions of leadership and exemplars to habitually engage in it, because it mostly arises from amusement and play, and it has the appearance of play and amusement in the eyes of people, so one who is followed should avoid it lest they become diminished in people’s eyes and thus be abandoned as a model. As for tearing garments, there is no concession for it except when one’s condition exceeds voluntary control, and it is not far-fetched that ecstasy may overwhelm to the extent that one tears their garment without awareness due to the overpowering intoxication of ecstasy, or with awareness but being like one compelled who cannot restrain themselves, and their state resembles that of one coerced, for they find in movement or tearing a relief and are compelled to it like a patient is compelled to moaning—even if they were charged to endure it, they could not, though it is a voluntary act, for not every act that occurs by will is one that a person can abandon. Breathing is an act that occurs by will, and if a person were charged to hold their breath for an hour, they would be compelled from within to choose to breathe. Similarly, shouting and tearing garments may be like that, so this is not described as forbidden. It has been mentioned regarding ecstasy—the sudden, overwhelming ecstasy—that he said, “Yes, one may strike their face with a sword without awareness,” and he was objected to and it was deemed improbable that it would reach this extent, but he insisted and did not retract, meaning that in some circumstances it may reach this extent in some individuals. If you say, “What do you say about the Sufis tearing new garments after the ecstasy subsides and they finish the audition, for they tear them into small pieces and distribute them among the people, calling them the ‘khirqah’?” Know that this is permissible if they are cut into square pieces suitable for patching garments and rugs, for cloth is torn to be sewn into a shirt, and that is not waste because it is tearing for a purpose. Likewise, patching garments is only possible with small cuts, and that is intended, and distributing them to all so that goodness may be widespread is an intended, permissible act. Every owner may cut their cloth into a hundred pieces and give them to a hundred poor, but the pieces should be such that benefit can be derived from them for patches. We only prohibited in the audition the tearing that ruins the garment, destroying part of it so that no benefit remains from it—that is pure waste and not permissible by voluntary choice. The fifth etiquette is conforming with the group in standing if one of them stands in sincere ecstasy without ostentation or affectation, or stands by choice without displaying ecstasy, and the group stands for him—then conformity is necessary, for that is among the etiquettes of companionship. Likewise, if it is the custom of a group to remove the turban in conformity with the one in ecstasy if his turban falls, or to remove garments if his garment falls from tearing, then conformity in these matters is part of good companionship and fellowship, for opposition is alienating. Every people have a custom, and one must adapt to people with their manners—the ḥadīth “Adapt to people with their manners” was transmitted by al-Ḥākim from the narration of Abū Dharr: “Interact with people according to their manners,” he said it is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs, as mentioned in the report, especially if they are manners that involve good fellowship, courtesy, and gladdening the heart through assistance. And the statement of one who says that this is an innovation that was not among the Companions—not everything judged permissible must have been present among the Companions.

It is transmitted from the Companions, may God be pleased with them, that the only thing to be feared is committing an innovation that opposes a transmitted Sunnah. The prohibition of anything of this sort has not been transmitted, and standing upon someone's entrance was not the custom of the Arabs. Rather, the Companions, may God be pleased with them, would sometimes not stand for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, as narrated by Anas, may God be pleased with him, which was mentioned earlier in the chapter on the Etiquettes of Companionship. However, if no general prohibition is established regarding it, we see no harm in it in lands where the custom has become to honor the entrant by standing, for the intended purpose is respect, honor, and gladdening the heart. Likewise, all other types of assistance, if the intention behind them is to gladden the heart and a group has agreed upon them, there is no harm in assisting them in it. Rather, it is better to assist, except in what has come with a prohibition that does not admit interpretation. And from good manners is not to rise to dance with the people if one finds his dancing burdensome, nor to disturb their states, for dancing without showing affectation is permissible. The one who shows affectation is the one from whom the effect of artificiality appears to all. And he who rises from sincerity is not burdensome to the dispositions. The hearts of the witnesses, if they are among the people of hearts, are a touchstone for sincerity and affectation. One of them was asked about sound spiritual ecstasy, and he said: "Its soundness is the acceptance of it by the hearts of the witnesses, if they are of similar kinds, not opposites." If you say: "Why is it that dispositions recoil from dancing, and the notion that it is false, frivolous, and contrary to religion comes quickly to minds, so that no one serious in religion sees it except that he rejects it?" Then know that seriousness cannot exceed the seriousness of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he saw the Abyssinians dancing in the mosque and did not reject it, because it was at a time suitable for it—which was the Eid—and from people suitable for it—who were the Abyssinians. Yes, dispositions recoil from it because it is mostly seen coupled with frivolity and play, and frivolity and play are permissible, but for the common folk among the Zanj and Abyssinians and their like. It is disliked for those of high standing because it is not befitting for them. And what is disliked for being unbefitting to the station of a person of station cannot be described as forbidden. If someone asked a poor man for something and he gave him a loaf of bread, that would be a commendable act of obedience. But if someone asked a king and he gave him one or two loaves, it would be reprehensible in the sight of all people, recorded in the annals of history among his faults, and his descendants and followers would be reproached for it. Yet, it cannot be said that what he did is forbidden, because from the perspective of giving bread to a poor man it is good, but from the perspective of its relation to his station it is unbecoming, just as withholding would be unbecoming in relation to a poor man. So it is with the dancer and what follows its course among permissible things. The permissible acts of the common folk are the misdeeds of the righteous, and the good deeds of the righteous are the misdeeds of those brought near. But this is from the perspective of considering stations. As for when it is viewed in itself, the ruling must be that in itself there is no prohibition in it, and God knows best.

From the preceding detailed discussion, it has become clear that listening [to music/spiritual audition] can be purely forbidden, can be permissible, can be disliked, or can be recommended. As for the forbidden, it is for most people among the youth and those overpowered by worldly desire, for listening only stirs in them what is predominant in their hearts of blameworthy attributes. As for the disliked, it is for one who does not attribute it to the form of created beings but takes it as a habit for himself most of the time on the basis of frivolity. As for the permissible, it is for one who has no share in it except delighting in a beautiful sound. As for the recommended, it is for one overpowered by the love of God Almighty, and listening only stirs in him the praiseworthy attributes. And praise be to God alone. Peace and blessings be upon Muhammad and his family.
