                             The Book of the Foundations of Belief
                      Being the Second Book of the Quarter of Worship
   The Book of the Foundations of Belief, containing four chapters:
   Chapter One: Presenting the creed of the People of the Sunnah concerning the two testimonies of faith, which are among the foundations of Islam. We say, and with God lies all success: Praise be to God, the Originator, the Restorer, the Doer of what He wills, Possessor of the Glorious Throne and Mighty Grasp, Who guides the choicest of His servants to the right path and the straight way, Who bestows upon them, after the testimony of Divine Oneness, the safeguarding of their beliefs from the darknesses of doubt and hesitation, Who guides them to follow His chosen Messenger and to tread the path of his most noble and honored Companions, supporting and guiding them, revealing to them in His Essence and His acts the beauties of His attributes, which none comprehends save he who lends an ear and is a witness. He has made known to them that in His Essence He is One, with no partner; Unique, with no equal; Eternal, with no opposite; Solitary, with no peer. He is One, Eternal, without beginning; Everlasting, without origin; Perpetual in existence, without end; Everlasting, without termination; Self-Subsisting, without interruption; Abiding, without cessation. He has always been and will always be described by the attributes of Majesty; He is not subject to cessation and separation by the passing of ages and the extinction of terms. Rather, "He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and He has full knowledge of all things." Transcendence: He is not a formed body, nor a limited, measurable substance. He does not resemble bodies, neither in measure nor in accepting division. He is not a substance, nor are substances contained in Him; nor is He an accident, nor are accidents contained in Him. Rather, He does not resemble any existent, nor does any existent resemble Him. "There is nothing like unto Him," nor is He like anything. He is not bounded by measure, nor contained by regions; directions do not encompass Him, nor do the earths or the heavens contain Him. He is established upon the Throne in the manner He has said and with the meaning He intended—an establishment transcendent from contact, settling, being firmly fixed, indwelling, or movement. The Throne does not carry Him; rather, the Throne and its bearers are carried by the subtlety of His power and subdued within His grasp. He is above the Throne and the heavens and above everything, down to the depths of the earth—an aboveness that does not bring Him nearer to the Throne and the heavens, just as it does not make Him farther from the earth and the dust. Rather, He is exalted in degrees above the Throne and the heavens, just as He is exalted in degrees above the earth and the dust. Yet, with all that, He is near to every existent, and He is closer to a servant than his jugular vein, "and He is Witness over all things." For His nearness does not resemble the nearness of bodies, just as His Essence does not resemble the essence of bodies. He does not indwell in anything, nor does anything indwell in Him. Exalted is He from being contained by a place, as He is sanctified from being bounded by time. Rather, He was before He created time and place, and He is now as He ever was. He is distinct from His creation by His attributes; there is nothing other than Him in His Essence, and nothing of His Essence in what is other than Him. He is sanctified from change and transition; events do not occur in Him, nor do contingencies befall Him. Rather, He remains forever in the attributes of His Majesty, transcendent from passing away, and in the attributes of His perfection, independent of any increase in completion. His existence in His Essence is known to intellects, and His Essence will be seen by eyes, as a grace from Him and a kindness to the righteous in the Abode of Permanence, and as a completion from Him of bliss by gazing upon His Noble Countenance. Life and Power: He, exalted is He, is Living, Powerful, Compeller, Subduer. Incapacity and impotence do not befall Him; slumber and sleep do not overtake Him; extinction and death do not oppose Him. He possesses sovereignty and dominion, might and omnipotence. To Him belongs authority and subjugation, creation and command. The heavens are folded in His right hand, and all creatures are subdued within His grasp. He is the Sole Creator and Originator, the Unique in bringing into existence and inventing. He created creation and their deeds, and He decreed their provisions and their terms. No destined thing escapes His grasp, and the turnings of affairs are not hidden from His power. His objects of power cannot be counted, and His objects of knowledge are not exhausted. Knowledge: He is Knower of all knowable things, encompassing all that occurs from the depths of the earths to the highest heavens. He is the Knower; not an atom's weight in the earth or in the heavens escapes His knowledge. Rather, He knows the creeping of the black ant upon the solid rock in the darkest night, perceives the movement of a mote in the air, knows the secret and what is more hidden, is aware of the whispers of consciences, the movements of thoughts, and the hidden things of inner secrets, with an eternal, everlasting knowledge with which He has always been described in the eternity of eternities.

There is no newly acquired knowledge inherent in His essence through indwelling or transference. The Will: That He, exalted, wills all beings and governs all events, so nothing occurs in the realm of dominion and sovereignty—be it small or great, minor or major, good or evil, beneficial or harmful, faith or disbelief, recognition or denial, success or loss, increase or decrease, obedience or disobedience—except by His decree, His ordainment, His wisdom, and His will. What He wills comes to be, and what He does not will does not come to be. Not a glance of an eye nor a fleeting thought escapes His will. Rather, He is the Originator, the Restorer, the Doer of what He wills. There is none to repel His command, none to revise His decree, and no escape for a servant from disobeying Him except by His enabling grace and His mercy. Nor does a servant have any power to obey Him except by His will and His volition. If all of mankind, jinn, angels, and devils were to gather to move or still a single atom in the universe without His will and volition, they would be incapable of it. And His will is subsistent in His essence, among the totality of His attributes; He has ever been thus described, willing from pre-eternity the existence of things at their appointed times which He ordained. Thus they come to be at their times exactly as He willed in pre-eternity, without advance or delay, but occur in accordance with His knowledge and will, without alteration or change. He administers affairs not through the arrangement of thoughts nor the awaiting of time, and thus no matter distracts Him from another.

Hearing and Sight: That He, exalted, is Hearing, Seeing. He hears and sees, and no audible thing, however hidden, is inexpressible to His hearing. No visible thing, however subtle, is absent from His sight. His hearing is not hindered by distance, nor is His sight repelled by darkness. He sees without pupil or eyelids, and hears without ear canals or ears, just as He knows without a heart, grasps without a limb, and creates without an instrument, for His attributes do not resemble the attributes of creation, just as His essence does not resemble the essences of creation.

Speech: That He, exalted, is Speaking, commanding us, promising, and warning with an eternal, primordial speech subsistent in His essence, not resembling the speech of creation. It is not a sound produced by the passage of breath or the collision of bodies, nor is it letters that cease with the closing of lips or the movement of a tongue. And the Qur'an, the Torah, the Gospel, and the Psalms are His revealed books to His messengers, peace be upon them. And the Qur'an is recited by tongues, written in volumes, preserved in hearts, yet it is also eternal, subsistent in the essence of God, exalted, not accepting separation or division by transference to hearts and pages. And Moses, peace be upon him, heard the speech of God without sound or letter, just as the righteous will see the essence of God, exalted, in the Hereafter without substance or accident. And since He possesses these attributes, He is Living, Knowing, Powerful, Willing, Hearing, Seeing, Speaking—with life, power, knowledge, will, hearing, sight, and speech—not merely by essence alone.

Actions: That He, glory and exalted be He, has no existent besides Him except what is originated by His action and emanates from His justice in the best, most complete, most perfect, and most just of ways. He is Wise in His actions, Just in His decrees. His justice is not measured by the justice of servants, for injustice can be conceived from a servant when he disposes of another's property, but injustice cannot be conceived from God, exalted, for He encounters no property belonging to another such that His disposal of it would be unjust. Everything besides Him—of humans, jinn, angels, devils, heavens, earth, animals, plants, inanimate objects, substances, and accidents, the perceived and the sensed—is originated, invented by His power after non-existence, a pure invention, and He brought it into being after it was nothing. For He existed alone, and there was nothing with Him; then He originated creation thereafter as a manifestation of His power and a realization of what preceded from His will and what was true in pre-eternity from His Word, not out of any need or necessity for it. He is gracious through creation, invention, and imposing obligation, not out of compulsion; He is bountiful through bestowal of favor and setting aright, not out of necessity. To Him belong grace, beneficence, favor, and bestowal, for He is capable of pouring upon His servants various types of torment and trying them with diverse pains and afflictions. Had He done that, it would have been justice from Him and would not have been unbecoming or unjust from Him. And He, mighty and majestic, confirms His believing servants in acts of obedience by virtue of generosity and promise, not by virtue of desert and obligation towards Him, for no action is incumbent upon Him for anyone, injustice cannot be conceived from Him, and no one has a right incumbent upon Him. Yet His right to obedience became obligatory upon creation by His making it obligatory upon the tongues of His prophets, peace be upon them, not by mere reason. But He sent the messengers and demonstrated their truthfulness with manifest miracles, so they conveyed His command, prohibition, promise, and threat, and it became obligatory upon creation to believe them in what they brought.

The meaning of the second statement: It is the testimony to the messengers concerning their messengership—that He sent the unlettered, Qurayshi Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with His message to all Arabs and non-Arabs, jinn and mankind, abrogating the previous religious laws with his law except what he confirmed from them. He favored him over all other prophets and made him the master of humanity. And the perfection of faith with the testimony of divine unity—the statement "There is no god but God"—is precluded unless it is coupled...

It entails bearing witness to the Messenger, which is your statement "Muhammad is the Messenger of God," and obligating creation to believe him truthful in all he informed about concerning matters of this world and the Hereafter. And that the faith of a servant is not accepted until he believes in what he informed of after death, and its first [matter]: the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, two awe-inspiring, formidable persons who seat the servant in his grave, sound in body and soul, and question him about Divine Oneness and Messengership, saying to him: "Who is your Lord, what is your religion, and who is your Prophet?" They are the two tempters of the grave, and their questioning is the first trial after death. And to believe in the punishment of the grave, that it is true and a just wisdom upon the body and soul as He wills. And to believe in the Balance with its two scales and its tongue, and its description in magnitude is that it is like the layers of the heavens and the earth; deeds are weighed by the power of God Almighty, and the weights on that Day will be of the measure of ants and mustard seeds, realizing the perfection of justice. The scrolls of good deeds are clarified in a beautiful form in the scale of light, making the Balance heavy according to the measure of their degrees with God by the grace of God. And the scrolls of evil deeds are cast in an ugly form in the scale of darkness, making the Balance light by the justice of God. And to believe that the Bridge is true, a bridge stretched over the back of Hell, sharper than the sword and finer than a hair. The feet of the disbelievers slip upon it by the decree of God, Glorified is He, so they plummet with it into the Fire. And the feet of the believers are made firm upon it by the grace of God, so they are led to the Abode of Permanence. And to believe in the Pond to be visited, the Pond of Muhammad ﷺ, from which the believers drink before entering Paradise and after crossing the Bridge. Whoever drinks a drink from it will never thirst thereafter. Its width is a month's journey, its water whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, around it are pitchers equal in number to the stars of the sky. In it are two spouts flowing into it from al-Kawthar. And to believe in the Reckoning and the disparity among people therein: to one who is scrutinized in the reckoning, to one who is pardoned in it, and to one who enters Paradise without reckoning—they are those brought near. Then God Almighty questions whom He wills from the prophets about conveying the message, and whom He wills from the disbelievers about rejecting the messengers. And the innovators are questioned about the Sunnah, and the Muslims are questioned about their deeds. And to believe in the extraction of the monotheists from the Fire after retribution, until no monotheist remains in Hell by the grace of God Almighty, so no monotheist remains eternally in the Fire. And to believe in the intercession of the prophets, then the scholars, then the martyrs, then the rest of the believers according to their rank and station with God Almighty. And whoever remains from the believers and has no intercessor is brought out by the grace of God, Mighty and Majestic. So no believer remains eternally in the Fire; rather, whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of faith is brought out from it. And to hold the excellence of the Companions, God be pleased with them, and their ranking, and that the best of people after the Prophet ﷺ is Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, then 'Uthman, then 'Ali, God be pleased with them all. And to think well of all the Companions and praise them as God, Mighty and Majestic, and His Messenger ﷺ praised them all. For all of that is from what the reports have conveyed and the traditions have borne witness. So whoever believes in all of that with certainty is from the people of truth and the band of the Sunnah, and has separated from the faction of misguidance and the party of innovation. We ask God for perfect certainty and good steadfastness in the religion for us and for all Muslims by His mercy, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. And may God bless our master Muhammad and every chosen servant.

Chapter Two: On the Method of Gradual Progression to Guidance and the Ordering of the Degrees of Belief. Know that what we mentioned in translating the creed should be presented to the child at the beginning of his upbringing so that he memorizes it by rote. Then its meaning is gradually unveiled to him as he grows older, bit by bit. Thus, its beginning is memorization, then understanding, then belief, certainty, and affirmation. This is something attained in the child without proof. From the grace of God Almighty upon the heart of man is that He opened it at the beginning of his upbringing to faith without need for argument and proof. How can this be denied when all the beliefs of the common folk have as their foundation mere instruction and pure imitation? Indeed, the belief attained by mere imitation is not free from a kind of weakness at the outset, in the sense that it would accept removal by its opposite if presented to it. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen it and establish it in the soul of the child and the common person until it becomes firmly rooted and is not shaken. The way to strengthen and establish it is not by teaching the craft of dialectic and theological discourse, but rather by occupying oneself with the recitation of the Quran and its interpretation, reading the Hadith and its meanings, and occupying oneself with the duties of worship. Thus, his belief continues to increase in firmness by what strikes his hearing from the proofs and arguments of the Quran, by what reaches him from the evidences and benefits of the Hadiths, by what shines upon him from the lights of worship and its duties, and by what is conveyed to him from witnessing the righteous.

Their company, their appearance, their listening, and their state of humble submission to God, Mighty and Majestic, and of fear of Him and lowliness before Him, become the first instruction, like casting a seed into the breast. These causes are like watering and nurturing it until that seed grows, strengthens, and rises as a goodly tree, firmly rooted, its branches in the sky. One must guard one's hearing from argumentation and disputation with the utmost vigilance, for what argumentation confuses is more than what it paves, and what it corrupts is more than what it rectifies. Indeed, strengthening it through argumentation is akin to striking a tree with an iron mallet hoping to strengthen it by increasing its parts, yet that may shatter and spoil it, which is the more likely outcome. Observation suffices you as clarification in this, so let direct sight suffice you as proof. Compare the creed of the righteous and pious among the common people with the creed of the theologians and disputants. You will see the common person's belief in firmness like a towering mountain, unmoved by calamities and thunderbolts, while the creed of the theologian, who guards his belief with the divisions of argumentation, is like a thread released into the air, which the winds sway this way and that—except for one who hears the proof of belief from them and receives it by imitation, just as he received the very belief by imitation, for there is no difference in imitation between teaching the proof or learning what is proven. Instructing in the proof is one thing, and inferring through independent reasoning is another, far removed from it. Then, if a child falls upon this creed and becomes engrossed in worldly gain, nothing else opens for him, but he will be safe in the Hereafter with the belief of the people of truth, for the Sacred Law did not require the rough Bedouins more than firm conviction in the apparent meaning of these beliefs. As for investigation, scrutiny, and contriving the composition of proofs, they were not required of them at all. If he wishes to be among the travelers on the path of the Hereafter and divine facilitation assists him so that he engages in action, adheres to piety, restrains the soul from caprice, and engages in spiritual discipline and striving, then doors of guidance open for him, unveiling the realities of this creed with a divine light cast into his heart due to the striving, in fulfillment of His promise, Mighty and Majestic, when He said: "As for those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them to Our paths. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good." This is the precious essence that is the ultimate faith of the truthful and those brought near. To it alludes the secret that was lodged in the breast of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, by which he surpassed creation. The unveiling of that secret—or rather, those secrets—has degrees according to the degrees of striving and the degrees of the inner self in purity and cleansing from all besides God, Exalted, and in illumination by the light of certainty. This is like the disparity among people in the secrets of medicine, jurisprudence, and other sciences, for that differs according to the difference in exertion and the difference in natural disposition in intelligence and acumen. And just as those degrees are boundless, so too are these.

[Question] If you ask: Is learning argumentation and theology blameworthy like learning astrology, or is it permissible, or recommended? Know that people have gone to extremes and excesses in this matter. Some say it is an innovation or forbidden, and that for a servant to meet God, Mighty and Majestic, with every sin except polytheism is better for him than to meet Him with theology. Others say it is obligatory and a duty, either a collective obligation or an individual one, and that it is the best of deeds and the highest of acts of nearness, for it is the verification of the knowledge of divine unity and a defense of the religion of God, Exalted. The position of prohibition was held by al-Shafi'i, Malik, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Sufyan, and all the Hadith scholars among the predecessors. Ibn 'Abd al-A'la, may God have mercy on him, said: I heard al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, on the day he debated Hafs al-Fard, who was among the Mutazilite theologians, say: "For a servant to meet God, Mighty and Majestic, with every sin except associating partners with God is better than meeting Him with anything from the science of theology." And I heard from Hafs speech that I cannot recount. He also said: "I have learned something from the people of theology that I never imagined. For a servant to be afflicted with everything God has forbidden except polytheism is better for him than to look into theology." Al-Karabisi reported that al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, was asked about something from theology and became angry, saying: "Ask Hafs al-Fard and his companions about this—may God disgrace them." When al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, fell ill, Hafs al-Fard entered upon him. He said to him: "Who am I?" He said: "Hafs al-Fard—may God neither protect you nor watch over you until you repent from what you are upon." He also said: "If people knew what caprices are in theology, they would flee from it as they flee from a lion." He also said: "If you hear a man say 'the name is the named' or 'other than the named,' then bear witness that he is from the people of theology and has no religion." Al-Za'farani said: Al-Shafi'i said: "My ruling concerning the people of theology is that they be beaten with palm fronds, paraded around the tribes and clans, and it be said: 'This is the recompense of those who abandon the Book and the Sunnah and take up theology.'" Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: "The practitioner of theology will never prosper, and you will scarcely see anyone..."

Whoever delves into theological discourse harbors deceit in his heart. He was so vehement in his condemnation that he shunned al-Harith al-Muhasibi, despite his asceticism and piety, because he authored a book refuting the innovators. He said to him, "Woe to you! Do you not first narrate their heresy and then refute them? Does your composition not compel people to study innovation and ponder those specious arguments, thereby inciting them to opinionated reasoning and investigation?" Ahmad, may God have mercy on him, said, "The theologians are heretics." Malik, may God have mercy on him, said, "What do you think if someone more argumentative than him comes along? Will he abandon his religion every day for a new religion?"—meaning the statements of disputants vary. Malik, may God have mercy on him, also said, "The testimony of people of innovation and caprice is not permissible." Some of his companions interpreted this, saying he meant by 'people of caprice' the theologians, regardless of their school. Abu Yusuf said, "Whoever seeks knowledge through theology becomes a heretic." Al-Hasan said, "Do not argue with people of caprice, do not sit with them, and do not listen to them." The traditionists among the predecessors unanimously agreed on this, and the severity reported from them on this matter is boundless. They said, "The Companions remained silent on this, although they were more knowledgeable of the truths and more eloquent in arranging words than others, only because they knew the evil it would generate." Therefore, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The extremists have perished, the extremists have perished, the extremists have perished"—meaning those who delve excessively into investigation and scrutiny. They also argued that if this were part of the religion, it would have been the most important thing the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would have commanded, taught its method, and praised it and its people. Yet, he taught them purification, urged them to learn the obligatory duties, and praised them for it. He forbade them from discoursing on predestination, saying, "Refrain from predestination." The Companions, may God be pleased with them, continued upon this. To go beyond the Master is transgression and injustice, for they are the Masters and the exemplars, and we are the followers and students.

As for the other faction, they argued by saying: If the danger in theology lies in terms like 'substance' and 'accident' and these unfamiliar terminologies not known to the Companions, may God be pleased with them, the matter is straightforward, for there is no field of knowledge that has not introduced terminologies for the sake of clarification, such as in Hadith, exegesis, and jurisprudence. If expressions like 'nullification,' 'breaking,' 'composition,' and 'transitivity,' and the corruption of premise, along with all the questions posed regarding analogy, were presented to them, they would not have understood them. Therefore, coining an expression to denote a sound objective is like creating a vessel of a new form for use in a permissible matter. If the danger lies in the meaning, we intend by it nothing but knowing the proof for the temporality of the world, the oneness of the Creator, and His attributes as revealed in the Sacred Law. So from where is knowing God, exalted is He, through proof forbidden? If the danger lies in factionalism, partisanship, enmity, and hatred, and what discourse leads to, that is forbidden and one must guard against it, just as arrogance, vanity, ostentation, and seeking leadership are outcomes to which the knowledge of Hadith, exegesis, and jurisprudence may lead, and they are forbidden, requiring caution. But that does not preclude the knowledge itself because it may lead to it. How can mentioning proof, demanding it, and investigating it be forbidden when God, exalted is He, has said, "Say, 'Produce your proof,'" and He, mighty and majestic, said, "So that he who perishes may perish by clear proof, and he who lives may live by clear proof," and He said, "Do you have any authority for this?"—meaning proof and evidence—and He said, "Say, 'Then to God belongs the conclusive argument,'" and He said, "Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord..." up to His words, "So the one who disbelieved was confounded," when He, glorified is He, mentioned Abraham's argumentation, disputation, and silencing of his opponent in the context of praising him. And He, mighty and majestic, said, "That was Our argument which We gave Abraham against his people," and He said, "They said, 'O Noah, you have disputed us and argued with us excessively,'" and He said in the story of Pharaoh, "And what is the Lord of the worlds?" up to His words, "If you have come with something clear." In summary, the Qur'an from beginning to end is an argument with the disbelievers. The essence of the theologians' proofs for divine oneness is His saying, "If there were therein gods besides God, both would have been ruined," and for prophethood, "If you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our servant, then produce a surah like it," and for resurrection, "Say, 'He will give it life who produced it the first time,'" among other such verses and proofs. The messengers, prayers of God be upon them, continually argued with and disputed the deniers. God said, "And argue with them in the best manner." The Companions, may God be pleased with them, also argued with and disputed the deniers, but only when necessary, and the need for it was rare in their time. The first to institute calling the innovators to truth through disputation was 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, when he sent Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, to the Kharijites to speak to them. He said, "What is your grievance?"

Regarding your leader, they said, "He fought but did not take captives nor spoils." He said, "That was in fighting the disbelievers. Tell me, if 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her) were among the captives allotted to one of you, would you deem lawful from her what you deem lawful from your property, when she is your mother according to the clear text of the Book?" They said, "No." So, two thousand of them returned to obedience through his argument.

It is narrated that al-Hasan debated a Qadari (follower of free will doctrine) and he renounced the doctrine of Qadar. And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (may God honor his face) debated a man from the Qadariyyah. And 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may God be pleased with him) debated Yazid ibn 'Umayrah concerning faith. 'Abdullah said, "If I were to say 'I am a believer,' I would be saying 'I am in Paradise.'" Yazid ibn 'Umayrah said to him, "O companion of the Messenger of God, this is a slip from you. Is faith not but to believe in God, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Resurrection, and the Balance, and to establish prayer, fasting, and almsgiving? We have sins; if we knew they would be forgiven for us, we would know we are among the people of Paradise. It is for this reason we say, 'We are believers,' but we do not say, 'We are among the people of Paradise.'" Ibn Mas'ud said, "You have spoken the truth, by God. It was indeed a slip from me."

Therefore, it should be said that their engagement in it (theological discourse) was little, not much; short, not long; and for necessity, not by way of systematic composition, teaching, and making it a craft. As for its being little, it was due to the scarcity of need, as innovation did not manifest in that era. As for its being short, the ultimate goal was to silence the opponent, secure his admission, unveil the truth, and remove doubt. Had the opponent's confusion or obstinacy been prolonged, their refutation would inevitably have been prolonged. They did not measure the extent of need with a scale or measure after embarking upon it. As for their not undertaking to teach and compose systematically on it, such was their practice also in jurisprudence, exegesis, and hadith. If it is permissible to compose works on jurisprudence and posit rare scenarios that occur only infrequently—either to store up for the day of their occurrence, though rare, or to sharpen minds—then we too may arrange methods of argumentation in anticipation of the need arising from the eruption of doubt, the agitation of an innovator, or to sharpen the mind, or to store up proofs so as not to be incapable of them at the moment of need, extemporaneously, like one who prepares weapons before the battle for the day of battle. This is what can be mentioned for both sides.

If you say, "What is your preferred position concerning it?" then know that the truth in this matter is that an absolute statement condemning it in every circumstance or praising it in every circumstance is an error. Rather, it necessitates detailed exposition. Know first that a thing may be prohibited due to its essence, like wine and carrion. By "due to its essence," I mean the reason for its prohibition is an attribute inherent in it, namely intoxication and death. When asked about this, we state absolutely that it is forbidden, without regard to the permissibility of carrion in dire necessity or the permissibility of sipping wine if a person chokes on a morsel and finds nothing to wash it down except wine. And there is what is forbidden due to an external factor, like selling upon the sale of your Muslim brother during the option period, and selling at the time of the call to prayer, and like eating clay, for it is forbidden due to the harm it contains. This divides into what harms in small and large amounts, so an absolute statement is made that it is forbidden, like poison which kills in small and large amounts; and into what harms only in large amounts, so an absolute statement of permissibility is made, like honey, for a large amount harms one with a hot temperament, and like eating clay. The absolute prohibition regarding clay and wine, and the absolute permissibility regarding honey, is a consideration of the predominant circumstances. If something is encountered where circumstances are contradictory, the preferable and furthest from ambiguity is to give details.

We return to the science of theology and say: It contains benefit and it contains harm. Considered from its benefit at the time of benefiting from it, it is permissible, recommended, or obligatory, as the situation demands. Considered from its harm at the time of suffering detriment from it and in its place, it is forbidden. As for its harm: it stirs up doubts, unsettles beliefs, and removes them from certainty and firmness. This occurs at the outset, and their return via proof is uncertain and varies among individuals. This is its harm regarding sound belief. It has another harm in confirming the innovator's belief in his innovation and solidifying it in their hearts, such that their motives are aroused and their insistence upon it intensifies. But this harm is via the turmoil stirred up by disputation. Therefore, you see that the common innovator may have his belief removed with gentleness in the shortest time, unless he grew up in a land where disputation and fanaticism are prevalent. For if all people, early and late, gathered against him, they would not be able to uproot the innovation from his heart. Rather, caprice, fanaticism, hatred for the disputant's opponents, and partisanship for his faction take hold of his heart and prevent him from perceiving the truth. Even if it were said to him, "Do you want God Almighty to lift the veil for you and make you know with certainty that the truth is with your opponent?" he would detest that, fearing that his opponent might rejoice in it. This is the malignant disease that has spread through lands and people. It is a type...

The corruption of its traces is wrought by disputants through partisanship, and this is its harm. As for its benefit, one might suppose its purpose is to unveil truths and to know them as they truly are—but far from it! There is no fulfillment of this noble objective in theological discourse. Indeed, confusion and misguidance within it are more prevalent than illumination and clarification. If you hear this from a mere narrator or an uncritical follower, it may cross your mind that people are enemies of what they do not know. So hear it from one who has experienced theological discourse, then renounced it after true experience, after delving into it to the utmost degree of the theologians, and then surpassed that to probe deeply into other sciences akin to the nature of this discourse, and who has verified that the path to the realities of knowledge from this angle is blocked. By my life, theological discourse is not devoid of unveiling, clarification, and illumination for some matters—but rarely, concerning matters so evident they are nearly understood before delving deeply into the craft of discourse. Rather, its benefit is singular: it is the guarding of the creed we have conveyed to the common people and preserving it from the confusions of innovators through various forms of argumentation. For the common person is weak, easily agitated by the disputation of an innovator, even if it is flawed; and opposing the flawed with the flawed repels it. People are bound by this creed we have presented, as the Sacred Law has conveyed it due to the rectification it brings to their religion and worldly life, and the righteous predecessors have unanimously agreed upon it. Scholars are bound to safeguard it for the common people from the deceptions of innovators, just as rulers are bound to safeguard their wealth from the encroachments of oppressors and usurpers. When one comprehends its harm and benefit, it should be employed like a skilled physician using a dangerous medicine—applying it only in its proper place, at the time of need, and to the extent of the need. The details are: the common people engaged in trades and crafts must be left with the soundness of the beliefs they have adopted, provided they have been taught the correct belief we mentioned. Teaching them theological discourse is pure harm in their regard, for it may stir doubt within them and shake their belief, and repair thereafter may not be possible. As for the common person who holds an innovation, he should be invited to the truth with gentleness, not partisanship, and with gentle discourse that convinces the soul, affects the heart, and is close to the manner of the proofs of the Quran and Hadith, blended with a style of admonition and warning. That is more beneficial than argumentation structured according to the conditions set by theologians, for when the common person hears that, he thinks it is a kind of argumentative craft learned by the theologian to lure people to his belief. If he is unable to answer, he assumes that the disputants of his own school could also repel it. Thus, disputation with this person and with the former is forbidden. Likewise with one who has fallen into doubt, it must be removed with gentleness, admonition, and proofs that are near, acceptable, and far from the depths of discourse and exhaustive argumentation. Argumentation is only beneficial in one situation: when a common person has adopted an innovation due to a type of argument he heard, and that argument is countered with its like, so he returns to the correct belief. This applies to one for whom familiarity with disputation has become such that it prevents him from being convinced by common admonitions and warnings; he has reached a state that nothing cures except the medicine of argumentation, so it is permissible to administer it to him. As for lands where innovation is rare and schools do not differ, one should confine oneself to conveying the belief we mentioned, not engage with proofs, and wait for a doubt to arise. If it arises, one addresses it to the extent of the need. If innovation is widespread and there is fear that children may be deceived, there is no harm in teaching them the amount we have included in the book "The Sacred Epistle," so that it may be a means to repel the influence of innovators' arguments if they encounter them. This is a concise measure, and we have included it in this book due to its brevity. If one possesses intelligence and alertness, and through his intelligence a question arises or a doubt stirs in his soul, then the feared ailment has appeared and the disease has manifested. There is no harm in elevating him to the amount we mentioned in the book "The Moderation in Belief," which is about fifty pages, and it does not depart from examining the foundations of creed to other investigations of the theologians. If that satisfies him, it suffices; if it does not satisfy him, then the ailment has become chronic, the disease dominant, and the illness pervasive. Let the physician treat him gently to the extent possible and await the decree of God Almighty for him—until the truth is unveiled to him through an inspiration from God, Glorified is He, or he remains in doubt and uncertainty as destined for him. The amount contained in that book and its like among compositions is what holds hope of benefit. As for what goes beyond it, it is of two types: one is inquiry into matters other than the foundations of creed, such as inquiry into supports, into events, into perceptions, and into delving into vision—whether it has an opposite called prevention or blindness, and if so, that is one, a prevention from all that is not seen, or it is established...

For every visible thing that can be seen, there is a prohibition according to its measure, and so on with other misleading vanities. The second category is an excessive elaboration of those proofs beyond those foundational principles, along with additional questions and answers. This, too, is an exhaustive pursuit that only increases misguidance and ignorance for one whom that initial measure does not convince. For often, elaboration and excessive proof only render speech more obscure. If someone were to say that investigating the rulings concerning perceptions and convictions holds the benefit of sharpening the intellect—and the intellect is the instrument of religion, just as the sword is the instrument of jihad—so there is no harm in sharpening it, akin to saying chess sharpens the intellect and is thus also part of religion—that is folly. For the intellect is sharpened by all the sciences of the Sacred Law, wherein no harm is feared. Thus, by this measure, you have come to know the blameworthy and praiseworthy extent of speech, the state in which it is blamed, the state in which it is praised, the person who benefits from it, and the person who does not.

If you say: "Since you have acknowledged the need for it to repel the innovators, and now innovations have arisen and the trial has become widespread, and the need is pressing, then undertaking this knowledge must become one of the communal obligations, like safeguarding wealth and other rights such as judgeship and governance. Unless scholars occupy themselves with disseminating, teaching, and investigating it, it will not endure. If it were abandoned entirely, it would be effaced. Mere natural disposition is insufficient to resolve the doubts of innovators without learning. Therefore, teaching and investigating it should also be among the communal obligations, unlike the time of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, when the need was not pressing." Then know that the truth is that in every land there must be someone dedicated to this knowledge, independently repelling the doubts of innovators that have arisen in that region, and this endures through teaching. However, it is not correct to teach it generally like teaching jurisprudence or exegesis. For this is like medicine, and jurisprudence like nourishment. The harm of nourishment is not feared, but the harm of medicine is to be guarded against due to the types of harm we mentioned. The scholar who should be specialized in teaching this knowledge is one who possesses three qualities: First, devotion to knowledge and eagerness for it, for the professional is prevented by his occupation from thoroughness and removing doubts when they arise. Second, intelligence, acumen, and eloquence, for the dull-witted does not benefit from his understanding, and the stammerer does not benefit from his argumentation, so harm from speech is feared for him and no benefit is hoped. Third, that his nature be one of righteousness, religiosity, and piety, and that his appetites not overpower him. For the corrupt person, with the slightest doubt, is torn away from religion, as that loosens the restraint and removes the barrier between him and pleasures, so he does not strive to remove the doubt but seizes it to be relieved from the burdens of obligation. Thus, such a learner corrupts more than he rectifies.

When you understand these divisions, it becomes clear to you that this praiseworthy argumentation in speech is only of the kind of the Qur'an's arguments: subtle words that affect hearts and convince souls, without delving into divisions and minutiae that most people do not understand. And if they do understand them, they believe it is sorcery and a craft its practitioner learned for deception. When he meets his like in craft, he contends with him. Know that Al-Shafi'i and all the early predecessors only prohibited delving into it and specializing in it due to the harm we have indicated. What is narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, regarding debating the Khawarij, and what is narrated from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, regarding debate on predestination and other matters, was of the clear, manifest speech and in a situation of need, and that is praiseworthy in every circumstance. Indeed, eras may differ in the abundance or scarcity of need, so it is not far-fetched that the ruling would differ accordingly. This is the ruling concerning the creed by which creation is worshipfully bound, and the ruling concerning the method of striving for it and preserving it.

As for removing doubt, unveiling realities, knowing things as they are, and perceiving the secrets which the outward expressions of this creed translate, there is no key to it except spiritual struggle, subduing appetites, turning completely towards God Almighty, and adhering to pure thought free from the impurities of disputation. It is a mercy from God, Glorified and Exalted, that flows upon whoever exposes himself to its breezes according to the provision, according to the exposure, and according to the receptivity of the vessel and the purity of the heart. And that is an ocean whose depth cannot be fathomed nor its shore reached.

[Question] If you say: "This speech indicates that these sciences have outward aspects and secrets; some are manifest, appearing first, and some are hidden, becoming clear through spiritual struggle, discipline, diligent seeking, pure thought, and a heart emptied of all worldly occupations save the Sought. This almost contradicts the Sacred Law, for the Sacred Law does not have an outward and inward, a secret and open; rather, the outward and inward, the secret...

Know that the division of these sciences into hidden and manifest is not denied by any person of insight; only the deficient deny it—those who grasped something in early youth and became rigid upon it, so they could not ascend to the heights of the exalted and the stations of the scholars and the saints. This is evident from the proofs of the Sacred Law. He (peace be upon him) said: “Indeed, the Quran has an outward and an inward, a limit and a point of ascent.” And Ali (may God be pleased with him) said, pointing to his chest: “Here lies abundant knowledge, if only I could find carriers for it.” And he (peace be upon him) said: “We, the community of prophets, have been commanded to speak to people according to the capacity of their intellects.” And he (peace be upon him) said: “No one relates a discourse to a people that their intellects cannot grasp except that it becomes a trial for them.” And God Almighty said: “These are the parables We set forth for people, but none comprehend them except the knowledgeable.” And he (peace be upon him) said: “Indeed, part of knowledge is like a hidden treasure; none know it except those who know God Almighty,” the hadith continuing as we cited it in the Book of Knowledge. And he (peace be upon him) said: “If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.” I wonder, if that were not a secret withheld from disclosure due to the incapacity of understandings to grasp it, or for another reason, why did he not mention it to them? There is no doubt they would have believed him had he mentioned it. And Ibn Abbas (may God be pleased with them both) said regarding the words of the Almighty: “God is He who created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof; the command descends between them”—“If I mentioned its interpretation, you would stone me,” and in another wording, “you would say he is an unbeliever.” And Abu Huraira (may God be pleased with him) said: “I preserved from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) two vessels; as for one, I disseminated it, but as for the other, had I disseminated it, this throat would have been cut.” And he (peace be upon him) said: “Abu Bakr did not surpass you by much fasting or prayer, but by a secret settled in his chest,” may God be pleased with him. There is no doubt that secret pertained to the foundations of the religion, not outside them, and what is of the foundations of the religion was not hidden in its outward aspects from others. And Sahl al-Tustari (may God be pleased with him) said: “The knower has three sciences: an outward science he gives to the people of the outward, an inward science he cannot manifest except to its people, and a science that is between him and God Almighty which he does not reveal to anyone.” And some of the gnostics said: “Disclosing the secret of Lordship is unbelief.” And some said: “Lordship has a secret that, if disclosed, would nullify prophethood; and prophethood has a secret that, if unveiled, would nullify knowledge; and the knowers of God have a secret that, if they disclosed it, the rulings would be nullified.” If this speaker did not mean by that the nullification of prophethood for the weak due to the deficiency of their understanding, then what he mentioned is not true. Rather, the correct view is that there is no contradiction in it, and the complete one is he whose light of knowledge does not extinguish the light of his scrupulousness, and the essence of scrupulousness is prophethood.

[Question] If you say: These verses and reports admit interpretations, so explain to us the manner of the difference between the outward and the inward. For if the inward contradicts the outward, it entails invalidating the Sacred Law, which is the statement of those who say that reality opposes the law, and that is unbelief, because the law is an expression of the outward and reality is an expression of the inward. And if it does not contradict or oppose it, then it is the same, so the division vanishes and the Sacred Law would have no secret that is not disclosed; rather, the hidden and the manifest would be one. Know that this question stirs a great discourse and leads to the sciences of unveiling, departing from the intended purpose of the science of spiritual practice, which is the aim of these books. For the beliefs we have mentioned are among the works of the hearts, and we have been obligated to receive them with acceptance and affirmation by the heart’s conviction upon them, not by striving to have their realities unveiled to us, for that is not required of all creation. Were it not among the works, we would not have cited it in this book, and were it not a work of the outward heart, not of its inward, we would not have cited it in the first half of the book. True unveiling is an attribute of the secret of the heart and its inward. But if the discussion leads to stirring the imagination regarding the contradiction of the outward by the inward, a brief discourse on its resolution is necessary. Whoever says that reality opposes the law or the inward contradicts the outward is closer to unbelief than to faith. Rather, the secrets that are exclusively attained by the near ones, in which the majority do not share in their knowledge, and from disclosing them to others they refrain, revert to five categories. The first category is that the matter in itself is subtle, beyond the grasp of most understandings, so its perception is exclusive to the elect, and they must not disclose it to those not suited for it, lest it become a trial for them when their understandings fall short of grasping it. The concealment of the secret of the spirit and the restraint of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) from explaining it belong to this category, for its reality is such that understandings are too weak to grasp it and imaginations fall short of conceiving its essence. Do not think that this was not unveiled to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), for whoever does not know the spirit is as if he does not know himself, and whoever does not know himself, how...

He knows his Lord, glorified be He, and it is not far-fetched that this may be unveiled to some of the saints and scholars, even if they are not prophets. However, they adhere to the decorum of the Sacred Law, thus remaining silent about what was left unspoken. Indeed, among the attributes of God, Mighty and Majestic, are hidden realities that the understandings of the masses fall short of grasping. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, only mentioned from them the outward aspects comprehensible to the intellects, such as knowledge and power and others, so that creation could understand them through a kind of analogy they imagined to their own knowledge and power, since they possess attributes called knowledge and power. They thus imagine that through a kind of comparison. Had he mentioned from His attributes what creation does not possess, to which some analogy might be drawn, they would not have understood it. Even the pleasure of intercourse, if mentioned to a child or an impotent man, would not be understood except by analogy to the pleasure of food which he perceives, and that is not true understanding. The disparity between the knowledge and power of God, Exalted be He, and the knowledge and power of creation is greater than the disparity between the pleasure of intercourse and eating. In summary, a human being only perceives himself and his own attributes, which are present to him now or were his before, then by analogy to that he understands it for others. Then he may affirm that between the two there is a disparity in nobility and perfection. Thus, human capability is limited to affirming for God, Exalted be He, what is affirmed for oneself of action, knowledge, power, and other attributes, while believing that these are more perfect and noble. Therefore, most of his glorification is based on his own attributes, not on what is exclusive to the Lord, Exalted be He, of majesty. For this reason He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I cannot enumerate Your praise; You are as You have praised Yourself." The meaning is not that I am incapable of expressing what I have perceived, but rather it is an admission of incapacity to grasp the reality of His majesty. Therefore, some have said: "None has known God in reality except God, Mighty and Majestic." And al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: "Praise be to God who has not given creation any way to know Him except through incapacity to know Him."

Let us rein in the discourse from this mode and return to the purpose, which is that one of the categories is that which intellects are incapable of grasping. Among it is the Spirit, and among it are some attributes of God, Exalted be He. Perhaps the allusion to its like is in His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Verily, God, glorified and exalted, has seventy veils of light; were they to be removed, the splendors of His Countenance would burn every being His sight apprehends."

The second category of hidden matters, which the prophets and the truthful abstain from mentioning, is that which is comprehensible in itself—the intellect is not incapable of it—but mentioning it harms most listeners, though it does not harm the prophets and the truthful. The secret of divine decree, which the people of knowledge are prevented from divulging, is from this category. It is not far-fetched that mentioning some truths may harm some of creation, just as the light of the sun harms the eyes of bats, and just as the breezes of roses harm the beetle. How can this be far-fetched when our statement that disbelief, fornication, sins, and evils are all by the decree, will, and wish of God, Exalted be He, is true in itself, yet hearing it has harmed some people, for it suggested to them that it indicates folly, the opposite of wisdom, and acceptance of the vile and injustice. Ibn al-Rawandi and a group of the forsaken fell into heresy with the like of that. Similarly, the secret of divine decree, if divulged, would suggest incapacity to most people, since their understandings fall short of grasping what would remove that suggestion from them. If someone were to say that if the appointed time of the Resurrection were mentioned—that it is after a thousand years or more or less—it would be comprehensible, but it was not mentioned for the benefit of the servants and for fear of harm, perhaps the duration until it is long, so the term would be extended, and when souls consider the time of punishment delayed, their concern diminishes. Or perhaps it was near in the knowledge of God, glorified be He, and had it been mentioned, fear would have become immense, people would have turned away from works, and the world would have been ruined. If this meaning is correct and sound, it would be an example of this category.

The third category is that a thing may be such that if mentioned explicitly, it would be understood and there would be no harm in it, but it is alluded to by way of metaphor and symbol so that its impact on the listener's heart is stronger, and there is a benefit in magnifying the importance of that matter in his heart. As if someone were to say: "I saw so-and-so placing pearls around the necks of swine," thereby alluding to disseminating knowledge and spreading wisdom to those unworthy of it. The listener may initially understand the apparent meaning of the words, but the discerning person, when he reflects and knows that this man had no pearls nor were there swine in his place, becomes alert to grasping the secret and inner meaning. Thus, people differ in this. From this is the poet's saying:

Two men, a tailor and a weaver,
Facing each other over the unarmed star.
That one keeps weaving a cloth for the departing,
And his companion sews garments for the arriving.

For he expressed a celestial cause for advancement and decline through two craftsmen. This type reverts to expressing the meaning through an image that contains the very meaning or its like. From it is His saying, peace and blessings be upon him:

The mosque recoils from phlegm as skin recoils from fire. And you see that the mosque's expanse does not physically contract from the phlegm. Its meaning is that the spirit of the mosque lies in its being venerated, and spitting phlegm is a belittlement of it, thus opposing the meaning of 'mosque-ness' just as fire opposes the cohesion of skin's parts. Likewise is His saying, peace be upon him: "Does he who raises his head before the Imam not fear that Allah will transform his head into a donkey's head?" This, in terms of physical form, has never been and will never be. But in terms of meaning, it is occurring, for the donkey's head is not defined by its essence and shape, but by its characteristic, which is stupidity and foolishness. Whoever raises his head before the Imam has indeed made his head a donkey's head in the meaning of stupidity and foolishness, and that is the intended meaning, not the shape which is the mold of the meaning. For it is the height of foolishness to combine following with preceding, for they are contradictory.

One knows that this secret is contrary to the apparent meaning either by rational or scriptural evidence. As for the rational, it is when taking it literally is impossible, like His saying, peace be upon him: "The believer's heart is between two fingers of the fingers of the Most Merciful." For if we were to search the hearts of the believers, we would not find fingers within them. Thus, we know it is a metaphor for Power, which is the secret and hidden spirit of the fingers. Fingers were used as a metaphor for Power because that has a greater impact in understanding the completeness of Omnipotence. Of this kind in its metaphor for Omnipotence is His saying, exalted is He: "Our command for a thing, when We will it, is only that We say to it, 'Be,' and it is." For its apparent meaning is impossible, for His saying "Be"—if it is an address to the thing before its existence, it is absurd, as the non-existent cannot understand the address until it is given form. And if it is after existence, it is in no need of being brought into being. But since this metaphor has a greater impact upon souls in conveying the ultimate extent of Omnipotence, He turned to it.

As for what is apprehended by scripture, it is when applying the literal meaning is possible, but it is narrated that something other than the literal was intended, as has come in the interpretation of His saying, exalted is He: "He sends down from the sky rain, and the valleys flow according to their measure." That the meaning of 'water' here is the Quran, and the meaning of 'valleys' is the hearts, and that some of them bear much, some little, and some bear none. And the foam is like disbelief and hypocrisy, for even if it appears and floats atop the water, it does not remain, while the guidance that benefits people endures. In this category, a group delved deeply and interpreted what has come regarding the Hereafter—the Scale, the Bridge, and others—and this is an innovation, for that was not transmitted by way of narration, and applying the literal meaning to them is not impossible, so they must be applied literally.

The fourth category is when a person apprehends a thing in its totality, then apprehends it in detail through verification and direct experience, so that it becomes a state adhering to him. The two knowledges thus differ, the first being like the husk and the second like the kernel; the first like the apparent and the second like the inner reality. This is as when a person sees in his eye a figure in darkness or from a distance, and he attains a kind of knowledge of it. Then when he sees it up close or after the darkness has lifted, he perceives a distinction between them. The latter is not contrary to the former; rather, it is its completion. Likewise is knowledge, faith, and conviction. For a person may believe in the existence of passionate love, illness, and death before they occur, but his verification of them at the time of occurrence is more complete than his verification before occurrence. Indeed, a person regarding desire, passionate love, and all other states has three differing states and distinct perceptions: the first is his belief in its existence before its occurrence, the second at the time of its occurrence, and the third after his engagement with it. For your verification of hunger after its departure differs from verification before its departure. Likewise, some of the sciences of religion become a direct taste and are thus perfected, and that is like the inner reality in relation to what preceded it. So there is a difference between the knowledge of a sick person about health and the knowledge of a healthy person about it. In these four categories, creation varies, and in none of them is there an inner meaning that contradicts the apparent; rather, it completes and perfects it, just as the kernel perfects the husk. And peace.

The fifth category is when the tongue of speech expresses the tongue of the state. The one of limited understanding stops at the apparent and believes it to be literal speech, while the one insightful into realities perceives the secret within it. This is like the saying of the poet: "The wall said to the peg, 'Why do you split me?' It said, 'Ask the one who drives me, for he left me no stone behind me.'" This is an expression of the tongue of the state by the tongue of speech. And of this is His saying, exalted is He: "Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, 'Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion.' They said, 'We have come willingly.'" The dull-witted requires for his understanding to imagine for them life, intellect, and comprehension of the address, and an address that is a sound and letter which the heaven and earth hear, so they answer with a letter and sound and say, "We have come willingly." But the insightful knows that this is the tongue of the state, and that it is a report of their being subjugated by necessity and compelled to subjugation.

From this stems God's saying: "There is not a thing but celebrates His praise" (Quran 17:44). The dull-witted person is compelled in this to imagine for inanimate objects a life, an intellect, and speech with sound and letter, so that they might say 'Glory be to God' for their praise to be realized. But the insightful one knows that what is intended is not the speech of the tongue, but rather that its very being is praising through its existence, sanctifying through its essence, and bearing witness to the oneness of God, glorified be He, as it is said:

      And in everything there is a sign for Him
      Pointing to the fact that He is the One.

And as it is said: This masterful craftsmanship bears witness for its Maker to good management and perfect knowledge—not in the sense that it says, "I bear witness," through utterance, but through its essence and state. Likewise, there is not a thing except that it is, in its very self, in need of a Bringer-into-being who brings it into being, sustains it, perpetuates its attributes, and cycles it through its stages. Thus, through its need, it bears witness to its Creator with sanctification. Those endowed with insight perceive its testimony, not those rigidly attached to outward appearances. For this reason, God said: "But you do not understand their praise" (Quran 17:44). As for the deficient, they do not understand it at all; and as for those brought near and the firmly rooted scholars, they do not understand its reality and perfection, for everything has various testimonies to the sanctification and praise of God, glorified be He, and each person perceives according to the capacity of their intellect and insight. Enumerating those testimonies is not fitting for the science of practical devotion. This field, too, is one in which the masters of outward appearances and the masters of insight differ in their knowledge of it, and through it the disparity between the inward and the outward becomes apparent.

In this station, for the people of spiritual stations, there is both extravagance and moderation. One who is extravagant in elevating outward appearances ends up altering all or most outward appearances and proofs, to the point that they interpreted God's saying: "And their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness" (Quran 36:65), and His saying: "And they will say to their skins, 'Why have you testified against us?' They will say, 'We were made to speak by God, who has made everything speak'" (Quran 41:21), and likewise the dialogues that occur from Munkar and Nakir, and in the Balance, the Bridge, the Reckoning, and the disputations of the people of the Fire and the people of Paradise in their saying: "Pour upon us some water or from what God has provided you" (Quran 7:50)—they claimed that all of this is by the 'tongue of state.' Others, among them Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may God be pleased with him), went to extremes in sealing the door [of interpretation] until he prohibited the interpretation of His saying: "Be,' and it is" (Quran 16:40), and they claimed that this is an address with letter and sound that occurs from God in every moment according to the number of things coming into being. I even heard some of his companions say that he sealed the door of interpretation except for three phrases: his saying (upon him be peace): "The Black Stone is God's right hand on His earth," and his saying: "The heart of the believers is between two fingers of the fingers of the Merciful," and his saying: "I find the breath of the Merciful coming from the direction of Yemen." The masters of outward appearances and conjecture leaned towards sealing the door. It is my view concerning Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may God be pleased with him) that he knew that 'istawa' (establishment) is not settling, and 'nuzul' (descending) is not transference, but he prohibited interpretation to seal the door and to safeguard the well-being of the creation, for if the door were opened, the breach would widen, the matter would slip from control, and exceed the limit of moderation, since the limit of what exceeds moderation cannot be regulated. There is no harm in this deterrence, and the practice of the early generations bears witness to it, for they used to say: "Let them pass as they have come," until Malik (may God have mercy on him), when asked about 'istawa', said: "The 'istawa' is known, the modality is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and asking about it is an innovation."

A group adopted moderation and opened the door of interpretation for everything related to the attributes of God, glorified be He, but left what pertains to the Hereafter according to its outward meanings and prohibited interpretation therein—they are the Ash'arites. The Mu'tazilites went further than them, even interpreting among His attributes the [beatific] Vision, and interpreting His being Hearing, Seeing, and interpreting the Ascension, claiming it was not with the body, and interpreting the punishment of the grave, the Balance, the Bridge, and a host of rulings of the Hereafter, but they affirmed the resurrection of bodies, and Paradise and its comprising of foods, scents, spouses, and tangible pleasures, and the Fire and its comprising of a tangible body that burns by scorching skins and melting fats. Beyond their level, the philosophers increased, interpreting everything that has come regarding the Hereafter and reducing it to intellectual and spiritual pains and intellectual delights, and they denied the resurrection of bodies, saying the souls remain and they are either tormented or blessed with a torment and bliss not perceived by the senses. These are the extravagant ones.

The limit of moderation between all this dissolution and the rigidity of the Hanbalis is subtle and obscure, not disclosed except to those who are divinely aided, who perceive matters by a divine light, not by mere hearing. Then, when the secrets of matters are unveiled to them as they truly are, they look to the transmitted reports and the incoming texts: what conforms with what they have witnessed with the light of certitude they affirm, and what contradicts it they interpret. As for one who takes knowledge of these matters from mere transmitted reports alone, they find no firm footing in them.

He preceded, yet no specific station is designated for him; the most fitting position for one confined to mere hearing is that of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God have mercy upon him. Now, lifting the veil on the limits of moderation in these matters falls within the science of spiritual unveiling, and discourse on it is lengthy, so we shall not delve into it. The aim is to clarify the harmony between the inner and the outer, and that it does not contradict it. Indeed, through these five divisions, many matters have been unveiled. If we see fit to restrict all common folk to the translation of the creed we have refined, and that they are not tasked beyond that in the first degree—unless there is fear of confusion due to the prevalence of innovation, then they are elevated to the second degree to a creed containing flashes of evidence, concise without depth—then we shall present in this book those flashes and confine ourselves therein to what we have refined for the people of sanctity, naming it "The Sacred Epistle on the Foundations of Beliefs," which is deposited in this third chapter of the book. The third chapter of the book "Foundations of Beliefs" on the flashes of evidence for the creed we translated as "The Sacred." So we say: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God who distinguished the group of the Sunnah with the lights of certainty, favored the party of truth with guidance to the pillars of religion, shielded them from the deviation of the deviators and the misguidance of the atheists, enabled them to follow the example of the master of messengers, guided them to emulate the companionship of the most noble, and facilitated for them the tracing of the footsteps of the righteous predecessors, so that they held fast from the demands of intellects to the firm rope, and from the ways of the ancients and their beliefs to the clear path. Thus, they united in speech between the conclusions of intellects and the transmitted rulings of the Sacred Law, and realized that uttering what they are commanded to say—"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God"—has no benefit or yield unless comprehension is achieved of the poles and foundations upon which this testimony revolves. They knew that the two phrases of the testimony, despite their brevity, encompass affirming the essence of the Divine, affirming His attributes, affirming His actions, and affirming the truthfulness of the Messenger. They learned that faith is built upon these pillars, which are four, and each pillar revolves around ten principles. The first pillar is knowledge of the essence of God Almighty, and it revolves around ten principles: knowledge of the existence of God Almighty, His pre-eternity, His everlastingness, that He is not a substance, nor a body, nor an accident, that He, glorified be He, is not confined to a direction nor settled in a place, that He is seen, and that He is one. The second pillar is in His attributes and comprises ten principles: knowledge that He is living, knowing, powerful, willing, hearing, seeing, speaking, transcendent from the inherence of events, and that His speech, knowledge, and will are pre-eternal. The third pillar is in His actions Almighty, and it revolves around ten principles: that the actions of servants are created by God Almighty, that they are acquired by the servants, that they are willed by God Almighty, that He is gracious with creation and invention, that He Almighty imposes obligation of what is beyond capacity, that He inflicts pain on the innocent, that it is not incumbent upon Him to observe what is most beneficial, that nothing is obligatory except by the Sacred Law, that the sending of prophets is permissible, and that the prophethood of our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is established, supported by miracle. The fourth pillar is in the transmitted matters, and it revolves around ten principles: affirming the resurrection and gathering, the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, the punishment of the grave, the scale, the bridge, the creation of Paradise and Hell, the rulings of leadership, that the merit of the Companions is according to their order, and the conditions of leadership.

(As for the first pillar of the pillars of faith, which is knowledge of the essence of God, glorified and exalted be He, and that God Almighty is one, and it revolves around ten principles.)

The first principle: knowledge of His existence Almighty, and the first of the lights by which illumination is sought and the path of consideration that is guided to by the Quran is taken; there is no explanation after the explanation of God Almighty. He Almighty has said: "Have We not made the earth a resting place, and the mountains as stakes, and created you in pairs, and made your sleep for rest, and made the night as a covering, and made the day for livelihood, and built above you seven strong ones, and made a blazing lamp, and sent down from the rain-clouds pouring water to bring forth thereby grain and vegetation and gardens of thick growth?" And He Almighty said: "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what God has sent down from the sky of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every kind of moving creature, and the directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason." And He Almighty said: "Do you not see how God created seven heavens in layers and made the moon therein a light and made the sun a lamp? And God caused you to grow from the earth a growth, then He will return you into it and extract you an extraction." And He Almighty said: "Then do you see that which you emit? Is it you who creates it, or are We the Creator?"

To the point where it is said to the deniers: It is not hidden from anyone possessing the slightest grain of intellect, if he contemplates with the most minimal thought the meaning of these verses and directs his gaze upon the wonders of God's creation in the heavens and the earth, and the marvels of the innate nature of animals and plants, that this astonishing affair and this precise order cannot do without a Maker who manages it, an Agent who governs and determines it. Rather, the very innate disposition of souls almost testifies to being compelled under His subjugation and directed according to the requirement of His management. Therefore, God Almighty said: "Is there any doubt about God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth?" (Qur'an 14:10). And for this reason, He sent the prophets, God's blessings be upon them, to call creation to monotheism, so that they would say, "There is no god but God." They were not commanded to say, "We have a god, and the world has a god," for that was already ingrained in the innate disposition of their intellects from the beginning of their formation and in the prime of their youth. Therefore, the Almighty said: "And if you ask them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' they will surely say, 'God.'" (Qur'an 31:25). And He said: "So set your face to the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the innate nature upon which God has created [all] people. There is no altering the creation of God. That is the upright religion." (Qur'an 30:30). Thus, in the innate nature of man and the evidences of the Qur'an, there is that which suffices without establishing a formal proof. However, for the sake of thoroughness and following the example of the speculative scholars, we say: Among the self-evident truths of the intellect is that a contingent being cannot, in its coming into existence, do without a cause that brings it into being. The world is contingent; therefore, it cannot, in its coming into existence, do without a cause. As for our statement that a contingent being cannot do without a cause for its occurrence, this is evident, for every contingent being is specific to a time, and it is rationally possible to conceive of its being earlier or later. Its specification to that time, rather than what preceded or followed it, necessarily requires a Specifier. As for our statement that the world is contingent, its proof is that the bodies of the world are not devoid of motion and rest, and both are contingent. That which is not devoid of contingent events is itself contingent. In this proof are three claims. The first is our statement that bodies are not devoid of motion and rest. This is perceived by immediate necessity and does not require contemplation or thought, for whoever conceives of a body that is neither at rest nor in motion has mounted the steed of ignorance and deviated from the path of intellect. The second is our statement that they (motion and rest) are contingent. This is indicated by their alternation and the existence of one after the other, which is observed in all bodies, both seen and unseen. For there is no body at rest but that the intellect judges the possibility of its motion, and no body in motion but that the intellect judges the possibility of its rest. The one that occurs is contingent due to its occurrence, and the preceding one is contingent due to its cessation, for if its pre-eternity were established, its cessation would be impossible, as will be explained and proven in establishing the permanence of the Maker, exalted and sanctified is He. The third is our statement: That which is not devoid of contingent events is contingent. Its proof is that if it were not so, then before every contingent event there would be contingent events having no beginning. If those events did not cease in their entirety, the turn for the existence of the present contingent event in the current moment would never be reached. The termination of that which has no end is impossible. And because if the celestial sphere had rotations without end, their number would not be free from being either even, or odd, or both even and odd, or neither even nor odd. It is impossible for it to be both even and odd, or neither even nor odd, for that combines affirmation and negation, since affirming one negates the other and negating one affirms the other. It is impossible for it to be even, because an even number becomes odd by the addition of one. How could that which is infinite lack a single one? It is impossible for it to be odd, because an odd number becomes even by the addition of one. How could it lack a single one when its numbers are infinite? It is impossible for it to be neither even nor odd, for then it would have an end. It is thus established from this that the world is not devoid of contingent events, and that which is not devoid of contingent events is therefore contingent. Once its contingency is established, its need for a cause that brings it into being is among the things necessarily perceived.

The Second Foundation: The knowledge that God, exalted is He, is pre-eternal, without beginning, eternal, having no first for His existence. Rather, He is the First of everything and before every dead and living thing. Its proof is that if He were contingent and not pre-eternal, He too would need a cause, and His cause would need a cause, and that would regress infinitely. What regresses infinitely cannot be realized, or it must end at a pre-eternal cause who is the First. That is the required One whom we have named the Maker of the world, its Originator, its Creator, its Bringer-into-being, and its Inventor.

The Third Foundation: The knowledge that He, exalted is He, along with being eternal without beginning, is also everlasting without end; there is no last for His existence. He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. For what has pre-eternity established for it, its non-existence is impossible. Its proof is that if He were to cease to exist, it would either be by Himself or by an annihilator that opposes Him. If it were possible for something whose permanence is conceivable to cease to exist by itself, then it would be possible for something whose non-existence is conceivable to come into existence by itself. Just as the occurrence of existence requires a cause, so too does the occurrence of non-existence require a cause. It is false that He would cease to exist by an annihilator that opposes Him, because that annihilator...

If He were eternal, existence could not be conceived alongside Him, yet the two preceding principles have established His existence and eternity. How then could His existence in pre-eternity coexist with its opposite? For if the opposite—non-existence—were originated, it would be impossible, since the originated cannot oppose the Eternal in such a way as to terminate His existence any more than the Eternal can oppose the originated to repel its existence—indeed, repulsion is easier than termination, and the Eternal is stronger and more entitled than the originated.

The Fourth Principle: Knowing that He, exalted is He, is not a substance occupying space; rather, He is transcendent and sanctified above any relation to spatial location. The proof is that every substance occupying space is confined to its location and cannot be devoid of either rest within it or motion away from it; thus it cannot be free from motion or rest, both of which are originated. Whatever cannot be free from originated phenomena is itself originated. If one were to imagine an eternal substance occupying space, it would imply the eternity of the world’s substances. If someone calls Him a substance without meaning spatial occupation, he errs in terminology, not in meaning.

The Fifth Principle: Knowing that He, exalted is He, is not a body composed of substances, for “body” denotes what is composed of substances. Since His being a substance confined to space is refuted, His being a body is likewise refuted, because every body is confined to space and composed of substances. A substance cannot be free from separation, combination, motion, rest, state, and magnitude—all marks of origination. If it were permissible to believe that the Maker of the world is a body, it would be permissible to attribute divinity to the sun, the moon, or any other kind of body. Should anyone dare to call Him, exalted is He, a body without intending composition from substances, that would be an error in name while correctly negating the meaning of body.

The Sixth Principle: Knowing that He, exalted is He, is not an accident subsisting in a body or a state in a substrate, for an accident is what inheres in a body. Every body is inevitably originated, and its originator must exist prior to it. How then could He be a state in a body when He existed alone in pre-eternity, with nothing else beside Him, and then originated bodies and accidents afterward? Moreover, He is Knowing, Powerful, Willing, Creator—as will be explained—and these attributes are impossible for accidents; indeed, they are only conceivable for an existent self-subsistent and independent in His essence. From these principles, it is established that He is an existent self-subsistent, not a substance, nor a body, nor an accident, and that the entire world consists of substances, accidents, and bodies. Thus, He resembles nothing, and nothing resembles Him. Rather, He is the Living, the Self-Subsisting, than Whom there is nothing like. How could the created resemble its Creator, the effect its Cause, the fashioned its Fashioner? Bodies and accidents are all from His creation and making, so it is impossible to judge Him by similarity or likeness.

The Seventh Principle: Knowing that God, exalted is He, is transcendent in Essence above being specified by directions, for direction is either above, below, right, left, front, or behind. These directions are His creation, brought into being through the creation of man, for He created for him two ends: one that rests on the earth, called the foot, and the opposite, called the head. Thus, the term “above” arose for what is toward the head, and “below” for what is toward the foot—so much so that an ant crawling inverted under a ceiling reverses the direction of “above” in its regard to “below,” though it is above in our regard. He created for man two hands, one generally stronger than the other, so the term “right” arose for the stronger and “left” for its opposite, and the direction toward the right is called right, the other left. He created for him two sides from one of which he sees and moves, so the term “front” arose for the direction he advances toward by movement, and “behind” for its opposite. Thus, directions are originated with the origination of man. Had man not been created with this form but created spherical like a ball, these directions would have no existence at all. How then could He in pre-eternity be specified by a direction when direction is originated? How could He become specified by a direction after not being so? That He created the world above Him is impossible, for He is exalted above having an “above,” since He is transcendent above having a head—and “above” denotes what is toward the head. Or that He created the world beneath Him is impossible, for He is exalted above having a “below,” since He is transcendent above having a foot—and “below” denotes what is toward the foot. All this is rationally impossible. Moreover, what is understood by His being specified by a direction is that He is confined to a space as substances are, or related to substances as accidents are. Since His being a substance or an accident has been shown impossible, His being specified by direction is impossible. If by “direction” something other than these two meanings is intended, it is an error in terminology while agreeing in meaning. Furthermore, if He were above the world, He would be adjacent to it, and whatever is adjacent to a body is either equal to it, smaller, or larger—all of which necessitate a measurer, and the One Creator, the Manager, is transcendent above that. As for raising hands in supplication toward the sky, it is because it is the direction of prayer, and therein lies a wisdom.

Also an allusion to what describes the Called One in terms of majesty and grandeur, indicating by the intention of the direction of loftiness the attribute of glory and exaltation, for He is above every existent through overpowering and dominion.

The Eighth Principle: Knowledge that He is established upon His Throne in the manner that God intended by establishment, which does not contradict the attribute of grandeur nor is it susceptible to traits of origination and annihilation. This is what is intended by the establishment to the heaven, as He said in the Qur’an, "Then He established Himself to the heaven, and it was smoke," and that is only through the way of overpowering and dominion, as the poet said:
      Mankind has established over Iraq
      Without a sword and without bloodshed.
The people of truth were compelled to this interpretation, just as the people of esotericism were compelled to interpret His saying, "And He is with you wherever you are," since it is unanimously understood as encompassing and knowledge; and to interpret His saying, "The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the Merciful," as power and strength; and to interpret His saying, "The Black Stone is God’s right hand on His earth," as honor and veneration. For if taken literally, it would entail impossibility; likewise, if establishment were taken as settling and taking position, it would entail that the one positioned is a body touching the Throne, either equal to it, larger, or smaller, and that is impossible, and what leads to impossibility is impossible.

The Ninth Principle: Knowledge that He, while being exalted from form and magnitude, sanctified from directions and dimensions, is visible to the eyes and sights in the Hereafter, the abode of permanence, due to His saying, "Faces that Day will be radiant, looking at their Lord." And He is not seen in this world, confirming His saying, "Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives vision," and His saying in addressing Moses, peace be upon him, "You will not see Me." I wonder how the isolated one knew from the attributes of the Lord of lords what Moses, peace be upon him, was ignorant of, and how Moses, peace be upon him, asked for vision while it is impossible. Perhaps ignorance is more fitting for the innovators and the misguided among the ignorant fools than for the prophets, prayers of God be upon them. As for the aspect of applying the verse of vision according to its apparent meaning, it is that it does not lead to impossibility, for vision is a type of unveiling and knowledge, except that it is more complete and clearer than knowledge. So if it is permissible for knowledge to relate to Him without being in a direction, then it is permissible for vision to relate to Him without a direction. And just as it is permissible for God to see creation without being opposite them, it is permissible for creation to see Him without opposition. And as it is permissible to know without modality and form, it is permissible to see likewise.

The Tenth Principle: Knowledge that God is one, without partner, singular without equal, unique in creation and origination, relying on bringing into existence and invention. He has no like to share with Him or equal Him, nor any adversary to contend with or oppose Him. Its proof is His saying, "If there were in them gods other than God, they would have been ruined." Its explanation is that if there were two, and one of them willed a matter, the second—if compelled to assist him—would be overpowered and incapable, and not a capable god; and if capable of opposing and resisting him, the second would be strong and overpowering, and the first weak and deficient, and not a capable god.

(The Second Pillar: Knowledge of the attributes of God, revolving around ten principles)
The First Principle: Knowledge that the Maker of the world is powerful, and that He is truthful in His saying, "And He is over all things competent," because the world is precise in its making, ordered in its creation. Whoever sees a garment of brocade, excellent in weaving and composition, harmonious in embroidery and edging, then imagines its weaving issued from a dead without ability or from a human without power, has departed from the instinct of intellect and joined the ranks of the foolish and ignorant.

The Second Principle: Knowledge that He is knowing of all existents and encompassing every creature; not an atom's weight in the earth or the heaven escapes His knowledge, truthful in His saying, "And He is of all things Knowing." And guiding to its truth by His saying, "Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?" He guides you to infer from creation to knowledge, for you do not doubt the indication of subtle creation and adorned craftsmanship, even in something insignificant and weak, of the maker’s knowledge of the manner of arrangement and composition. So what God has mentioned is the utmost in guidance and definition.

The Third Principle: Knowledge of His being alive, for whoever’s knowledge and power are established, His life is established by necessity. If one could conceive of a powerful, knowing, acting, managing being without being alive, it would be possible to doubt the life of animals in their movements and stillness, even the life of masters of crafts and industries, and that is immersion in the depths of ignorance and misguidance.

The Fourth Principle: Knowledge that He is willing in His actions, so no existent is except that it is dependent upon...

His will emanates from His intention, thus He is the Originator, the Restorer, the Doer of what He wills. How could He not be willing when every act issuing from Him could have issued its opposite, and what has no opposite could have issued precisely that, before or after? Power relates to two opposites and two moments with a single relation, necessitating a directing will that channels power to one of the two possibilities. If knowledge sufficed without will in specifying the known, such that it could be said it occurred at the time predetermined by its existence, then it would equally suffice without power, such that it could be said it occurred without power, because knowledge of its existence therein preceded.

The Fifth Principle: Knowing that He, exalted, is Hearing, Seeing; not hidden from His sight are the whispers of the conscience, the hidden recesses of fancy and thought; nor escapes His hearing the sound of the creeping of a black ant on a solid rock in a dark night. How could He not be Hearing and Seeing when hearing and sight are undeniably perfections, not deficiencies? How then could the created be more perfect than the Creator, or the artifact finer and more complete than the Artisan? How could the division be equitable when deficiency occurs on His side and perfection in His creation and craft? Or how could the argument of Abraham, peace be upon him, against his father stand firm when he worshipped idols out of ignorance and error, and he said to him, “Why do you worship what neither hears nor sees, nor avails you anything?” If that were reversed against him regarding his object of worship, his argument would become invalid and his proof collapsed, and the word of God, exalted, would not be true: “That was Our argument which We gave Abraham against his people.” And just as one comprehends His being an Agent without limbs, and Knowing without heart or brain, let him comprehend His being Seeing without pupil and Hearing without ear, for there is no difference between them.

The Sixth Principle: That He, glorified and exalted, is Speaking with speech, an attribute subsisting in His essence, not a sound nor a letter; indeed, His speech does not resemble the speech of others, just as His existence does not resemble the existence of others. Speech in reality is the speech of the soul; sounds are merely letters divided to convey meanings, as they are sometimes conveyed by movements and gestures. How has this confused a group of the foolish, yet not confused ignorant poets, as one of them said:
      Indeed, speech resides in the heart, and the tongue is but made a guide to the heart.
Whoever does not comprehend this with his intellect, nor is restrained by restraint from saying, “My tongue is originated, but what occurs in it by my originated power is eternal,” then cut off hope from his intellect and withhold your tongue from addressing him. And whoever does not understand that “eternal” denotes what has nothing before it, and that the ‘bā’ precedes the ‘sīn’ in saying “bismillāh,” so the ‘sīn’ following the ‘bā’ cannot be eternal, then purify your heart from turning attention to him. For God, glorified, has a secret in distancing some servants, and whom God leads astray, for him there is no guide. Whoever finds it remote that Moses, peace be upon him, heard in this world a speech that is not sound nor letter, let him find it strange to see in the Hereafter an existent that is not body nor color. If he comprehends seeing what has no color, body, dimension, nor quantity—and he has not yet seen other than it—let him comprehend in the sense of hearing what he comprehended in the sense of sight. And if he comprehends that He has one knowledge that is knowledge of all existents, let him comprehend one attribute of the essence that is speech encompassing all that is indicated by expressions. And if he comprehends the existence of the seven heavens and the existence of Paradise and Hell written on a small leaf and preserved in the measure of an atom of the heart, and all that visible in the measure of a lens of the pupil, without the essence of the heavens, earth, Paradise, and Hell residing in the pupil, heart, or leaf, then let him comprehend the existence of speech recited by tongues, preserved in hearts, written in codices, without the essence of speech residing therein. For if the essence of speech resided in the paper by writing the Book of God, then the essence of God, exalted, would reside by writing His name on paper, and the essence of Hell would reside by writing its name on paper, and it would burn.

The Seventh Principle: That the speech subsisting in Himself is eternal, as are all His attributes, for it is impossible that He be a locus for originated entities or subject to change. Rather, the attributes necessarily possess the descriptions of eternity as the essence does; changes do not affect them, nor do originated entities reside in Him. Rather, He has always, in His eternity, been described with praiseworthy attributes, and will remain in His perpetuity thus, exalted above change of states. For what is a locus for originated entities is not free from them, and what is not free from originated entities is originated. The description of origination is established for bodies only due to their exposure to change and fluctuation of attributes; how then could their Creator share with them in accepting change? Built upon this is that His speech is eternal, subsisting in His essence; what is originated are the sounds that indicate it. And just as one comprehends the subsistence of the desire for learning and the will in the essence of a parent for a child before creating the child, so that when the child is created and attains understanding, and God creates for him knowledge pertaining to what is in the father’s heart of desire, he becomes commanded.

By that quest which arose in the essence of his father and whose existence persisted until the time his son came to know him, let one comprehend the arising of the quest indicated by His words, exalted is He, "Take off your sandals" (20:12) in the essence of God, and the destination of Moses, peace be upon him, being addressed by it after its existence, when knowledge of that quest was created for him and he heard that ancient discourse.

The Eighth Principle: That His knowledge is eternal, so He has never ceased to be knowing of His essence, His attributes, and what He originates of His creations. Whenever creations occur, no knowledge of them occurs to Him; rather, they become unveiled to Him through the eternal knowledge. For if knowledge were created for us of Zayd's arrival at sunrise, and that knowledge were decreed to persist until the sun rose, then Zayd's arrival at sunrise would be known to us through that knowledge without another knowledge newly occurring. Thus should the eternity of God's knowledge, exalted is He, be understood.

The Ninth Principle: That His will is eternal, and in eternity it pertained to the origination of events at their appropriate times, in accordance with the precedence of eternal knowledge. For if it were originated, it would become a locus for originated things. And if it occurred other than in His essence, He would not be willing it, just as you are not moving by a movement not in your essence. However one conceives it, the occurrence of a will would require another will, and that other will would require yet another, and the matter would regress infinitely. If it were permissible for a will to occur without a will, it would be permissible for the world to occur without a will.

The Tenth Principle: That God, exalted is He, is knowing with a knowledge, living with a life, powerful with a power, willing with a will, speaking with a speech, hearing with a hearing, and seeing with a sight. He possesses these descriptions from these eternal attributes. The statement of one who says "knowing without knowledge" is like saying "rich without wealth," "knowledge without a knower," or "knower without a known." For knowledge, the known, and the knower are concomitant, like killing, the killed, and the killer. Just as it is inconceivable to have a killer without killing or a killed, nor a killed without a killer or killing, so too it is inconceivable to have a knower without knowledge, knowledge without a known, or a known without a knower. Rather, these three are concomitant in the intellect; one does not separate from the others. Whoever allows the separation of the knower from knowledge, let him allow its separation from the known and the separation of knowledge from the knower, for there is no distinction between these descriptions.

(The Third Pillar: Knowledge of the Acts of God, Exalted is He, and it revolves around ten principles)

The First Principle: Knowledge that every originated thing in the world is His act, His creation, and His invention. There is no creator for it other than Him and no originator for it except Him. He created creation, fashioned them, brought their power into existence, and their movement. Thus, all the acts of His servants are created by Him and pertain to His power, confirming Him in His saying, exalted is He, "God is the Creator of all things" (39:62), and in His saying, "And God created you and what you do" (37:96), and in His saying, "Whether you conceal your speech or proclaim it, indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts" (67:13). Does He not know, He who created? And He is the Subtle, the Acquainted (67:14). He commands the servants to be cautious in their statements, their acts, their secrets, and their hidden thoughts due to His knowledge of the sources of their acts. And He evidences knowledge through creation. How could He not be the creator of the servant's act when His power is complete, without deficiency, and it pertains to the movement of the servants' bodies? The movements are alike, and the power's pertaining to them is due to their essence. So what prevents its pertaining from some movements and not others when they are alike? Or how could the animal be independent in invention when from the spider, the bee, and all other animals issue delicate crafts at which the minds of those of understanding are bewildered? How then are they alone in inventing them, apart from the Lord of lords, while they are not knowing of the details of what issues from them of acquisition? Far, far is it! The creations are humbled, and He is alone in sovereignty and dominion, the Compeller of the earth and the heavens.

The Second Principle: That God's, glorified is He, exclusive invention of the servants' movements does not remove them from being within the power of the servants by way of acquisition. Rather, God, exalted is He, created both the power and the object of power, and He created both the choice and the chosen. As for the power, it is a description of the servant and a creation of the Lord, glorified is He; it is not an acquisition for him. As for the movement, it is a creation of the Lord, exalted is He, and a description of the servant and an acquisition for him. For it was created as an object of power by a power which is his description, and the movement had a relation to another attribute called power, so it is termed an acquisition by consideration of that relation. How could it be pure compulsion when one necessarily perceives the distinction between the voluntary movement and the involuntary tremor? Or how could it be the servant's creation when he does not encompass knowledge of the details of the parts of acquired movements and their numbers? When both extremes are invalidated, nothing remains but moderation in belief, which is that they are objects of power by the power of God, exalted is He, through invention, and by the power of the servant in another manner of relation expressed as acquisition. It is not a necessity of the power's relation to its object that it be only through invention, for the power of God, exalted is He, in pre-eternity was related to the world while it was not.

Creation occurs through it, and it, at the moment of creation, is connected to it in another manner of connection, making it evident that the attachment of divine power is not restricted to the occurrence of the object of power through it.

The Third Principle: That the action of the servant, even if it is an acquisition by the servant, does not escape being willed by God, exalted be He. Thus, not a blink of an eye, nor a turn of thought, nor a stray glance occurs in the dominion of the visible and unseen realms except by the decree and power of God, and by His will and volition. From Him comes evil and good, benefit and harm, Islam and disbelief, recognition and denial, success and loss, misguidance and right guidance, obedience and disobedience, polytheism and faith. There is none to repel His decree and none to revise His judgment. He leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. This is indicated by transmitted evidence in the unanimous saying of the community: "What He wills, is; and what He does not will, is not," and in the words of God, Mighty and Majestic: "Had God willed, He would have guided all mankind," and His saying, exalted be He: "Had We willed, We could have given every soul its guidance." It is indicated by rational evidence that sins and crimes, if God dislikes them and does not will them, yet they occur in accordance with the will of the enemy, Iblis—may God curse him—even though he is an enemy to God, exalted be He, and what occurs according to the will of the enemy is more than what occurs according to His will, exalted be He. I wonder how a Muslim can dare to reduce the dominion of the Compeller, the Possessor of Majesty and Honor, to a rank which, if the leadership of a village chief were reduced to it, he would disdain it. For if what continues for the enemy of the chief in the village were more than what is established for him, he would disdain his leadership and absolve himself of his authority. Disobedience is what predominates over creation, and all of that, according to the innovators, occurs contrary to the will of the Truth, exalted be He. This is the ultimate weakness and incapacity—exalted is the Lord of lords far above what the wrongdoers say, supremely exalted. Then, once it becomes clear that the actions of servants are created by God, it is correct that they are willed by Him. If it is said: "How then does He forbid what He wills and command what He does not will?" We say: Command is not the same as will. This is illustrated when a master strikes his servant and the ruler reproaches him for it. He excuses himself by his servant's rebellion against him, but the ruler disbelieves him. He then wishes to manifest his proof by commanding the servant to do an act and the servant disobeys him in the presence of the ruler. So he says to him: "Saddle this mount," in the sight of the ruler. Thus, he commands him to do what he does not want him to obey. Had he not been a commander, his excuse before the ruler would not have been established; and had he willed his obedience, he would have willed his own destruction, which is impossible.

The Fourth Principle: That God, exalted be He, is gracious through creation and invention, and He is bountiful by imposing obligations upon the servants. Creation and imposition of obligation were not incumbent upon Him. The Mu'tazilites said it became incumbent upon Him due to the benefit therein for the servants, but this is impossible, for He is the One who imposes obligation, commands, and forbids. How could He be subject to being obligated or exposed to necessity and address? What is meant by "obligatory" is one of two things: either an action whose omission entails harm, either delayed—as it is said: "It is obligatory upon the servant to obey God so that He does not punish him in the Hereafter with the Fire"—or immediate harm—as it is said: "It is obligatory upon the thirsty one to drink so that he does not die"; or it is meant that whose absence leads to an impossibility—as it is said: "The existence of the known is obligatory," for its absence leads to an impossibility, which is that knowledge becomes ignorance. If the opponent intends by "creation is obligatory upon God" the first meaning, then he has exposed Him to harm. If he intends the second meaning, then it is conceded, for after the precedence of knowledge, the existence of the known is necessary. If he intends a third meaning, it is incomprehensible. His statement "It is obligatory for the benefit of His servants" is corrupt speech, for if He is not harmed by neglecting the benefit of the servants, then obligation has no meaning in His regard. Moreover, the benefit of the servants lies in Him creating them in Paradise. As for creating them in the abode of trials, exposing them to sins, then targeting them for the peril of punishment and the terror of the presentation and the reckoning—there is no bliss in that for those of understanding.

The Fifth Principle: It is permissible for God, exalted be He, to obligate the creation with what they have no capacity for, contrary to the Mu'tazilites. Were this not permissible, then asking for its removal would be impossible, yet they have asked for it, saying: "Our Lord, do not impose upon us that which we have no capacity to bear." And because God, exalted be He, informed His Prophet ﷺ that Abu Jahl would not believe him, then commanded him to command him to believe him in all his statements—and among his statements was that he would not believe him—so how could he believe him in that he does not believe him? Is this not an impossibility in existence?

The Sixth Principle: That God, Mighty and Majestic, has the right to inflict pain upon creation and punish them without a prior offense and without a subsequent reward, contrary to the Mu'tazilites, because He disposes freely in His dominion, and it is inconceivable that His disposal oversteps His dominion. Injustice is an expression for disposing in the property of another without his permission, and that is impossible for God, exalted be He, for He does not encounter property belonging to another such that His disposal in it would be injustice. The permissibility of this is indicated by its existence, for the slaughter of animals is inflicting pain upon them, and the various types of torment poured upon them from the side of human beings did not...

If it is preceded by a sin, then if it is said that God, exalted is He, will resurrect it and recompense it according to the measure of the pain it has endured, and this is incumbent upon God, glorified and sublime—this is the statement of one who claims it is incumbent upon God to resurrect every ant that was trodden upon and every louse that was crushed so that He may reward them for their pains. Such a one has departed from both religious law and reason. For it is said: describing reward and resurrection as being incumbent upon Him—if what is meant by 'incumbent' is that He would be harmed by omitting it, that is impossible. If something else is intended, it has already been stated that it is not understood, as it departs from the meanings mentioned for 'incumbent'.

The Seventh Principle: That He, exalted is He, does with His servants as He wills. It is not incumbent upon Him to observe what is most beneficial for His servants, due to what we have mentioned: that nothing is incumbent upon Him, glorified and sublime. Indeed, 'incumbency' is inconceivable in relation to Him, for He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. I wonder with what the Mu'tazilite would answer in his statement that what is most beneficial is incumbent upon Him, regarding a question we pose to him: namely, to suppose a disputation in the Hereafter between a child and an adult, both of whom died as Muslims. For God, glorified and sublime, will increase the degrees of the adult and favor him over the child because he toiled in faith and obedience after reaching maturity, and this is incumbent upon Him according to the Mu'tazilite. So if the child were to say, "O Lord, why have You elevated his station above mine?" He would say, "Because he reached maturity and strove in acts of obedience." And the child would say, "You caused me to die in childhood, so it was incumbent upon You to prolong my life until I reached maturity so that I might strive." Thus, You have deviated from justice in favoring him with a long life and not me. So why have You favored him? God, exalted is He, would say, "Because I knew that if you had reached maturity, you would have associated partners with Me or disobeyed, so what was most beneficial for you was to die in childhood." This is the Mu'tazilite's excuse for God, mighty and majestic. At this point, the disbelievers would call out from the depths of the blazing Fire and say, "O Lord, did You not know that if we had reached maturity we would have associated partners? Why did You not cause us to die in childhood? For we would have been content with a station lower than that of the Muslim child." With what can this be answered? Does this not necessitate, in this case, only the decisive conclusion that divine matters are exalted, by the judgment of His Majesty, from being weighed on the scale of the people of the Mu'tazila? If it is said: whenever He has the power to observe what is most beneficial for His servants and then subjects them to causes of punishment, that would be ugliness unbefitting wisdom. We say: ugliness is that which does not accord with a purpose, such that a thing may be ugly to one person and beautiful to another if it accords with the purpose of one and not the other. Thus, the killing of a person is deemed ugly by his allies and deemed good by his enemies. If by 'ugly' is meant what does not accord with the purpose of the Creator, glorified is He, that is impossible, for He has no purpose. Therefore, ugliness cannot be conceived from Him, just as injustice cannot be conceived from Him, for He cannot be conceived of as disposing of another's property. If by 'ugly' is meant what does not accord with the purpose of another, then why do you say that this is impossible for Him? Is this not merely arbitrary desire, contradicted by what we have already supposed regarding the disputation of the people of the Fire? Then, 'the Wise' means the One who knows the realities of things, capable of perfecting His action in accordance with His will. From where does this necessitate observing what is most beneficial? As for the wise among us, he observes what is most beneficial with regard to himself, to gain praise in this world and reward in the Hereafter, or to ward off harm from himself. All of that is impossible for God, glorified and sublime.

The Eighth Principle: That knowledge of God, glorified is He, and obedience to Him are obligatory by the ordainment and legislation of God, exalted is He, not by reason—contrary to the Mu'tazila. For even if reason were to impose the obligation of obedience, it cannot but do so either for no benefit—which is impossible, as reason does not impose futility—or for a benefit and purpose. That cannot but revert either to the One worshipped—and that is impossible in relation to Him, exalted is He, for He is sanctified above purposes and benefits; indeed, disbelief and faith, obedience and disobedience are equal in His sight, exalted is He—or revert to an incidental matter for the servant. That is also impossible, for he has no purpose in the immediate state; rather, he wearies himself with it and turns away from desires because of it. And in the ultimate end, there is only reward and punishment. From where does one know that God, exalted is He, rewards for disobedience and obedience and does not punish for them, when obedience and disobedience are equal in His sight, for He has no inclination toward one nor a particular connection to either? The distinction of that is known only through the revealed law. Indeed, he who takes this from an analogy between the Creator and the creature has erred, where he distinguishes between gratitude and ingratitude due to the pleasure, delight, and enjoyment he finds in one and not the other. If it is said: if reflection and knowledge are not obligatory except by the revealed law, and the revealed law is not established unless the legally responsible person reflects upon it, then if the legally responsible person says to the Prophet, "Reason does not oblige me to reflect, and the revealed law is not established for me except through reflection, and I will not proceed to reflect," this would lead to silencing the Messenger. We say: this resembles the statement of one who says to a person standing in a place, "Behind you is a ferocious lion. If you do not leave the spot, it will kill you. If you turn behind you and look, you will know my truthfulness." The standing person says, "Your truthfulness is not established unless..."

I looked behind me, and I did not look behind me, nor do I look at what has not proven your truthfulness. This indicates the foolishness of this speaker and his aiming for perdition, and it causes no harm to the guiding mentor. Similarly, the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: "Behind you is death, and before it are ravenous beasts and burning fires. If you do not take caution from them and recognize my truthfulness by turning to my miracle, you will perish." So, whoever turns back recognizes, takes precaution, and is saved. And whoever does not turn back and persists perishes and is ruined. There is no harm upon me if all people perish entirely. My duty is only the clear proclamation. The Sacred Law makes known the existence of ravenous beasts after death, and the intellect provides understanding of his speech and comprehension of the possibility of what he may say in the future, and innate disposition urges caution from harm. The meaning of something being obligatory is that in its abandonment there is harm, and the meaning of the Sacred Law being prescriptive is that it makes known the anticipated harm. For the intellect does not guide to aiming for harm after death when following base desires. This is the meaning of the Sacred Law and the intellect and their effect in determining obligation. Were it not for the fear of punishment for abandoning what He has commanded, obligation would not be established, for the meaning of the obligatory is only that which, if abandoned, is linked to harm in the Hereafter.

The Ninth Principle: It is not impossible to send the prophets (peace be upon them), contrary to the Brahmins who said there is no benefit in their being sent, for the intellect suffices instead of them. This is because the intellect does not guide to the acts that bring salvation in the Hereafter, just as it does not guide to the medicines beneficial for health. The need of creation for the prophets is like their need for physicians. However, the truthfulness of a physician is known by experience, and the truthfulness of a prophet is known by miracle.

The Tenth Principle: That God, glorified be He, sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the seal of the prophets and as abrogator of what came before him from the laws of the Jews, Christians, and Sabians, and supported him with manifest miracles and stunning signs, such as the splitting of the moon, the glorification of the pebbles, the speech of the inanimate, and the water that gushed forth from between his fingers. Among his clear signs with which he challenged all the Arabs is the Magnificent Qur'an. For they, despite being distinguished by eloquence and rhetoric, aimed to insult him, forbid him, kill him, and expel him, as God, mighty and majestic, informed about them, yet they were incapable of opposing it with the like of the Qur'an, as it was not within human power to combine the majesty of the Qur'an and its composition, along with what it contains of news of the ancients, despite him being unlettered, unpracticed in books, and its informing of the unseen in matters wherein his truthfulness was realized subsequently, such as His saying, exalted be He: "You will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, if God wills, in safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] shortened," and such as His saying: "Alif, Lam, Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome within a few years." The aspect of the miracle's indication of the truthfulness of the messengers is that everything humans are incapable of can only be an act of God, exalted be He. Whenever it is coupled with the challenge of the Prophet (peace be upon him), it takes the place of His saying, "You have spoken truthfully." This is like one who claims before a king, asserting to his subjects that he is the king's messenger to them. If he then says to him, "If you are truthful, then stand upon your throne three times and sit contrary to your custom," and the king does that, it produces necessary knowledge for those present that this takes the place of his saying, "You have spoken truthfully."

(The Fourth Pillar: Concerning the Transmitted Matters and Believing Him (peace be upon him) in what he informed about, and it revolves around ten principles.)

The First Principle: The Gathering and the Resurrection. The Sacred Law has come with both, and it is truth, and believing in them is obligatory because it is possible for the intellect. Its meaning is restoration after annihilation, and that is within the power of God, exalted be He, like the initial creation. God, exalted be He, says: "He says, 'Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?' Say, 'He will give them life who produced them the first time.'" Thus, He argues by the initial creation for the restoration. And He, mighty and majestic, says: "Your creation and your resurrection are not but like that of a single soul." And restoration is a second beginning, so it is possible like the first beginning.

The Second Principle: The questioning by Munkar and Nakeer. Reports have come concerning it, so believing in it is obligatory because it is possible, as it only requires restoring life to a part of the parts by which the address is understood, and that is possible in itself. What is observed of the stillness of the parts of the deceased and our not hearing the questioning of him does not negate that, for the sleeper is still in his outward state, yet perceives in his inward state pains and pleasures whose effect he feels upon awakening. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) used to hear the speech of Gabriel (peace be upon him) and see him, while those around him did not hear him nor see him, nor did they encompass anything of his knowledge except what He willed. So if He did not create for them hearing and sight, they would not perceive him.

The Third Principle: The punishment of the grave. The Sacred Law has come with it. God, exalted be He, says: "The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening. And the Day the Hour appears [it will be said], 'Make the people of Pharaoh enter the severest punishment.'"

And it is well-known from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the righteous predecessors, seeking refuge from the punishment of the grave, and it is possible, so belief in it is obligatory. Belief in it is not negated by the dispersal of the deceased's parts in the bellies of beasts and the crops of birds, for the faculty that perceives the pain of punishment in an animal are specific parts, and God, Exalted is He, is capable of restoring perception to them.

The Fourth Principle: The Scale, and it is true. God, Exalted is He, said: "And We shall set up the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection..." (Qur'an, Al-Anbiya' 21:47). And He, Exalted is He, said: "Then, those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose scales are light..." (Qur'an, Al-Mu'minun 23:102-103). Its interpretation is that God, Exalted is He, creates in the scrolls of deeds a weight according to the degrees of deeds with God, Exalted is He, so the measures of the servants' deeds become known to the servants, such that justice in punishment or favor in pardon and the multiplication of reward becomes manifest to them.

The Fifth Principle: The Bridge (As-Sirat), and it is a bridge stretched over the back of Hell, finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. God, Exalted is He, said: "And lead them to the path of Hell. And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned." (Qur'an, As-Saffat 37:23-24). This is possible, so belief in it is obligatory, for He who is capable of making birds fly in the air is capable of making man walk on the Bridge.

The Sixth Principle: That Paradise and Hell are created. God, Exalted is He, said: "And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous..." (Qur'an, Al 'Imran 3:133). So His statement, Exalted is He, "prepared" is proof that it is created, and it must be taken according to its apparent meaning, as there is no impossibility in it. It cannot be said there is no benefit in creating them before the Day of Recompense, for God, Exalted is He: "He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned." (Qur'an, Al-Anbiya' 21:23).

The Seventh Principle: That the rightful Imam after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, is Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, then 'Uthman, then 'Ali, may God be pleased with them. There was no explicit textual designation (nass) from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, for an Imam at all, for if there had been, it would have been more deserving of being manifest than his appointment of individual governors and commanders over troops in the lands, and that was not concealed, so how could this have been concealed? And if it had appeared, how could it have been effaced until it was not transmitted to us? Thus, Abu Bakr only became Imam by election and pledge of allegiance (bay'ah). As for positing a textual designation for someone else, that attributes to all the Companions opposition to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and a breach of consensus, and that is something none would dare to invent except the Rafidah (Rejecters). The people of the Sunnah are accustomed to declaring all the Companions pure and praising them, just as God, Glorified and Exalted is He, and His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, praised them. What occurred between Mu'awiyah and 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both, was based on independent reasoning (ijtihad), not from Mu'awiyah contesting the Imamate itself. For 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, thought that handing over the killers of 'Uthman, given the multitude of their clans and their mixing with the army, would lead to disruption of the affair of the Imamate at its beginning, so he deemed delay more correct. And Mu'awiyah thought that delaying their affair, given the enormity of their crime, would necessitate emboldening [others] against the Imams and expose blood to being shed. The eminent scholars have said: "Every independent reasoning scholar is correct," and some have said: "The correct one is one." None of sound judgment has gone so far as to deem 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, mistaken.

The Eighth Principle: That the merit of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, is according to their order in the Caliphate. For the reality of merit is what constitutes merit with God, Mighty and Majestic, and that is not known except to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. Verses and numerous reports have come praising them all. The subtleties of merit and its order are only grasped by those who witnessed the revelation and its sending down, through contextual clues and minute details. Had they not understood that, they would not have ordered the affair thus, for they were not swayed in God's matter by the blame of any blamer, nor turned from the truth by any turner.

The Ninth Principle: That the conditions for the Imamate, after Islam and legal responsibility, are five: masculinity, piety, knowledge, competence, and Qurayshi lineage, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "The Imams are from Quraysh." If a number of people described with these qualities are present, then the Imam is the one to whom the pledge of allegiance is concluded by the majority of the people. One who opposes the majority is a rebel who must be compelled to submit to the truth.

The Tenth Principle: That if it becomes impossible to find piety and knowledge in one who assumes the Imamate, and his removal would stir unbearable strife, we rule that his Imamate is validly concluded. For we are between either stirring strife by replacement, wherein the harm that befalls the Muslims exceeds what they lose from the deficiency of these conditions, which were established for the sake of benefit, such that one does not demolish the foundation of benefit out of eagerness for its perfections—like one who builds a palace and destroys a city—or ruling that the land is devoid of an Imam and that legal judgments are invalid, and that is impossible. We rule that the judgments of the rebels in their lands are effective due to pressing need, so how can we not rule the validity of the Imamate in cases of need and necessity?

These four pillars, containing the forty principles, are the foundations of beliefs. Whoever believes in them is in accordance with the people of the Sunnah and distinct from the faction of innovation. So God, Exalted is He...

May He guide us with His facilitation and lead us to truth and its realization through His grace and the vastness of His generosity and favor. And may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and every chosen servant.

[The Fourth Chapter of the Foundations of Belief] Concerning Faith and Islam, the connection between them, and what pertains to them of increase and decrease, and the manner of the predecessors' exception therein. In it are three issues.

[Issue] They differed regarding whether Islam is the same as Faith or something else. And if it is something else, is it separate from it, existing without it, or is it linked to it, inseparable from it? It was said they are one and the same. It was said they are two things with no connection. And it was said they are two things, but one is linked to the other. Abu Talib al-Makki has presented on this matter speech marked by severe confusion and much prolixity. Let us now advance to a clear declaration of the truth without digressing to transmit what yields no benefit. We say regarding this: there are three inquiries. An inquiry into the linguistic import of the two terms, an inquiry into what is intended by them in the usage of the Sacred Law, and an inquiry into their ruling in this world and the next. The first inquiry is linguistic, the second is exegetical, and the third is jurisprudential and legal.

The First Inquiry: Concerning the linguistic import. The truth herein is that Faith is an expression for affirmation. God Almighty said: "Nor would you believe us" meaning 'affirm for us.' And Islam is an expression for submission and surrender, through acquiescence and compliance, and the abandonment of rebellion, refusal, and obstinacy. Affirmation has a specific locus, which is the heart, and the tongue is its interpreter. As for submission, it is general, pertaining to the heart, the tongue, and the limbs. For every affirmation by the heart is a submission and an abandonment of refusal and denial. Likewise, confession by the tongue, and likewise obedience and compliance by the limbs. Thus, the linguistic import is that Islam is more general and Faith is more specific. Faith is an expression for the noblest parts of Islam. Therefore, every affirmation is a submission, but not every submission is an affirmation.

The Second Inquiry: Concerning the usage of the Sacred Law. The truth herein is that the Sacred Law has employed them interchangeably and concurrently, has employed them to denote difference, and has employed them to denote overlap. As for interchangeability, it is in His saying, Almighty: "So We brought out those who were therein of the believers. But We found not therein except one house of Muslims." And by agreement, there was only one house. And He said: "O my people, if you have believed in God, then upon Him rely, if you should be Muslims." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Islam is built upon five." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was once asked about Faith and he answered with these five. As for difference, it is in His saying: "The Bedouins say, 'We have believed.' Say, 'You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted.''" Its meaning is: we have surrendered outwardly. Here, He intended by Faith only affirmation in the heart, and by Islam, outward surrender by the tongue and limbs. And in the Hadith of Gabriel, peace be upon him, when he asked him about Faith, he said: "That you believe in God, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and in resurrection after death, and in the reckoning, and in the divine decree, its good and its evil." Then he said: "What is Islam?" He answered by mentioning the five characteristics. Thus, he expressed by Islam the outward submission by word and deed. And in the Hadith concerning Sa'd, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, gave a gift to one man and did not give to another. Sa'd said to him: "O Messenger of God, you left so-and-so, you did not give him, and he is a believer." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Or a Muslim." He repeated it to him, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, repeated it. As for overlap, it is also narrated that he was asked: "Which deeds are best?" He said: "Islam." He said: "Which Islam is best?" He said: "Faith." This is evidence for both difference and overlap. This is the most fitting of usages linguistically, for Faith is an act among acts, and it is the best of them. And Islam is submission, whether by the heart, the tongue, or the limbs. The best of it is that by the heart, which is affirmation, called Faith. The usage of them to denote difference, to denote overlap, and to denote interchangeability are all not outside the path of linguistic figurative usage. As for difference, it is to make Faith an expression for affirmation by the heart only, which conforms to language, and Islam an expression for outward submission, which also conforms to language. For submission in some loci of submission is applied to it the name 'submission.' It is not a condition for the realization of the name that the meaning be general for every locus in which the meaning can exist. For one who touches another with part of his body is called 'toucher,' even if he does not encompass all of his body. Thus, applying the name Islam to outward submission when there is no inward submission conforms to language. Upon this meaning proceeded His saying: "The Bedouins say, 'We have believed.' Say, 'You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted.''" And His saying, peace be upon him, in the Hadith of Sa'd: "Or a Muslim," because he preferred one over the other. And by difference, he intends...

The distinction between the two terms is established. As for their overlap, it also conforms to linguistic usage specifically concerning *Iman* (faith). This is when *Islam* (submission) is taken to mean surrender with the heart, speech, and action all together, while *Iman* is taken to mean only a part of what is encompassed by *Islam*, namely, affirmation with the heart. This is what we intended by 'overlap,' and it conforms to linguistic usage regarding the specificity of *Iman* and the generality of *Islam* encompassing everything. On this basis is understood the statement "*Iman*" in response to the questioner, meaning *Islam* is superior because *Iman* was made a specific part of *Islam*, thus including it within it.

As for using them synonymously, by making *Islam* mean surrender with both the heart and the outward aspect together—since all of that is surrender—and likewise *Iman*, and then using the term *Iman* specifically by generalizing it and including the outward aspect in its meaning, this is permissible. For the outward surrender through speech and action is the fruit and result of inner affirmation. Sometimes the name 'tree' is used intending the tree along with its fruit, by way of leniency. Thus, with this degree of generalization, it becomes synonymous with the name *Islam* and corresponds to it, neither exceeding nor falling short of it. On this basis is understood His saying: **"But We found therein none but a single household of Muslims."**

The Third Inquiry: Concerning the Legal Ruling. *Islam* and *Iman* entail two rulings: one pertaining to the Hereafter and one pertaining to this world. As for the Hereafter, it is deliverance from the Fire and prevention of eternal abode therein, for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: **"He will be brought out of the Fire who had in his heart an atom's weight of faith."** They have differed regarding what this ruling is contingent upon, expressing it by asking: 'What is faith?' Some say it is merely the inner conviction. Some say it is conviction in the heart and testimony with the tongue. Some add a third: performance of the pillars [of Islam]. We shall lift the veil on this and say: Whoever combines these three, there is no dispute that his abode is Paradise.

The second degree is that two are present along with part of the third—namely, speech and conviction, and some of the works—but its possessor committed a major sin or some major sins. At this point, the Mu'tazilites said he has thereby exited from faith, yet has not entered into disbelief; rather, his name is 'sinful transgressor' (*Fasiq*), and he is in a station between the two stations, and he is eternally in the Fire. This is invalid, as we shall mention.

The third degree is that affirmation in the heart and testimony with the tongue are present, but not the works of the limbs. They have differed regarding its ruling. Abu Talib al-Makki said that works of the limbs are from faith and it is not complete without them, and he claimed consensus on this. He argued with evidences that imply the opposite of his intent, such as God's saying: **"those who believe and do righteous deeds"**—for this indicates that works are besides faith, not part of faith's essence; otherwise, works would be in the position of something repeated. It is astonishing that he claimed consensus in this while also transmitting his (the Prophet's) saying (peace be upon him): **"No one becomes a disbeliever except after rejecting what he had affirmed,"** and he rejects the Mu'tazilites' statement of eternal abode in the Fire due to major sins. The one who says this is essentially stating the doctrine of the Mu'tazilites, for it is said to him: 'One who affirms with his heart and testifies with his tongue and dies immediately—is he in Paradise?' He must say yes. Herein is a ruling that faith exists without works. We add and say: If he remained alive until the time for a single prayer entered upon him, and he neglected it, then died, or committed fornication, then died—is he eternally in the Fire? If he says yes, then that is the intent of the Mu'tazilites. If he says no, then that is a clear statement that works are not a pillar of faith's essence, nor a condition for its existence, nor for deserving Paradise by it. If he says, 'I meant by that if he lives a long time and does not pray nor undertake any of the prescribed works,' we say: Then what defines that duration? What is the number of those acts of obedience whose abandonment invalidates faith? What is the number of major sins whose commission invalidates faith? This cannot be arbitrarily determined, and no one has ever adopted such a position.

The fourth degree is that affirmation in the heart exists before one speaks with the tongue or engages in works, and then he dies. Do we say he died a believer between him and God Almighty? This is a matter of disagreement. Those who stipulate speech for the completeness of faith say this one died before faith. This is invalid, for he (the Prophet) (peace be upon him) said: **"He will be brought out of the Fire who had in his heart an atom's weight of faith,"** and this one's heart is overflowing with faith, so how could he be eternally in the Fire? Furthermore, in the Hadith of Gabriel (upon him be peace), nothing was stipulated for faith except affirmation of God Almighty, His angels, His books, and the Last Day, as preceded.

The fifth degree: One affirms with the heart and has from his lifespan a period enabling him to utter the two testimonies and knows their obligation, but he did not utter them. It is possible to consider his abstention from speech like abstention from prayer. We say he is a believer, not eternally in the Fire. Faith is pure affirmation, and the tongue is the interpreter of faith. Therefore, faith must exist in its completeness before

The tongue until the tongue translates it, and this is the most apparent, for there is no basis except following what the words necessitate. The established linguistic usage is that faith is an expression denoting affirmation by the heart. He, may He be glorified and exalted, has said: "He will bring forth whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of faith." Faith is not negated from the heart by remaining silent about the obligatory utterance, just as it is not negated by remaining silent about the obligatory action. Some have said that utterance is a pillar, since the two testimonies are not a report about the heart, but rather the establishment of another contract, an initiation of testimony, and a commitment. The first view is more apparent. A group of the Murji'ah went to extremes in this, saying, "This one does not enter the Fire at all," and they said, "Even if a believer disobeys, he does not enter the Fire." We will refute that for them in the sixth degree: that one says with his tongue, "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah," but does not affirm it with his heart. We have no doubt that in the judgment of the Hereafter, this person is among the disbelievers and is eternally in the Fire. And we have no doubt that in the worldly judgment pertaining to the Imams and rulers among the Muslims, he is treated as such, because his heart is not known to them, and we must assume about him that he did not say it with his tongue except while inwardly holding it in his heart. However, we are uncertain about a third matter: the worldly judgment between him and Allah, the Exalted. That is, if a close Muslim relative of his dies immediately, and he later affirms with his heart, and then seeks a legal opinion, saying, "I was not affirming with my heart at the time of death, and the inheritance is now in my possession. Is it permissible for me, between myself and Allah, the Exalted?" Or he married a Muslim woman and then affirmed with his heart—is he obliged to renew the marriage? This is a point of legal scrutiny. It is possible to say that worldly rulings are tied to the apparent statement, both outwardly and inwardly. And it is possible to say they are tied to the outward in relation to others, because his inward state is not apparent to others, while his inward state is apparent to himself between him and Allah, the Exalted. The more apparent view—and knowledge is with Allah, the Exalted—is that that inheritance is not permissible for him, and he is obliged to renew the marriage. For this reason, Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, would not attend the funeral of any hypocrite who died, and 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, would observe this from him and would not attend if Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, did not attend. Prayer is an outward action in this world, even though it is among the acts of worship, and avoiding the forbidden is also part of what is obligatory to Allah, like prayer, due to His saying, may He be glorified and exalted: "Seeking the lawful is an obligation after an obligation." This does not contradict our statement that inheritance is a ruling of Islam, which is submission. Rather, complete submission is what encompasses the outward and the inward. These are speculative juristic investigations built upon the apparent meanings of words, general texts, and analogies. Therefore, one deficient in the sciences should not think that certainty is required in it, since it is customary to include it in the discipline of theology, where certainty is sought. He who looks to customs and formalities in the sciences has not prospered. If you say: "Then what is the specious argument of the Mu'tazilah and the Murji'ah, and what is the proof for the invalidity of their statement?" I say: Their specious argument is the general texts of the Qur'an. As for the Murji'ah, they said a believer does not enter the Fire, even if he commits all sins, due to His, the Mighty and Majestic, saying: "So whoever believes in his Lord – he will neither fear deprivation nor burden," and due to His, the Blessed and Exalted, saying: "And those who believe in Allah and His messengers – those are the supporters of truth," the verse, and due to His saying: "Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them," up to His saying: "We denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything.'" So His statement "Every time a company is thrown into it" is general, so it should be that whoever is thrown into the Fire is a denier. And due to His saying: "None will burn in it except the most wretched, Who had denied and turned away." This is a restriction, affirmation, and negation. And due to His saying: "Whoever comes with a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be safe." Faith is the foremost of good deeds. And due to His saying: "And Allah loves the doers of good," and He said: "Indeed, We do not allow to be lost the reward of any who does good deeds." They have no proof in that, for wherever faith is mentioned in these verses, what is intended is faith accompanied by action, since we have established that 'faith' may be used and what is intended by it is 'Islam,' which is compliance with the heart, speech, and action. The evidence for this interpretation is numerous reports about punishing the disobedient and the measures of punishment, and His saying, may He be glorified and exalted: "He will bring forth from the Fire whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of faith." So how can he be brought out if he did not enter? And from the Qur'an is His saying: "Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills." The exception by His will indicates division. And His saying: "And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger – then indeed, for him is the Fire of Hell; they will abide therein forever." Specifying it with disbelief is arbitrary. And His saying: "Unquestionably, the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment," and He said: "And whoever comes with an evil deed – their faces will be overturned into the Fire." These general texts oppose their general texts, and it is necessary to apply specification and interpretation to both sides, because the reports explicitly state that the disobedient...

They are tormented [52] but rather the statement of the Almighty: “And there is none of you but will pass over it (Hell)” is explicit that this is inevitable for all, since no believer is free from a sin he commits. And His statement, the Almighty: “None shall enter it save the most wretched, who denied and turned away” intended by it either a specific group or intended by “the most wretched” a specific individual as well. And His statement, the Almighty: “Whenever a group is cast into it, its keepers will ask them” meaning a group from the disbelievers. Specifying general statements is plausible. And from this verse, al-Ash‘ari and a group of theologians encountered the denial of the forms of generality and that these terms are suspended until evidence appears indicating their meaning.

As for the Mu‘tazilah, their specious argument is His statement, the Almighty: “And indeed I am Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does righteous deeds and then remains guided” and His statement, the Almighty: “By time, indeed mankind is in loss, except those who have believed and done righteous deeds” and His statement, the Almighty: “And there is none of you but will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed” then He said: “Then We will save those who feared Allah” and His statement, the Almighty: “And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger – then indeed, for him is the fire of Hell” and every verse in which Allah, the Exalted, mentions righteous deeds coupled with faith, and His statement, the Almighty: “And whoever kills a believer intentionally – his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally” and these general statements are also specified by the evidence of His statement, the Almighty: “But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, Allah will turn to him in forgiveness” so He retains a will regarding the forgiveness of other than polytheism. Likewise His saying ﷺ: “He will bring out of the Fire whoever had in his heart an atom’s weight of faith” and His statement, the Almighty: “Indeed, We do not allow to be lost the reward of any who does well in deeds” and His statement, the Almighty: “Indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good” so how could the reward of the root of faith and all acts of obedience be lost due to a single disobedience? And His statement, the Almighty: “And whoever kills a believer intentionally” meaning because of his faith, and it has been reported for a reason like this.

If you say: The preferred opinion has inclined that faith exists without action, and it is well-known from the predecessors their saying: “Faith is belief, statement, and action” so what is its meaning? We say: It is not far-fetched to count action as part of faith because it perfects and completes it, just as it is said: “The head and hands are from the human,” and it is known that one ceases to be human by the absence of the head, but does not cease by being handless. Similarly, it is said: “The glorifications and magnifications are from the prayer,” even though it is not invalidated by their absence. Thus, affirmation by the heart is from faith like the head to the existence of a human, for it ceases by its absence, and the rest of the acts of obedience are like the limbs, some higher than others. And He ﷺ said: “The adulterer is not a believer at the moment he commits adultery” and the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, did not hold the doctrine of the Mu‘tazilah regarding exiting faith due to adultery, but its meaning is: not truly believing with a complete, perfect faith, just as it is said of the incapacitated, amputated person: “This is not a human,” meaning he does not have the perfection that is beyond the reality of humanity.

[Issue] If you say: The predecessors have agreed that faith increases and decreases; it increases by obedience and decreases by disobedience. So if affirmation is faith, increase and decrease in it are inconceivable. I say: The predecessors are the upright witnesses, and no one has a deviation from their statement, so what they mentioned is truth. The matter is only in understanding it, and in it is evidence that action is not from the components of faith and the pillars of its existence; rather, it is an addition to it, by which it increases. The increased exists and the decreased exists, and a thing does not increase by itself. Thus, it is not permissible to say a human increases by his head, but rather it is said he increases by his beard and his fatness. And it is not permissible to say prayer increases by bowing and prostration, but rather it increases by the etiquettes and Sunnahs. This is a clear statement that faith has an existence, then after existence its state varies by increase and decrease.

If you say: The difficulty remains in how affirmation increases and decreases while it is a single trait. I say: When we abandon appeasement and do not heed the confusion of the confuser, and we lift the veil, the difficulty is removed. So we say: Faith is a shared name applied in three aspects: The first is that it is applied for affirmation by the heart in the manner of belief and imitation without unveiling and expansion of the chest, and this is the faith of the common people, indeed the faith of all creation except the elect. This belief is a knot in the heart; sometimes it tightens and strengthens, and sometimes weakens and slackens, like a knot on a thread, for example. Do not deem this improbable; consider the Jew and his firmness in his belief from which he cannot be drawn away by intimidation and warning, nor by illusion and admonition, nor by verification and proof. Likewise the Christian and the innovators; among them are those who can be doubted by the slightest speech and can be drawn away from his belief by the slightest enticement or intimidation, even though he is not doubting his belief like the first, but they differ in the intensity of determination. This exists in true belief as well, and action.

This resolve grows and increases just as watering affects the growth of trees. Thus, God Almighty said: “So it increased them in faith” (Qur’an 9:124), and He said: “That they may increase in faith along with their [present] faith” (Qur’an 48:4). And He, glorified be He, said in a narration from some reports: “Faith increases and decreases.” This is due to the effect of righteous deeds upon the heart, which none perceives except one who observes the states of his soul during times of diligence in worship and devotion to it with presence of heart, compared to times of lassitude, and who perceives the disparity in the tranquility of faith’s convictions in these states, until its knot becomes more resistant to anyone who seeks to untie it through doubt. Indeed, one who believes in the meaning of mercy toward an orphan, if he acts according to that belief by stroking his head and being gentle with him, will perceive from his inner self a confirmation and multiplication of mercy due to the action. Likewise, one who believes in humility, if he acts accordingly by performing an act of bowing or prostrating to another, will feel humility in his heart when undertaking service. Thus, all attributes of the heart issue actions from the limbs, then the effect of those actions returns upon them, confirming and increasing them. This will come in the Quarter of the Saving and Damning Acts, in explaining the manner of the inner’s connection to the outer, deeds to beliefs, and hearts. For that is of the kind of connection between the visible realm and the unseen realm. By the visible realm, I mean the world of testimony perceived by the senses; by the unseen realm, the world of the unseen perceived by the light of insight. The heart is from the world of the unseen, and the limbs and their actions are from the visible realm. The subtlety and precision of the connection between the two worlds reaches a point where some people imagine the union of one with the other, while others imagine there is no world except the visible world—these perceived bodies. Whoever perceives both matters and perceives their multiplicity, then their connection, expressed it by saying:
    The glass became thin and the wine became thin, and they resembled each other, so the matter became ambiguous.
    As if there is wine and no cup, and as if there is cup and no wine.
Let us return to the intended purpose, for this knowledge is outside the knowledge of spiritual practice, but between the two knowledges there is also connection and linkage. Therefore, you see the sciences of unveiling climb every hour upon the sciences of practice until they are unveiled from them by divine obligation. This is the aspect of faith’s increase through obedience according to this usage. Hence, ‘Ali, may God honor his face, said: “Faith indeed appears as a white spot; then when the servant performs righteous deeds, it grows and increases until the entire heart becomes white. And hypocrisy indeed appears as a black spot; then when violations are committed, it grows and increases until the entire heart becomes black and is sealed over.” That is the sealing, and he recited God’s saying: “No! Rather, a stain has covered their hearts” (Qur’an 83:14). The second usage: that it is intended to mean both affirmation and action, as He, glorified be He, said: “Faith has seventy-odd branches,” and as He said: “The adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer.” When action enters into the requirement of the term ‘faith,’ its increase and decrease is not hidden. Does that affect the increase of faith which is mere affirmation? There is consideration in this, and we have indicated that it does affect it. The third usage: that it is intended to mean certain affirmation by way of unveiling, expansion of the breast, and witnessing by the light of insight. This is the furthest of the categories from accepting increase. But I say: the certain matter about which there is no doubt differs in the heart’s tranquility towards it. The heart’s tranquility that two is more than one is not like its tranquility that the world is created and originated, even though there is no doubt in either. For certainties differ in degrees of clarity and degrees of the heart’s tranquility towards them. We have addressed this in the chapter on certainty in the Book of Knowledge, in the section on the signs of the scholars of the Hereafter, so there is no need for repetition. It has become clear in all usages that what they said about faith’s increase and decrease is true. How could it not be, when in the reports: “He will be brought out of the Fire who has in his heart an atom’s weight of faith,” and in some places in another report: “a dinar’s weight”? What meaning is there for the difference in its measures if what is in the heart does not vary?
[Question] If you say: What is the meaning of the predecessors saying, “We are believers, if God wills,” and the exception is doubt, and doubt in faith is disbelief? Yet all of them refrained from a decisive answer with “faith” and were cautious about it. Sufyan al-Thawri, may God have mercy on him, said: “Whoever says, ‘I am a believer before God,’ is among the liars; and whoever says, ‘I am a true believer,’ is an innovator.” How can he be a liar when he knows he is a believer in himself? And whoever is a believer in himself is a believer before God, just as whoever is tall or generous in himself and knows that is so before God, and likewise whoever is joyful, sorrowful, hearing, or seeing. If a person were asked, “Are you an animal?” it would not be proper for him to say, “I am an animal, if God wills.” And when Sufyan said...

That was said to him, so what should we say? He said: Say, "We believe in God and what has been revealed to us." And what difference is there between saying, "We believe in God and what has been revealed to us," and saying, "I am a believer"? And it was said to Al-Hasan, "Are you a believer?" He replied, "If God wills." It was said to him, "Why do you make an exception, O Abu Sa'id, concerning faith?" He said, "I fear that if I say 'yes,' God, glorified and exalted, would say, 'You have lied, O Hasan,' and thus the word would be confirmed against me." And he used to say, "What assures me that God, glorified and exalted, has not observed me in something He dislikes and thus detested me and said, 'Go away, I do not accept any deed from you'? So I work in a work that is not accepted." And Ibrahim ibn Adham said, "If you are asked, 'Are you a believer?' say, 'There is no god but God.'" And on another occasion he said, "Say, 'I do not doubt faith, and your asking me is an innovation.'" And it was said to 'Alqamah, "Are you a believer?" He said, "I hope so, if God wills." And Al-Thawri said, "We are believers in God, His angels, His books, and His messengers, but we do not know what we are in the sight of God, exalted." So what is the meaning of these exceptions? The answer is that this exception is valid and has four aspects: two aspects are based on doubt, not concerning the foundation of faith but concerning its conclusion or perfection, and two aspects are not based on doubt.

The first aspect, which is not based on opposing doubt, is precaution against certainty out of fear of what it contains of self-praise. God, exalted, said: "So do not claim purity for yourselves." And He said: "Have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves?" And God, exalted, said: "See how they invent lies against God." And it was said to a wise man, "What is ugly truthfulness?" He said, "A person's praise of himself." And faith is among the highest attributes of glory, and certainty is absolute self-praise. The formula of exception is as if a burden for one who recognizes self-praise, just as when a person is told, "You are a physician, or a jurist, or an exegete," and he says, "Yes, if God wills," not in the context of doubt but to remove himself from praising himself. Thus, the formula is one of hesitation and weakening of the statement itself, and its meaning is the weakening necessitated by the implications of the statement, which is self-praise. By this interpretation, if one were asked about a blameworthy attribute, it would not be appropriate to make an exception.

The second aspect is etiquette by mentioning God, exalted, in every situation and referring all matters to the will of God, glorified and exalted. For God, glorified and exalted, taught His Prophet etiquette when He said: "And never say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except [when adding], 'If God wills.'" Then He did not restrict that to matters of no doubt, but said: "You will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, if God wills, in safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] shortened." And God, glorified and exalted, knew that they would certainly enter and that He willed it, but the purpose was to teach him that. So the Messenger of God observed etiquette in what he reported, whether known or doubtful, until he said when he entered the graveyards: "Peace be upon you, O abode of believing people, and we, if God wills, will join you." Joining them is not doubted, but the requirement of etiquette is mentioning God, exalted, and linking matters to Him. This formula indicates that until, by customary usage, it became an expression of showing desire and hope. So if you are told, "So-and-so will die soon," and you say, "If God wills," it is understood from it your desire, not your doubt. And if you are told, "So-and-so's illness will depart and he will recover," and you say, "If God wills," meaning desire, then the word has shifted from the meaning of doubt to the meaning of desire. Likewise, the shift to the meaning of etiquette by mentioning God, exalted, however the matter may be.

The third aspect is based on doubt, and its meaning is: I am truly a believer, if God wills. For God, exalted, said to a specific people by their individuals: "Those are the ones who are true believers." They are divided into two groups, and this refers to doubt in the perfection of faith, not in its foundation. Every person doubts the perfection of his faith, and that is not disbelief. Doubt in the perfection of faith is valid from two perspectives: One, from the aspect that hypocrisy removes the perfection of faith, and it is hidden; one cannot be certain of being free from it. Two, that it is perfected by acts of obedience, and one does not know their existence in perfection. As for action, God, exalted, said: "The believers are only those who have believed in God and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of God. It is those who are the truthful." So doubt is concerning this truthfulness. And likewise, God, exalted, said: "But righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets." He stipulated twenty attributes, such as fulfilling the covenant and patience in hardships, then said: "Those are the ones who are true." And He said: "God will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees." And He said: "Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest and fought." The verse. And He said: "They are degrees with God." And he said: "Faith is naked, and its garment..."

Piety. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Faith has over seventy branches, the least of which is removing a harmful object from the road." This indicates the connection between the perfection of faith and deeds. As for its connection to being free from hypocrisy and hidden polytheism, there is his statement (peace be upon him): "There are four characteristics; whoever possesses them is a pure hypocrite, even if he fasts and prays and claims to be a Muslim: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise, he breaks it; when he is entrusted, he betrays; and when he disputes, he acts immorally." In some narrations: "and when he makes a covenant, he acts treacherously." In the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "Hearts are of four kinds: a heart that is bare, in which is a shining lamp—that is the heart of the believer; and a heart that is encrusted, containing both faith and hypocrisy. The likeness of faith within it is that of a herb nourished by sweet water, and the likeness of hypocrisy within it is that of an ulcer nourished by pus and blood. Whichever of the two nourishments prevails over it, he is judged accordingly." In another wording: "it prevailed over it and carried it away." And he (peace be upon him) said: "The greatest hypocrites of this community are its reciters." In a hadith: "Polytheism is more hidden in my community than the creeping of an ant on a smooth stone." Hudhayfah (may God be pleased with him) said: "During the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), a man would utter a word and thereby become a hypocrite until he died. And I hear it from one of you ten times a day." Some scholars said: "The person closest to hypocrisy is the one who sees himself as innocent of it." Hudhayfah said: "The hypocrites today are more numerous than they were during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). In those days, they would conceal it, but today they display it openly." This hypocrisy opposes the sincerity, perfection, and purity of faith, and it is hidden. The person farthest from it is the one who fears it, and the closest to it is the one who sees himself as innocent of it. Al-Hasan al-Basri was asked: "They say there is no hypocrisy today?" He replied: "O my brother, if the hypocrites were to perish, you would feel lonely on the road." He, or someone else, said: "If hypocrites were to grow tails, we would not be able to tread the earth with our feet." Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) heard a man criticizing al-Hajjaj and said: "Tell me, if he were present and listening, would you speak of him thus?" The man said: "No." Ibn 'Umar said: "We used to consider this hypocrisy during the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever has two tongues in this world, God will give him two tongues in the Hereafter." He also said (peace be upon him): "The worst of people is the two-faced one who comes to these with one face and to those with another." Al-Hasan was told: "There are people who say, 'We do not fear hypocrisy.'" He said: "By God, if I knew I was innocent of hypocrisy, it would be dearer to me than the earth filled with gold." Al-Hasan said: "Among hypocrisy is the discrepancy between the tongue and the heart, the secret and the public, the entrance and the exit." A man said to Hudhayfah (may God be pleased with him): "I fear I may be a hypocrite." He replied: "If you were a hypocrite, you would not fear hypocrisy, for the hypocrite feels secure from it." Ibn Abi Mulaykah said: "I met one hundred and thirty—in one narration, one hundred and fifty—Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and every one of them feared hypocrisy." It is narrated: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was sitting with a group of his Companions, and they mentioned a man, praising him greatly. While they were doing so, the man appeared before them, his face dripping with water from ablution, his sandals hanging from his hand, and the mark of prostration between his eyes. They said, 'O Messenger of God, this is the man we described.' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'I see on his face a stain from Satan.' The man came, greeted them, and sat with the group. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, 'I adjure you by God, did it occur to your heart when you approached the group that there was no one among them better than you?' He said, 'O God, yes.'" The Prophet (peace be upon him) then said in his supplication: "O God, I seek Your forgiveness for what I know and for what I do not know." He was asked, "Do you fear, O Messenger of God?" He replied, "And what would make me feel secure? The hearts are between two fingers of the fingers of the Most Merciful; He turns them as He wills. And He, glorified be He, has said: 'And there will appear to them from God that which they had not taken into account.'" It is said in interpretation: "They performed deeds they thought were good, but they were placed in the scale of evil deeds." Sari al-Saqati said: "If a person entered a garden containing all kinds of trees, upon which were all kinds of birds, and every bird addressed him in its language, saying, 'Peace be upon you, O friend of God,' and his heart became content with that, he would be a captive in their hands." These reports and narrations make you aware of the gravity of the matter due to the subtleties of hypocrisy and hidden polytheism, and that no one is secure from it. Even 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may God be pleased with him) used to ask Hudhayfah about himself, whether he was mentioned among the hypocrites. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "I heard something from one of the rulers and wanted to reject it, but I feared he would order my death. I did not fear death itself, but I feared that at the moment my soul departed, my heart might seek to show off to people, so I restrained myself." This is from the hypocrisy that opposes the reality, sincerity, perfection, and purity of faith—not its foundation. For hypocrisy is of two kinds: one that expels from the religion, associates with the disbelievers, and places among the eternally damned in the Fire.

The second leads its possessor to the Fire for a duration, or diminishes from the degrees of the highest paradise and lowers from the rank of the truthful ones, and that is subject to doubt, and for that reason, making exception therein is good. The origin of this hypocrisy is disparity between the inward and the outward, and feeling secure from the guile of God, and self-admiration, and other matters from which none are free except the truthful ones.

The fourth aspect: It is also based upon doubt, and that is from fear of the ending, for one does not know whether faith will remain safe for him at death or not. If his end is sealed with disbelief, his prior deeds are nullified, because they are contingent upon the soundness of the ending. If a fasting person were asked at midday about the soundness of his fast and he said, "I am certainly fasting," then if he broke his fast during the remainder of that day, his falsehood would become clear, since the soundness is contingent upon completion until sunset at the end of the day. And just as the day is the appointed time for the completion of the fast, so the lifespan is the appointed time for the completion of the soundness of faith. To describe it as sound before its end is based on the presumption of continuity, which is subject to doubt, and the outcome is feared. For its sake, most of the fearful ones weep, because it is the fruit of the prior decree and the eternal will, which does not become apparent except by the appearance of what is decreed, and none of humankind has any insight into it. Therefore, fear of the ending is like fear of what is prior, and perhaps what appears in the present moment is what the prior word has decreed contrary to it. So who knows that he is among those for whom the best reward from God has preceded? It is said concerning the meaning of His saying, exalted is He: "And the agony of death comes with the truth" — meaning with what is prior, that is, it reveals it. Some of the predecessors said, "Only the endings of deeds are weighed." And Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, would swear by God that there is no one who feels secure from being stripped of his faith except that it is stripped from him. It is said that among sins are sins whose punishment is a bad ending — we seek refuge in God from that — and it is said they are punishments for claiming sainthood and honor falsely. Some of the knowers said, "If martyrdom were presented to me at the door of the house, and death upon monotheism at the door of the room, I would choose death upon monotheism at the door of the room, because I do not know what change might occur in my heart concerning monotheism from the door of the house to the door of the room." Another said, "If I knew someone to be upon monotheism for fifty years, then a pillar came between me and him and he died, I would not judge that he died upon monotheism." And in the hadith: "Whoever says, 'I am a believer,' he is a disbeliever, and whoever says, 'I am knowledgeable,' he is ignorant." It is said concerning His saying, exalted is He: "And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice" — truth for the one who dies upon faith, and justice for the one who dies upon polytheism. And He, exalted is He, has said: "And to God belongs the outcome of all matters." Therefore, whenever doubt is of this nature, making exception is obligatory, because faith is an expression for what leads to Paradise, just as fasting is an expression for what fulfills the obligation. And what becomes invalid before sunset does not fulfill the obligation and thus exits from being a fast. Likewise is faith. Rather, it is not far-fetched that one might be asked about a past fast, about which there is no doubt after its completion, and it is said, "Did you fast yesterday?" and he says, "Yes, if God, exalted is He, wills," for the true fast is the accepted one, and the accepted one is hidden from him; none has insight into it except God, exalted is He. From this perspective, making exception is good in all righteous deeds, and that is doubt concerning acceptance, for after the apparent conditions of soundness have been met, subtle causes, which none has insight into except the Lord of lords, majestic is His splendor, may prevent acceptance. Therefore, doubt concerning it is good. These are the aspects of the goodness of making exception in the answer concerning faith, and they are the last with which we conclude the book of the Foundations of Beliefs. The book is completed by the praise of God, exalted is He, and upon our master Muhammad and upon every chosen servant.

and His angels and His messengers, and believe in Paradise and Hell and the Balance." The hadith's origin in Muslim does not mention the Balance, but because of the hadith of 'A'ishah from Dawud. As for the three situations, no one will mention anyone at the Balance until it is known whether his scale will be light or heavy. Ibn Mardawayh added in his tafsir: 'A'ishah said, "Until we have learned that the scales are the two pans, wherein something is placed in this one and something is placed in that one, so one of them rises and the other becomes light." And al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the hadith of Anas: "Seek me at the Balance." And from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar in the hadith of the card: "The records are placed in one scale and the card in the other scale." And Ibn Shahin narrated in the *Book of Sunnah* from Ibn 'Abbas: "The pan of the Balance is like the platters of the entire world."

[6] The hadith concerning belief in the Bridge, which is a bridge stretched over the back of Hell, sharper than a sword and finer than a hair. The two Shaykhs narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "And the Bridge will be laid across the midst of Hell." And they both have from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Then the Bridge will be laid over Hell." Muslim added: Abu Sa'id said, "The Bridge is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword." And Ahmad raised it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab*. And concerning the Resurrection from the hadith of Anas, but it is weak. And concerning the Resurrection from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umayr, which is *mursal*, and from the statement of Ibn Mas'ud: "The Bridge is like the edge of a sword." And at the end of the hadith is what indicates it is *marfu'*.

[7] The hadith concerning belief in the Basin, and that the believers will drink from it. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Anas concerning the revelation of "Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar": "It is a Basin to which my nation will come on the Day of Resurrection. Its vessels are like the number of the stars." And they both have from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, Jundub, and Sahl ibn Sa'd: "I will be your forerunner at the Basin." And from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Your Basin is as the distance between Jurba' and Adhruh." And al-Tabrani said: "As between you and between Jurba' and Adhruh," and this is correct. The Basin is mentioned in the *Sahih* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa'id, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, Hudhayfah, Abu Dharr, Habis ibn Samurah, Harithah ibn Wahb, Thawban, 'A'ishah, Umm Salamah, and Asma'.

Around it are pitchers like the number of the stars of the sky." From the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr. And they both have from the hadith of Anas: "In it are pitchers like the number of the stars of the sky." And in a narration of Muslim: "More than the number of the stars of the sky."

[9] The hadith: "In it are two spouts flowing from al-Kawthar." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Thawban: "Two spouts flow into it, supplied from Paradise, one of gold and the other of silver."

[10] The hadith concerning belief in the Reckoning, and the disparity among creation therein: to one who will be scrutinized in the Reckoning, to one who will be granted leniency therein, and to one who will enter Paradise without any reckoning. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in *al-Ba'th* from the hadith of 'Umar, who said: "O Messenger of God, what is faith?" He said: "That you believe in God, His angels, His books, His messengers, and in death, the resurrection after death, the Reckoning, Paradise and Hell, and the Decree in its entirety." The hadith is in Muslim without mention of the Reckoning. And the two Shaykhs have from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Whoever is scrutinized in the Reckoning will be punished." She said: I said, "Does not God, Exalted is He, say: 'He will be reckoned an easy reckoning'?" He said: "That is the presentation." And they both have from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The nations were shown to me, and it was said, 'This is your nation, and with them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning or punishment.'" And Muslim has from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and 'Imran ibn Husayn: "Seventy thousand from my nation will enter Paradise without any reckoning." Al-Bayhaqi added in *al-Ba'th* from the hadith of 'Amr ibn Hazm: "And He gave me, with each one of the seventy thousand, seventy thousand." Ahmad added from the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr after this addition: "So why did you not ask for more?" He said: "I did ask for more, and He gave me with each man seventy thousand." 'Umar said: "So why did you not ask for more?" He said: "I did ask for more, and He gave me like this," and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr spread his hands apart.

Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Noah will be called on the Day of Resurrection, and he will say, 'At Your service, at Your service, O Lord.' He will say, 'Did you deliver?' He will say, 'Yes.' It will be said to his nation, and they will say, 'No warner came to us.' He will say, 'Who will bear witness for you?' He will say, 'Muhammad and his nation.'"

[12] The hadith concerning the questioning of innovators about the Sunnah: Ibn Majah narrated from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Whoever speaks about anything concerning divine decree will be questioned about it on the Day of Resurrection." And from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "There is no caller who calls to anything except that he will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection, bound to what he called to, even if a man called another man." Their chains of transmission are weak.

This was mentioned previously in the Book of Knowledge. And in Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "...'Whomever you find in his heart a mustard seed's weight of faith, bring him out.'" In another narration: "...a seed's weight of good." In it: "Then God, the Exalted, will say: 'The angels have interceded, the prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded. None remains but the Most Merciful of the merciful.' Then He will take a handful from the Fire and bring out from it a people who never did any good..."

[16] The hadith concerning the best of people after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, being Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, then 'Uthman, then 'Ali: Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "We used to compare people during the time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and we considered Abu Bakr the best, then 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, then 'Uthman ibn 'Affan." And in Abu Dawud: "We used to say while the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was alive: 'The best of the Prophet's community is Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, then 'Uthman,' may God be pleased with them."

Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban recorded it in the book *Al-'Azamah* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Between Allah and the angels surrounding the Throne are seventy veils of light," but its chain is weak. Also within it, from the narration of Anas, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to Gabriel, "Do you see your Lord?" He said, "Between me and Him are seventy veils of light." In *Al-Awsat* by al-Tabarani, from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "Allah the Exalted has a thousand veils of light and darkness."

[38] Hadith: "The speech of the dumb beast." Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi recorded it with a sound chain from the narration of Ya'la ibn Murrah regarding the camel that complained to the Prophet (peace be upon him) about its owner.
