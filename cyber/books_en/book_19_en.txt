The Book of Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil

This is the ninth book of the second quarter on customary acts from the books of *The Revival of the Religious Sciences*.

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, with Whose praise books are opened and by the grace of Whose generosity blessings are sought. And blessings upon the master of the prophets, Muhammad, His messenger and servant, and upon his pure family and his righteous companions after him.

To proceed: Enjoining good and forbidding evil is the greatest pivot of religion. It is the vital mission for which God sent all the prophets. Were its foundation to be rolled up, and its knowledge and practice neglected, prophethood would be nullified, faith would vanish, a period of spiritual neglect would become widespread, misguidance would prevail, ignorance would become common, corruption would intensify, the breach would widen, lands would be ruined, and the servants would perish—unaware of their destruction until the Day of Summons. What we feared has come to pass. Truly to God we belong and to Him we shall return. For from this pivot, its practice and knowledge have faded, and its reality and form have been utterly obliterated.

Hypocrisy toward creation has taken hold of hearts, and vigilance toward the Creator has been erased from them. People have plunged into following their whims and desires like beasts plunge. It has become rare upon the face of the earth to find a sincere, truthful believer who, for the sake of God, fears not the blame of any blamer.

Whoever strives to remedy this period of neglect and mend this breach—whether by undertaking its practice or by assuming the responsibility for its execution, reviving this extinguished tradition, shouldering its burdens, and exerting himself in its revival—will have distinguished himself among creation by reviving a tradition that time had consigned to death. He will attain a unique nearness to God, a station whose degrees of proximity diminish before its pinnacle.

We shall now explain its knowledge in four chapters:

Chapter One: On the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil, and its virtue.
Chapter Two: On its pillars and conditions.
Chapter Three: On its spheres of application and a clarification of the prevalent evils in customary practices.
Chapter Four: On enjoining rulers and sultans to do good and forbidding them from evil.

**Chapter One: On the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil, its virtue, and the blameworthiness of neglecting and abandoning it.**

This is indicated, beyond the consensus of the community and the indications of sound intellects, by verses, reports, and traditions. As for the verses:

The Exalted said: *"Let there be from among you a community inviting to good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. And it is they who are the successful."* (3:104) In this verse is a clarification of the obligation, for His saying *"Let there be..."* is a command, and the apparent meaning of a command is obligation. In it is also a clarification that success is tied to it, for He restricted it and said, *"And it is they who are the successful."* Furthermore, it clarifies that it is a collective obligation (*fard kifayah*), not an individual one (*fard 'ayn*). For if a community undertakes it, the obligation is lifted from the others, as He did not say, "Be, all of you, enjoiners of good," but rather said, *"Let there be from among you a community..."* Therefore, whenever one or a group performs it, the burden is lifted from the others, and success is specifically for those who perform it directly. Yet if all of creation neglect it, the burden of sin inevitably encompasses all who are capable of it.

And the Exalted said: *"They are not all alike. Among the People of the Scripture is a steadfast community reciting the verses of God during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer]. They believe in God and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous."* (3:113-114) He did not testify to their righteousness merely by their belief in God and the Last Day until He added to it enjoining good and forbidding evil.

And the Exalted said: *"The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer..."* (9:71) Thus He described the believers as those who enjoin good and forbid evil. Therefore, whoever abandons enjoining good and forbidding evil is outside the fold of these believers described in this verse.

And the Exalted said: *"Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed. They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing!"* (5:78-79) This is the utmost severity, for He made their deserving of the curse a consequence of their abandoning the forbidding of evil.

And the Almighty said: *"You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong..."* (3:110) This indicates the virtue of enjoining good and forbidding evil, for He made clear that they were the best nation brought forth for mankind because of it.

And the Exalted said: *"So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We saved those who forbade evil and seized those who wronged with a harsh punishment because they were defiantly disobedient."* (7:165) Thus He made clear that they attained salvation through forbidding evil, and this also indicates its obligation.

And the Exalted said: *"[They are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong."* (22:41) Thus He coupled it with prayer and zakah in describing the righteous and the believers.

And He, the Exalted, said: "And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression." This is a decisive command. The meaning of cooperation is to urge towards it, to facilitate the paths of good, and to block the ways of evil and aggression as much as possible.

And He, the Exalted, said: "If only the rabbis and scholars had forbidden them from their sinful speech and consumption of unlawful gain! Wretched indeed is what they were doing." Thus, He clarified that they sinned by abandoning the prohibition.

And He, the Exalted, said: "If only there had been among the generations before you people of remaining virtue forbidding corruption on earth..." Thus, He clarified that He destroyed all of them except a few among them who were forbidding corruption.

And He, the Exalted, said: "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives." And that is the command of what is right towards parents and relatives.

And He, the Exalted, said: "There is no good in most of their private conversation, except for those who enjoin charity or what is right or reconciliation between people. And whoever does that seeking the pleasure of Allah - then We are going to give him a great reward."

And He, the Exalted, said: "And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between them..." Reconciliation is a prohibition against transgression and a return to obedience. If it is not done, then Allah, the Exalted, has commanded to fight it, saying: "Then fight the one that transgresses until it returns to the command of Allah." And that is the forbidding of wrong.

As for the narrations, among them is what was narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said in a sermon he delivered: "O people, you recite this verse and interpret it contrary to its interpretation: 'O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided.'" The narration of Abu Bakr: "O people, you recite this verse and interpret it contrary to its interpretation: 'O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves...'" It was reported by the compilers of the Sunan and preceded in the chapter on seclusion. And I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: "There is no people among whom sins are committed, and among them is one who is able to forbid them, but he does not do so, except that Allah is about to envelop them all with a punishment from Himself."

And it was narrated from Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani that he asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, about the interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: "Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided." The narration of Abu Tha'labah: He asked the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, about the interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: "Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided." It was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, and Ibn Majah. He said: "O Abu Tha'labah, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. But when you see stinginess obeyed, desire followed, worldly life given preference, and every person of opinion admiring his own opinion, then upon you is yourself, and leave the common people. Ahead of you are trials like pieces of a dark night. For the one who holds fast in them to something like what you are upon, there is the reward of fifty of you." It was said: "From among them, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "No, from among you, for you find helpers upon good, and they do not find helpers upon it."

And Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about the interpretation of this verse. He said: "This is not its time. Today it is accepted. But its time is about to come when you will enjoin what is right and such will be done to you, and you will speak but it will not be accepted from you. Then at that time, 'upon you is yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided.'"

And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "You must enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, or Allah will surely empower over you the worst among you. Then the best among you will supplicate, but their supplication will not be answered." The narration: "You must enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, or Allah will surely empower over you the worst among you. Then the best among you will supplicate, but their supplication will not be answered." It was reported by al-Bazzar from the narration of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, and al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and both are weak. Al-Tirmidhi has a similar narration from Hudhayfah, except that he said: "Or Allah is about to send upon you a punishment from Him, then you will call upon Him but He will not respond to you." He said this is a good hadith in meaning. It means their awe will fall from the eyes of the wicked, so they will not fear them.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O people, indeed Allah says: 'You must enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong before you supplicate and are not answered.'" The narration: "O people, indeed Allah, the Glorified, says: 'You must enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong before you supplicate and are not answered.'" It was reported by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of 'A'ishah with the wording "Command and forbid," and it is in Ibn Majah without attributing it to the speech of Allah, the Exalted, and in its chain there is weakness.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The deeds of righteousness compared to jihad in the cause of Allah are but like a drop in a vast ocean. And all the deeds of righteousness and jihad in the cause of Allah compared to enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong are but like a drop in a vast ocean." The narration: "The deeds of righteousness compared to jihad in the cause of Allah are but like a drop in a vast ocean." It was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, limited to the first part of the narration from Jabir with a weak chain. As for the last part, he reported it...

In the book of Obedience and Disobedience, Ibn Ma'bad narrates from Yahya ibn 'Ata, either as a mursal or mu'dal report, and I do not know about Yahya ibn 'Ata. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, Allah the Exalted will ask the servant, 'What prevented you, when you saw evil, from denouncing it?' And when Allah prompts the servant with his excuse, he will say, 'My Lord, I trusted in You and feared the people.'" This hadith, "Verily, Allah the Exalted will ask the servant..." is reported by Ibn Majah and has been mentioned previously.

And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Beware of sitting in the pathways." They said, "We have no alternative; they are our gathering places where we converse." He said, "If you refuse but to do so, then give the pathway its due right." They said, "And what is the right of the pathway?" He said, "Lowering the gaze, refraining from harm, returning the greeting, enjoining good, and forbidding evil." This hadith, "Beware of sitting in the pathways," is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Sa'id.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "All the speech of the son of Adam is against him, not for him, except commanding good, forbidding evil, or remembrance of Allah the Exalted." The hadith, "All the speech of the son of Adam is against him..." has been mentioned previously in the chapter on Knowledge.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, Allah does not punish the elite for the sins of the common folk until they see evil manifest among them while they are capable of denouncing it, yet they do not denounce it." This hadith, "Verily, Allah does not punish the elite..." is reported by Ahmad from the narration of 'Adi ibn 'Umairah, in which there is one whom I do not know, and by al-Tabarani from the narration of his brother al-'Ars ibn 'Umairah, in which there is one I do not recognize.

And Abu Umamah al-Bahili narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "How will you be when your women become insolent, your youth become immoral, and you abandon your striving?" They said, "Will that truly happen, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, and worse than that will occur." They said, "And what is worse than that, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "How will you be when you do not command good and do not forbid evil?" They said, "Will that truly happen, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, and worse than that will occur." They said, "And what is worse than that?" He said, "How will you be when you see good as evil and evil as good?" They said, "Will that truly happen, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, and worse than that will occur." They said, "And what is worse than that?" He said, "How will you be when you command evil and forbid good?" They said, "Will that truly happen, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, and worse than that will occur. Allah the Exalted says, 'By Myself I swear, I will surely send upon them a trial in which the forbearing will be bewildered.'" The hadith of Abu Umamah, "How will you be when your women become insolent..." is reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya with a weak chain, excluding his statement, "How will you be when you command evil and forbid good." And Abu Ya'la reported it from the narration of Abu Hurairah, limited to the first three questions and their answers without the latter two, and its chain is weak.

And from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not stand by a man being killed unjustly, for the curse descends upon those present who do not defend him. And do not stand by a man being beaten unjustly, for the curse descends upon those present who do not defend him." The hadith of 'Ikrimah from Ibn 'Abbas, "Do not stand by a man being killed unjustly..." is reported by al-Tabarani with a weak chain and by al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman with a good chain.

And he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "It is not fitting for a person who witnesses a situation in which there is a right due, that he should not speak it, for it will neither hasten his appointed term nor deprive him of provision that is his." The hadith, "It is not fitting for a person who witnesses a situation..." is reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with the chain of the preceding hadith.

And al-Tirmidhi, who graded it good, and Ibn Majah reported from the narration of Abu Sa'id: "Let not the awe of people prevent a man from speaking the truth when he knows it." This hadith indicates that it is not permissible to enter the dwellings of oppressors and corrupt people, nor to be present in places where evil is witnessed while one is incapable of changing it, for he said, "The curse descends upon those present." And it is not permissible for him to witness evil without a need, excusing himself by being incapable. For this reason, a group of the predecessors chose seclusion due to witnessing evils in the markets, festivals, and gatherings while being incapable of change. This necessitates abandoning the company of people. And for this reason, 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "The ascetics did not wander and leave their homes and children except due to what has befallen us."

When they saw evil manifest and good vanish, and perceived that speech would not be accepted from those who spoke, and witnessed the tribulations, and did not feel secure from being afflicted by them or from punishment descending upon those people—so that they would not be safe from it—they considered that dwelling among wild beasts and eating herbs was better than dwelling among these people in their luxury. Then he recited: "So flee to Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner." So a group fled. Were it not for the secret that Allah, glorified be His praise, placed in prophethood, we would have said they are no better than these others. It has reached us that the angels, peace be upon them, meet them and shake their hands, and clouds and wild beasts pass by one of them, and he calls to them and they answer him, and he asks them where they have been commanded, and they inform him—and he is not a prophet.

And Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever is present at a sin and dislikes it is as if he were absent from it; and whoever is absent from it but approves of it is as if he were present at it." The hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Whoever is present at a sin and dislikes it is as if he were absent from it; and whoever is absent from it but approves of it is as if he were present at it." It was narrated by Ibn ‘Adi, and in it is Yahya ibn Abi Salman. Al-Bukhari said it is a rejected hadith. The meaning of the hadith is that one may be present for a need or it may coincidentally occur before him; but to attend intentionally is prohibited, as indicated by the first hadith.

And Ibn Mas‘ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent no prophet but that he had disciples. The prophet remains among them as long as Allah wills, working among them by the Book of Allah and His command. Then when Allah takes His prophet, the disciples remain, working by the Book of Allah, His command, and the Sunnah of their prophet. When they pass away, there come after them people who mount the pulpits, saying what they do not know and doing what is disapproved. When you see that, it is incumbent upon every believer to strive against them with his hand; if he cannot, then with his tongue; if he cannot, then with his heart—and beyond that there is no Islam." The hadith of Ibn Mas‘ud: "Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent no prophet but that he had disciples..." Muslim narrated something similar.

And Ibn Mas‘ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: There were people of a village who committed sins, and among them were four men who disapproved of what they did. One of them stood and said: "You are doing such and such," and he began to forbid them and inform them of the ugliness of their deeds. They began to rebut him and did not desist from their actions. So he reviled them, and they reviled him; he fought them and they overpowered him. So he withdrew and said: "O Allah, I forbade them but they did not obey me; I reviled them and they reviled me; I fought them and they overpowered me." Then he left. Then the second stood and forbade them, but they did not obey him; he reviled them and they reviled him. So he withdrew and said: "O Allah, I forbade them but they did not obey me; I reviled them and they reviled me; and had I fought them, they would have overpowered me." Then he left. Then the third stood and forbade them, but they did not obey him. So he withdrew and said: "O Allah, I forbade them but they did not obey me; and had I reviled them, they would have reviled me; and had I fought them, they would have overpowered me." Then he left. Then the fourth stood and said: "O Allah, had I forbidden them, they would have disobeyed me; had I reviled them, they would have reviled me; and had I fought them, they would have overpowered me." Then he left. Ibn Mas‘ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The fourth was the lowest in rank among them, and few among you are like him.

And Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: It was said: "O Messenger of Allah, will a village be destroyed while there are righteous people in it?" He said: "Yes." It was said: "Why, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Due to their negligence and their silence regarding the sins against Allah, the Exalted." The hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas: "It was said: 'O Messenger of Allah, will a village be destroyed while there are righteous people in it?' He said: 'Yes.' It was said: 'Why, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Due to their negligence and their silence regarding the sins against Allah.'" It was reported by Al-Bazzar and Al-Tabarani with a weak chain.

And Jabir ibn ‘Abd Allah said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Allah, blessed and exalted, revealed to an angel among the angels: 'Overturn such-and-such a city upon its inhabitants.' He said: 'O Lord, among them is Your servant so-and-so, who has not disobeyed You for an instant.' He said: 'Overturn it upon him and upon them, for his face never frowned in anger at any time.'" The hadith of Jabir: "Allah revealed to an angel among the angels: 'Overturn such-and-such a city upon its inhabitants.' He said: 'O Lord, among them is Your servant so-and-so...'" It was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat and Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu‘ab, and it was deemed weak. What is preserved is from the saying of Malik ibn Dinar.

And ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The people of a village were punished—there were eighteen thousand among them—their deeds were like the deeds of the prophets." They said: "O Messenger of Allah, how?" He said: "They did not become angry for the sake of Allah, nor did they enjoin good nor forbid evil." The hadith of ‘A’ishah: "The people of a village were punished—there were eighteen thousand among them—their deeds were like the deeds of the prophets." I have not found it attributed to the Prophet. Ibn Abi Al-Dunya and Abu Al-Shaykh reported from Ibrahim ibn ‘Umar Al-San‘ani: "Allah revealed to Joshua son of Nun: 'I will destroy from your people forty thousand of the best of them and sixty thousand of the worst of them.' He said: 'O Lord, these are the worst, but what about the best?' He said: 'They did not become angry for My anger, and they would eat and drink with them.'" And from ‘Urwah...

His father said: Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, which of Your servants is most beloved to You?" He said: "The one who hastens to My will as the eagle hastens to its prey, and who is as eager for My righteous servants as the infant is eager for the breast, and who becomes angry when My prohibitions are violated as the leopard becomes angry for itself—for when the leopard is angry for itself, it cares not whether the people are few or many." This indicates the virtue of enjoining good, despite the severity of fear. And Abu Dharr al-Ghifari said: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: "O Messenger of God, is there a jihad other than fighting the polytheists?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Yes, O Abu Bakr. Verily, God Almighty has mujahideen on earth better than the martyrs—living, provided for, walking upon the earth. God boasts of them to the angels of heaven, and Paradise is adorned for them as Umm Salamah adorned herself for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: "O Messenger of God, and who are they?" He said: "Those who enjoin good and forbid evil, those who love for God's sake and hate for God's sake." Then he said: "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, verily a servant among them will be in a chamber above chambers, above the chambers of the martyrs. The chamber has three hundred thousand doors of ruby and green emerald, upon each door a light. And verily a man among them will be wed to three hundred thousand dark-eyed houris; whenever he turns to one of them and looks at her, she says to him: 'Do you remember such-and-such a day when you enjoined good and forbade evil?' Every time he looks at one of them, she reminds him of a station where he enjoined good and forbade evil." The narration of Abu Dharr: Abu Bakr said: "O Messenger of God, is there a jihad other than fighting the polytheists?" He said: "Yes, O Abu Bakr. Verily, God Almighty has mujahideen on earth better than the martyrs." Then he mentioned the hadith, and in it he said: "They are those who enjoin good and forbid evil." The hadith in its full length—I have not found a source for it, and it is rejected. And Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, may God be pleased with him, said: I said: "O Messenger of God, which martyr is most honored with God, Mighty and Majestic?" He said: "A man who stood before an unjust ruler, enjoined him to good and forbade him from evil, and was killed for it. If he is not killed, then the pen does not record [sin] for him after that, even if he lives as long as he lives." The narration of Abu 'Ubaydah: I said: "O Messenger of God, which martyr is most honored with God?" He said: "A man who stood before an unjust ruler, enjoined him to good and forbade him from evil, and was killed for it." The hadith was reported by al-Bazzar, limited to this without his saying "If he is not killed..." to the end, and this addition is rejected. In it is Abu al-Hasan, not well-known, unrecognized. And al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The best martyrs of my community is a man who stood before a tyrannical leader, enjoined him to good and forbade him from evil, and was killed for that. That martyr's station in Paradise is between Hamzah and Ja'far." The narration of al-Hasan al-Basri, mursal: "The best martyrs of my community is a man who stood before a tyrannical leader, enjoined him to good and forbade him from evil, and was killed for that. That martyr's station in Paradise is between Hamzah and Ja'far." I have not seen it from the narration of al-Hasan. And al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak authenticated its chain from the narration of Jabir: "The master of martyrs is Hamzah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and a man who stood before a tyrannical leader, enjoined and forbade him, and was killed." And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "Wretched are the people who do not enjoin justice, and wretched are the people who do not enjoin good and forbid evil." The narration of 'Umar: "Wretched are the people who do not enjoin justice, and wretched are the people who do not enjoin good and forbid evil." Reported by Abu al-Shaykh ibn Hibban from the narration of Jabir with a weak chain. As for the narration of 'Umar, Abu Mansur al-Daylami indicated it by saying: "In the chapter," and 'Ali ibn Mu'abbad reported it in the book "al-Ta'ah wa al-Ma'siyah" from the narration of al-Hasan, mursal. As for the narrations: Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, said: "You must enjoin good and forbid evil, or God will empower over you a tyrannical ruler who will not respect your elder nor have mercy on your young. Your best will supplicate against him, but they will not be answered; you will seek victory but not be aided; you will seek forgiveness but not be forgiven." Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, was asked about the dead among the living, and he said: "The one who does not reject evil with his hand, his tongue, or his heart." And Malik ibn Dinar said: A scholar from the scholars of the Children of Israel used to have men and women visit his home; he would admonish them and remind them of the days of God, Mighty and Majestic. One day he saw one of his sons flirting with a woman, and he said: "Gently, my son, gently." He fell from his couch, his phlegm was cut off, his wife miscarried, and his sons were killed in the army. Then God Almighty revealed to the prophet of his time: "Inform so-and-so the news that I will never bring forth from your loins a righteous one forever. Was your anger for Me only that you said: 'Gently, my son'?"

O my son, be not hasty. Hudhayfah said: "A time will come upon people when a donkey's carcass among them will be more beloved to them than a believer who commands them to good and forbids them from evil." And God Almighty revealed to Joshua son of Nun, peace be upon him: "I will destroy from your people forty thousand of their best and sixty thousand of their worst." He said: "O Lord, these are the worst, but what of the best?" He said: "They did not become angry for My anger, and they ate and drank with them." And Bilal ibn Sa'd said: "When a sin is concealed, it harms only its doer; but when it is made public and not changed, it harms the common people." And Ka'b al-Ahbar said to Abu Muslim al-Khawlani: "What is your standing among your people?" He said: "Good." Ka'b said: "The Torah says otherwise." He said: "What does it say?" He said: "It says that when a man commands good and forbids evil, his standing among his people becomes bad." He said: "The Torah has spoken truth, and Abu Muslim has lied." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, used to visit the rulers, then he refrained from them. It was said to him: "If you visited them, perhaps they would feel it within themselves." He said: "I fear that if I speak, they will think that what is with me is other than what is with me; and if I remain silent, I fear I will sin." This indicates that whoever is incapable of commanding good must distance himself from that place and conceal himself from it, so that no evil occurs in his presence. And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, said: "The first part of jihad you will lose is jihad with your hands, then jihad with your tongues, then jihad with your hearts. When the heart does not recognize good nor reject evil, it is overturned, making its top its bottom." And Sahl ibn 'Abdullah, may God have mercy on him, said: "Any servant who acts in any matter of his religion as he is commanded or forbidden, and clings to it when affairs become corrupt, times grow strange, and the age is troubled, he is among those who have stood for God in his age by commanding good and forbidding evil." Its meaning is that if he is only capable of himself, and he stands with it and rejects the conditions of others with his heart, then he has brought what is the utmost in his right. And it was said to al-Fudayl: "Will you not command and forbid?" He said: "A people commanded and forbade, then they disbelieved, because they did not have patience over what befell them." And it was said to al-Thawri: "Will you not command good and forbid evil?" He said: "When the sea bursts forth, who can dam it?" Thus, it has become clear by these proofs that commanding good and forbidding evil is obligatory, and its obligation does not fall away with capability except by the establishment of one who performs it. Let us now mention its conditions and the conditions of its obligation.

The Second Chapter: On the Pillars of Commanding Good and Its Conditions. Know that the pillars in *hisbah*, which is an inclusive term for commanding good and forbidding evil, are four: the one who commands, the one commanded, the matter commanded, and the act of commanding itself. These are four pillars, and each has its conditions.

The First Pillar: The One Who Commands, and it has conditions: that he be legally responsible, a Muslim, and capable. Thus excluded from it are the insane, the child, the unbeliever, and the incapable. Included in it are individual subjects, even if they are not authorized, and included are the sinner, the slave, and the woman. Let us mention the reason for stipulating what we have stipulated and the reason for discarding what we have discarded.

As for the first condition, which is legal responsibility, its reason for stipulation is not hidden, for the non-responsible is not obligated by command. What we mentioned we intended as a condition for obligation. As for the possibility and permissibility of the action, it requires only intellect, such that even a child approaching puberty who is discerning, even if not legally responsible, may reject evil, may spill wine and break musical instruments, and if he does that, he attains reward by it, and none may prevent him, since he is not legally responsible, for this is an act of worship and he is among its people, like prayer, leadership, and other acts of worship. His ruling is not the ruling of positions of authority such that legal responsibility is stipulated therein. For this reason, we affirm it for the slave and individual subjects. Yes, in preventing by action and nullifying evil there is a kind of authority and sovereignty, but it is acquired by mere faith, like killing the polytheist, nullifying his causes, and seizing his weapons, for the child may do that where he is not harmed by it. Preventing immorality is like preventing disbelief.

As for the second condition, which is faith, its reason for stipulation is not hidden, for this is support of the religion, so how can one of its people be one who denies the foundation of the religion and is an enemy to it? As for the third condition, which is righteousness, some have considered it and said: "The sinner may not command." They perhaps argued for it with the censure directed at those who command what they do not do, like His saying, exalted is He: "Do you command people to righteousness and forget yourselves?" and His saying, exalted is He: "How despicable it is with God that you say what you do not do," and by what is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "On the night I was taken on the night journey, I passed by people whose lips were being cut with scissors of fire. I said: 'Who are you?' They said: 'We used to command good and not do it, and forbid evil and do it.'" The hadith "I passed on the night I was taken on the night journey by people whose lips were cut with scissors of fire" has preceded in the chapter on knowledge.

It is related that God Almighty revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him: "Admonish yourself; if you are admonished, then admonish the people; otherwise, be ashamed before Me." Some have argued by way of analogy that guiding others is a branch of being guided oneself, and likewise, reforming others is a branch of one's own rectitude, and reform is the purification due from the capital of righteousness. For how can one who is not righteous in himself reform another? When can the shadow be straight if the stick is crooked? All that they have mentioned is mere imaginings. The truth is that a transgressor may perform *hisbah* (enjoining good and forbidding evil). Its proof is that we say: Is it a condition for performing *hisbah* that its practitioner be infallible, protected from all sins? If that is stipulated, it would rupture the consensus and then seal the door of *hisbah* entirely, for there is no infallibility for the Companions, let alone those below them. As for the Prophets, peace be upon them, there is disagreement concerning their infallibility from errors, and the Mighty Qur'an indicates the attribution of sin to Adam, peace be upon him, as well as to a group of Prophets. For this reason, Sa'id ibn Jubayr said: "If none were to command good and forbid evil except one in whom there is no fault, then no one would command anything." Malik was amazed at this from Sa'id ibn Jubayr. If they claim that this condition is not required for minor sins, such that one wearing silk may forbid fornication and drinking wine, we say: Does a wine-drinker have the right to fight the disbelievers and perform *hisbah* upon them by forbidding disbelief? If they say no, they rupture the consensus, for the Muslim armies have never ceased to include the righteous and the wicked, the wine-drinker and the oppressor of orphans, and they were not prevented from fighting, neither in the era of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, nor after him. If they say yes, we say: Does a wine-drinker have the right to forbid murder or not? If they say no, we say: What is the difference between him and one wearing silk, since it is permissible for the latter to forbid wine? Murder is a major sin relative to drinking, just as drinking is relative to wearing silk, so there is no difference. If they say yes and differentiate the matter by saying that everyone who commits something may not forbid its like or what is lesser, but may only forbid what is greater, this is arbitrary. For just as it is not far-fetched that a drinker may forbid fornication and murder, from where is it far-fetched that a fornicator may forbid drinking? Indeed, from where is it far-fetched that he may drink and forbid his youths and servants from drinking, saying: "Desisting and forbidding are obligatory. From where does my disobedience to God Almighty in one matter oblige me to disobey in the other?" And if forbidding is obligatory upon me, from where does its obligation fall away due to my committing a sin? For it is impossible to say: "Forbidding the drinking of wine is obligatory upon him as long as he does not drink, but if he drinks, the obligation to forbid falls away." If it is said: "Then, by this reasoning, one would have to say that the obligation of ablution and prayer is upon me, so I perform ablution even if I do not pray, and I take the pre-dawn meal even if I do not fast, because both the pre-dawn meal and the fast are recommended for me." But it is said: One of them is conditional upon the other. Similarly, reforming others is conditional upon reforming oneself, so let him begin with himself, then with those under his care. The answer is that the pre-dawn meal is intended for the fast; were it not for the fast, the pre-dawn meal would not be recommended. What is intended for something else is not independent of that other thing. Reforming others is not intended for reforming the self, nor is reforming the self intended for reforming others, so to claim that one is conditional upon the other is arbitrary. As for ablution and prayer, it is a necessary condition; thus, whoever performs ablution but does not pray has fulfilled the command of ablution, and his punishment is less than the punishment of one who abandons both prayer and ablution. So let the one who abandons both forbidding and desisting be more punished than the one who forbade but did not desist. How can this be, when ablution is a condition not desired for itself but for prayer, so it has no ruling independent of prayer? As for *hisbah*, it is not a condition for desisting and obeying, so there is no similarity between them. If it is said: "Then, by this reasoning, one would have to say that if a man fornicates with a woman who is coerced and her face is veiled, and she uncovers her face by her own choice, the man may perform *hisbah* during the act of fornication, saying: 'You are coerced in the fornication but choosing to uncover your face for a non-mahram, and here I am, a non-mahram to you, so cover your face.' This is a reprehensible *hisbah* that every sensible heart would reject and every sound nature would find abhorrent." The answer is that the truth may be reprehensible, and falsehood may be pleasing to natures. What is followed is the evidence, not the aversion of fancies and imaginings. For we say: His statement to her in that situation, "Do not uncover your face," is it obligatory, permissible, or forbidden? If you say it is obligatory, that is the point, for uncovering is a sin, and forbidding sin is right. If you say it is permissible, then he is allowed to say what is permissible, so what is the meaning of your statement that a transgressor may not perform *hisbah*? If you say it is forbidden, we say: And was this obligatory? From where did it become forbidden due to his committing fornication? It is strange that an obligation should become forbidden because of committing another forbidden act. As for the aversion of natures to it and their rejection of it, it is for two reasons: One is that he abandoned the more important matter and busied himself with what is less important. Just as...

Human nature recoils from abandoning the essential for the trivial, just as it recoils from one who scruples to consume stolen food while persisting in usury, or from one who abstains from backbiting yet bears false witness—for false witness is more vile and severe than backbiting, which is merely reporting an existing truth. This aversion in souls does not indicate that abstaining from backbiting is not obligatory, nor that if one backbites or consumes a morsel of the unlawful, his punishment would not increase. Similarly, his harm in the Hereafter from his own sin is greater than from another's sin, so his preoccupation with the lesser over the greater is repugnant to nature because he neglected the greater, not because he committed the lesser. Thus, if someone seizes a horse and its bridle, then busies himself recovering the bridle while neglecting the horse, human nature recoils from him, and he is seen as blameworthy—not for seeking the bridle, which is not blameworthy, but for neglecting the horse in favor of the bridle. The censure intensifies for abandoning the more important for the lesser. Likewise, the censure of a sinner is viewed with aversion from this perspective, yet this does not mean his censure is inherently blameworthy.

Secondly, censure may be through admonition or through coercion. Admonition is ineffective with one who does not heed it. We say: if one knows his words will not be accepted in censure due to people's awareness of his sinfulness, then censure through admonition is not incumbent upon him, as there is no benefit in his admonition. Sinfulness negates the benefit of his speech, and when the benefit of speech is nullified, the obligation to speak falls away. As for censure through prevention, the aim is coercion, and complete coercion involves both action and proof. If a sinner is coerced by action, he is also coerced by proof, for it may be said to him: "You did not advance upon it." Thus, human nature recoils from coercing him by action while he is already coerced by proof, yet this does not strip the action of its legitimacy—just as defending a Muslim from an oppressor while neglecting one's own oppressed father causes nature to recoil, but defending the Muslim remains rightful. From this, it follows that a sinner is not obliged to censure through admonition those aware of his sinfulness, as they will not heed it. If he is not obliged and knows it will lead to prolonged reproach harming his honor, we say he should not do so either. Thus, one type of censure—admonition—is invalidated by sinfulness, making uprightness a condition for it. As for coercive censure, no such condition applies, so there is no blame on a sinner for destroying wine, breaking musical instruments, or similar acts if he is able. This is the utmost fairness and clarity on the matter.

As for the verses they cite as evidence, the reproach is for their neglect of the known good, not for their enjoining it. Their enjoining indicates the strength of their knowledge, and the punishment of the knowledgeable is more severe because they have no excuse despite their strong knowledge. His saying, exalted is He, "Why do you say what you do not do?" refers to false promises. His saying, mighty and glorious, "And you forget yourselves," reproaches them for forgetting themselves, not for enjoining others, but mentioning their enjoining others serves as evidence of their knowledge and emphasizes the argument against them. His saying, "O son of Maryam, admonish yourself..." pertains to censure through admonition, and we concede that the admonition of a sinner is futile with those aware of his sinfulness. Then His saying, "So be ashamed before Me," does not indicate prohibiting admonishing others; rather, it means: be ashamed before Me, so do not neglect the more important and busy yourself with the lesser, as one might say: "Take care of your father, then your neighbor; otherwise, feel shame."

If it is said: Should it then be permissible for a disbelieving protected person to censure a Muslim if he sees him fornicating, since his saying "Do not fornicate" is inherently true, so it is impossible for it to be forbidden—indeed, it should be permissible or obligatory? We say: If the disbeliever prevents the Muslim by his action, that is an imposition upon him, and he is prevented because it is an imposition, for "Allah has not given the disbelievers over the believers any way." As for merely saying "Do not fornicate," it is not forbidden because it is a prohibition against fornication, but because it displays authority in judging the Muslim, and therein lies humiliation for the one judged. The sinner deserves humiliation, but not from a disbeliever who is more deserving of humiliation than he. This is the reason we forbid him from censure; otherwise, we do not say the disbeliever is punished for saying "Do not fornicate" as a prohibition, but we say if he does not say it, he is punished for it if we consider addressing disbelievers with religious particulars—a point examined in jurisprudence but not fitting our purpose here.

The fourth condition: authorization from the Imam or ruler. Some have stipulated this condition, denying the right of censure to ordinary subjects. This stipulation is invalid, for the verses and reports we have cited indicate that whoever sees an evil and remains silent about it disobeys, as it is obligatory to forbid it wherever it is seen.

However one may view it in general terms, to specify that it requires the delegation of authority from the Imam is an arbitrary ruling with no basis. It is astonishing that the Rawafid went beyond this, saying that commanding the right is not permissible unless the infallible Imam—who is the rightful Imam in their view—has emerged. These are of too low a station to be addressed; rather, the response to them, when they come to the court seeking their rights concerning their blood and wealth, is to say: Your being aided is commanding the right, and extracting your rights from the hands of those who wronged you is forbidding the wrong. Your seeking your right is part of what is right, and this is not the time to refrain from forbidding wrong and seeking rights because the rightful Imam has not yet emerged. If it is said concerning commanding the right that it establishes authority and guardianship and a ruling over the one being ruled, and that is why it is not established for a disbeliever over a Muslim even though it is a right, then it should not be established for individual subjects except by delegation from the ruler and the one in authority. We say: As for the disbeliever, he is prevented because of the authority and honor of ruling involved, and the disbeliever is debased, so he does not deserve to attain the honor of ruling over a Muslim. As for individual Muslims, they deserve this honor by virtue of religion and knowledge, and what it contains of the honor of authority and ruling does not require delegation, like the honor of teaching and informing, for there is no dispute that informing of prohibition and obligation to one who is ignorant and proceeding to wrong out of ignorance does not need the permission of the ruler, and in it is the honor of guidance. And upon the informer is that reproach, and that suffices in it by mere religion. Likewise, forbidding and the explanation of the statement in this is that hisbah has five levels, as will come: The first is informing, the second is admonishing with gentle speech, the third is reproach and rebuke—and I do not mean by reproach obscenity, but rather saying, "O ignorant one, O fool, do you not fear God?" and what runs in this vein—the fourth is prevention by force through direct action, such as breaking musical instruments, pouring out wine, snatching the silk garment from its wearer, and seizing the usurped garment and returning it to its owner, and the fifth is intimidation and threat of beating and directly beating him until he desists from what he is upon, like one persistent in backbiting and slander. For depriving his tongue is not possible, but he is compelled to choose silence by beating. This may require seeking help and gathering aides from both sides, and that may lead to fighting. The aspect of the other levels being free from the need of the Imam's permission is not hidden, except the fifth level, for in it there is consideration to come. As for informing and admonishing, how could they need the Imam's permission? As for reproaching, calling foolish, attributing to wickedness and lack of fear of God, and what runs in its vein, it is truthful speech, and truth is deserved; rather, the best of ranks is a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler—the hadith: "The best jihad is a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler," reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri as is in the hadith. So if it is permissible to judge the Imam despite his opposition, how could it need his permission? Likewise, breaking musical instruments and pouring out wines, for it is undertaking what is known to be right without independent reasoning, so it does not depend on the Imam. As for gathering aides and brandishing weapons, that may lead to general strife, so in it there is consideration to come. The continuous practice of the predecessors in hisbah over the rulers is decisive for their consensus on independence from delegation. Rather, everyone who commands right, if the ruler is pleased with it, then that is it; if he is angered by it, then his anger at it is a wrong that must be denounced, so how could it need his permission in denouncing him? Indicating that is the practice of the predecessors in denouncing the Imams, as is reported that Marwan ibn al-Hakam gave the sermon before the Eid prayer, and a man said to him, "The sermon is only after the prayer." Marwan said to him, "Leave that, O so-and-so." Abu Sa'id said, "As for this, he has fulfilled what is upon him. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to us, 'Whoever among you sees a wrong, let him change it with his hand; if he cannot, then with his tongue; if he cannot, then with his heart, and that is the weakest of faith.'" The hadith: "Marwan gave the sermon before the prayer on Eid," the hadith, and in it the hadith of Abu Sa'id marfu': "Whoever sees a wrong," reported by Muslim. They had understood from these generalities the inclusion of the sultans under them, so how could it need their permission? And it is reported that when al-Mahdi came to Mecca, he stayed there as long as God willed, then when he began the circumambulation, he pushed the people away from the House. Abdullah ibn Marzuq leapt up, grabbed him by his cloak, then shook him and said, "Look at what you are doing! Who made you more entitled to this House than one who came to it from afar, until when he reached it, you came between him and it? God Almighty has said, 'Equal are the one who dwells therein and the visitor.' Who gave you this?" He looked at his face and recognized him, for he was from their clients, and said, "Abdullah ibn Marzuq?" He said, "Yes." He was taken and brought to Baghdad. He disliked punishing him with a punishment that would bring infamy upon him.

The common folk placed him in the stable of beasts to tend the animals, and they joined to him a vicious horse of ill temperament so that the horse might trample him. But Allah, the Exalted, softened the horse for him. Then they confined him to a room and locked it, and al-Mahdi kept the key with him. After three days, he had emerged into the garden eating herbs. Al-Mahdi was informed of this and said to him, "Who released you?" He replied, "The One who imprisoned me." Al-Mahdi cried out and shouted, "Do you not fear that I will kill you?" Abdullah raised his head to him, laughing, and said, "If you possessed power over life or death..." He remained imprisoned until al-Mahdi died, then they released him, and he returned to Mecca. It is said he had made a vow to himself that if Allah delivered him from their hands, he would sacrifice a hundred camels, and he worked at this until he had sacrificed them.

It is narrated from Hibban ibn Abdullah: Harun al-Rashid went for leisure to al-Duwayn, and with him was a man from Banu Hashim, Sulayman ibn Abi Ja'far. Harun said to him, "You had a singing girl who sang beautifully, so bring her to us." She came and sang, but he did not praise her singing. He said to her, "What is the matter with you?" She replied, "This is not my lute." He said to the servant, "Bring us her lute." He went and brought the lute, and encountered an old man gathering date pits. He said, "Make way, old man!" The old man raised his head, saw the lute, took it from the servant, and struck it against the ground. The servant took it and went with it to the keeper of the quarter, saying, "Guard this, for it is sought by the Commander of the Faithful." The keeper of the quarter said to him, "There is no one in Baghdad more devout than this man; how could he be sought by the Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "Listen to what I tell you." Then he entered upon Harun and said, "I passed by an old man gathering date pits and said to him, 'Make way!' He raised his head, saw the lute, took it, and struck it against the ground, breaking it." Harun became enraged, furious, and his eyes reddened. Sulayman ibn Abi Ja'far said to him, "What is this anger, O Commander of the Faithful? Send to the keeper of the quarter to strike his neck and cast him into the Tigris." He said, "No, but we shall send for him and question him first."

The messenger came and said, "Answer the Commander of the Faithful." He said, "Yes." He said, "Mount." He said, "No." He came walking until he stood at the palace gate. It was said to Harun, "The old man has come." Harun said to his companions, "What do you think? Should we remove what is before us of objectionable things before this old man enters, or move to another gathering where there is nothing objectionable?" They said to him, "Let us move to another gathering where there is nothing objectionable, may you be set right." So they moved to a gathering where there was nothing objectionable. Then he ordered the old man to be admitted. In his sleeve was the bag containing the date pits. The servant said to him, "Take this out of your sleeve and enter upon the Commander of the Faithful." He said, "What is this? My supper tonight?" He said, "We will give you supper." He said, "I have no need of your supper." Harun said to the servant, "What do you want from him?" He said, "In his sleeve are date pits; I told him to discard them and enter upon the Commander of the Faithful." He said, "Leave him, let him not discard them." He entered, gave greetings, and sat. Harun said to him, "O old man, what compelled you to do what you did?" He said, "And what did I do?" Harun became too ashamed to say, "You broke my lute." When he pressed him, he said, "I heard your father and your forefathers reciting this verse from the pulpit: 'Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression.' I saw an objectionable thing and changed it." So he changed it. By Allah, he said nothing but this.

When he left, the Caliph gave a man a purse of money and said, "Follow the old man. If you see him saying, 'I said to the Commander of the Faithful,' and he says to me such and such, then give him nothing. But if you see him speaking to no one, give him the purse." When he left the palace, there was a date pit on the ground that had sunk in, and he began trying to extract it, speaking to no one. He said to him, "The Commander of the Faithful says to you, take this purse." He said, "Tell the Commander of the Faithful to return it from whence he took it." And it is narrated that after finishing his words, he turned his attention to the date pit he was trying to extract from the ground, saying, "I see the world, for whom it is in his hands, as anxieties; whenever they increase for him, it humiliates the noble for it with meanness and honors everyone who is humiliated before it. If you have no need of a thing, leave it and take what you are in need of."

And from Sufyan al-Thawri, may Allah have mercy on him, he said: Al-Mahdi performed Hajj in the year one hundred and sixty-six. I saw him stoning the Jamrah of al-'Aqabah while the people were striking right and left with whips. I stopped and said, "O fair of face, narrate to us." Ayman narrated from Wa'il from Qudamah ibn Abdullah al-Kalabi, who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, stoning the Jamrah on the Day of Sacrifice upon a camel, with no striking, no driving away, no whipping, and no 'to you, to you.' The narration of Qudamah ibn Abdullah: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, stoning the Jamrah on the Day of Sacrifice upon a camel, with no striking, no driving away, no whipping, and no 'to you, to you.' Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and said it is hasan sahih, as did al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. As for his statement at the beginning that al-Thawri said al-Mahdi performed Hajj in the year sixty-six, it is not correct, for al-Thawri died in the year one hundred and sixty-one. And here you are, the people are striking between...

He stretched his hands to the right and left, then said to a man among them, "Who is this?" It was said, "Sufyan al-Thawri." He said, "O Sufyan, if it were al-Mansur, he would not have tolerated you for this." He replied, "If al-Mansur had informed you, you would have fallen short of what you are in." It was then said to him, "He addressed you as 'O fair-faced one' and did not say 'O Commander of the Faithful.'" So he said, "Seek him out." Sufyan was sought but went into hiding.

It has been narrated concerning al-Ma’mun that it reached him that a pious man was going among the people, commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil, without having been ordered to do so by him. He ordered that he be brought before him. When he stood before him, he said, "I have been informed that you considered yourself fit to command good and forbid evil without our having ordered you." Al-Ma’mun was seated on a chair, looking into a book or a document, and he neglected it, so it fell and ended up under his foot without him realizing. The pious man said to him, "Lift your foot from the names of Allah the Exalted, then say whatever you wish." Al-Ma’mun did not understand his meaning and said, "What are you saying?" until he repeated it three times without him understanding. Then he said, "Either you lift it, or permit me to lift it." Al-Ma’mun looked under his foot and saw the book. He took it, kissed it, and was ashamed. Then he turned back and said, "Why do you command good when Allah has appointed that to us, the People of the House? We are those about whom Allah said, 'Those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer, give zakah, enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong.'" He said, "You speak truth, O Commander of the Faithful. You are as you have described yourself in terms of authority and power. However, we are your helpers and allies in it, and none denies that except one ignorant of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace be upon him. Allah says, 'The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong...' And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, 'The believer to the believer is like a building, one part strengthening the other.' This hadith is agreed upon from Abu Musa. It has preceded in the third chapter on the manners of companionship. You have been given authority in the land, and here is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. If you submit to them, you will be grateful to whoever assists you for their sanctity. But if you are arrogant toward them and do not submit to what is incumbent upon you from them, then He to whom your command belongs and in whose hand is your might—He has stipulated that He will not waste the reward of those who do good. So say now whatever you wish."

Al-Ma’mun was impressed by his speech and pleased with it, saying, "One like you is permitted to command good. Proceed with what you were upon, by our order and according to our view." So the man continued upon that.

In the course of these narratives is the clarification of the proof for dispensing with permission. If it is said, "Do you then affirm the guardianship of commanding good and forbidding evil for the child over the parent, the slave over the master, the wife over the husband, the student over the teacher, and the subjects over the ruler absolutely, just as it is affirmed for the parent over the child, the master over the slave, the husband over the wife, the teacher over the student, and the sovereign over the subjects? Or is there a distinction between them?" Know that what we hold is that the foundation of guardianship is affirmed, but there is a distinction in the details. Let us suppose this regarding the child with the parent. We say: We have arranged for commanding good five levels. The child has the guardianship of commanding good with the first two levels, which are informing, then admonishing and counseling with gentleness. He does not have the guardianship with reviling, harshness, and threat, nor with directly striking—these are the last two levels. As for the third level, where it leads to harm to the parent and his anger, this is a matter of consideration. It would be, for example, breaking his stick, spilling his wine, untying the threads from his garments woven of silk, returning to the owners what he finds in his house of unlawful wealth that he has usurped or stolen or taken from the flow of provision from the tax of the Muslims—if its owner is known—and effacing the images engraved on his walls and carved in the wood of his house, and breaking vessels of gold and silver. For his action in these matters does not pertain to the person of the father, unlike striking and reviling. However, the parent is harmed by it and becomes angry because of it, except that the child’s action is right, and the father’s anger stems from his love for falsehood and the unlawful. The more apparent according to analogy is that this is affirmed for the child; indeed, it is obligatory upon him to do that. It is not far-fetched to consider in it the ugliness of the wrong and the extent of harm and anger. If the wrong is flagrant and anger over it is slight, as with spilling the wine of one whose anger is not severe, that is clear. But if the wrong is minor and the anger is severe, as if he has vessels of crystal or glass with images of animals, and breaking them entails great financial loss—this sin does not run the course of wine and the like. All of this is a field of consideration.

If it is said, "From where do you say he does not have the guardianship with harshness, striking, and pressing to abandon falsehood? For the command to do good and forbid evil in the Book and the Sunnah has come generally, without specification. As for the prohibition of showing disrespect..."

And harm has been established, and it is specific to matters not related to committing wrongdoings. Thus we say it has been established particularly regarding the father, necessitating an exception from the general rule, for there is no dispute that the executioner does not have the right to kill his father for adultery as a prescribed punishment, nor to personally carry out the punishment upon him. Indeed, he should not personally kill his unbelieving father; rather, if he were to cut off his hand, retaliation would not be obligatory upon him, and he would not have the right to harm him in retaliation. Reports have come regarding this, and some of them are established by consensus—the reports stating that the executioner does not have the right to flog his father for adultery, nor to personally carry out the punishment upon him, nor to personally kill his unbelieving father, and that if he were to cut off his hand, retaliation would not be obligatory. Then it is said, "And some of them are established by consensus." I said, "I have found nothing on this except the hadith: 'A parent is not retaliated against for [the killing of] a child,' reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of 'Umar." Al-Tirmidhi said there is inconsistency in it. So if it is not permissible for him to harm his father with a punishment that is a right due to a past offense, then it is not permissible for him to harm him with a punishment meant to prevent a future, anticipated offense—indeed, it is more appropriate. And this arrangement should also apply to the slave and the wife with the master and the husband, for they are close to the child in the binding nature of the right, although the right of ownership is stronger than the right of marriage. But in the report, "If prostration to a creature were permissible, I would have commanded the woman to prostrate to her husband"—the hadith, "If prostration to a creature were permissible, I would have commanded the woman to prostrate to her husband," was mentioned earlier in the chapter on marriage—and this indicates the strength of the right as well. As for the subjects with the ruler, the matter is more stringent than with the child; they have nothing with him except informing and advising. As for the third category, there is consideration therein, for storming in to take wealth from his treasury and returning it to the owners, and unraveling threads from his silk garments, and breaking wine vessels in his house, nearly leads to breaching his dignity and diminishing his majesty, and that is prohibited. The prohibition against it has come, just as the prohibition against remaining silent on wrongdoing has come—the hadith prohibiting openly rebuking the ruler in a manner that leads to breaching his dignity, reported by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak from the narration of 'Iyad ibn Ghanm al-Ash'ari: "Whoever has advice for one in authority, let him not speak to him publicly, but take him by the hand and be alone with him. If he accepts it, he accepts it; otherwise, he has fulfilled what is upon him and what is for him." He said its chain is sound. And al-Tirmidhi has it and graded it good from the narration of Abu Bakrah: "Whoever dishonors God's authority on earth, God will dishonor him on earth." Thus two harms also conflict therein, and the matter is entrusted to independent reasoning arising from considering the severity of the wrongdoing and the extent to which his majesty is diminished due to storming in upon him, and that is something which cannot be precisely regulated. As for the student and the teacher, the matter between them is lighter, for the one honored is the teacher who imparts knowledge from the perspective of religion, and there is no sanctity for a scholar who does not act upon his knowledge. So he may treat him according to the knowledge he learned from him. And it is narrated that al-Hasan was asked about the child: how should he advise his father? He said, "He admonishes him as long as he does not become angry; if he becomes angry, he remains silent toward him." The fifth condition is being capable, and it is not hidden that the incapable one has no duty of enjoining good except with his heart, for everyone who loves God hates His disobedience and rejects it. And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said, "Strive against the disbelievers with your hands; if you are unable except to frown in their faces, then do so." And know that the cessation of obligation does not stop at physical incapacity; rather, what is joined to it is fearing harm that will befall him, for that is in the meaning of incapacity. Likewise, if he does not fear harm but knows that his rejection will not benefit, then he should consider two meanings: one, the rejection not being beneficial, preventing it; and the other, fearing harm. From considering these two meanings, four situations arise: The first is that the two meanings combine, such that he knows his speech will not benefit and he will be beaten if he speaks. Then the duty of enjoining good is not obligatory upon him; indeed, it may be prohibited in some instances. Yes, he is obliged not to attend places of wrongdoing and to seclude himself in his house so that he does not witness it, and not to go out except for an important need or obligation. And he is not obliged to leave that town and emigrate except if he is compelled into corruption or forced to assist rulers in oppression and wrongdoings; then he must emigrate if he is able to do so, for coercion is not an excuse for one who is able to escape from coercion. The second situation is that both meanings are absent, such that he knows the wrongdoing will be removed by his word and action, and no harm will befall him; then rejecting it is obligatory upon him, and this is absolute capability. The third situation is that he knows his rejection will not benefit, but he does not fear harm; then the duty of enjoining good is not obligatory due to its lack of benefit, but it is recommended to manifest the symbols of Islam and remind people of the command of religion. The fourth situation is the opposite of this: that he knows harm will befall him, but the wrongdoing will be nullified by his action, as he is able to throw...

The wicked man's bottle with a stone, breaking it and spilling the wine, or striking the lute in his hand with a swift blow, shattering it immediately, thus halting this evil act—yet knowing that he will retaliate by striking his head—this is not obligatory nor forbidden, but rather recommended. This is indicated by the report we cited concerning the merit of speaking a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler, and there is no doubt that this entails risk. It is also supported by what is narrated from Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, who said: "I heard some words from a caliph and intended to rebuke him, knowing I would be killed. Death did not deter me, but I was among a crowd of people and feared that showing off for the sake of others would overtake me, causing me to be killed without sincerity in the act." If it is asked: What then is the meaning of God's words, 'And do not throw yourselves into destruction'? We say: There is no dispute that a single Muslim may charge into the ranks of the disbelievers and fight, even knowing he will be killed. This might seem contrary to the verse's implication, but it is not so. Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Destruction is not that; rather, it is abandoning spending in obedience to God Almighty—meaning whoever does not do that has destroyed himself." Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said: "Destruction is to commit a sin and then say, 'I will not be forgiven.'" Abu 'Ubaydah said: "It is to commit a sin and then perform no good deed thereafter until he perishes." If it is permissible to fight the disbelievers until killed, it is likewise permissible in enjoining good. However, if he knows his assault on the disbelievers will cause no harm, like a blind man throwing himself upon the ranks or an incapacitated person, that is forbidden and falls under the general meaning of the verse on destruction. It is only permissible for him to proceed if he knows he will fight until killed, or knows he will break the hearts of the disbelievers by them witnessing his bravery and their belief that all Muslims show little concern and love martyrdom in God's path, thereby breaking their strength. Similarly, it is permissible—indeed recommended—for the enjoiner of good to expose himself to beating or killing if his enjoining has an effect in removing evil, breaking the prestige of the wicked, or strengthening the hearts of the religious. But if he sees a dominant wicked man with a sword at his side and a cup in his hand, and knows that if he rebukes him, he will drink the cup and strike his neck, this is something I see no justification for in enjoining good—it is sheer destruction. The objective is to have an impact on religion and sacrifice oneself for it; exposing oneself to destruction without effect has no justification—rather, it should be forbidden. Enjoining good is only recommended if he is able to nullify the evil or his action yields benefit, provided the harm is limited to himself. If he knows that others among his companions, relatives, or associates will also be struck, then enjoining good is not permissible—indeed, it is forbidden—because he is incapable of preventing the evil except by leading to another evil, and that is not capability at all. Even if he knows that his enjoining would nullify that evil, but it becomes a cause for another evil committed by someone other than the one being enjoined, it is not lawful for him to proceed, the clearer view being that the aim is the absolute absence of religious evils, whether for Zayd or 'Amr. For example, if a person has a lawful drink that has become impure due to contamination, and he knows that if he spills it, his companion or children will drink wine due to lack of lawful drink, there is no sense in spilling it. It may be argued that he should spill it, thereby nullifying an evil, while the drinking of wine is the blameworthy act, and the enjoiner is incapable of preventing that evil. Some have held this view, and it is not far-fetched, for these are jurisprudential issues where judgment can only be based on conjecture. It is not unlikely to distinguish between degrees of the evil being changed and the evil to which enjoining leads. If someone is slaughtering a sheep for another to eat, and he knows that preventing it would lead him to slaughter and eat a human, there is no sense in this enjoining. Yes, if preventing him from slaughtering a human or cutting off his path leads him to seize his property, that has merit. These are subtle points falling within the realm of independent reasoning, and the enjoiner must follow his own reasoning in all this. Due to these subtleties, we say the common person should only enjoin good in clear, known matters like drinking wine, fornication, and abandoning prayer. As for what is known to be sinful relative to surrounding actions and requires independent reasoning, if the common person delves into it, what he corrupts will be more than what he rectifies. From this, the view of those who do not affirm the authority of enjoining good except by appointment of the ruler is strengthened, for perhaps one who is unqualified due to deficient knowledge or deficient religiosity may undertake it, leading to various disorders. The veil over this will be lifted, God willing. If it is asked: Since you have specified knowledge that harm will befall him or that his enjoining will not be effective, what if instead of knowledge there is conjecture—what is the ruling? We say: Strong conjecture in these matters...

On the meaning of knowledge: The distinction becomes apparent when conjecture and knowledge conflict, for definitive knowledge is given precedence over conjecture. Another distinction between knowledge and conjecture lies in other contexts, namely that it absolves one from the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil when one knows with certainty that it will yield no benefit. If one's predominant conjecture is that it will not benefit, yet there remains a possibility that it might, and moreover, no harm is anticipated, scholars have differed regarding its obligation. The more evident position is that it remains obligatory, as there is no harm in it, and its benefit is anticipated. The general command to enjoin good and forbid evil necessitates obligation in every circumstance. We only exempt from it, by way of specification, that which one knows will yield no benefit—whether through consensus or evident analogy—since the command is not intended for its own sake but for the one commanded. Thus, when despair of benefit is certain, there is no benefit in it. However, if there is no despair, the obligation should not be waived.

If it is asked: Regarding the anticipated harm—if it is neither certain nor known through predominant conjecture, but is instead doubtful, or if one's predominant conjecture is that no harm will befall, yet there remains a possibility of harm—does this possibility waive the obligation, such that it is only obligatory when one is certain that no harm will occur? Or is it obligatory in every case except when one's predominant conjecture is that harm will befall? We say: If the predominant conjecture is that harm will befall, it is not obligatory; if the predominant conjecture is that no harm will befall, it is obligatory. Mere possibility does not waive the obligation, for this is possible in every act of enjoining good. If one doubts without any preponderance, this is a matter for consideration. It may be said: The default is obligation by virtue of the general principles, and it is only waived due to harm, and harm is that which is conjectured or known, such that it is anticipated. This is the more evident position. It may also be said: It is only obligatory upon one if one knows or conjectures that no harm will befall oneself. The first view is sounder, considering the general principles that necessitate enjoining good.

If it is asked: Anticipation of harm varies with cowardice and boldness. The cowardly, weak-hearted person sees the distant as near, as if witnessing it and being alarmed by it. The reckless, brave person considers harm unlikely to befall them due to their innate optimism, to the extent that they do not believe in it until it occurs. Upon what, then, should reliance be placed? We say: Reliance is upon a balanced disposition, sound intellect, and temperament. For cowardice is an ailment, a weakness in the heart caused by deficiency and shortcoming in strength, while recklessness is excess in strength and a departure from balance through increase. Both are deficiencies; perfection lies in balance, which is expressed as courage. Each of cowardice and recklessness may stem at times from deficiency in intellect, at times from a flaw in temperament through shortcoming or excess. For one whose temperament is balanced in the quality of cowardice and boldness may fail to perceive the avenues of harm, so their boldness arises from ignorance; or they may fail to perceive the means to repel harm, so their cowardice arises from ignorance. Or they may be aware, through experience and practice, of the entrances and repulsions of harm, yet distant harm works upon them in discouragement and dissolving their strength to advance, due to weakness of heart, as near harm works upon the courageous, balanced person. Thus, no attention is paid to the two extremes. The coward must strive to remove cowardice by removing its cause, which is ignorance or weakness. Ignorance is removed by experience, and weakness is removed by practicing the feared action through effort until it becomes habitual. For example, a beginner in debate or preaching may be naturally cowardly due to weakness; when they practice and become accustomed, weakness leaves them. If it becomes an inherent, unchangeable trait due to weakness dominating the heart, then the ruling for that weak person follows their condition, and they are excused, just as a sick person is excused from some obligations. Therefore, we may say, according to one view, that performing the Hajj by sea is not obligatory for one overwhelmed by fear of sailing, but it is obligatory for one whose fear of it is not great. Similarly is the case with the obligation of enjoining good.

If it is asked: What is the limit of the anticipated harm? For a person may dislike a word, a blow, or the long tongue of the one enjoining good against them regarding their right through backbiting. There is no person who enjoins good but anticipates some form of harm; it may even be that someone schemes against them with a ruler or disparages them in a gathering, causing them detriment through that disparagement. So what is the limit of harm that waives the obligation? We say: This too involves obscure consideration, its forms are widespread, and its instances numerous. But we strive to gather its scattered parts and enumerate its categories. We say: Harm is the opposite of what is desired. The desires of people in this world revert to four matters: for the soul, knowledge; for the body, health and safety; for wealth, prosperity; and for the hearts of people, the establishment of prestige. Thus, what is desired is knowledge, health, prosperity, and prestige. The meaning of prestige is mastery over people's hearts, just as the meaning of prosperity...

Possessing wealth is because people's hearts are a means to worldly honors, just as possessing coins is a means to attaining objectives. The meaning of status and the reason for the natural inclination towards it will be elaborated in the Quarter of the Destructive Matters.

Each of these four—knowledge, health, wealth, and status—is sought by a person for himself, his relatives, and those close to him. In these four, two things are disliked: first, the loss of what is already possessed and present; second, the prevention of what is anticipated and lacking—meaning the obstruction of what one expects to come into being. Thus, harm lies only in the loss of a present possession and its disappearance, or the hindrance of an anticipated one. For the anticipated is an expression for what is possible to attain, and what is possible to attain is as if it is already present, and the loss of its possibility is as if it is the loss of its attainment. Therefore, the disliked matter reverts to two categories: one is the fear of the prevention of the anticipated, and this should never be a license to abandon enjoining good. Let us mention its example in the four pursuits.

As for knowledge, its example is abandoning the duty of enjoining good upon someone who is specifically connected to one's teacher, fearing that one's standing with him will become tarnished, and he will thus refuse to teach him. As for health, its example is abandoning the censure of a doctor who enters upon him, for instance, wearing silk, fearing that he will delay attending to him, and thus his anticipated health will be prevented because of it. As for wealth, its example is abandoning the duty of enjoining good upon the ruler and his associates, and upon one who supports him from his wealth, fearing that his future provision will be cut off and he will cease his support. As for status, its example is abandoning the duty of enjoining good upon someone from whom he expects support and status in the future, fearing that he will not attain status, or fearing that his standing with the ruler from whom he expects an appointment will become tarnished.

All of this does not nullify the obligation of enjoining good, for these are additional benefits whose attainment is prevented, and labeling the prevention of attaining additional benefits as harm is metaphorical. True harm is only the loss of what is already present. Nothing is exempt from this except what necessity dictates, and where its loss involves a danger that outweighs the danger of remaining silent about an evil—such as if one is in need of a doctor for an immediate illness and health is anticipated from the doctor's treatment, and he knows that in his delay lies severe affliction, prolonged illness, and it may even lead to death. By knowledge here, I mean the level of presumption that would permit, for its like, abandoning the use of water and resorting to dry ablution. When it reaches this limit, it is not far-fetched to permit abandoning the duty of enjoining good.

As for in knowledge, it is like one who is ignorant of the essentials of his religion and finds no teacher except one, and has no ability to travel to another, and knows that the one upon whom he would enjoin good is capable of blocking his path to reaching him because the scholar obeys him or heeds his word. Here, patience with ignorance of the essentials of religion is a danger, and silence about an evil is a danger. It is not far-fetched to weigh one against the other, and this varies according to the gravity of the evil and the intensity of the need for knowledge due to its connection to the essentials of religion.

As for in wealth, it is like one who is incapable of earning and begging, and is not strong in self-reliance upon God, and has no one providing for him except a single person, and if he were to enjoin good upon him, his provision would be cut off, and he would be reduced to seeking unlawful provision or die of hunger. This also, when the matter becomes severe for him, it is not far-fetched to permit him to remain silent.

As for in status, it is when a wicked person harms him and he finds no way to repel his harm except through status he acquires from a ruler, and he cannot reach him except through the mediation of a person who wears silk or drinks wine, and if he were to enjoin good upon him, he would not be an intermediary and means for him, and thus the attainment of status would be prevented for him, and the harm from the wicked person would persist because of it.

All these matters, when they become apparent and strong, their exemption is not far-fetched. However, the ruling in them is tied to the diligent consideration of the one who enjoins good, until he consults his heart concerning them and weighs one danger against the other, giving preponderance by the judgment of religion, not by the dictate of desire and natural inclination. If he gives preponderance by the dictate of religion, his silence is called prudent dissimulation; if he gives preponderance by the dictate of desire, his silence is called hypocritical flattery. This is an inward matter, only perceived through careful discernment, but the critic is insightful. It is incumbent upon every religious person therein to watch over his heart and know that God is aware of his motive and what turns him—whether it is religion or desire. Every soul will find what it has done of evil or good presented before God, even in a fleeting thought or a fleeting glance, without injustice or oppression, for God is not unjust to His servants.

As for the second category, which is the loss of what is present, it is disliked and is considered in the permissibility of silence in the four matters, except for knowledge. For its loss is not feared except through one's own negligence; otherwise, no one has the power to strip knowledge from another, even if they have the power to strip health, safety, affluence, and wealth. This is one of the causes of the nobility of knowledge, for it endures in this world and its reward endures in the Hereafter; there is no cessation for it forever. As for health and safety, their loss is through beating. Whoever knows that he will be beaten with a painful beating from which he will suffer in the course of enjoining good is not obligated to enjoin good, although it is recommended for him, as preceded. When this is understood...

This pertains to causing pain through beating, so it is more evident in wounding, cutting, and killing. As for wealth, it is when one knows that his home will be looted, his house destroyed, and his garments seized. This also removes the obligation, leaving only the recommendation, for there is no harm in ransoming his religion with his worldly life. Each of beating and looting has a lower threshold of insignificance, like a single seed in wealth or a light slap in beating, which is not considered. And an upper threshold that must be considered, and a middle ground that falls into the area of ambiguity and personal judgment. The devout should strive in this and favor the side of religion as much as possible.

As for honor, its loss occurs by being struck painlessly or insulted publicly, having a cloth placed around his neck and paraded through town, or having his face blackened and displayed—all without bodily pain, yet grievous to honor and painful to the heart. This has degrees. The correct approach is to divide it into what is termed loss of dignity, such as being paraded bareheaded and barefoot; this permits silence, for dignity is commanded to be preserved in the Sacred Law, and this pains the heart more than multiple blows or the loss of a few coins. This is the second degree: what is termed pure honor and high rank, like appearing in fine garments or riding horses. If he knew that performing his duty would require walking in the market in clothes he is unaccustomed to or walking when his habit is to ride, this is among the privileges, and consistently preserving them is not praiseworthy, while preserving dignity is. Thus, the obligation of commanding right should not be dropped for such a level.

Similar is if he fears verbal attack, whether in his presence with accusations of ignorance, foolishness, hypocrisy, or slander, or in his absence with various backbiting. This does not remove the obligation, for it only removes superfluities of honor not greatly needed. If commanding right were abandoned due to blame from a critic, backbiting by a sinner, insults, reproach, or loss of status in his eyes or those of his peers, it would have no obligation at all, as one cannot avoid it unless the wrong itself is backbiting and he knows that objecting would not silence the backbiter but rather include him in the backbiting, making it forbidden as it increases sin. If he knows the backbiter would stop that backbiting and limit it to him, it is not obligatory, for backbiting him is also a sin against the one backbitten, but it is recommended to ransom the mentioned one's honor with his own honor through selflessness.

General principles indicate the confirmed obligation of commanding right and the grave danger in silence, which is only counterbalanced by what carries great danger in religion. Wealth, life, and dignity have shown their danger in the Sacred Law. As for the privileges of honor, respectability, degrees of adornment, and seeking praise of creation, all carry no danger. If he refrains from fear of such harms befalling his children or relatives, it is less than for himself, for suffering harm personally is more severe than for others, yet from a religious perspective it is greater, for he may forgo his own rights but not those of others. Thus, he should refrain if what they lose is through sin, like beating or looting, for it is repelling one wrong that leads to another. If it is lost without sin, it is also harming a Muslim, which is not allowed without their consent. If it leads to harming his people, he should leave it, like an ascetic with wealthy relatives who fears not for his wealth but that his relatives will be targeted in retaliation through him. If harm from his commanding right extends to his relatives and neighbors, he should leave it, for harming Muslims is to be avoided just as silence on wrong is. Yes, if they are not harmed in wealth or life but through insults and abuse, this requires consideration, varying with the severity of the wrong and the harmfulness of the speech to the heart and honor.

If asked: If a person intends to cut off a part of himself and can only be prevented by fighting that may lead to his death, should he fight? If you say yes, it is absurd, for it is destroying a life for fear of losing a limb, and in destroying life the limb is also lost. We say: Prevent him and fight him, for our aim is not preserving his life and limb but cutting off the means of wrong and sin. Killing him in commanding right is not a sin, while cutting his own limb is. This is like repelling an aggressor against a Muslim's wealth by what may kill him, which is permissible—not in the sense of ransoming a Muslim's dirham with a Muslim's soul.

That is impossible, but his intention to seize the wealth of the Muslims is a sin, and his killing in defense against the sin is not a sin. The objective is only to repel sins. If it is said: "If we knew that if he were alone with himself he would sever his own limb, then we ought to kill him immediately to close the door to sin," we say: That is not known with certainty, and it is not permissible to shed his blood on the suspicion of a sin. However, if we see him in the act of severing, we repel him. If he fights us, we fight him and do not concern ourselves with what befalls his soul. Thus, a sin has three states: The first is that it is completed; the punishment for what has been completed is a prescribed penalty (hadd) or discretionary punishment (ta'zir), and this is for the authorities, not for individuals. The second is that the sin is present and its perpetrator is engaged in it, such as wearing silk, holding an oud, or holding wine. Nullifying this sin is obligatory by every possible means, unless it leads to a more heinous sin or its equal. This duty is established for both individuals and the common people. The third is that the reprehensible act is anticipated, like one who prepares by sweeping the gathering place, adorning it, and gathering flowers for drinking wine, but the wine has not yet arrived. This is doubtful, for perhaps an obstacle may prevent it. Therefore, individuals have no authority over one who intends to drink, except through admonition and sincere counsel. As for reproach and beating, it is not permissible for individuals, nor for the authority, unless that sin is known from him by continuous habit, and he has embarked on the means leading to it, and nothing remains for the occurrence of the sin except awaiting what is beyond his control. This is like youths standing at the doors of women's bathhouses to look at them upon entry and exit. For even if they do not block the path due to its width, it is permissible to hold them accountable by removing them from the place and preventing them from standing through reproach and beating. The verification of this, if examined, reverts to the fact that this standing in itself is a sin, even if the sinner's aim is beyond it, just as seclusion with a non-mahram woman is in itself a sin because it is a likely place for sin to occur, and procuring the likely place of sin is a sin. By "likely place" we mean that by which a person is exposed to the occurrence of sin in most cases, such that he is unable to refrain from it. Thus, it is, in truth, accountability for a present sin, not an anticipated one.

The second pillar of accountability (hisbah) is that in which accountability applies: it is every reprehensible act existing at present, apparent to the accountable without spying, known to be reprehensible without independent reasoning. These are four conditions; let us examine them. The first: that it be reprehensible. By this we mean that it is something whose occurrence is cautioned against in the Sacred Law. We have moved from the term "sin" to this because "reprehensible" is more general than "sin." For if one sees a child or an insane person drinking wine, he must spill his wine and prevent him. Likewise, if he sees an insane person fornicating with an insane woman or an animal, he must prevent him from it. This is not due to the heinousness of the act's appearance and its visibility among people; rather, even if one encounters this reprehensible act in seclusion, prevention is obligatory. This is not called a sin in the case of the insane person, for a sin without a sinner is impossible. Thus, the term "reprehensible" is more indicative of it and more general than the term "sin." We have included under this generality both minor and major sins. Accountability is not specific to major sins; rather, exposing one's private parts in the bath, seclusion with a non-mahram woman, and following one's gaze to look at non-mahram women—all of that is among minor sins, and forbidding them is obligatory. The distinction between minor and major sins requires consideration, which will come in the Book of Repentance.

The second condition is that it exist at present. This is also a precaution against holding accountable one who has finished drinking wine, for that is not for individuals, and the reprehensible act has ceased; and a precaution against what will exist in the immediate future, like one who is known by circumstantial evidence to intend to drink that night. There is no accountability over him except through admonition. If he denies his intention for it, admonishing him is also not permissible, for in that is having a bad opinion of a Muslim. Perhaps he is truthful in his statement, and perhaps he may not proceed with what he intended due to an obstacle. Let one be mindful of the subtle point we mentioned: that seclusion with a non-mahram woman is an immediate sin, as is standing at the door of a women's bathhouse and what is similar to it.

The third condition is that the reprehensible act be apparent to the accountable without spying. For whoever conceals a sin in his house and locks his door, it is not permissible to spy on him. God Almighty has forbidden it, and the story of 'Umar and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf concerning it is well-known; we have mentioned it in the Book of the Etiquette of Companionship. Likewise, what is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, climbed over the wall of a man's house and saw him in a disliked state, so he reproached him. The man said, "O Commander of the Faithful, if I have disobeyed God in one aspect, you have disobeyed Him in three." He said, "And what are they?" He replied, "God has said, 'And do not spy,' and you have spied. And He has said, 'And enter houses through their doors,' and you have climbed over from the roof. And He has said, 'Do not enter houses other than your own until you have announced yourselves.'"

And greet its inhabitants, and what remained secure, 'Umar left it and stipulated repentance upon him. For this reason, 'Umar consulted the Companions, may God be pleased with them, while he was upon the pulpit and asked them about the Imam if he personally witnessed an evil—does he have the right to establish the prescribed punishment for it? 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, indicated that this is contingent upon two just witnesses; one is not sufficient for it. We have cited these reports in the explanation of the Muslim's right from the Book of the Etiquettes of Companionship, so we will not repeat them. If you say: What is the definition of public manifestation and concealment? Then know that whoever closes the door of his house and conceals himself within its walls, it is not permissible to enter upon him without his permission to identify the sin, unless it becomes manifest within the house in a manner known to one who is outside the house, such as the sounds of flutes and stringed instruments if they rise such that they pass beyond the walls of the house. Then whoever hears that has the right to enter the house and break the instruments of diversion. Likewise, if the voices of the intoxicated rise with the words familiar among them such that the people of the streets hear them, this is a manifestation necessitating the duty of commanding right and forbidding wrong. Therefore, it is only perceived with the penetration of the walls by a sound or a smell. If the odors of wine waft, and it is possible that they are from lawful wines, it is not permissible to intend their spilling. But if it is known by circumstantial evidence that they wafted due to their consumption for drinking, this is a matter of consideration, and the apparent ruling is the permissibility of intervention. A bottle of wine may be concealed in a sleeve or under a garment, and likewise instruments of diversion. If a transgressor is seen and under his garment is something, it is not permissible to uncover it unless it becomes apparent by a specific sign, for his transgression does not indicate that what is with him is wine, since the transgressor also needs vinegar and other things. It is not permissible to infer from his concealment that if it were lawful he would not have concealed it, because the purposes for concealment are many. If the odor is wafting, this is a matter for consideration, and the apparent ruling is that he has the right to intervene, because this is a sign that yields presumption, and presumption is like knowledge in matters such as these. Likewise, the lute may be recognized by its shape if the covering garment is thin, so the indication of the shape is like the indication of the odor and the sound. Whatever its indication becomes manifest is not concealed but rather uncovered. We have been commanded to conceal what God has concealed and to disapprove of whoever reveals to us his page. Revelation has degrees: sometimes it is revealed to us by the sense of hearing, sometimes by the sense of smell, sometimes by the sense of sight, and sometimes by the sense of touch. It is not possible to specify that with the sense of sight alone; rather, the intent is knowledge, and these senses also yield knowledge. Therefore, it is only permissible to break what is under the garment if it is known to be wine. He does not have the right to say, "Show me so I may know what is in it"; this is spying. The meaning of spying is seeking the indicative signs of knowledge. If the indicative sign of knowledge is obtained and it yields knowledge, it is permissible to act according to its requirement. As for seeking the indicative sign of knowledge, there is absolutely no concession in it. The fourth condition is that its being an evil be known without independent reasoning. Everything that is subject to independent reasoning has no duty of intervention. Thus, it is not for the Hanafi to disapprove of the Shafi'i eating the dabb lizard and the hyena and omitting the name of God, nor for the Shafi'i to disapprove of the Hanafi drinking wine that is not intoxicating, taking the inheritance of uterine relatives, sitting in a house he took by preemption of neighborhood, and other matters subject to independent reasoning. Yes, if the Shafi'i saw a Shafi'i drinking wine, marrying without a guardian, and having intercourse with his wife, this is a matter for consideration, and the more apparent ruling is that he has the duty of intervention and disapproval, for none of the scholars of verification have held that it is permissible for a practitioner of independent reasoning to act according to the ruling of another's independent reasoning, nor that one whose independent reasoning in following authority has led him to a person he considers the best of scholars has the right to adopt the school of another, selecting from the schools the most pleasing to him. Rather, it is incumbent upon every follower to follow his authority in every detail. Therefore, his contravention of the follower is agreed upon as being an evil among the scholars of verification, and he is disobedient by the contravention. However, from this follows a matter more subtle than it, which is that it is permissible for the Hanafi to object to the Shafi'i if he marries without a guardian by saying to him: The action in itself is valid, but not valid for you. You are invalidating it by proceeding with it while believing that the correct view is the school of al-Shafi'i, and contravening what is correct according to you is disobedience in your regard, even if it is correct according to God. Likewise, the Shafi'i intervenes against the Hanafi if he joins him in eating the dabb lizard, omitting the name of God, and other matters, and says to him: Either you believe that al-Shafi'i is more deserving of being followed, then you proceed contrary to him, or you do not believe that, then do not proceed contrary to him because it is against your belief. Then this leads to another matter from tangible things, which is that a deaf man, for example, has intercourse with a woman intending fornication, and the one commanding right knows that this is his wife, whom his father married to him in his childhood, but he does not know and is unable to inform him of that due to his deafness or because he is not familiar with his language. Thus, in proceeding while believing she is a stranger, he is disobedient and punishable for it in the Hereafter, so he should be prevented from it.

It concerns his wife, yet he is distant in that it is lawful in God's knowledge, but near in that it is forbidden to him due to his error and ignorance. There is no doubt that if he made his wife's divorce contingent upon a quality in the heart of the overseer—such as a desire, anger, or other—and that quality existed in his heart, but he was unable to inform the couple of it, yet knew internally that the divorce had occurred, then if he sees him having intercourse with her, he must prevent it—I mean by speech—because that is fornication, except that the fornicator is unaware of it, while the overseer knows she has been irrevocably divorced from him. Their not being sinful due to their ignorance of the quality's existence does not remove the act from being reprehensible, nor does it excuse the fornication of the insane, and we have clarified that it is to be prevented. If it is to be prevented because it is reprehensible before God, even if it is not reprehensible to the doer and he is not sinful due to the excuse of ignorance, then by the converse of this, it follows that what is not reprehensible before God, but is reprehensible to the doer due to his ignorance, is not to be prevented. This is the more apparent view, and God knows best.

From this, it is concluded that the Hanafi does not object to the Shafi'i regarding marriage without a guardian, while the Shafi'i objects to the Shafi'i in it, because the objected-to act is reprehensible by agreement of both the overseer and the one overseen. These are subtle jurisprudential issues with conflicting probabilities. We have only issued a ruling according to what seemed preponderant to us at the time, and we do not definitively assert the error of an opponent's preponderance if he holds that oversight only applies to what is known with certainty. Some have adopted this view, saying there is no oversight except in matters like wine and pork and what is definitively known to be unlawful. However, the more fitting view in our opinion is that independent reasoning affects the ruling for the one exercising it, for it is extremely far-fetched that one would exert reasoning about the direction of prayer, acknowledge the appearance of the direction to him through probabilistic evidence, then turn his back to it and not be prevented from doing so because of another's conjecture, since turning one's back is correct. Some hold that it is permissible for every follower to choose whichever school he wishes without it being considered, and perhaps the adoption of this by anyone is fundamentally invalid. This is a doctrine that is not established, and if established, it is not considered.

If you say: Since there is no objection to the Hanafi regarding marriage without a guardian because he considers it valid, then similarly there should be no objection to the Mu'tazilite in his saying that God is not seen, that good is from God and evil is not from God, and that God's speech is created; nor to the anthropomorphist in his saying that God is a body with a form and that He is settled upon the Throne; indeed, there should be no objection to the philosopher in his saying that bodies are not resurrected, only souls are resurrected—because these individuals also arrived at what they said through their reasoning and they believe it to be the truth. If you say the invalidity of these doctrines is evident, then the invalidity of the doctrine of one who contradicts the clear text of a sound hadith is also evident. Just as it is established by the apparent meanings of the texts that God is seen—which the Mu'tazilite denies through interpretation—so too are established by the apparent meanings of the texts issues in which the Hanafi differs, such as the issue of marriage without a guardian and the issue of pre-emption due to neighborhood and their like.

Know that issues are divided into those in which it can be conceived to say that every independent interpreter is correct—these are rulings on the permissibility and prohibition of actions, and that is wherein objectors do not confront the interpreters, since their error is not known with certainty but only conjecturally—and into those wherein it is inconceivable that more than one is correct, such as the issue of seeing God, divine decree, the eternity of speech, and negating form, corporeality, and settlement from God. This is wherein the error of the mistaken one is known with certainty, and no excuse remains for his error, which is pure ignorance. Therefore, all innovations should have their avenues blocked and be denounced to the innovators, even if they believe them to be the truth, just as the disbelief of the Jews and Christians is refuted, even though they believe it to be true, because their error is known with certainty, unlike error in matters open to independent reasoning.

If you say: Whenever you object to the Qadari in his saying evil is not from God, the Qadari will also object to you in your saying evil is from God, and likewise in your saying God is seen and in all other issues, since the innovator considers himself correct and the correct one an innovator in the view of the innovator, and each claims to be correct and denies being an innovator—so how can oversight be carried out? Know that because of this conflict, we say: Look to the locality where that innovation has appeared. If the innovation is alien and all the people are upon the Sunnah, then they have the right to oversee it without the ruler's permission. But if the people of the locality are divided into people of innovation and people of the Sunnah, and objection would stir sedition involving fighting, then individuals do not have oversight in doctrinal matters except by appointment of the ruler. If the ruler sees the correct opinion, supports it, and permits one to deter the innovators from manifesting the innovation, then he has that right, and no one else does.

The sultan does not face opposition, and what occurs from the side of individuals does not lead to the matter being opposed. In summary, enjoining good and forbidding evil in matters of innovation is more critical than in all other sins. However, one must observe the detailed distinctions we have mentioned, so that the matter does not become opposed and does not escalate into stirring up strife. Indeed, if the sultan were to grant unrestricted permission to prevent anyone who openly declares that the Qur'an is created, or that God will not be seen, or that He is settled upon the Throne in physical contact with it, or other such innovations, then individuals would seize authority to prevent it, and the matter would not be opposed. Opposition only arises in the absence of the sultan's permission. The third pillar—the one upon whom enjoining good is incumbent—and its condition is that he possesses an attribute such that the forbidden act becomes reprehensible in his regard. The minimum that suffices for this is that he be a human being; it is not stipulated that he be legally responsible, for we have clarified that if a child were to drink wine, he would be prevented from it and enjoined upon, even if before puberty. It is not stipulated that he be discerning, for we have clarified that if an insane person were to fornicate with an insane woman or commit bestiality, he would be prevented from it. Yes, there are actions that are not reprehensible in the case of the insane, such as neglecting prayer, fasting, and others, but we do not concern ourselves with differing details, for that too varies for the resident and the traveler, the sick and the healthy. Our aim is to point to the attribute by which the basis of reproach becomes directed at him, not that by which details are prepared. If you say: be content with him being an animal and do not stipulate him being human, for if a beast were to damage a person's crops, we would prevent it, just as we prevent the insane from fornication and bestiality—then know that calling that "enjoining good" has no basis, for enjoining good is an expression for preventing a reprehensible act due to the right of God, safeguarding the one prevented from committing the sin. Preventing the insane from fornication and bestiality is for the right of God, and likewise preventing the child from drinking wine. And if a person destroys another's crops, he is prevented from it due to two rights: one is the right of God Almighty, for his act is disobedience, and the second is the right of the one whose property is destroyed against him. These are two separate causes; if he were to amputate another's limb with his permission, the disobedience exists, but the right of the victim falls due to his permission, so enjoining good and prevention are established by one of the causes. If an animal causes destruction, the disobedience is absent, but prevention is established by one of the causes. However, there is a subtle point: we do not intend by driving the animal away to prevent the animal, but to protect the Muslim's property, for if an animal were to eat carrion or drink from a vessel containing wine or water mixed with wine, we would not prevent it from that. Indeed, it is permissible to feed hunting dogs carrion and dead animals. But if a Muslim's property is exposed to loss and we are able to protect it without hardship, it becomes obligatory upon us to preserve the property. Indeed, if a jar belonging to someone were to fall from a height and beneath it was a vial belonging to another, we would deflect the jar to protect the vial, not to prevent the jar from falling, for we do not intend to prevent the jar and guard it from becoming a breaker of the vial. And we prevent the insane from fornication, bestiality, and drinking wine, and likewise the child, not to safeguard the animal being approached or the wine being drunk, but to safeguard the insane from drinking wine and to honor him insofar as he is a respected human being. These are subtle intricacies that only the profound scholars perceive, so they should not be overlooked. Then, regarding what a child and an insane person must be kept from, there is consideration, for what applies to them may be uncertain, such as wearing silk and other matters, and we will address what we allude to in the third chapter. If you say: does everyone who sees animals freely grazing in a person's crops have to drive them out? And does everyone who sees a Muslim's property on the verge of loss have to protect it? If you say that is obligatory, this is an excessive imposition leading to a person being subservient to others his entire life. If you say it is not obligatory, then why is enjoining good obligatory upon one who usurps another's property, which has no cause other than consideration for another's property? We say this is a profound and obscure investigation, and the concise statement regarding it is: whenever one is able to protect it from loss without incurring physical hardship, financial loss, or diminishment of status, it becomes obligatory upon him. That extent is obligatory in the rights of a Muslim; indeed, it is the lowest degree of rights. The proofs obligating the rights of Muslims are many, and this is their lowest degree, and it is more deserving of being obligatory than returning a greeting, for the harm in this is greater than the harm in neglecting to return a greeting. Indeed, there is no disagreement that if a person's property is being lost due to an oppressor's injustice, and if by testifying the truth would be restored to him, it becomes obligatory upon him, and he disobeys by concealing the testimony. In the meaning of neglecting testimony is neglecting every prevention in which there is no harm upon the preventer. But if there is hardship upon him, or harm to wealth or status, he is not required to strive in that. However, if it does not cause hardship to alert the owner of the crops from sleep or to inform him, it becomes obligatory, and neglecting it is...

Its definition and notification are like neglecting to inform the judge of testimony, and there is no concession in that, nor is it possible to consider the lesser or greater therein, such that one might say: if nothing is lost from its benefit during the period of his occupation with driving out the animals except the equivalent of a dirham, for example, and the owner of the crop misses out on much wealth, then his side is given preference because the dirham that is his, he is entitled to its preservation just as the owner of a thousand is entitled to the preservation of the thousand, and there is no alternative but that. As for when the loss of wealth occurs through a path that is sinful, such as usurpation or killing a slave owned by another, then this must be prevented, even if there is some hardship in it, because the objective is the right of the Sacred Law, and the aim is to repel sin. And upon a person is to exert himself in repelling sins, just as it is upon him to exert himself in abandoning sins, and all sins in abandoning them involve hardship; indeed, all obedience returns to opposing the self, and that is the utmost hardship. Then, he is not required to bear every harm, but rather there is detail in it as we have mentioned from the degrees of feared harms that the overseer (muhtasib) fears. The jurists have differed regarding two issues that are close to our purpose. One of them is: is picking up a lost item obligatory? And the lost item is perishing, and the picker prevents its loss and strives in its preservation. The truth in it according to us is that it be detailed, and it is said: if the lost item is in a place where if left it would not perish, but rather someone who recognizes it would pick it up, or it is left as if it were in a mosque or a hospice where those who enter are specified and all of them are trustworthy, then picking it up is not obligatory. If it is in a place of loss, then consider: if there is hardship upon him in preserving it, as if it were an animal needing fodder and a stable, then that is not obligatory upon him, because picking up is only obligatory due to the right of the owner, and his right is due to him being a respected human being, and the picker is also a human being and has a right not to be burdened for the sake of another, just as another is not burdened for his sake. If it were gold, a garment, or something wherein there is no harm upon him except merely the hardship of notification, then this should be in the place of the two opinions: one speaker says notification and fulfilling its condition involves hardship, so there is no way to obligate him to that except that he volunteers, undertaking it in accordance with the reward. And a speaker says: this amount of hardship is considered minor in relation to observing the rights of the Muslims, so this is placed in the position of the hardship of the witness in attending the court session, for he is not required to travel to another town except that he volunteers for it. If the judge's court is in his vicinity, then attendance is obligatory, and the hardship with these steps is not considered hardship in the purpose of establishing testimony and fulfilling the trust. If it were on the other side of the town and required attendance during the midday and intense heat, then this may fall into the place of independent reasoning and consideration. For the harm that befalls the one striving to preserve the right of another has an extreme of smallness about which there is no doubt that he would not mind it, and an extreme of abundance about which there is no doubt that he is not required to bear it, and a middle that is contested by the two extremes and is always in the place of doubt and consideration. And it is among the chronic ambiguities that are not within human capability to remove, since there is no criterion to differentiate between its closely resembling parts. However, the God-fearing looks into it for himself and leaves what causes him doubt except what does not cause him doubt. This is the ultimate unveiling of this foundational principle. The fourth pillar is the essence of commanding right and forbidding wrong (al-hisbah), and it has degrees and etiquettes. As for the degrees, the first is recognition, then notification, then prohibition, then admonition and sincere counsel, then rebuke and reprimand, then changing with the hand, then threat of striking, then carrying out the strike and its verification, then brandishing the weapon, then seeking support therein with helpers and gathering troops. As for the first degree, which is recognition, we mean seeking knowledge of the occurrence of the wrong. And that is prohibited, and it is the spying we have mentioned. So he should not eavesdrop on another's house to hear the sound of strings, nor sniff to detect the smell of wine, nor feel what is in his garment to know the shape of the flute, nor inquire from his neighbors to inform him of what occurs in his house. Yes, if two just persons inform him initially without inquiry that so-and-so drinks wine in his house or that in his house there is wine prepared for drinking, then he has permission at that time to enter his house, and permission is not required, and trespassing his property by entering to facilitate repelling the wrong is like breaking his head by striking to prevent whenever needed. If two just persons or one just person inform him—and in summary, everyone whose narration is accepted, not his testimony—then regarding the permissibility of storming his house based on their statement about him, there is consideration and possibility, and the preferable is to refrain because he has a right that his house not be trespassed without his permission, and the right of a Muslim is not nullified from what is established against him except by two witnesses, so this is the most preferable to be taken as the reference in it. And it has been said that the inscription on Luqman's seal was: concealment, for when I witnessed, better than publicizing what I suspected. The second degree is notification, for the wrongdoer may proceed with the wrong due to his ignorance, and when he is informed...

He who neglects it is like the blackened one who prays yet fails to perform bowing and prostration properly. It becomes known that this is due to his ignorance that such is not valid prayer. If he were content not being a praying person, he would have abandoned prayer altogether. Therefore, he must be instructed with gentleness, without harshness, because instruction inherently implies attribution to ignorance and foolishness, and to instruct is to cause hurt. Rarely does a person accept being ascribed ignorance in matters, especially in religious law. Thus you see one dominated by anger—how he becomes enraged when alerted to his error and ignorance, and how he strives to deny the truth after knowing it, fearing that the shame of his ignorance be exposed. Human nature is more eager to conceal the shame of ignorance than to conceal physical shame, for ignorance is ugliness in the form of the soul, a blackness upon its face, and its possessor is blameworthy for it. The ugliness of the two shames refers to the form of the body, but the soul is nobler than the body, and its ugliness is more severe than the ugliness of the body. Yet he is not blameworthy for it, for it is a creation; its occurrence did not enter his choice, nor is its removal and improvement within his choice. Ignorance is an ugliness that can be removed and replaced by the beauty of knowledge. Therefore, a person’s pain at the exposure of his ignorance is great, and his inner joy in his knowledge is great, as is his pleasure when the beauty of his knowledge appears to others. Since instruction is an exposure of shame and hurts the heart, its harm must be countered with gentle kindness. So we say to him: “A person is not born knowing. Indeed, we too were ignorant of prayer matters, and scholars taught us. Perhaps your village is devoid of knowledgeable people, or its scholar is negligent in explaining and clarifying prayer. The condition of prayer is tranquility in bowing and prostration.” Thus he is treated gently so that instruction is achieved without harm, for harming a Muslim is forbidden and to be avoided, just as leaving him in wrongdoing is to be avoided. No rational person washes blood with blood or with urine. Whoever avoids the danger of silence over wrongdoing and substitutes for it the danger of harming a Muslim when it is unnecessary has indeed washed blood with urine, in truth. As for when you come upon an error in non-religious matters, you should not correct him, for he gains knowledge from you and becomes your enemy—unless you know he values knowledge, and that is very rare.

The third degree is prohibition through admonition, counsel, and instilling fear of God Almighty. This applies to one who proceeds with an action while knowing it is wrong, or to one who persists in it after learning it is wrong, such as one who habitually drinks, oppresses, backbites Muslims, or the like. He should be admonished and made to fear God Almighty, and the reports containing warnings about that should be related to him. The conduct of the pious predecessors and the worship of the God-fearing should be recounted to him, all with compassion and gentleness, without harshness or anger. Rather, he should be looked upon with mercy, and his persistence in sin should be seen as a calamity upon himself, for Muslims are like one soul. Here lies a great peril that must be guarded against, for it is destructive: that the knowledgeable person, during instruction, sees his own honor through knowledge and the other’s humiliation through ignorance, and perhaps intends by instruction to show superiority and display distinction through the nobility of knowledge, humiliating the other relative to the baseness of ignorance. If the motive is this, then this wrong is uglier in itself than the wrong he confronts. The example of such a reformer is like one who saves another from fire by burning himself—the utmost in ignorance. This is a great humiliation, a terrible consequence, and a snare of Satan into which every person descends by his rope, except whom God has made aware of his own faults and opened his insight with the light of His guidance. For in judging others there is great pleasure for the soul from two aspects: one from the aspect of knowledge, the other from the aspect of the authority and dominance in judging. This reverts to ostentation and seeking status—the hidden desire that calls to subtle polytheism. It has a criterion and measure by which the reformer should examine himself: that the cessation of that person from wrongdoing by himself or through another’s reform be more beloved to him than his cessation through his own reform. If reform is burdensome to him, heavy on his soul, and he wishes another would suffice, then let him undertake reform, for his motive is religion. But if the admonition of that sinner through his admonition and his restraint through his rebuke is more beloved to him than his admonition through another’s, then he is merely following his own desire and seeking to display his own status through the means of his reform. So let him fear God regarding it and first reform himself. At this point, it is said to him what was said to Jesus, peace be upon him: “O son of Mary, admonish yourself; if you heed, then admonish people; otherwise, feel shame before me.” And it was said to Dawud al-Ta’i, may God have mercy on him: “What do you think of a man who enters upon these rulers, commanding them to good and forbidding them from evil?” He said: “I fear for him the whip.” He said: “He can endure it.” He said: “I fear for him the sword.” He said: “He can endure it.” He said: “I fear for him the hidden disease—that is, pride.”

The fourth category: Reviling and reproaching with harsh, coarse speech. This is resorted to when one is incapable of prevention through gentleness, and when signs of obstinacy and mockery of admonition and counsel become apparent. An example is the saying of Abraham, peace be upon him: "Fie upon you and what you worship besides Allah! Have you then no sense?" (Qur'an 21:67). We do not mean by reviling and foul language that which involves attribution to fornication or its preliminaries, nor lying. Rather, it is to address someone with what is not considered part of foul language, such as saying: "O transgressor! O fool! O ignorant one! Do you not fear Allah?" and like saying: "O black one! O dimwit!" and what follows this pattern. For every transgressor is a fool and ignorant; were it not for his foolishness, he would not disobey Allah, the Exalted. Indeed, anyone who is not prudent is a fool. The prudent one is he for whom the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, testified to prudence when he said: "The prudent one is he who holds himself to account and works for what is after death. The fool is he who follows his own whims and has vain hopes in Allah." This hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan* (good), and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Shaddad ibn Aws. For this rank, there are two etiquettes: The first is not to proceed to it except out of necessity and incapacity for gentleness. The second is to speak only the truth and not to indulge in it, letting one's long tongue loose with what is not needed. Rather, one should restrict oneself to the extent of the need. If one knows that addressing him with these restraining words will not restrain him, then it is not fitting to utter them. Instead, one should confine oneself to showing anger, contempt for him, and disdain for his position due to his sin. If one knows that if he spoke he would be struck, but if he frowned and showed displeasure on his face he would not be struck, then it is incumbent upon him [to do the latter], and disapproval in the heart does not suffice for him. Rather, he must knit his brow and show disapproval for him.

The fifth degree: Changing with the hand. This is like breaking musical instruments, spilling wine, removing silk from his head and body, preventing him from sitting on it, pushing him away from sitting on another's property, ejecting him from an usurped house by dragging him with his foot, and removing him from the mosque if he is sitting while in a state of major ritual impurity, and what is similar. This is conceivable for some sins but not others. As for sins of the tongue and heart, one is not capable of directly changing them. Likewise, every sin confined to the sinner himself and his internal faculties. For this degree, there are two etiquettes: The first is not to undertake the change with one's own hand unless one is incapable of charging the person responsible for it to do so. If it is possible for him to charge him to walk out of the usurped land and the mosque, he should not push or drag him. If he is able to charge him to spill the wine, break the musical instruments, and undo the seams of the silk garment, he should not undertake that himself. For in adhering to the limit of breaking there is a kind of hardship. If he does not undertake it himself, striving in it suffices, and it is undertaken by one who is not restrained from his action. The second is to restrict oneself in the method of change to the necessary extent. That is, not to seize his beard in ejecting him, nor by his foot if he is able to drag him by his hand, for increasing harm in it is superfluous. And not to tear the silk garment, but only to undo its seams. And not to burn the musical instruments and the cross displayed by the Christians, but to nullify their suitability for corruption by breaking. The limit of breaking is that it reaches a state where restoring it to working order requires effort equal to the effort of starting anew from wood. In spilling wines, one avoids breaking the vessels if a way is found to do so. If he cannot manage it except by throwing a stone at their containers, he may do that, and the value of the container is forfeited. He is liable for it because of the wine, since it became an obstacle between him and reaching the spilling of the wine. If the wine were shielded by his body, we would intend his body with wounding and striking to gain access to spill the wine. Therefore, the sanctity of his property in the containers does not exceed the sanctity of his own self. If the wine were in bottles with narrow necks, and if he busied himself with spilling it, the time would be long and the corrupt people would overtake him and prevent him, he may break them. This is an excuse. Even if he does not fear being caught by the corrupt people and their prevention, but his time would be wasted and his tasks would be neglected, he may break them. He is not obliged to waste the benefit of his body and the purpose of his tasks for the sake of the wine container. Where spilling is feasible without breaking, breaking it entails liability. If you say: Why is breaking not permitted for the sake of deterrence? And why is dragging by the foot not permitted in ejecting from usurped land so that it is more emphatic in deterrence? Know that deterrence is only for the future, punishment is for the past, and repelling is for the present, immediate situation. For the common subjects, only repelling is permitted, which is the elimination of the wrong. Whatever exceeds the measure of elimination is either punishment for a past crime or deterrence for a future one, and that is for the authorities, not the subjects. Indeed, the authority may do that if he sees benefit in it. And I say to him...

To order the breaking of vessels containing wine as a deterrent, and this was done during the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, to emphasize the prohibition. The hadith about breaking vessels containing wine in his time, peace and blessings be upon him, was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Talhah, who said, "O Prophet of God, I have purchased wine for orphans under my care." He said, "Pour out the wine and break the jars." In its chain is Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, but the more correct narration is that of al-Suddi from Yahya ibn 'Abbad from Anas that Abu Talhah was with me, as al-Tirmidhi said. Its abrogation is not established, but the need for deterrence and weaning was severe. So if the ruler, through his independent reasoning, sees a similar need, it is permissible for him to do the like. Since this is tied to a precise type of independent reasoning, it is not for the common subjects. If you say, "Then let it be permissible for the Sultan to deter people from sins by destroying their wealth and demolishing their houses in which they drink and disobey, and burning their wealth by which they facilitate sins," know that if the Sacred Law had come with that, it would not have been outside the norms of public welfare. However, we do not innovate public welfare interests; rather, we follow them therein. The breaking of wine vessels is established during times of severe need, and leaving it after that due to the absence of severe need is not abrogation; rather, the ruling ceases with the cessation of its cause and returns with its return. We only permitted that for the Imam by virtue of following precedent, and we prevented the common subjects from it due to the obscurity of the aspect of independent reasoning therein. Rather, we say: If the wines were poured out first, it is not permissible to break the vessels afterward. Their breaking was only permissible as a consequence of the wine. If they are empty of it, it is destruction of property, unless they are saturated with wine and are only suitable for it. The action transmitted from the first era was accompanied by two meanings: one, the severe need for deterrence, and the other, the subordination of the vessels to the wine with which they were occupied. These are two effective meanings; there is no way to omit them. And a third meaning: that it issued from the opinion of the person in authority due to his knowledge of the severe need for deterrence, and it is also effective, so there is no way to nullify it. These are subtle juristic considerations which the public enjoiner of good must inevitably know.

The sixth degree: Threat and intimidation, such as saying, "Leave this alone, or I will break your head," or "I will strike your neck," or "I will order such and such," and the like. This should precede actual striking if it is possible to present it first. The proper conduct in this rank is not to threaten him with a warning he is not permitted to carry out, such as saying, "I will demolish your house," or "I will strike your child," or "I will insult your wife," and what follows this pattern. For if he says it with resolve, it is forbidden, and if he says it without resolve, it is a lie. Yes, if he is met with defiance of his warning and contempt, he may resolve upon it to a known limit necessitated by the situation. He may increase the warning beyond what is in his inner resolve if he knows that will suppress and deter him. That is not from the prohibited lying; rather, exaggeration in such matters is customary, and it is the meaning of a man's exaggeration in reconciling between two persons and harmonizing between two adversaries. That is something for which concession has been made due to need, and this is in its meaning. For the intent by it is to reform that person. To this meaning, some people have alluded that it is not unbecoming of God to threaten with what He will not do, because reneging on a threat is magnanimity. What is unbecoming is to promise what one will not do. This is not satisfactory to us, for the Eternal Speech is not subject to reneging, whether a promise or a threat. This is only conceivable regarding created beings, and it is so, for reneging on a threat is not forbidden.

The seventh degree: Direct striking with the hand, foot, or other than that in which there is no brandishing of a weapon. That is permissible for individuals on the condition of necessity and restricting oneself to the extent of need in repelling. When the wrong is repelled, one should desist. The judge may pressure one against whom a right is established to fulfill it by imprisonment. If the imprisoned one persists and the judge knows of his ability to fulfill the right and that he is obstinate, he may compel him to fulfill it by striking gradually, as needed. Likewise, the public enjoiner observes gradation. If he needs to brandish a weapon and is able to repel the wrong by brandishing a weapon and by wounding, he may undertake that as long as it does not stir up strife. For example, if a corrupt person seizes a woman, or is playing a flute he has with him, and between him and the public enjoiner is an intervening river or a blocking wall, he takes his bow and says to him, "Let her go, or I will shoot you if you do not let her go," he may shoot. He should not aim for a fatal shot, but rather the leg, thigh, or the like, and observe gradation in it. Likewise, he draws his sword and says, "Leave this wrong, or I will strike you." All of that is repelling wrong, and repelling it is obligatory by every possible means. There is no difference in that between what pertains to the exclusive right of God and what pertains to other humans. The Mu'tazilah said: What does not pertain to other humans has no public enjoining in it except...

The eighth degree is when one cannot accomplish it alone and requires assistants who brandish weapons, and perhaps the corrupt person also seeks support from his own aides. This leads to two sides confronting and fighting each other. Here, disagreement has emerged regarding the need for the Imam’s permission. Some say that individuals among the common people may not undertake this independently because it stirs up strife, incites corruption, and ruins lands. Others say permission is not required, and this is the more reasoned opinion, because if individuals are permitted to enjoin good, and the initial degrees lead to subsequent ones, and the subsequent to further ones, it will inevitably end in physical conflict, and conflict calls for mutual aid. Therefore, one should not be deterred by the necessities of enjoining good and its ultimate extent of mobilizing troops in God’s pleasure and repelling disobedience. We permit individual warriors to gather and fight whichever groups of disbelievers they wish to suppress the people of disbelief; similarly, suppressing the people of corruption is permissible, for there is no harm in killing a disbeliever, and if a Muslim is killed, he is a martyr. Likewise, there is no harm in killing a corrupt person who fights to defend his corruption, and the sincere enjoiner of good who is killed unjustly is a martyr. In summary, the matter reaching this point is rare in enjoining good, so it does not alter the principle of analogy. Rather, it is said: Whoever is able to repel an evil has the right to repel it with his hand, his weapon, himself, and his assistants. Thus, the issue is ambiguous as we have mentioned. These are the degrees of enjoining good; now let us mention its etiquettes, and God grants success.

Chapter on the Etiquettes of the Enjoiner of Good: We have detailed the etiquettes within each degree; now we mention their summary and sources. We say: All etiquettes of the enjoiner of good stem from three qualities in him: knowledge, piety, and good character. As for knowledge, he must know the occasions, limits, channels, and impediments of enjoining good, so he confines himself to the legal boundary therein. Piety restrains him from contravening what is known, for not everyone who knows acts upon his knowledge; indeed, one may know he is excessive in enjoining good and exceeds the legally permitted limit, but some motive drives him to it. Let his speech and admonition be acceptable, for the corrupt person scoffs at him when he enjoins good, and that emboldens him against it. As for good character, it enables him to be gentle and kind, which is the foundation of this chapter and its means. Knowledge and piety alone are insufficient, for when anger surges, mere knowledge and piety do not suffice to suppress it unless one’s nature is receptive through good character. In truth, piety is not complete without good character and the ability to control desire and anger. Through this, the enjoiner of good remains patient with what befalls him in God’s religion; otherwise, if his honor, wealth, or person is harmed by insult or beating, he forgets enjoining good, neglects God’s religion, and becomes preoccupied with himself. Indeed, he may even initiate it seeking status and fame. These three qualities make enjoining good an act of nearness to God and through them evils are repelled. If they are lacking, evil is not repelled; indeed, enjoining good may itself become an evil by exceeding the legal limit therein.

These etiquettes are indicated by the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him: “No one enjoins good and forbids evil except one who is gentle in what he enjoins, gentle in what he forbids, forbearing in what he enjoins, forbearing in what he forbids, knowledgeable in what he enjoins, knowledgeable in what he forbids.” The hadith: “No one enjoins good and forbids evil except one who is gentle in what he enjoins, gentle in what he forbids” — I have not found it exactly thus. Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu‘ab reports from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, from his grandfather: “Whoever enjoins good, let his enjoining be good.” This indicates that it is not required to be absolutely knowledgeable, but rather in what he enjoins and forbids; similarly with forbearance. Al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, said: “If you are among those who enjoin good, be among those who practice it, or you will perish.” It has been said: “Do not blame a person for his action while you are attributed with its like; whoever condemns something and then does its like only disgraces his own intellect.” We do not mean by this that enjoining good becomes prohibited due to sinfulness, but its effect on hearts is nullified by the apparent sinfulness of the person to people. It is reported from Anas, may God be pleased with him, who said: “We said, ‘O Messenger of God, we will not enjoin good until we practice it all, and we will not forbid evil until we avoid it all.’ The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: ‘Rather, enjoin good even if you do not practice it all, and forbid evil even if you do not avoid it all.’” The hadith of Anas: “We said, ‘O Messenger of God, we will not enjoin good until we practice it all, and we will not forbid evil until we avoid it all.’ He said, peace be upon him: ‘Rather, enjoin good even if you do not practice it all, and forbid evil even if you do not avoid it all.’” Al-Tabarani transmitted it in Al-Mu‘jam al-Saghir and Al-Awsat, and in its chain is ‘Abd al-Quddus ibn Habib, about whom they unanimously agreed.

He left it, and one of the early pious predecessors advised his sons, saying: "If any of you intends to enjoin good, let him prepare his soul for patience and trust in the reward from God. For whoever trusts in the reward from God will not feel the touch of harm." Thus, among the etiquettes of enjoining good is preparing the soul for patience. For this reason, God the Exalted coupled patience with enjoining good, saying, narrating from Luqman: "O my son, establish prayer, enjoin good, forbid evil, and be patient over what befalls you." Among the etiquettes is reducing attachments so that his fear does not multiply, and severing hope from creatures so that hypocrisy departs from him. It is narrated from some of the shaykhs that he had a cat, and he would take from a butcher in his neighborhood every day something from the glands for his cat. Then he saw the butcher committing a wrong, so he first entered his house and brought out the cat, then came and enjoined good upon the butcher. The butcher said to him: "I will not give you anything for your cat after this." He said: "I did not enjoin good upon you except after bringing out the cat and severing hope from you." And it is as he said. So whoever does not sever hope from people will not be capable of enjoining good. And whoever hopes that people's hearts be pleased with him and their tongues be free in praising him, enjoining good will not be made easy for him. Ka'b al-Ahbar said to Abu Muslim al-Khawlani: "How is your standing among your people?" He said: "Good." He said: "The Torah says: 'When a man enjoins good and forbids evil, his standing among his people becomes bad.'" Abu Muslim said: "The Torah has spoken truthfully, and Abu Muslim has lied." What indicates the obligation of gentleness is what al-Ma'mun cited as proof when a preacher admonished him and spoke harshly to him. He said: "O man, be gentle, for God sent one better than you to one worse than me and commanded him with gentleness, saying: 'Speak to him gently; perhaps he may remember or fear.'" So let the one who enjoins good follow the example of the prophets, prayers of God be upon them, in gentleness. It is narrated by Abu Umamah that a young man came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said: "O Prophet of God, permit me to fornicate." The people shouted at him. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Bring him closer." He came closer until he sat before him. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Would you like it for your mother?" He said: "No, may God make me your ransom." He said: "Likewise, people do not like it for their mothers. Would you like it for your daughter?" He said: "No, may God make me your ransom." He said: "Likewise, people do not like it for their daughters. Would you like it for your sister?" The narration of Abu Umamah that a young man said: "O Messenger of God, permit me to fornicate," and the people shouted at him—the hadith is narrated by Ahmad with a good chain, its narrators are narrators of the Sahih. Ibn 'Awf added until he mentioned the paternal aunt and maternal aunt, and he would say for each one: "No, may God make me your ransom," and he, peace be upon him, would say: "Likewise, people do not like it." And both of them in their narration—meaning Ibn 'Awf and the other narrator—said: Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, placed his hand on his chest and said: "O God, purify his heart, forgive his sin, and protect his chastity." So there was nothing more hateful to him than that—meaning fornication. It was said to al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad, may God have mercy on him: "Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah accepts gifts from the ruler." Al-Fudayl said: "He only took from them less than his due." Then he met him privately and admonished and rebuked him. Sufyan said: "O Abu 'Ali, if we are not among the righteous, we indeed love the righteous." And Hammad ibn Salamah said: "Silah ibn Ashim passed by a man who had let his garment drag, and his companions wanted to seize him harshly. He said: 'Leave him to me; I will suffice you.' He said: 'O nephew, I have a need from you.' He said: 'What is your need, uncle?' He said: 'I would like you to raise your garment.' He said: 'Yes, and with honor.' So he raised his garment. He said to his companions: 'If you had seized him harshly, he would have said: No, and no honor, and would have insulted you.'" And Muhammad ibn Zakariyya al-Ghallabi said: "I witnessed 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn 'A'ishah one night when he left the mosque after Maghrib heading to his home, and on his way was a young man from Quraysh who was drunk and had seized a woman and was dragging her, and she cried for help. The people gathered around him beating him. Ibn 'A'ishah looked at him and recognized him, so he said to the people: 'Step back from my nephew.' Then he said: 'Come to me, O nephew.' The young man felt ashamed and came to him, and he embraced him to himself, then said to him: 'Go with me.' So he went with him until he reached his home, and he brought him into the house and said to one of his servants: 'His lodging is with you. When he sobers from his drunkenness, inform him of what he did, and do not let him leave until you bring him to me.' When he sobered up, he reminded him of what had happened, and he felt ashamed and wept and intended to leave. The servant said: 'He has ordered that you come to him.' So he brought him to him, and he said to him: 'Are you not ashamed for yourself? Are you not ashamed for your honor? Do you not see from your children? Fear God and desist from what you are in.' The young man wept with his head lowered, then raised his head and said: 'I have made a covenant with God the Exalted—He will ask me about it on the Day of Resurrection—that I will not return to drinking wine or to anything I was in, and I have repented.' He said: 'Come closer to me,' and kissed his head and said: 'You have done well, my son.' And after that, the young man kept close to him."

And it was written from him the Hadith, and that was through the blessing of his gentleness. Then he said: "Verily, the people command the good and forbid the evil, yet their good may become evil. So upon you is gentleness in all your affairs; through it you will attain what you seek."

And from Al-Fath ibn Shakhraf, he said: A man became infatuated with a woman and accosted her, and in his hand was a knife; none could approach him but he would wound them, and the man was of powerful build. While the people were in that state and the woman was screaming in his grasp, Bishr ibn al-Harith passed by. He drew near to him and rubbed his shoulder against the man's shoulder, and the man fell to the ground. Bishr walked on. They approached the man, and he was drenched in profuse sweat, and the woman went on her way. They asked him, "What is your condition?" He said, "I do not know, but an elder brushed against me and said to me, 'Verily, God Almighty is looking at you and at what you do.' My legs weakened at his words, and I was seized by an intense awe, and I do not know who that man was." They said to him, "It was Bishr ibn al-Harith." He said, "Woe is me! How can I be looked upon after today?" The man fell ill from that day and died on the seventh day.

Thus was the custom of the people of religion in commanding right and forbidding wrong. We have transmitted in this regard narrations and reports in the chapter on Hatred for the Sake of God and Love for the Sake of God from the Book of the Etiquettes of Companionship, so we shall not prolong by repetition. This concludes the examination of the degrees of commanding right and its etiquettes. And God is the Granter of success by His grace, and praise be to God for all His favors.

**The Third Chapter: On Familiar Wrongs in Customs**

We shall point to a summary of them so that one may infer their like from them, for there is no hope of enumerating and exhausting them. Among these are the wrongs of the mosques.

Know that wrongs are divided into the reprehensible and the prohibited. When we say this is a reprehensible wrong, know that preventing it is recommended and remaining silent about it is reprehensible, but it is not forbidden, unless the doer does not know it is reprehensible, in which case it is obligatory to mention it to him, for reprehensibility is a legal ruling that must be conveyed to one who does not know it. When we say a prohibited wrong, or we say a wrong absolutely, we thereby intend the prohibited, and remaining silent about it while having the capacity is prohibited.

What is frequently witnessed in mosques is the corruption of prayer by abandoning tranquility in the bowing and prostration, and this is a wrong that invalidates the prayer by the explicit text of the Hadith. Forbidding it is obligatory, except in the case of a Hanafi who believes that does not prevent the validity of the prayer, for forbidding is of no benefit with him. And whoever sees one corrupting his prayer and remains silent about it is his partner in it. Thus has the report come. And in the narration is what indicates it, for it is reported concerning backbiting that the listener is a partner of the speaker: "The backbiter and the listener are two partners in sin." This was mentioned previously in the Book of Fasting. Likewise, everything that impairs the validity of prayer, such as an impurity on his garment which he does not see, or a deviation from the direction of prayer due to darkness or blindness—all of that necessitates commanding right therein.

Among them is reciting the Quran with incorrect inflection; forbidding it is obligatory, and teaching the correct recitation is obligatory. If the one in retreat in the mosque wastes most of his time in such matters and is occupied by them to the neglect of supererogatory prayers and remembrance, then let him occupy himself with this, for it is better for him than his remembrance and supererogatory prayers, because this is an obligation and it is an act of worship whose benefit extends to others; thus it is more pressing than a supererogatory act whose benefit is confined to himself. If that prevents him from, for example, book-copying or from the livelihood which is his sustenance, then if he has enough for his sufficiency, it is incumbent upon him to occupy himself with that, and it is not permissible for him to abandon commanding right in pursuit of increase in worldly matters. But if he needs to earn for his daily sustenance, that is an excuse for him, and the obligation falls from him due to his incapacity.

As for the one who frequently recites with incorrect inflection, if he is capable of learning, he must refrain from recitation before learning, for he is disobedient by it. If his tongue does not comply, then if most of what he recites is with incorrect inflection, he should leave it and strive to learn the Opening Chapter and correct it. If most is correct and he is unable to make it all even, there is no harm for him to recite, but he should lower his voice so that others do not hear him. There is also an aspect to preventing him privately. However, if that is the limit of his ability and he finds solace in recitation and is eager for it, I see no harm in it, and God knows best.

Among them is the mutual signaling of the muezzins during the call to prayer, and their prolonging it by extending its words, and their turning away from the direction of prayer with their entire chest during the two "hayya 'ala" phrases, or each one of them performing the call separately but without pausing until the other's call is cut off, such that the response to the call becomes confused for those present due to the overlapping of voices. All of that are reprehensible wrongs that must be made known. If they are done knowingly, then preventing them and commanding right therein is recommended.

Likewise, if the mosque has a single muezzin and he gives the call before dawn, he should be prevented from giving the call after dawn, for that disturbs the fasting and the prayers of the people, unless it is known that he gives the call before dawn so that one does not rely on his call for prayer and for abandoning the pre-dawn meal, or unless there is with him another muezzin with a known voice who gives the call at dawn.

Among the reprehensible acts is also multiplying the call to prayer, one after another after the rising of dawn, in a single mosque...

Successive and closely spaced times, whether from one person or a group, are of no benefit if no one remains asleep in the mosque and the sound does not extend beyond the mosque to awaken others. All of that is among the disliked actions contrary to the practice of the Companions and the early predecessors. Among them is that the preacher wears a black garment dominated by silk or holds a gilded sword—he is a transgressor, and censuring him is obligatory. As for mere blackness, it is not disliked, but it is not beloved, for the most beloved garments to God Almighty are white. Whoever says it is disliked and an innovation intends by it that it was not customary in the first era, but if there is no prohibition regarding it, it should not be called an innovation or disliked; rather, it is forsaking what is more beloved. Among them is the speech of storytellers and preachers who mix innovation into their words. If the storyteller lies in his accounts, he is a transgressor, and censuring him is obligatory. Likewise, the innovating preacher must be prevented, and it is not permissible to attend his gathering except with the intention of manifesting refutation against him, either to all if one is able, or to some of those present around him. If one is not able, it is not permissible to listen to innovations. God Almighty said to His Prophet: "So turn away from them until they engage in discourse other than this." Whenever his speech inclines toward laxity and emboldening people toward sins, and people increase in boldness through his words, and in reliance on God's pardon and mercy, causing their hope to outweigh their fear, it is reprehensible and must be prevented from him, for the corruption in that is great. Indeed, if their fear outweighs their hope, that is more fitting and closer to human nature, for they are in greater need of fear. Justice is the balancing of fear and hope, as 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "If a caller were to call on the Day of Resurrection for all people to enter Hell except one man, I would hope to be that man; and if a caller were to call for all people to enter Paradise except one man, I would fear to be that man." Whenever the preacher is a youth adorned for women in his clothing and appearance, frequent in poetry, gestures, and movements, and women attend his gathering, this is reprehensible and must be prevented, for corruption in it is greater than benefit. This becomes evident from him through circumstantial indications of his state. Indeed, preaching should not be entrusted except to one whose outward appearance is piety, his demeanor tranquility and dignity, and his attire that of the righteous; otherwise, people only increase further in misguidance. A barrier must be placed between men and women to prevent gazing, for that is also a source of corruption, and customs testify to these reprehensible matters. Women must be prevented from attending mosques for prayers and remembrance gatherings if temptation is feared from them, for 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, prevented them. It was said to her: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not prevent them from congregational prayers." She said: "If the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had known what they would innovate after him, he would have prevented them." The narration of 'A'isha: "If the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had known what women would innovate after him, he would have prevented them from the mosques," is agreed upon. As for a woman passing through the mosque while covered, she is not prevented from it, though it is preferable not to take the mosque as a thoroughfare at all. The recitation of reciters before preachers with elongation and melodies in a manner that alters the arrangement of the Qur'an and exceeds the limits of revelation is reprehensible, strongly disliked, censured by a group of the early predecessors. Among them are circles on Friday for selling medicines, foods, and amulets, and the standing of beggars, their recitation of the Qur'an, their chanting of poetry, and the like. Among these things, some are prohibited because they involve deception and falsehood, like the liars among the methods of physicians, the people of sleight of hand and deceptions, and likewise the practitioners of amulets mostly resort to selling them through deceptions upon children and the common folk—this is forbidden in the mosque and outside the mosque, and must be prevented. Indeed, every sale involving falsehood, deception, and concealing defects from the buyer is forbidden. Among them are things permissible outside the mosque, like tailoring, selling medicines, books, and foods—this in the mosque is also not forbidden except due to an incidental factor, which is that it narrows the space for worshippers and disturbs their prayer. If there is nothing of that sort, it is not forbidden, though it is preferable to abandon it. However, a condition for its permissibility is that it occurs in rare times and limited days, for making the mosque a permanent shop renders it forbidden and must be prevented. Among permissible things, some are permissible on the condition of rarity; if it becomes frequent, it becomes a minor sin, just as among sins some are minor on the condition of not persisting. If a little of this, were its door opened, is feared to lead to much, it should be prevented. This prevention should be up to the ruler or the one in charge of the mosque's affairs appointed by the ruler, because that cannot be achieved through personal reasoning, and individuals may not prevent what is inherently permissible out of fear that it may become frequent.

The entry of the insane, children, and the intoxicated into the mosque is permissible. There is no issue with a child entering the mosque if he does not play, nor is playing in the mosque forbidden for him, nor is remaining silent about his play, unless the mosque is taken as a playground and it becomes habitual; then it must be prevented. This is among matters where a small amount is permissible but a large amount is not. The evidence for the permissibility of a small amount is what is narrated in the two Sahih collections: that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, stood for the sake of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, until she looked at the Ethiopians dancing and playing with shields and spears in the mosque on the day of Eid. There is no doubt that if the Ethiopians had taken the mosque as a playground, they would have been prevented from it, but this was not considered reprehensible due to its rarity and small amount; rather, he looked at it. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded it for them so that Aisha could observe them, to gladden her heart, as he said, "Proceed, O sons of Arfadah," as we transmitted it in the Book of Listening. As for the insane, there is no issue with their entering the mosque unless it is feared they will soil it, or utter abuse, or speak what is obscene, or engage in what is reprehensible in its appearance, such as exposing private parts and the like. As for the quiet, calm insane person whose stillness and silence are known by habit, he should not be expelled from the mosque. The intoxicated person is in the same ruling as the insane. If it is feared from him vomiting—meaning throwing up—or harm by tongue, he must be expelled. Likewise, if he is of disturbed mind, that is feared from him. If he has drunk but is not intoxicated, yet the smell emanates from him, it is reprehensible and strongly disliked. How could it not be, when one who eats garlic and onions—this hadith was not transmitted by al-'Iraqi, but the commentator transmitted it from al-Bukhari, Muslim, and others—the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade him from attending mosques, but that is understood as dislike. The matter with wine is more severe. If someone says, "The intoxicated should be struck and expelled from the mosque as a deterrent," we say no; rather, he should sit in the mosque and be called to and commanded to abandon drinking as long as he is currently rational. As for striking him as a deterrent, that is not for individuals but for the authorities, and that is upon his admission or the testimony of two witnesses. As for merely the smell, no. However, if he walks among people swaying such that his intoxication is known, it is permissible to strike him in the mosque and elsewhere to prevent him from showing the effect of intoxication, for showing the effect of immorality is immoral, and sins must be abandoned, and after the act, they must be concealed along with their traces. If he is concealed and hides his effect, it is not permissible to spy on him. The smell may emanate without drinking, by sitting where wine is or by it reaching the mouth without swallowing, so one should not rely on it.

Among the reprehensible matters customary in markets are lying in bargaining and concealing defects. If someone says, for example, "I bought this commodity for ten and I profit such and such in it," and he is lying, he is sinful. Whoever knows that must inform the buyer of his lie. If he remains silent out of consideration for the seller's feelings, he is a partner in betrayal and disobeys by his silence. Likewise, if he knows of a defect, he must alert the buyer to it; otherwise, he is content with the loss of his Muslim brother's wealth, and that is forbidden. Likewise, disparity in measurement, whether by cubit, dry measure, or scale, must be changed by whoever knows it, either himself or by reporting it to the authority so he may change it. Among them is abandoning offer and acceptance and relying on tacit transaction, but that is within the scope of scholarly discretion, so it is not deemed reprehensible except for one who believes it obligatory. Likewise, in invalid conditions customary among people, they must be deemed reprehensible, for they corrupt contracts. Likewise, in all usurious transactions, which are prevalent, and likewise all other invalid transactions. Among them is selling amusement devices and selling shapes of animals depicted during Eid days for the sake of children; those must be broken and their sale prevented, like amusement devices. Likewise, selling vessels made of gold and silver, and selling silk garments and hats of gold and silk—meaning those that are only suitable for men or it is known by the custom of the land that only men wear them—all of that is reprehensible and prohibited. Likewise, one who habitually sells worn, shortened clothes that are worn by people due to their shortness and wear, and claims they are new—this action is forbidden, and preventing it is obligatory. Likewise, patching torn clothes in a way that leads to deception, and all types of contracts leading to deceptions—enumerating them would be lengthy, so let what we have not mentioned be judged by what we have mentioned.

Among the reprehensible matters customary in streets are placing pillars and building benches connected to owned buildings, planting trees, extending balconies and awnings, and placing wood, loads of grain, and food on pathways. All of that is reprehensible if it leads to narrowing the paths and harming passersby, even if it does not lead to any harm at all.

The sting of the path does not prevent it; indeed, it is permissible to place firewood and loads of food on the road in the quantity that is transported to houses, for that is something in which the general public shares a need, and it is not possible to prevent it. Likewise, tying beasts of burden on the road in a manner that narrows the path and soils the passersby is a reprehensible act that must be prevented, except to the extent needed for dismounting and mounting. This is because streets are for shared benefit, and no one has the right to claim exclusive use of them except to the extent of necessity. Grazing is the need for which streets are typically used, apart from other needs. Among these is the market for beasts of burden and thorns upon them that tear people's garments; that is reprehensible if it is possible to tie and gather them so they do not tear, or if it is possible to divert them to a spacious place; otherwise, there is no prevention, for the need of the town's people is pressing for it. Indeed, they should not be left discarded on the streets except for the duration of transport. Similarly, loading beasts with burdens they cannot bear is reprehensible; the owners must be prevented from it. Likewise, the butcher's slaughter, if he slaughters on the road adjacent to the shop door and soils the road with blood, is reprehensible and must be prevented. Rather, his right is to make a slaughtering place within his shop, for in that is a narrowing of the road and harm to people due to the splattering of impurity and because natures find filth repulsive. Similarly, throwing garbage on the main roads, scattering watermelon rinds, or sprinkling water where slipping and stumbling are feared—all of that is among reprehensible acts. Likewise, discharging water from spouts projecting from a wall onto a narrow road, for that soils garments or narrows the road, is not prevented on wide roads since diversion from it is possible. As for leaving rainwater, mud, and snow on roads without sweeping, that is reprehensible, but it is not specific to a particular person, except for snow which is specifically dumped on the road by one person, and water that collects on the road from a specific spout—then its owner in particular must sweep the road. If it is from rain, that is a general public duty, so it is upon the authorities to oblige people to undertake it, and individuals have no role in it except admonition only. Likewise, if one has a vicious dog at his house door that harms people, he must be prevented from it. If it only harms by soiling the road and it is possible to guard against its impurity, he is not prevented from it. If it narrows the road by stretching its forelegs, he is prevented from it. Rather, its owner is prevented from sleeping on the road or sitting in a manner that narrows the road, so his dog is more deserving of prevention. Reprehensible acts of bathhouses include images that are at the bathhouse door or inside the bathhouse; they must be removed by everyone who enters if they are able. If the place is high and their hand cannot reach it, it is not permissible for them to enter except out of necessity, so let them turn to another bathhouse, for witnessing the reprehensible is not allowed. It suffices to deface its countenance and thereby nullify its image. Images of trees and other engravings are not prevented, except images of living beings. Among them is exposing private parts and looking at them, and among them is the masseur uncovering the thigh and what is below the navel to remove dirt; indeed, among them is putting the hand under the loincloth, for touching another's private part is forbidden like looking at it. Among them is lying face down before the masseur for kneading the thighs and buttocks; this is disliked if there is a barrier, but it is not prohibited if movement of desire is not feared. Likewise, exposing the private part to a non-Muslim cupper is among abominations, for it is not permissible for a woman to expose her body to a non-Muslim woman in the bathhouse, so how could it be permissible for her to expose her private parts to men? Among them is dipping the hand into impure vessels in small quantities of water, and washing an impure loincloth or basin in a pool with little water, for that contaminates the water, except according to the school of Malik, so it is not permissible to denounce it among Malikis, but it is permissible according to Hanafis and Shafi'is. If a Maliki and a Shafi'i gather in the bathhouse, it is not for the Shafi'i to prevent the Maliki from that except by way of request and gentleness, which is to say to him, "We need to wash the hand first, then dip it in the water, but you are free from harming me and depriving me of purification," and what follows this course. For matters of juristic discretion, it is not possible to enforce public morality through coercion. Among them is that there be smooth, slippery stones at the entrances to bathhouse rooms and the channels of its waters upon which the heedless slip; this is reprehensible and must be uprooted and removed, and the bathhouse keeper is denounced for neglecting it, for it leads to falling, and falling may lead to the breaking or dislocation of a limb. Similarly, leaving slippery lotus leaves and soap on the bathhouse floor is reprehensible. Whoever does that and leaves, leaving it behind, and a person slips on it and a limb of his is broken, and that was in a place where it is not apparent such that guarding against it is difficult, then liability oscillates between the one who left it and the bathhouse keeper.

The bath attendant, whose duty is to clean the bathhouse and the face, is liable for compensation if he neglects it on the first day, and on the second day, as it is customary to clean the bathhouse daily, and the timing for re-cleaning is determined by customary practices, so let this be considered. There are other disliked matters in the bathhouse, which we have mentioned in the Book of Purification, so refer there. Among the reprehensible practices in hospitality are spreading silk carpets for men, which is forbidden, as well as burning incense in a silver or gold censer, or serving drink, or using rosewater in silver vessels or those with silver tops. Also included are hanging curtains with images on them, listening to stringed instruments or the singing of female singers, and women gathering on rooftops to look at men, especially if there are young men among them from whom temptation is feared. All of that is prohibited and reprehensible, and must be changed. Whoever is unable to change it must leave, and whoever is not permitted to sit has no concession to sit witnessing such evils. As for images on cushions and spread carpets, they are not reprehensible, nor are those on plates and bowls, but vessels made in the shape of images are forbidden; for instance, some censers have tops shaped like birds, which is forbidden, and the portion bearing the image must be broken. There is disagreement regarding small silver kohl containers, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal left a gathering because of them. Whenever the food is forbidden, the place is usurped, or the spread garments are forbidden, it is among the gravest of evils. If among them is someone who indulges in drinking wine alone, attendance is not permissible, for it is not lawful to attend drinking gatherings, even if one abstains from drinking. It is also not permissible to sit with a sinner while he is actively engaged in sin; consideration of sitting with him afterward concerns whether one must hate him for God's sake and shun him, as we mentioned in the chapter on love and hatred for God's sake. Likewise, if among them is someone who wears silk or a gold ring, he is a sinner, and it is not permissible to sit with him without necessity. If the garment is on a non-adult boy, this is a matter for consideration; the correct view is that it is reprehensible and must be removed from him if he is discerning, due to the general statement of the Prophet, peace be upon him: "These two are forbidden for the males of my community." The hadith "These two are forbidden for the males of my community" was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ali, and it was previously mentioned in the fourth chapter of the Etiquettes of Eating. Just as a boy must be prevented from drinking wine, not because he is legally responsible, but because he becomes accustomed to it, so that when he reaches puberty it becomes difficult for him to abstain, similarly, the desire to adorn oneself with silk overcomes him if he becomes accustomed to it, thus sowing corruption in his heart, from which grows a deep-rooted tree of desire that is difficult to uproot after puberty. As for a boy who is not discerning, the meaning of prohibition is weakened in his case, though it is not free from possibility, and knowledge rests with God. The insane person is in the same category as the non-discerning boy. Yes, adorning with gold and silk is permissible for women without extravagance. I see no concession in piercing a girl's ear for the purpose of hanging a gold earring, for this is a painful wound, and such an act warrants retaliation, so it is not permissible except for an important need, like phlebotomy, cupping, or circumcision. Adornment with earrings is not important; rather, sufficiency is found in hanging them on the ear without piercing, and in necklaces and bracelets. This, even if customary, is forbidden, and preventing it is obligatory; hiring for it is invalid, and the wage taken for it is forbidden, unless a concession is established through transmission, but no concession has reached us thus far. Also, if among the guests is an innovator who speaks of his innovation, attendance is permissible for one who is capable of refuting him, with the intention to do so. If one is incapable, it is not permissible. If the innovator does not speak of his innovation, attendance is permissible while showing dislike toward him and turning away from him, as we mentioned in the chapter on hatred for God's sake. If there is a jester with tales and various anecdotes, if he jokes with obscenity and lies, attendance is not permissible, and when present, one must denounce him. If it is with jest containing no lie or obscenity, it is permissible, I mean in small amounts, but making it a profession and habit is not permissible. Every lie that is not concealed as a lie and not intended for deception is not among the reprehensible matters, such as a person saying, for example, "I sought you a hundred times today," and "I repeated the speech to you a thousand times," and what is similar, where it is known that truthfulness is not intended; that does not impair integrity nor cause testimony to be rejected. The limits of permissible jest and permissible lying will come in the Book of the Afflictions of the Tongue from the Quarter of the Destructive Matters. Also, extravagance in food and construction is reprehensible; indeed, in wealth there are two evils: one is wastefulness, and the other is extravagance. Wastefulness is squandering wealth without a benefit that is considered significant, such as burning...

Tearing a garment, demolishing a building without purpose, and throwing wealth into the sea are all forms of waste. In the same category is spending wealth on professional mourners and musicians, and on various types of corruption, because these are benefits prohibited by the Sacred Law, thus rendering the wealth as if it were non-existent. As for *israf* (extravagance/waste), it may be used to refer to spending wealth on mourners, musicians, and sinful matters. It may also be used to refer to spending on permissible things of their kind, but with excess. Excess varies relative to circumstances. For example, we would say that a man who possesses only one hundred dinars, with dependents and children who have no livelihood except this, and who spends it all on a feast, is wasteful and must be restrained. The Exalted said, "And do not make your hand chained to your neck, nor stretch it forth to the utmost limit, lest you become blameworthy and destitute." This was revealed concerning a man in Medina who distributed all his wealth and left nothing for his dependents, then was required to provide for them and could not. And the Exalted said, "And do not be wasteful, for the wasteful are brothers of the devils." Likewise, the Mighty and Majestic said, "And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy." Therefore, whoever is extravagant in this manner is to be censured, and it is incumbent upon the judge to place him under interdiction, unless the man is alone and possesses a true, powerful reliance upon God; then he may spend all his wealth in the paths of righteousness. But one who has dependents or is incapable of such reliance is not permitted to give all his wealth in charity. Similarly, if one spends all his wealth on decorating his walls and adorning his buildings, this is also prohibited extravagance. However, doing so for one who possesses abundant wealth is not prohibited, because adornment is a sound purpose. Mosques have always been adorned, and their doors and ceilings decorated, even though decorating doors and ceilings has no benefit except mere adornment. The same applies to houses. Likewise, the ruling applies to beautifying oneself with clothes and foods: it is permissible in its kind, but becomes extravagance relative to the man's condition and wealth. Such reprehensible matters are many and cannot be enumerated. Judge by these the gatherings in courts of judges, the offices of rulers, schools of jurists, Sufi lodges, and market inns—no place is free from a reprehensible, disliked, or dangerous matter. To exhaustively list all reprehensible matters would require encompassing all the details of the Sacred Law, its principles and branches, so let us limit ourselves to this amount.

**General Reprehensible Matters:** Know that every person sitting in his house, wherever he may be, is not free in this time from a reprehensible matter in terms of neglecting to guide people, teach them, and urge them to good. Most people are ignorant of the Sacred Law regarding the conditions of prayer in the cities, let alone in villages and deserts. Among them are Bedouins, Kurds, Turkomans, and other types of people. It is obligatory that in every mosque and neighborhood of a city there be a jurist to teach people their religion, and likewise in every village. It is obligatory upon every jurist—after fulfilling his personal obligation and freeing himself for the communal obligation—to go out to those neighboring his town from the rural folk, Arabs, Kurds, and others, and teach them their religion and the obligations of their Sacred Law. He should take provisions with him to eat and not eat from their food, for most of it is usurped. If one person undertakes this duty, the burden is lifted from the others; otherwise, the burden encompasses all. As for the scholar, it is due to his negligence in going out; as for the ignorant, it is due to his negligence in abandoning learning. Every commoner who knows the conditions of prayer must teach others; otherwise, he is a partner in the sin. It is known that a person is not born knowing the Sacred Law; rather, conveying it is obligatory upon the people of knowledge. Everyone who learns a single issue is among its people of knowledge. By my life, the sin upon the jurists is greater because their capability in it is more evident, and it is more fitting to their craft, for if professionals abandoned their craft, livelihoods would be ruined. They have undertaken a matter indispensable for the rectification of creation. The affair and craft of the jurist is to convey what has reached him from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, for the scholars are the heirs of the prophets. A person may sit in his house and not go to the mosque because he sees that the people do not perform prayer properly. However, if he knows this, it becomes obligatory upon him to go out to teach and forbid. Likewise, everyone who is certain that in the market there is a reprehensible matter occurring constantly or at a specific time, and he is capable of changing it, it is not permissible for him to absolve himself by sitting at home. Rather, he must go out. If he is incapable of changing all of it but is cautious from witnessing it and is capable of changing some, he must go out, because his going out for the purpose of changing what he is capable of does not harm him by witnessing what he is incapable of. What is prohibited is attending to witness the reprehensible without a sound purpose. It is incumbent upon every Muslim to begin with himself, rectifying it by adhering to obligations and abandoning prohibitions, then to teach that to his household, then, after finishing with them, to extend to his neighbors, then to the people of his locality, then to the people of his town, then to...

The people of the cultivated lands surrounding his town, then to the people of the deserts from among the Kurds, Arabs, and others, and so on to the farthest reaches of the world. If the nearer one fulfills it, the obligation falls from the farther one; otherwise, the obligation burdens every capable person, whether near or far. The obligation does not fall as long as there remains on the face of the earth one ignorant of an obligation from the obligations of his religion, while he is capable of striving towards it himself or through another to learn his obligation. This is an all-consuming occupation for one concerned with the affair of his religion, occupying him from dividing his time in rare subsidiary issues and delving into the minutiae of sciences that are among the communal obligations (fard kifayah). Nothing takes precedence over this except an individual obligation (fard 'ayn) or a communal obligation more important than it.

The Fourth Chapter: Concerning the affair of the rulers and sultans and forbidding them from evil.

We have mentioned the degrees of commanding good, that its first is instruction, its second is admonition, its third is harshness in speech, and its fourth is prevention by force through compelling to the truth by striking and punishment. What is permissible from all of that with the sultans are the first two ranks, which are instruction and admonition. As for prevention by force, that is not for individual subjects with the sultan, for that stirs up strife, incites evil, and what results from it of harm is greater. As for harshness in speech, such as saying, "O oppressor! O one who fears not God!" and what follows its course, that is not permissible if it stirs a strife whose evil extends to others. If he fears only for himself, it is permissible, rather recommended. For it was from the practice of the predecessors to expose themselves to dangers and to speak openly with disapproval, without concern for the destruction of life or exposure to various types of torment, knowing that it is martyrdom. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best of martyrs is Hamzah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, then a man who stood before a ruler, commanding him and forbidding him for the sake of God Almighty, and was killed for that." A hadith: "The best of martyrs is Hamzah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, then a man who stood before a man, commanding him and forbidding him for the sake of God, and was killed for that." Al-Hakim transmitted it from the hadith of Jabir and said its chain is sound. It was mentioned in the preceding chapter. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best jihad is a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler." A hadith: "The best jihad is a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler." It was mentioned previously. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, described 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, saying: "He is an iron horn; no blame of a blamer takes him in [the cause of] God." And he left his saying the truth, having no friend. A hadith describing him, peace and blessings be upon him, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab as an iron horn whom no blame of a blamer takes in [the cause of] God; he left his saying the truth, having no friend. Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it with a weak chain, limiting it to the end of the hadith from the hadith of 'Ali: "May God have mercy on 'Umar; he spoke the truth even if it was bitter. He left the truth, having no friend." As for the first part of the hadith, al-Tabarani transmitted that 'Umar said to Ka'b al-Ahbar: "How do you find my description?" He said: "I find your description an iron horn." He said: "And what is an iron horn?" He said: "A severe commander whom no blame of a blamer takes in [the cause of] God." When those firm in religion knew that the best speech is a word of truth before a tyrannical ruler, and that the possessor of that, if killed, is a martyr as the reports have come, they advanced towards that, preparing themselves for destruction, bearing various types of torment, and being patient in that for the sake of God Almighty, and expecting reward from God for what they sacrifice of their lives.

The method of admonishing the sultans and commanding them to good and forbidding them from evil is what the scholars of the predecessors transmitted. We have presented a summary of that in the chapter on entering upon the rulers in the Book of the Lawful and the Prohibited. We will limit ourselves now to narratives from which the manner of admonition and the method of disapproving of them is known. Among them is what is reported of the disapproval of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, towards the nobles of Quraysh when they intended evil towards the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. That is what is reported from 'Urwah, may God be pleased with him, who said: I said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "What is the most you saw Quraysh attain against the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in what they showed of aggression towards him?" He said: I was present with them when their nobles gathered one day at al-Hijr and mentioned the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. They said: "We have not seen the like of what we have endured from this man: he has belittled our intellects, insulted our forefathers, criticized our religion, divided our community, and reviled our gods. We have endured from him a grave matter," or as they said. While they were in that state, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, appeared to them. He approached walking until he touched the Corner, then passed by them, circumambulating the House. When he passed by them, they made sarcastic remarks with some speech. He said: I recognized that on the face of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. Then he proceeded. When he passed the second time, they made similar remarks. I recognized that on his face, peace be upon him. Then he proceeded and passed by them the third time, and they made similar remarks until he stopped and said: "Do you hear, O assembly of Quraysh? By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad..."

I have brought you slaughter," he said. Then the people bowed their heads until there was not a man among them but that it was as if a bird had alighted upon his head. Even the most severe among them in that matter before that would mend it with the finest words he could find, to the point that he would say, "Depart, O Father of al-Qasim, rightly guided, for by God you were not ignorant." He said: Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, departed. When the next day came, they gathered in the Hijr, and I was with them. Some of them said to others, "You mentioned what has reached you concerning him and what has reached him concerning you, until when he confronted you with what you dislike, you abandoned him." While they were in that state, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, appeared. They rushed toward him as one man and surrounded him, saying, "Are you the one who says such-and-such? Are you the one who says such-and-such?"—referring to what had reached them of his criticism of their gods and their religion. He said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Yes, I am the one who says that." He said: By God, I saw a man among them take hold of the collar of his garment. He said: And Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, stood in his defense, saying while he wept, "Woe unto you! Would you kill a man for saying, 'My Lord is God'?" Then they turned away from him, and that was the most severe I ever saw Quraysh inflict upon him. The narration of 'Urwah: I said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, "What is the most you ever saw Quraysh inflict upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in the enmity they displayed?" The hadith is narrated at length by al-Bukhari in an abbreviated form and by Ibn Hibban in its entirety. In another narration from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, may God be pleased with them both, he said: While the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the courtyard of the Ka'bah, 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt approached, took the shoulder of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, twisted his garment around his neck, and choked him severely. Abu Bakr came, took him by his shoulder, and pushed him away from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saying, "Would you kill a man for saying, 'My Lord is God,' when he has come to you with clear proofs from your Lord?" The hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: While the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was in the courtyard of the Ka'bah, 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt approached and took the shoulder of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him... The hadith is narrated by al-Bukhari. And it is narrated that Mu'awiyah, may God be pleased with him, withheld the stipends. Abu Muslim al-Khawlani stood before him and said to him, "O Mu'awiyah, this is not from your toil, nor from the toil of your father, nor from the toil of your mother." He said: Mu'awiyah became angry, descended from the pulpit, and said to them, "Stay where you are," and disappeared from their sight for a time. Then he came out to them having performed a ritual bath, and said, "Abu Muslim spoke to me with words that angered me, and I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say, 'Anger is from Satan, and Satan was created from fire. Fire is only extinguished with water. So when one of you becomes angry, let him perform a ritual bath.'" The hadith of Mu'awiyah: "Anger is from Satan..." the hadith. At its beginning is a story narrated by Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah*, and in it is one whom I do not know. "And I entered and performed a ritual bath, and Abu Muslim spoke truth that it is not from my toil nor from the toil of my father. So come forward for your stipends." And it is narrated from Dabah ibn Muhsin al-'Anazi, who said: Abu Musa al-Ash'ari was appointed as our governor in Basrah. When he would address us, he would praise God and extol Him, send blessings upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and then begin to supplicate for 'Umar, may God be pleased with him. He said: That angered me from him, so I stood up to him and said, "Where are you concerning his companion, preferring him over him?" He did that repeatedly. Then he wrote to 'Umar complaining about me, saying, "Dabah ibn Muhsin al-'Anazi confronts me in my address." 'Umar wrote to him to send me to him. He said: So he sent me to him. I arrived and knocked on his door. He came out to me and said, "Who are you?" I said, "I am Dabah." He said to me, "No welcome and no hospitality." I said, "As for welcome, it is from God. As for hospitality, I have neither family nor wealth. For what reason have you deemed it lawful, O 'Umar, to summon me from my province without a sin I have committed or a thing I have done?" He said, "What is it that has occurred between you and my governor?" I said, "Now I will inform you of it. He, when he would address us, would praise God and extol Him, send blessings upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and then begin to supplicate for you. That angered me from him, so I stood up to him and said, 'Where are you concerning his companion, preferring him over him?' He did that repeatedly. Then he wrote to you complaining about me." He said: 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, burst forth weeping and said, "By God, you are more correct and better guided than he. Will you forgive me my sin, that God may forgive you?" I said, "May God forgive you, O Commander of the Faithful." He said: Then he burst forth weeping and said, "By God, a night of Abu Bakr and a day are better than 'Umar and the family of 'Umar. Shall I tell you of his night and his day?" I said, "Yes." He said: "As for the night: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, intended to depart from Makkah, fleeing from the polytheists, he left by night. Abu Bakr followed him, and he would walk sometimes in front of him, sometimes behind him, sometimes to his right, and sometimes to his left. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'What is this, O Abu Bakr? I do not recognize this from your usual behavior.' He said, 'O Messenger of God, I think of ambush, so I am in front of you, and I think of pursuit...'"

I would be behind you, at times to your right, at times to your left, not feeling secure for you." He said: So the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, walked that night on the tips of his toes until they became sore. When Abu Bakr saw that they had become sore, he carried him on his shoulders and began to hasten with him until he reached the mouth of the cave. He set him down and then said, "By Him who sent you with the truth, you shall not enter it until I enter it first. If there is anything inside, let it befall me before you." He entered and saw nothing inside, so he carried him and brought him in. In the cave was a crevice containing snakes and vipers. Abu Bakr plugged it with his foot, fearing that something might emerge from it towards the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and harm him. They began to strike Abu Bakr's foot, and his tears streamed down his cheeks from the pain he felt, while the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "O Abu Bakr, do not grieve; indeed, God is with us." Then God sent down His tranquility upon him and reassurance to Abu Bakr. This was his night.

As for his day: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away, the Arabs apostatized. Some of them said, "We will pray but we will not give zakah." I came to him, not sparing any advice, and said, "O Successor of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, be gentle with the people and show them kindness." He replied to me, "A tyrant in the Age of Ignorance, yet timid in Islam? By what means shall I gentle them? The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, has been taken, and revelation has ceased. By God, if they were to withhold from me a hobbling rope that they used to give to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, I would fight them for it." He said: So we fought for it, and by God, it was a sound judgment. This was his day.

Then he wrote to Abu Musa, reproaching him regarding the incident of Dabbah ibn Muhsin. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari was our governor in Basrah, and in it from 'Umar is that he said, "By God, a night of Abu Bakr and a day are better than 'Umar and the family of 'Umar. Shall I narrate to you his day and his night?" He mentioned the night of the Hijrah and the day of the Apostasy at length. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah with a weak chain as such. The story of the Hijrah is narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'A'ishah with a different context, and the two Shaykhs agreed upon it from the hadith of Abu Bakr with another wording. From his hadith, they both have: I said, "O Messenger of God, if one of them were to look at his feet, he would see us beneath his feet." He said, "O Abu Bakr, what do you think of two, God being the third of them?" As for his fighting against the people of Apostasy, it is in the two Sahihs from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away and Abu Bakr succeeded him, and those among the Arabs who disbelieved did so, 'Umar said to Abu Bakr, "How can you fight the people?" ... the hadith.

And from al-A'shami: 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah entered upon 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan while he was sitting on his couch, and around him were nobles from every tribe—this was in Mecca during the time of his pilgrimage in his caliphate. When he saw him, he rose to him, seated him with him on the couch, and sat before him, saying, "O Abu Muhammad, what is your need?" He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, fear God regarding the sanctity of God and the sanctity of His Messenger, so commit to its upkeep. Fear God regarding the children of the Emigrants and the Helpers, for it is by them that you sit in this position. Fear God regarding the people of the frontiers, for they are the fortress of the Muslims. Attend to the affairs of the Muslims, for you alone are responsible for them. Fear God regarding those at your door; do not neglect them nor shut your door against them." He said to him, "Yes, I will do so." Then he rose and stood, but 'Abd al-Malik seized him and said, "O Abu Muhammad, you have asked us for a need on behalf of others, and we have fulfilled it. What is your own need?" He said, "I have no need from any creature." Then he left. 'Abd al-Malik said, "This, by your father, is nobility."

It is also narrated that al-Walid ibn 'Abd al-Malik said to his chamberlain one day, "Stand at the door, and when a man passes by you, bring him in to me to converse with me." The chamberlain stood at the door for a while, and 'Ata' ibn Abi Rabah passed by him—he did not recognize him—so he said to him, "O elder, enter to the Commander of the Faithful, for he has ordered it." 'Ata' entered upon al-Walid, and with him was 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz. When 'Ata' drew near to al-Walid, he said, "Peace be upon you, O Walid." Al-Walid became angry with his chamberlain and said to him, "Woe to you! I ordered you to bring in a man to converse with me and keep me company, yet you brought in a man who did not deem it proper to address me by the name God has chosen for me." His chamberlain said to him, "No one else passed by me." Then he said to 'Ata', "Sit," and turned to him, conversing with him. Among what 'Ata' said to him was, "It has reached us that in Hell there is a valley called Habhab, which God has prepared for every unjust ruler in his judgment." Al-Walid was stunned by his words—he was sitting before the threshold of the council—and fell backward into the midst of the council, unconscious. 'Umar said to 'Ata', "You have killed the Commander of the Faithful!" 'Ata' seized the arm of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz and pinched him severely, saying to him, "O 'Umar, the matter is serious, so be serious." Then 'Ata' rose and departed. It has reached us from 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy on him, that he said, "I remained for a year feeling the pain of his pinch in my arm." And Ibn Abi Shumaylah was described with intellect and refinement.

He entered upon Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, and Abd al-Malik said to him, "Speak." He said, "What shall I speak, when I know that every word a speaker utters will be a burden upon him, except what is for God?" Then Abd al-Malik wept and said, "May God have mercy on you. People have never ceased to admonish and counsel one another." The man said, "O Commander of the Faithful, on the Day of Resurrection, people will not be saved from the choking bitterness and the sight of perdition therein, except those who please God by displeasing their own souls." Then Abd al-Malik wept and said, "Without doubt, I shall make these words a mirror set before my eyes as long as I live."

It is narrated from Ibn 'A'isha that al-Hajjaj summoned the jurists of Basra and the jurists of Kufa. We entered upon him, and al-Hasan al-Basri—may God have mercy on him—was the last to enter. Al-Hajjaj said, "Welcome, O Abu Sa'id! Come near to me." Then he called for a chair and placed it beside his couch, and he sat upon it. Al-Hajjaj began to converse with us and question us. When he mentioned Ali ibn Abi Talib—may God be pleased with him—he spoke ill of him, and we spoke ill of him similarly, to draw near to him and to be safe from his evil. Al-Hasan remained silent, biting his thumb. He said, "O Abu Sa'id, why do I see you silent?" He said, "What can I say?" He said, "Inform me of your opinion concerning Abu Turab." He said, "I heard God, glorious is His mention, say, 'We did not appoint the direction you were facing except to distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn back on their heels. It was indeed a great test except for those whom God has guided. God would not let your faith go to waste. Truly God is Kind and Merciful to mankind.' So concerning one whom God has guided from among the people of faith, I say: he is the cousin of the Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—and his son-in-law through his daughter, and the most beloved of people to him, and the possessor of blessed, precedent merits from God which you, nor anyone among people, can deny him or come between him and them. And I say: if Ali has any shortcoming, God is his reckoner. By God, I find no statement more just than this." Then al-Hajjaj's face darkened and changed, and he rose from his couch in anger and entered a room behind it, and we left.

'Amir al-Sha'bi said: I took al-Hasan by the hand and said, "O Abu Sa'id, you have angered the ruler and filled his heart with rancor." He said, "Away from me, O 'Amir! People say 'Amir al-Sha'bi is the scholar of the people of Kufa,' yet you come to a devil from among the devils of mankind, speak to him according to his desire, and agree with him in his opinion. Woe to you, O 'Amir! Why did you not fear God? If asked, you should have spoken the truth, or remained silent and been safe." 'Amir said, "O Abu Sa'id, I have said it, and I know what is in it." Al-Hasan said, "That is even greater as an argument against you and more severe in responsibility."

It is narrated that al-Hajjaj sent for al-Hasan. When he entered upon him, he said, "Are you the one who says, 'May God fight them! They killed the servants of God for a dinar and a dirham'?" He said, "Yes." He said, "What compelled you to this?" He said, "The covenant that God took from the scholars, that they should make it clear to the people and not conceal it." He said, "O Hasan, restrain your tongue, and beware lest I hear from you what I dislike, for I will separate your head from your body."

It is related that Hutiṭ al-Zayyat was brought to al-Hajjaj. When he entered upon him, he said, "Are you Hutiṭ?" He said, "Yes. Ask whatever you wish, for I have pledged to God at the Station (of Abraham) three qualities: if asked, I will speak truthfully; if tested, I will be patient; and if granted well-being, I will be grateful." He said, "So what do you say concerning me?" He said, "I say you are among the enemies of God on earth, violating sacred limits and killing on suspicion." He said, "Then what do you say concerning the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan?" He said, "I say his sin is greater than yours, for you are but one sin from among his sins." Al-Hajjaj said, "Apply the punishment to him." They continued punishing him until they split reeds for him, then placed them on his flesh and bound them with ropes, then they pulled reed by reed until they tore his flesh apart. They did not hear him say anything. It was said to al-Hajjaj, "He is at the point of death." He said, "Take him out and throw him in the marketplace." Ja'far said: I and a companion of his came to him and said, "O Hutiṭ, do you have any need?" He said, "A drink of water." They brought him a drink, then he died. He was eighteen years old—may God have mercy on him.

It is narrated that Umar ibn Hubayra summoned the jurists of the people of Basra, the people of Kufa, the people of Medina, and the people of Syria and their reciters. He began to question them and spoke with 'Amir al-Sha'bi, and he found that he had knowledge of everything he asked him. Then he turned to al-Hasan al-Basri and questioned him. Then he said, "These two are the ones: this is the man of the people of Kufa," meaning al-Sha'bi, "and this is the man of the people of Basra," meaning al-Hasan. He ordered the chamberlain to usher the people out and was left alone with al-Sha'bi and al-Hasan. He turned to al-Sha'bi and said, "O Abu 'Amr, I am the trustee of the Commander of the Faithful over Iraq and his governor over it, a man commanded to obedience. I have been tested with the subjects, and their right is incumbent upon me. I love to protect them and oversee what rectifies them, along with sincere counsel for them. Yet it reaches me from a group among the people of the regions something for which I find fault with them, so I withhold a portion of their stipend and place it in the treasury. My intention is to return it to them, but then the Commander of the Faithful is informed that I have withheld it in that manner, and he writes to me not to..."

He sends it, and I cannot refuse his command nor carry out his letter, for I am but a man commanded to obey. So, am I accountable in this and in similar matters where the intention is as I have described?" Al-Sha'bi said: I replied, "May God set the ruler aright. The ruler is like a father who errs and hits the mark." He was pleased with my words and delighted by them, and I saw joy on his face. He said, "Praise be to God." Then he turned to Al-Hasan and said, "What do you say, O Abu Sa'id?" He said, "I have heard the ruler's statement that he is the trustee of the Commander of the Faithful over Iraq and his agent upon it, a man commanded to obey, entrusted with the subjects, and obliged by their rights, their sincere counsel, and overseeing what rectifies them. The right of the subjects is binding upon you, and it is incumbent upon you to encompass them with sincere counsel. I heard 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Samurah al-Qurashi, a companion of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Whoever is entrusted with a flock and does not encompass them with sincere counsel, God will forbid Paradise to him.'" (Al-Hasan's narration from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Samurah: "Whoever is entrusted with a flock and does not encompass them with sincere counsel, God will forbid Paradise to him." Al-Baghawi narrated it in Mu'jam al-Sahabah with a weak chain, but the two Shaykhs agreed upon a similar version from Al-Hasan's narration from Ma'qil ibn Yasar.) And he says, "I sometimes withhold from their stipends intending their rectification and reform, and that they may return to obedience. Then it reaches the Commander of the Faithful that I have withheld them in that manner, and he writes to me not to return it. I cannot refuse his command, nor can I carry out his letter. The right of God is more binding than the right of the Commander of the Faithful, and God is more deserving of obedience. There is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator. So, compare the letter of the Commander of the Faithful with the Book of God Almighty. If you find it conforming to the Book of God, then take it; but if you find it contradicting the Book of God, then cast it aside. O Ibn Hubayrah, fear God, for soon a messenger from the Lord of the worlds will come to you, removing you from your throne and taking you from the expanse of your palace to the narrowness of your grave. You will leave your authority and your world behind you and advance to your Lord, descending upon your deeds. O Ibn Hubayrah, God can withhold you from Yazid, but Yazid cannot withhold you from God. The command of God is above every command, and there is no obedience in disobedience to God. I warn you of His punishment, which is not averted from the criminal people." Ibn Hubayrah said, "Hold back on your lameness, O elder, and refrain from mentioning the Commander of the Faithful, for the Commander of the Faithful is a man of knowledge, judgment, and virtue. God Almighty has entrusted him with what He has of this nation's affairs due to His knowledge of him and what He knows of his virtue and intention." Al-Hasan said, "O Ibn Hubayrah, the reckoning is behind you, lash for lash and wrath for wrath. God is vigilant, O Ibn Hubayrah. If you encounter one who counsels you sincerely in your religion and urges you to the matter of your Hereafter, it is better than meeting a man who deceives you and gives you false hopes." Ibn Hubayrah stood up, his face darkening and his color changing. Al-Sha'bi said: I said, "O Abu Sa'id, you have angered the ruler, stirred his chest, and deprived us of his kindness and gifts." He said, "Away from me, O 'Amir." I went out to Al-Hasan, wrapped in my cloak and with lowered gaze. He had high status and belittled us, treating us harshly, and he was worthy of what he attained, while we were worthy of that treatment. I have not seen the like of Al-Hasan among the scholars I have met, except like an Arabian steed among packhorses. We did not attend any gathering but he excelled over us, saying, 'To God Almighty,' and we said something similar to them." 'Amir al-Sha'bi said, "I vow to God not to attend a ruler after this gathering to flatter him." And Muhammad ibn Wasil entered upon Bilal ibn Abi Burdah and said to him, "What do you say about divine decree?" He said, "Your neighbors are the people of the graves, so reflect upon them, for in them is preoccupation from decree." And from Al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, he said: My uncle Muhammad ibn 'Ali narrated to me, saying: I was present in the gathering of the Commander of the Faithful Abu Ja'far al-Mansur, and among them was Ibn Abi Dhu'ayb, while the governor of Medina was Al-Hasan ibn Zayd. Then the Ghifari tribe came and complained to Abu Ja'far about something concerning Al-Hasan ibn Zayd. Al-Hasan said, "O Commander of the Faithful, ask about them Ibn Abi Dhu'ayb." He asked him, "What do you say about them, O Ibn Abi Dhu'ayb?" He said, "I testify that they are people who shatter others' honor and frequently harm them." Abu Ja'far said, "You have heard." The Ghifari tribe said, "O Commander of the Faithful, ask him about Al-Hasan ibn Zayd." He said, "O Ibn Abi Dhu'ayb, what do you say about Al-Hasan ibn Zayd?" He said, "I testify against him that he judges by other than the truth and follows his desires." He said, "You have heard, O Hasan, what Ibn Abi Dhu'ayb said about you, and he is the righteous elder." He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, ask him about yourself." He said, "What do you say about me?" He said, "Excuse me, O Commander of the Faithful." He said, "I ask you by God to inform me." He said, "You ask me by God as if you do not know yourself." He said, "By God, you shall inform me." He said, "I testify that you took this wealth not by its right and placed it not with its rightful people, and I testify that..."

Injustice has become widespread at your door. Abu Ja'far rose from his place, placed his hand on the back of Ibn Abi Dhu'ib's neck, seized him, and said, "By God, were I not seated here, I would seize Persia, Byzantium, Daylam, and the Turks by this very spot on you." Ibn Abi Dhu'ib replied, "O Commander of the Faithful, Abu Bakr and 'Umar have passed, and they took what was right and divided it equitably. They seized the necks of Persia and Byzantium and humbled their pride." Abu Ja'far then released his neck and set him free, saying, "By God, were I not certain of your sincerity, I would have killed you." Ibn Abi Dhu'ib said, "By God, O Commander of the Faithful, I give you counsel more sincere than that of your son al-Mahdi." It reached us that when Ibn Abi Dhu'ib left al-Mansur's gathering, Sufyan al-Thawri met him and said, "O Abu al-Harith, I was pleased by how you addressed this tyrant, but I was displeased by your saying 'your son al-Mahdi' to him." He replied, "May God forgive you, O Abu 'Abd Allah. All of us are 'mahdi' (guided); all of us were once in the cradle (mihd)." From al-Awza'i, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Amr said: Abu Ja'far al-Mansur, the Commander of the Faithful, summoned me while I was at the coast. I came to him, and when I arrived and greeted him with the caliphate, he returned the greeting and seated me. Then he said, "What delayed you from us, O Awza'i?" I said, "And what do you desire, O Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "I desire to learn from you and take guidance from you." I said, "Then take care, O Commander of the Faithful, not to be ignorant of anything I say to you." He said, "How could I be ignorant of it when I am asking you about it and have summoned you for it?" I said, "I fear you may hear it and then not act upon it." Al-Rabi' then shouted at me and reached for his sword, but al-Mansur rebuked him and said, "This is a council of reward, not a council of punishment." The narration of al-Awza'i with al-Mansur and his admonition to him, in which he mentioned ten elevated hadiths, and the story in its entirety was narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the book "Admonitions of the Caliphs," and we narrated it in the shaykh-list of Yusuf ibn Kamil al-Khaffaf and the shaykh-list of Ibn Tabarrad. In its chain is Ahmad ibn 'Ubayd ibn Nasih. Ibn 'Adi said: He narrates odd reports, but he is, in my view, among the truthful. I have seen the listing of the mentioned hadiths in the admonition to recall whether any of them has a chain other than this one, and to know the companion of each hadith or if it is mursal. The first of them: My soul became content and I expanded in speech, saying, "O Commander of the Faithful, Makhul narrated to me from 'Atiyyah ibn Bishr, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'Any servant to whom an admonition from God comes regarding his religion, it is a blessing from God sent to him. If he accepts it with gratitude, well and good; otherwise, it becomes a proof from God against him, increasing him in sin and increasing God's wrath upon him.'" The hadith of 'Atiyyah ibn Bishr: "Any servant to whom an admonition from God comes regarding his religion, it is a blessing from God..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it in "Admonitions of the Caliphs." O Commander of the Faithful, Makhul narrated to me from 'Atiyyah ibn Yasir, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Any ruler who dies having betrayed his people, God will forbid Paradise to him." The hadith of 'Atiyyah ibn Yasir: "Any ruler who sleeps having betrayed his people, God will forbid Paradise to him." O Commander of the Faithful, whoever dislikes the truth has disliked God, for God is the Manifest Truth. Indeed, what has softened the hearts of your community toward you when you were entrusted with their affairs is your kinship to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He was compassionate and merciful to them, sharing with them from his own hand, praised by God and by people. It is incumbent upon you to uphold the truth for him among them, to stand with justice for him among them, and to cover their faults. Do not shut the doors against them, nor erect a veil before them. Rejoice in blessing among them, and grieve for the harm that befalls them. O Commander, Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it therein, and Ibn 'Adi in "Al-Kamil" in the biography of Ahmad ibn 'Ubayd. O Commander of the Faithful, whoever dislikes the truth has disliked God, for God is the Manifest Truth. Indeed, what has softened the hearts of your community toward you when you were entrusted with their affairs is your kinship to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He was compassionate and merciful to them, sharing with them from his own hand, praised by God and by people. It is incumbent upon you to uphold the truth for him among them, to stand with justice for him among them, and to cover their faults. Do not shut the doors against them, nor erect a veil before them. Rejoice in blessing among them, and grieve for the harm that befalls them. O Commander of the Faithful, you were preoccupied with your own self to the neglect of the common people whom you now rule—their red and black, their Muslim and non-Muslim—and each has a share of justice due from you. How will it be when groups upon groups rise from among them, and there is not one among them except that he complains of a calamity you brought upon him or an injustice you delivered to him? O Commander of the Faithful, Makhul narrated to me from 'Urwah ibn Ruwaym, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had a twig in his hand with which he would clean his teeth and with which he would gesture.

The hypocrites came, and Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to him and said, "O Muhammad, what is this twig with which you have broken the hearts of your community and filled them with terror?" A narration from 'Urwah ibn Ruwaym: There was a twig in the hand of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, with which he would clean his teeth and with which he would frighten the hypocrites. The narration is transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in it, and it is mursal, and 'Urwah is mentioned by Ibn Hibban among the reliable Followers. So what of one who tears their veils, sheds their blood, destroys their homes, expels them from their lands, and conceals them in fear of him? O Commander of the Faithful, Makhul narrated to me from Ziyad from Harithah from Habib ibn Maslamah that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, called for retaliation against himself for a scratch he unintentionally caused a Bedouin. Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to him and said, "O Muhammad, God did not send you as a tyrant nor an arrogant one." So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, called the Bedouin and said, "Take retaliation from me." The Bedouin said, "I have absolved you, by my father and mother! I would never do that, even if it cost me my life." So he supplicated for good for him. The narration of Habib ibn Maslamah that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, called for retaliation against himself for a scratch he unintentionally caused a Bedouin is transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in it. And Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i narrated from the narration of 'Umar: I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, take retaliation from himself. And al-Hakim from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla from his father: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, poked Usayd ibn Hudayr in his side. He said, "You have hurt me." He said, "Take retaliation." The narration says its chain is sound. O Commander of the Faithful, satisfy your soul for your soul, and take for it security from your Lord, and aspire for a Paradise whose width is the heavens and the earth, about which the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The space of a bow of one of you in Paradise is better for him than the world and all it contains." The narration "The space of a bow of one of you in Paradise is better than the world and all it contains" is transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of al-Awza'i, disconnected, he did not mention its chain. And al-Bukhari narrated it from the narration of Anas with the wording "the space of a handspan." O Commander of the Faithful, if dominion had remained for those before you, it would not have reached you, and likewise it will not remain for you just as it did not remain for others. O Commander of the Faithful, do you know what came in the interpretation of this verse from your grandfather? "What is with this Book that leaves nothing small or great but it has enumerated it?" He said: "The small is a smile and the great is laughter." So what of what the hands have done and the tongues have harvested? O Commander of the Faithful, it reached me that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said: "If a lamb were to die of neglect on the bank of the Euphrates, I would fear being questioned about it." So what of one who is deprived of your justice while he is upon your carpet? O Commander of the Faithful, do you know what came in the interpretation of this verse from your grandfather? "O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow desire, lest it lead you astray from the way of God." God Almighty said in the Psalms: "O David, when two disputants sit before you, and you have a desire for one of them, do not wish in yourself that the right be for him so that he prevails over his opponent, for I would erase you from My prophethood, and then you would not be My successor nor have honor. O David, I only made My messengers to My servants as shepherds, like shepherds of camels, for their knowledge of care and their gentleness in governance, so that they may mend the broken and guide the weak to pasture and water." O Commander of the Faithful, you have been tested with a matter that, if presented to the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, they would refuse to bear it and would shrink from it. O Commander of the Faithful, Yazid ibn Jabir narrated to me from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Amrah al-Ansari that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, appointed a man from the Ansar over the alms. He saw him after some days remaining (in Medina) and said to him, "What prevented you from going out to your work? Do you not know that you have the like of the reward of a fighter in the cause of God?" He said, "No." He said, "How is that?" He said, "It reached me that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'There is no ruler who is put in charge of any of the affairs of the people but he will be brought on the Day of Resurrection with his hand tied to his neck, and nothing will free it except his justice. He will be made to stand on a bridge over Hellfire, and that bridge will shake with a shaking that displaces every limb from its place. Then he will be returned and called to account. If he was good, he will be saved by his goodness, and if he was evil, that bridge will be torn apart with him and he will plummet into Hellfire for seventy autumns.'" The narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Amr that 'Umar appointed a man from the Ansar over the alms, and in it is raised: "There is no ruler who is put in charge of any of the affairs of the people but he will come to God on the Day of Resurrection with his hand tied to his neck..." is transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in it from this chain. And al-Tabarani narrated it from the narration of Suwayd ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz from Yasar ibn Abi al-Hakam from Abi Wa'il that 'Umar appointed Bishr ibn 'Asim, and he mentioned a shorter version of it, and that Bishr heard it from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioning in it...

Salman said, and Umar, may God be pleased with him, asked him, "From whom did you hear this?" He said, "From Abu Dharr and Salman." So Umar sent for them and asked them. They said, "Yes, we heard it from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." Umar said, "Alas for Umar! Who will undertake it with all that it entails?" Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, said, "One whose nose God has made to run and whose cheek He has pressed to the ground." Then he took a handkerchief, placed it over his face, and wept and sobbed until he made me weep. Then I said, "O Commander of the Faithful, your grandfather al-'Abbas asked the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for the governorship of Mecca, or al-Ta'if, or Yemen. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, 'O 'Abbas, O uncle of the Prophet! A soul you give life to is better than a governorship you cannot count.'" The hadith: "O 'Abbas, O uncle of the Prophet! A soul you save is better than a governorship you cannot count." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus, disconnected without a chain. Al-Bayhaqi reported it from the hadith of Jabir with a connected chain, and from the narration of Ibn al-Munkadir as a mursal narration, and said, "This is the preserved version as mursal, as advice from him to his uncle and compassion for him, and he informed him that he could avail him nothing against God." For God had revealed to him, "And warn your nearest kin." So he said, "O 'Abbas and O Safiyyah, uncle and aunt of the Prophet, and O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, I cannot avail you anything against God. For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds." The hadith: "O 'Abbas, O Safiyyah, O Fatimah, I cannot avail you anything against God. For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus, disconnected without a chain. Al-Bukhari reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a connected chain, without the words "For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds." And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said, "The affairs of people can only be managed by one of sound intellect and firm resolve, from whom no disgrace is exposed and from whom no free woman is feared, and whom no blamer's blame deters in the matter of God." And he said, "Rulers are of four kinds: A ruler who is strong, restraining himself and his agents—he is like a warrior in the path of God, with God's hand extended over him in mercy. A ruler in whom there is weakness, restraining himself but whose agents indulge due to his weakness—he is on the brink of destruction unless God has mercy on him. A ruler who restrains his agents but indulges himself—he is the 'Hatmah' (the Devourer) about whom the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'The worst of shepherds is the Hatmah'—he is the one who perishes alone." The hadith "The worst of shepherds is the Hatmah" is reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'A'idh ibn 'Amr al-Muzani with a connected chain, and it is found in Ibn Abi al-Dunya from al-Awza'i, disconnected as mentioned by the author. And a ruler who indulges himself and his agents—they all perish. And it has reached me, O Commander of the Faithful, that Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I have come to you when God commanded the bellows of the Fire to be placed upon it, and it was set ablaze for the Day of Resurrection." He said to him, "O Gabriel, describe the Fire to me." He said, "God Almighty commanded it, and it was kindled for a thousand years until it became red, then it was kindled for a thousand years until it became yellow, then it was kindled for a thousand years until it became black. So it is black, dark; its embers give no light and its flames are not extinguished. By the One who sent you with the truth, if a garment from the garments of the people of the Fire were displayed to the people of the earth, they would all die. And if a bucket from their drink were poured into all the waters of the earth, it would kill whoever tasted it. And if a forearm's length of the chain that God mentioned were placed upon all the mountains of the earth, they would melt and could not bear it. And if a man were entered into the Fire and then taken out of it, the people of the earth would die from the foulness of his smell, the ugliness of his form, and his enormity." So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wept, and Gabriel, peace be upon him, wept at his weeping. He said, "Do you weep, O Muhammad, when God has forgiven you your past and future sins?" He said, "Should I not then be a grateful servant? And why do you weep, O Gabriel, you who are the Trustworthy Spirit, God's trustee over His revelation?" He said, "I fear that I might be tested with what Harut and Marut were tested with. That is what prevents me from relying on my station with my Lord, lest I feel secure from His plan." They continued weeping until they were called from the heavens, "O Gabriel, O Muhammad! God has secured you from disobeying Him so that He would punish you, and He has favored Muhammad over all the prophets as He has favored Gabriel over all the angels." The hadith: "It has reached me that Gabriel came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, 'I have come to you when God commanded the bellows of the Fire to be placed upon it, and it was set ablaze for the Day of Resurrection...'" the full hadith. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it thus, disconnected without a chain. And it has reached me, O Commander of the Faithful, that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said, "O God, if You know that I care, when two disputants sit before me, on whom the truth leans, whether near or far, then do not delay me for the blink of an eye." O Commander of the Faithful, the most severe severity is standing for God's right, and the most noble nobility with God is piety. Indeed, whoever seeks honor through obedience to God, God will elevate and honor him; and whoever seeks it through disobedience to God, God will abase and lower him. This is my advice to you, and peace be upon you. Then I rose to leave. He said to me, "Where to?" I said, "To my child and homeland, by the leave of the Commander."

The believers, God willing." He said, "I have granted you permission and thanked you for your counsel, and I have accepted it. God is the Granter of success in good and the Helper in it, and by Him I seek aid, and upon Him I rely, and He is sufficient for me, and what an excellent Trustee. So do not cease to address me with the like of this, for you are one whose word is accepted, not suspected in giving sincere advice." I said, "I shall do so, God willing."

Muhammad ibn Mus'ab said: He ordered that wealth be given to him to assist him in his departure, but he did not accept it, saying, "I am free from need of it, and I would never sell my sincere counsel for a worldly gain." Al-Mansur recognized his principle and did not find fault with him for that.

From Ibn al-Muhajir, he said: The Commander of the Faithful, al-Mansur—may God ennoble it—came to Mecca as a pilgrim. He would leave Dar al-Nadwah for Tawaf in the last part of the night, performing Tawaf and praying without anyone knowing. When dawn broke, he would return to Dar al-Nadwah, and the muezzins would come, greet him, and the prayer would be established, and he would lead the people in prayer.

One night he went out at the time of the pre-dawn darkness. While he was performing Tawaf, he heard a man near the Multazam saying, "O God, I complain to You of the prevalence of oppression and corruption on earth, and of the injustice and greed that stand between the truth and its people." Al-Mansur quickened his pace until his ears were filled with his words. Then he went out and sat in a corner of the mosque and sent for him, summoning him. The messenger came to him and said, "Answer the Commander of the Faithful." He prayed two rak'ahs, touched the Corner, and came forward with the messenger. He greeted him, and al-Mansur said to him, "What is this I heard you saying about the prevalence of oppression and corruption on earth, and of the greed and injustice that stand between the truth and its people? By God, you have filled my ears with what has sickened and disturbed me."

He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, if you grant me safety for myself, I will inform you of matters from their roots; otherwise, I will confine myself to my own affairs, for in them I have an all-engrossing concern." He said to him, "You are safe for yourself." He said, "The one whom greed has entered, such that it stands between him and the truth and reforming what has appeared of oppression and corruption on earth, is you."

He said, "Woe to you! How can greed enter me when the yellow and white [gold and silver] are in my hand, and the sweet and sour are within my grasp?" He said, "Has greed entered anyone as it has entered you, O Commander of the Faithful? God Almighty has entrusted you with the affairs of the Muslims and their wealth, yet you have neglected their affairs and busied yourself with amassing their wealth. You have placed between you and them a barrier of plaster and brick and doors of iron, and guards armed with weapons. Then you imprisoned yourself among them, and you dispatched your agents to collect and levy wealth. You appointed ministers and assistants who are oppressors; if you forget, they do not remind you, and if you remember, they do not aid you. You strengthened them to oppress the people with wealth, cavalry, and weapons. You ordered that none of the people should enter upon you except so-and-so and so-and-so, a few individuals you named. You did not command that the wronged, the distressed, the hungry, the naked, the weak, nor the poor—nor anyone who has a right to this wealth—be given access.

"When those few individuals whom you selected for yourself and favored over your subjects, and whom you ordered not to be barred from you, saw that wealth was being collected and not distributed, they said, 'This one has betrayed God, so why should we not betray him? He has made it easy for us.' They conspired that no knowledge of the people's affairs should reach you except what they wished, and that no agent of yours should go out and oppose their command except that they would remove him until his standing fell and his worth diminished.

"When this spread from you and from them, the people magnified them and feared them. The first to appease them were your own agents, with gifts and wealth, so they might strengthen themselves through them to oppress your subjects. Then the powerful and wealthy among your subjects did likewise, to gain power to oppress those beneath them among the subjects. Thus, the lands of God became filled with greed, oppression, and corruption. These people became your partners in your authority while you were heedless.

"If a wronged person comes, he is prevented from entering upon you. If he wishes to raise his voice or present his case to you when you appear publicly, he finds you have forbidden that and have stationed a man to look into their grievances. If that man comes and informs your inner circle, they ask the holder of the grievance not to raise his complaint. Even if the wronged one has honor and a claim that should be answered, he cannot achieve what he wants for fear of them. So the wronged one keeps going to him, seeking refuge, complaining, and crying for help, while he repels him and makes excuses to him. If he strives hard and manages to come out and his cry is raised before you, he is struck a severe beating as a deterrent to others—and you look on, neither denouncing nor changing it. What then is the survival of Islam and its people upon this?

"Indeed, the Umayyads and the Arabs were such that no wronged person would come to them except that his grievance was raised to them, and he would receive justice. Indeed, a man would come from the farthest lands until he reached the gate of their ruler and call out, 'O people of Islam!' They would rush to him: 'What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?' and they would raise his grievance to their ruler, and he would receive justice.

"Indeed, O Commander of the Faithful, I used to travel to the land of China, where there was a king. I arrived there once when his hearing had gone. He began to weep. His ministers said to him, 'Why do you weep? May your eyes not weep.' He said, 'Verily, I am not weeping over...

The calamity that has befallen me, yet I weep for an oppressed one crying out at the door whose voice I do not hear. Then he said: If my hearing has gone, my sight has not. Proclaim among the people: Let none wear a red garment except one who is oppressed. He would ride the elephant and patrol the two ends of the day—would he see an oppressed person and grant him justice? O Commander of the Faithful, this man is a polytheist who associates partners with God; his compassion and tenderness for the polytheists overcame the greed of his soul for his kingdom. But you are a believer in God and the cousin of the Prophet of God—let not your compassion and tenderness for the Muslims be overcome by the greed of your soul. For you gather wealth only for one of three: If you say, 'I gather it for my child,' God has shown you a lesson in the small child who falls from his mother's womb, and his wealth is upon the earth—wealth! And there is no wealth except that before it is a greedy hand that seizes it. God, exalted is He, continues to be gentle with that child until people's desire for him grows great. You are not the one who gives; rather, God gives to whom He wills. If you say, 'I gather wealth to strengthen my authority,' God has shown you a lesson in those before you—how what they gathered of gold and silver, and what they prepared of men, weapons, and steeds did not avail them. And what harmed you and your father's son in the state of scant resources and weakness when God willed for you what He willed? If you say, 'I gather wealth to seek an aim greater than the aim you are in,' then by God, above what you are in is only a station unattainable except by righteous deeds. O Commander of the Faithful, do you punish one of your subjects who disobeys you with something more severe than killing? He said: No. He said: Then what will you do with the dominion God has entrusted to you and the worldly kingdom you possess, while He, exalted is He, does not punish those who disobey Him with killing, but punishes those who disobey Him with everlasting painful torment? He is the One who sees what your heart has resolved and what your limbs have concealed. What will you say when the True, Manifest Sovereign seizes the worldly kingdom from your hand and calls you to account? Will anything of what you were in, that you greedily hoarded of the worldly kingdom, avail you before Him? Al-Mansur wept intensely until he sobbed and his voice rose. Then he said: Would that I had not been created and had been nothing! Then he said: How can I manage what I have been entrusted with when I see none among the people except a traitor? He said: O Commander of the Faithful, upon you are the guiding, eminent leaders. He said: And who are they? He said: The scholars. He said: They have fled from me. He said: They fled from you fearing you would compel them to what has appeared of your way from your agents. But open the doors, ease the barriers, support the oppressed against the oppressor, prevent injustices, take from what is lawful and pure, and distribute it with truth and justice. I guarantee that whoever fled from you will come to you and aid you in rectifying your affair and your subjects. Al-Mansur said: O God, grant me success to act according to what this man has said. The callers to prayer came, greeted him, and the prayer was established. He went out and led them in prayer, then said to the guard: Upon you is the man; if you do not bring him to me, I will strike your neck. And he became intensely angry with him. The guard went out seeking the man. While he was patrolling, behold, the man was praying in one of the ravines. He sat until he finished his prayer, then said: O man, do you not fear God? He said: Yes. He said: Do you not know him? He said: Yes. He said: Come with me to the commander, for he has sworn to kill me if I do not bring you to him. He said: I have no way to that. He said: He will kill me. He said: No. He said: How? He said: Do you recite well? He said: No. So he took out from a bag he had with him a written scroll containing something and said: Take it and place it in your pocket, for in it is the supplication for relief. He said: And what is the supplication for relief? He said: None is granted it except the martyrs. I said: May God have mercy on you, you have been good to me. If you see fit to inform me what this supplication is and its merit. He said: Whoever supplicates with it evening and morning, his sins are demolished, his joy endures, his faults are erased, his supplication is answered, his provision is expanded, his hope is granted, he is aided against his enemy, and he is recorded with God as truthful, and he does not die except as a martyr. You say: O God, as You have been gentle in Your majesty beyond the gentle, and exalted in Your majesty above the exalted, and You know what is beneath Your earth as You know what is above Your throne, and the whispers of the hearts are like the open before You, and open speech is like the secret in Your knowledge, and everything submits to Your majesty, and every possessor of authority humbles to Your authority, and the affair of this world and the next all is in Your hand—make for me from every worry I have entered into this evening a relief and an exit. O God, indeed Your pardon of my sins, Your overlooking of my faults, and Your covering of my ugly deeds make me hopeful to ask You for what I do not deserve, wherein I have fallen short. I call upon You secure, and I ask You familiarly, for You are the benefactor to me, and I am the wrongdoer to myself in what is between me and You. You show affection to me with Your blessings, and I become hateful to You through disobedience. But trust in You has emboldened me to be audacious with You, so turn to me with Your favor and kindness, for indeed You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful. He said: So I took it and placed it in my pocket. Then I had no concern except the Commander of the Faithful. I entered and greeted him. He raised his head, looked at me, and smiled.

Then he said, "Woe to you, and you practice sorcery?" I said, "No, by God, O Commander of the Faithful." Then I related to him my affair with the shaykh. He said, "Bring the written charm he gave you." Then he began to weep and said, "And you have been saved." He ordered it to be copied and gave me ten thousand. Then he said, "Do you know him?" I said, "No." He said, "That was al-Khidr, peace be upon him."

And from Abu 'Imran al-Jawni: When Harun al-Rashid assumed the caliphate, the scholars visited him and congratulated him on what he had attained of the affair of the caliphate. He opened the treasuries and proceeded to reward them with splendid gifts. Prior to that, he used to sit with the scholars and the ascetics, and he would display piety and austerity. He had been a close brother to Sufyan ibn Sa'id ibn al-Mundhir al-Thawri in earlier times. But Sufyan shunned him and did not visit him. Harun yearned for his visit to be alone with him and speak with him, but he did not visit him and paid no heed to his position nor to what he had attained. This weighed heavily upon Harun, so he wrote him a letter saying:

"In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. From the servant of God, Harun al-Rashid, Commander of the Faithful, to his brother Sufyan ibn Sa'id ibn al-Mundhir. To proceed: O my brother, you know that God, blessed and exalted, has made brotherhood between the believers and established that in it and for it. Know that I have taken you as a brother with a bond of brotherhood from which I have not severed your tie nor cut off your affection. I am inwardly disposed towards you with the best of love and desire. Were it not for this responsibility with which God has entrusted me, I would have come to you, even crawling, due to the love I find for you in my heart. Know, O Abu 'Abd Allah, that none of my brothers and your brothers remains except that he has visited me and congratulated me on what I have attained. I have opened the treasuries and given them from the splendid gifts that which gladdened my soul and pleased my eye. I have found you slow in coming to me. I have written you this letter out of intense longing for you. You know, O Abu 'Abd Allah, what has been related concerning the merit of the believer, visiting him, and maintaining ties with him. So when my letter reaches you, hasten, hasten!"

When he finished writing the letter, he turned to those present, and all of them knew Sufyan al-Thawri and his sternness. He said, "Summon a man from the gate." A man named 'Abbad al-Talaqani was brought in. He said, "O 'Abbad, take this letter of mine and go with it to Kufa. When you enter it, ask about the tribe of Banu Thawr, then ask about Sufyan al-Thawri. When you see him, deliver this letter of mine to him, and listen with your ear and heart to all that he says. Note for me every detail of his affair, great and small, so that you may inform me of it." 'Abbad took the letter and set out with it until he arrived in Kufa. He asked about the tribe and was directed to it. Then he asked about Sufyan and was told, "He is in the mosque."

'Abbad said: I approached the mosque. When he saw me, he stood up and said, "I seek refuge in God, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from Satan the accursed. And I seek refuge in You, O God, from any visitor who visits except with good." 'Abbad said: The words struck my heart and wounded me. When he saw me dismounting at the door of the mosque, he stood to pray, and it was not a time of prayer. I tied my horse at the mosque door and entered. His companions were sitting with their heads bowed as if they were thieves upon whom the sultan had descended, fearful of his punishment. I gave greetings of peace, but no one raised his head to me; they returned the greeting with the tips of their fingers. I remained standing. Not one of them offered me a seat. A trembling seized me from their awe. I cast my eye upon them and said, "The one praying is Sufyan." I threw the letter to him. When he saw the letter, he trembled and recoiled from it as if it were a snake presented to him in his prayer niche. He bowed, prostrated, and gave the salutation. He put his hand in his sleeve, wrapped it in his cloak, and took it. He turned it over with his hand, then threw it to those behind him and said, "Let one of you take it and read it, for I seek God's forgiveness from touching something a wrongdoer has touched with his hand."

'Abbad said: One of them took it, untying it as if afraid of the mouth of a snake that would bite him. Then he opened it and read it. Sufyan began to smile the smile of one amazed. When he finished reading it, he said, "Turn it over and write to the wrongdoer on the back of his letter." It was said to him, "O Abu 'Abd Allah, he is the caliph. Would that you wrote to him on a clean sheet." He said, "Write to the wrongdoer on the back of his letter. If he acquired it from lawful means, he will be recompensed for it. If he acquired it from unlawful means, he will suffer for it. Nothing touched by a wrongdoer remains with us to corrupt our religion." It was said to him, "What shall we write?" He said, "Write:

'In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. From the sinful servant Sufyan ibn Sa'id ibn al-Mundhir al-Thawri to the servant deluded by hopes, Harun al-Rashid, who has been stripped of the sweetness of faith. To proceed: I have written to you to inform you that I have severed your tie and cut off your affection and hold your position in low esteem. For you have made me a witness against you by your own confession against yourself in your letter, by which you have boldly raided the treasury of the Muslims and spent it not in its rightful due and disbursed it not according to its proper ruling. Then you were not content with what you did while you were distant from me, until you wrote to me making me a witness against yourself. Indeed, I have borne witness against you, I and my brothers who witnessed the reading of your letter, and we will deliver the testimony against you tomorrow.'"

Before God Almighty, O Harun, you have raided the treasury of the Muslims without their consent. Did those whose hearts are to be reconciled, the workers upon it in the land of God Almighty, the strugglers in the path of God, and the wayfarer consent to your action? Or did the bearers of the Quran, the people of knowledge, the widows, and the orphans consent to that? Or did any of your subjects consent to it? So tighten your waist-wrapper, O Harun, and prepare an answer for the questioning and a garment for the tribulation. And know that you will stand before the Just Judge, for you have suffered a loss in your own soul when you were stripped of the sweetness of knowledge, asceticism, the delight of the Quran, and the companionship of the righteous. And you have consented for yourself to be an oppressor and a leader for the oppressors. O Harun, you have sat upon the throne and worn silk, and you have lowered a curtain before your door, and you have resembled the chamberlains—by the Lord of the worlds! Then you have stationed your dark soldiers before your door and your curtain; they oppress the people and do not grant justice. They drink wine and flog those who drink it, they fornicate and punish the fornicator, they steal and amputate the thief. Should not these judgments have been upon you and upon them before you judged the people with them? So how will it be for you, O Harun, tomorrow when the caller calls from before God Almighty: "Gather those who did wrong and their spouses"—meaning the oppressors and the helpers of oppressors—and you are brought before God Almighty with your hands bound to your neck, none loosening them except your justice and fairness, while the oppressors are around you and you are their forerunner and leader into the Fire? It is as if I see you, O Harun, seized by the tight constriction and arriving at the driving place, while you see your good deeds in the scale of another and the sins of another in your scale, added to your own sins—tribulation upon tribulation, darkness upon darkness. So preserve my counsel and take admonition from my exhortation with which I have exhorted you, and know that I have advised you and left no extremity in advice for you. So fear God, O Harun, regarding your subjects, and preserve Muhammad—peace and blessings be upon him—in his community, and excel in stewardship over them. And know that this matter, had it remained for another, would not have reached you, and it is destined for another. And likewise the world transfers its inhabitants one after another; among them are those who provision themselves with provisions that benefit them, and among them are those who lose their world and their Hereafter. And I reckon you, O Harun, among those who lose their world and their Hereafter. So beware, beware that you write to me a letter after this, for I will not answer you regarding it. And peace.

Said 'Abbad: Then he threw to me the letter unfolded, neither folded nor sealed. I took it and went to the market of Kufa, and the exhortation had settled in my heart. So I called out, "O people of Kufa!" and they answered me. I said to them, "O people, who will buy a man who has fled from God to God?" They came to me with dinars and dirhams. I said, "I have no need for wealth, but a coarse woolen cloak and a Qutwani mantle." He said: So that was brought, and I stripped off the clothing I had been wearing with the Commander of the Faithful, and I came leading the packhorse with the weapon I had been carrying until I reached the door of the Commander of the Faithful Harun, barefoot and walking. Those at the Caliph's door mocked me, then permission was sought for me. When I entered upon him and he saw me in that state, he stood and sat, then stood up and began striking his head and face, calling out in woe and grief, saying, "The messenger has benefited, but the sender is disappointed. What is the world to me, and a kingdom that will swiftly depart from me?" Then I threw the letter to him unfolded as it had been given to me. Harun began reading it, his tears flowing from his eyes, reading and sobbing. One of his companions said, "O Commander of the Faithful, Sufyan has indeed been bold against you. If only you would send for him and burden him with iron and tighten the prison upon him, making him an example for others." Harun said, "Leave us, O slaves of the world! The deluded one whom you have deluded, and the wretched one whom you have ruined. Verily, Sufyan is a community unto himself. Leave Sufyan and his affair." Then Sufyan's letter remained beside Harun; he would read it at every prayer until he passed away—may God have mercy on him. So may God have mercy on a servant who reflects upon himself and fears God regarding what he presents tomorrow from his deeds, for he will be accounted for it and recompensed accordingly. And God is the Grantor of success.

And from 'Abdullah ibn Mihran, he said: Al-Rashid performed Hajj and arrived at Kufa, staying there for days. Then he set out to depart, and the people went out, and Bahlul the Mad went out among those who went out to the rubbish dump, and the boys were harming him and annoying him. Then the litters of Harun approached, and the boys refrained from annoying him. When Harun came, he called out in his loudest voice, "O Commander of the Faithful!" Harun drew aside the curtain with his hand from his face and said, "At your service, O Bahlul." He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, narrate to us from Ayman ibn Na'il from Qudamah ibn 'Abdullah al-'Amiri, he said: I saw the Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—returning from 'Arafat upon a reddish-brown she-camel of his, without striking nor driving nor 'To you, to you.'" The narration of Qudamah ibn 'Abdullah al-'Amiri: I saw the Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—returning from 'Arafat upon a reddish-brown she-camel of his, without striking nor driving nor "To you, to you." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and graded it sound, as did al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.

Beyond his statement while departing from Arafat, they only said "he throws the pebbles," and that is the correct view, as previously mentioned in the second chapter. And your humility on this journey of yours, O Commander of the Faithful, is better for you than your arrogance and tyranny. He said: Then Harun wept until his tears fell upon the ground, then said: O Bahlul, give us more, may God have mercy on you. He said: Yes, O Commander of the Faithful: A man whom God has given wealth and beauty, who spends from his wealth and is chaste with his beauty, is recorded in the pure register of God Almighty with the righteous. He said: You have spoken well, O Bahlul, and gave him a reward. He said: Return the reward to the one from whom you took it, for I have no need of it. He said: O Bahlul, if you have a debt, we will settle it. He said: O Commander of the Faithful, these scholars of Kufa are abundant, and their consensus is that settling a debt with another debt is not permissible. He said: O Bahlul, then let us provide for you what sustains you or supports you. He said: Then Bahlul raised his head to the sky and said: O Commander of the Faithful, you and I are among the dependents of God, so it is impossible that He would remember you and forget me. He said: Then Harun let down the curtain and departed.

And from Abu al-Abbas al-Hashimi, from Salih ibn al-Ma'mun, who said: I entered upon al-Harith al-Muhasibi, may God have mercy on him, and said to him: O Abu Abdullah, have you taken your soul to account? He said: This was once. I said to him: And today? He said: I conceal my state. Verily, I recite a verse from the Book of God Almighty and I am cautious lest my soul hear it, and were it not that joy would overcome me in it, I would not have made it known. And indeed, one night I was sitting in my prayer niche when behold, a youth with a handsome face and pleasant fragrance greeted me, then sat before me. I said to him: Who are you? He said: I am one of the wanderers who seek out the worshippers in their prayer niches, and I see no striving in you, so what is your work? I said to him: Concealing calamities and attracting benefits. He cried out and said: I did not know that anyone between the two sides of the east and the west had this attribute. Al-Harith said: I wanted to add to it, so I said to him: Do you not know that the people of hearts conceal their states, keep their secrets hidden, and ask God to conceal that for them? So from where would you recognize them? He cried out a cry from which he fainted, and he remained with me for two days unconscious. Then he regained consciousness and had soiled his clothes, so I knew his mind had been taken away. I brought out a new garment for him and said to him: This is my shroud, I have preferred you with it, so perform ablution and repeat your prayer. He said: Bring the water. So he performed ablution and prayed, then wrapped himself in the garment and left. I said to him: Where are you going? He said to me: Rise with me. He kept walking until he entered upon al-Ma'mun, greeted him, and said: O oppressor, I am an oppressor if I do not say to you: O oppressor, seek God's forgiveness for my shortcoming regarding you. Do you not fear God Almighty for what He has given you dominion over? And he spoke many words, then turned to leave while I was sitting at the door. Al-Ma'mun turned to him and said: Who are you? He said: I am a man from the wanderers. I reflected on what the truthful ones before me did and found no share for myself in it, so I clung to your admonition, hoping I might catch up with them. He said: Then he ordered his neck to be struck. He was taken out while I was sitting at the door, wrapped in that garment, and a caller was calling out: Who is the guardian of this man, let him take him. Al-Harith said: I hid from him, so some strangers took him and buried him, and I was with them, they not knowing his state. I stayed in a mosque by the graves, grieving for the youth, until sleep overcame me. And behold, he was among maidens, I have never seen more beautiful than them, and he was saying: O Harith, by God, you are among the concealers who hide their states and obey their Lord. I said: And what have they done? He said: Soon they will meet you. I looked and saw a group of riders. I said: Who are you? They said: The concealers of their states. This youth's words moved you, yet there was nothing in his heart of what you described, so he went out for commanding and forbidding, and indeed God Almighty sent him down with us and was angry for His servant.

And from Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Muqri, who said: Abu al-Husayn al-Nuri was a man of little curiosity; he would not ask about what did not concern him nor inquire into what he had no need of. And if he saw an evil, he would change it even if it meant his destruction. One day he went down to a watering place known as the Watering Place of the Coal Sellers to purify himself for prayer when he saw a boat containing thirty jars, written upon them with tar: "Lutf." He read it and disapproved of it, for he knew nothing in trade or sales that was expressed as "Lutf." He said to the boatman: What is in these jars? He said: And what is it to you? Go about your business. When al-Nuri heard this from the boatman, his thirst to know increased, so he said: I would like you to inform me, what is in these jars? He said: And what is it to you? By God, you are a curious Sufi. This is wine for al-Mu'tadid, who wants to complete his gathering with it. Al-Nuri said: And this is wine? He said: Yes. He said: I would like you to give me that ladle. The boatman was annoyed with him and said to his boy: Give it to him until I see what he does. When the ladle was in his hand, he climbed into the boat and kept breaking them, jar by jar, until he reached the last one except for a single jar, while the boatman was calling for help until the master of the bridge rode up...

On that day, Ibn Bashr succeeded, so he seized al-Nuri and brought him before the presence of al-Mu'tadid. Al-Mu'tadid was a man whose sword preceded his speech, and the people had no doubt that he would kill him. Abu al-Husayn said: I was brought before him while he was seated on an iron chair, with a staff in his hand which he was turning over. When he saw me, he said: "Who are you?" I said: "A promoter of good and forbidder of evil." He said: "And who appointed you to this duty?" I said: "The One who appointed you to the Imamate appointed me to this duty, O Commander of the Faithful." He then bowed his head to the ground for a while, then raised his head to me and said: "What compelled you to do what you did?" I said: "Compassion from me towards you, for I extended my hand to avert harm from you, but fell short of it." He bowed his head, pondering my words, then raised his head to me and said: "How can this single dinar be extracted from a collection of dinars?" I said: "In its extraction is a reason I will inform the Commander of the Faithful of, if he permits." He said: "Speak, inform me." I said: "O Commander of the Faithful, I approached the dinars demanding the Right due to me from God, and my heart was overwhelmed by the witness of reverence for the Truth and fear of the demand, so the awe of creation vanished from me, and I proceeded against them in this state until I came to this dinar. Then I felt within myself pride that I had proceeded against one like you, so I held back. Had I proceeded against it in the first state, even if the world were full of dinars, I would have broken them and not cared." Al-Mu'tadid said: "Go, for we have freed your hand, except for what you wish to change of the wrong." Abu al-Husayn said: I said: "O Commander of the Faithful, changing it has become distasteful to me, for I used to change it for God's sake, and now I change it for the sake of your guards." Al-Mu'tadid said: "What is your need?" I said: "O Commander of the Faithful, command that I be released safely." So he ordered that for him, and he went out to Basra. He spent most of his days there in fear that someone would ask him for a need that al-Mu'tadid would be asked for. He remained in Basra until al-Mu'tadid died, then he returned to Baghdad. This was the conduct of the scholars and their custom in commanding good and forbidding evil, and their lack of concern for the might of sultans, because they relied on the grace of God Almighty to protect them and were content with the decree of God Almighty to grant them martyrdom. When they purified their intention for God, their speech affected the hard hearts, softening them and removing their hardness. But now, ambitions have shackled the tongues of the scholars, so they remain silent; and if they speak, their states do not support their statements, so they do not succeed. Had they been truthful and aimed for the true purpose of knowledge, they would have succeeded. The corruption of the subjects is due to the corruption of the kings, and the corruption of the kings is due to the corruption of the scholars, and the corruption of the scholars is due to the dominance of the love of wealth and status. Whoever is dominated by the love of this world cannot perform the duty of commanding good and forbidding evil upon the lowly, let alone upon kings and the great. And God is the One sought for help in every circumstance. The book of Commanding Good and Forbidding Evil is completed, by the praise of God and His help and His good facilitation.
