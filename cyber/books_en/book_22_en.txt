The Book of Disciplining the Soul and Refining Character

And treating the diseases of the heart

This is the second book of the quarter on the destructive matters.

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who directs affairs through His wise governance and justice, and fashioned creation with excellence in its formation. He adorned the human form with the beauty of its proportion and measure, guarding it from excess or deficiency in its shape and dimensions. He entrusted the refinement of character to the striving and diligence of the servant, urging him to cultivate it through warnings and admonitions, and made easy for His chosen servants the refinement of character through His facilitation and grace, bestowing upon them the easing of its difficulty and hardship. Blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, the servant of God, His prophet, beloved, intimate friend, herald, and warner, from whose countenance the lights of prophethood shone forth, and from whose indications and glad tidings the reality of Truth became manifest; and upon his family and companions who purified the face of Islam from the darkness of disbelief and its shadows, and severed the root of falsehood, remaining unsullied by its lesser or greater aspects.

Now then: Noble character is the attribute of the master of the messengers and the finest deed of the truthful. In truth, it is half of religion, the fruit of the striving of the God-fearing, and the discipline of the devout. Base morals are the lethal poisons, the crushing ruiners, the disgraceful ignominies, the evident vices, and the foul traits that distance one from the proximity of the Lord of the Worlds, entangling their possessor in the company of devils. They are the open gates to the Fire of God Almighty, kindled, which rises over the hearts—just as beautiful morals are the open gates from the heart to the bliss of Paradise and the nearness of the Merciful. Wicked morals are diseases of the hearts and ailments of the souls, except that this is a disease that forfeits eternal life. How can it compare to an illness that forfeits only the life of the body? However intense the care of physicians in establishing laws for treating bodies—wherein their sickness entails only the loss of perishable life—the care to establish laws for treating diseases of the hearts—wherein their sickness entails the loss of everlasting life—is more paramount. This type of medicine is obligatory to learn for every person of understanding, for no heart is free from ailments which, if neglected, accumulate and compound, with maladies reinforcing one another. Thus, the servant needs meticulousness in knowing their science and causes, then diligence in treating and rectifying them. Their treatment is what is intended by His words, exalted is He: "He has succeeded who purifies it," and their neglect is what is intended by His words: "And he has failed who corrupts it." In this book, we point to a summary of the diseases of the hearts and the manner of discourse on treating them in general, without detailing the treatment of specific maladies, for that will come in the remaining books of this quarter. Our aim now is the comprehensive consideration of refining character and laying out its methodology. We mention this, taking the treatment of the body as an example, so that its understanding may be brought closer to minds and clarified. This will be done by explaining the virtue of good character, then the reality of good character, then how character accepts change through discipline, then the means by which good character is attained, then the ways through which the detailed paths to refining character and disciplining souls are known, then the signs by which the disease of the heart is recognized, then the ways by which a person knows the faults of his own soul, then the evidences from revelation that the path to treating hearts is solely through abandoning desires, then the signs of good character, then the method of disciplining children from early development, then the conditions of resolve and the preliminaries of striving. These are eleven chapters that encompass the aims of this book, God willing.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Noble Character and the Disgrace of Base Character

God Almighty said to His Prophet and beloved, praising him and manifesting His favor upon him: "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "The character of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was the Qur'an." A man asked the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, about good character, so he recited the words of God: "Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; but turn away from the ignorant." Then he, peace be upon him, said: "It is that you reconcile with those who cut you off, give to those who deprive you, and pardon those who wrong you." And he, peace be upon him, said: "I was only sent to perfect noble character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The heaviest thing to be placed in the scale on the Day of Resurrection is God-consciousness and good character." A man came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, from in front of him and said: "O Messenger of God, what is religion?" He said: "Good character." Then he came to him from his right side and said: "O Messenger of God, what is religion?" He said: "Good character." Then he came to him from his left side and said: "What is religion?" He said: "Good character." Then he came to him from behind him and said: "O Messenger of God, what is religion?" He turned to him and said: "Do you not understand? It is that you do not become angry." And it was said: "O Messenger of God, what is misfortune?" He said: "Bad character." And a man said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "Counsel me." He said: "Be conscious of God wherever you are." He said: "Increase me." He said: "Follow a bad deed with a good deed to erase it." He said: "Increase me." He said: "Interact with people with good character." And he, peace be upon him, was asked: "Which deeds are best?" He said: "Good character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "God does not beautify the creation and character of a servant and then feed him to the Fire." And al-Fudayl said: It was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him and his family: "Such-and-such woman fasts the day and prays the night, but she is of bad character, harming her neighbors with her tongue." He said: "There is no good in her; she is among the people of the Fire." And Abu al-Darda' said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "The first thing placed in the scale is good character and generosity. And when God created faith, it said: 'O God, strengthen me.' So He strengthened it with good character and generosity. And when God created disbelief, it said: 'O God, strengthen me.' So He strengthened it with miserliness and bad character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "God has chosen this religion for Himself, and nothing befits your religion except generosity and good character. So adorn your religion with them." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Good character is the greatest creation of God." And it was said: "O Messenger of God, which of the believers has the best faith?" He said: "The best of them in character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "You will not encompass people with your wealth, so encompass them with a cheerful face and good character." And he, peace be upon him, also said: "Bad character spoils a deed just as vinegar spoils honey." And from Jarir ibn 'Abdullah, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God has beautified your creation, so beautify your character." And from al-Bara' ibn 'Azib, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was the most handsome of people in face and the best of them in character." And from Abu Mas'ud al-Badri, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication: "O God, You have beautified my creation, so beautify my character." And from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would frequently supplicate, saying: 'O God, I ask You for health, well-being, and good character.'" And from Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, who said: "The nobility of a believer is his religion, his sufficiency is his good character, and his manliness is his intellect." And from Usama ibn Sharik, who said: I witnessed the Bedouins asking the Prophet, peace be upon him, saying: "What is the best thing given to a servant?" He said: "Good character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The most beloved of you to me and the closest to me in seating on the Day of Resurrection are the best of you in character." And from Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Three traits: whoever does not have them, or one of them, then do not regard any of his deeds: God-consciousness that restrains him from the disobedience of God, or forbearance that restrains the foolish, or character by which he lives among people." And from his supplication, peace be upon him, at the opening of prayer: "O God, guide me to the best of character, for none guides to the best of it but You, and turn me away from bad character, for none turns me away from bad character but You." And Anas said: While we were with the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, one day, he said: "Indeed, good character melts away sin just as the sun melts ice." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Among the happiness of a person is good character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Good fortune is good character." And he, peace be upon him, said to Abu Dharr: "O Abu Dharr, there is no intellect like planning, and no nobility like good character." And from Anas, who said: Umm Habiba said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "What do you think of a woman who had two husbands in the world, then she dies and they die, and they enter Paradise; to which of them will she belong?" He said: "To the one with the best character who was with her in the world. O Umm Habiba, good character takes away the good of this world and the Hereafter." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed..."

The steadfast Muslim attains the rank of the fasting and praying worshiper through the excellence of his character and the nobility of his station." In another narration: "the rank of the thirsting one in the scorching heat." And ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Samurah reported: We were with the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he said, "Last night I saw something wondrous: I saw a man from my community kneeling on his knees, with a veil between him and God. Then his good character came and admitted him into the presence of God, the Exalted." And Anas reported: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Verily, a servant may reach the great ranks of the Hereafter and the noble stations through his good character, even though he is weak in worship." It is narrated that ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) sought permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) while there were women from the women of Quraysh with him, speaking to him and raising their voices above his voice. When ‘Umar sought permission, they hurried behind the veil. ‘Umar entered and the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was laughing. ‘Umar said, "What makes you laugh, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of God?" He replied, "I marveled at these women who were with me—when they heard your voice, they hurried behind the veil." ‘Umar said, "You are more deserving of their awe, O Messenger of God." Then ‘Umar turned to them and said, "O enemies of your own souls! Do you fear me and not fear the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)?" They said, "Yes, for you are harsher and sterner than the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)." He (peace be upon him) said, "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, O son of al-Khattab, whenever Satan meets you taking a path, he takes a path other than yours." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Bad character is a sin that is not forgiven, and ill suspicion is a stinking offense." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Verily, a servant may descend, due to his bad character, to the lowest depths of Hell."

Narrations: Ibn Luqman the Wise said to his father: O father, which qualities in a person are best? He replied: Religion. He asked: And if there are two? He said: Religion and wealth. He asked: And if there are three? He said: Religion, wealth, and modesty. He asked: And if there are four? He said: Religion, wealth, modesty, and good character. He asked: And if there are five? He said: Religion, wealth, modesty, good character, and generosity. He asked: And if there are six? He said: O my son, if these five qualities are gathered in him, then he is pure, pious, a friend of God, and free from Satan.

Al-Hasan said: Whoever has a bad character torments himself. Anas ibn Malik said: Verily, a servant may attain the highest degree in Paradise through his good character, even without being a devout worshiper, and he may reach the lowest pit in Hell through his bad character, even while being a devout worshiper. Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: In the breadth of good character lie the treasures of provision. Wahb ibn Munabbih said: The likeness of one with bad character is that of a broken pottery shard—it cannot be patched nor returned to clay. Al-Fudayl said: I would prefer that a dissolute person with good character accompany me rather than a devout worshiper with bad character.

Ibn al-Mubarak accompanied a man of bad character on a journey, bearing with him and dealing with him gently. When he parted from him, he wept. He was asked about that, and he said: I wept out of mercy for him; I parted from him, but his character remains with him—it did not part from him. Al-Junayd said: Four things elevate a servant to the highest ranks, even if his deeds and knowledge are little: forbearance, humility, generosity, and good character, and that is the perfection of faith. Al-Kinani said: Sufism is character; so whoever surpasses you in character surpasses you in Sufism. Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: Mix with people through good character, and distinguish yourselves from them through deeds. Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: Bad character is a vice with which many good deeds are of no benefit, and good character is a virtue with which many vices cause no harm.

Ibn Abbas was asked: What is nobility? He said: It is what God has stated in His Mighty Book: "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you." It was said: Then what is lineage? He said: The best of you in character is the most noble of you in lineage. And he said: Every structure has a foundation, and the foundation of Islam is good character. Ata said: No one has been elevated except through good character, and no one has attained its perfection except the Chosen One (peace be upon him). Thus, the closest of creation to God, the Almighty, are those who follow his traces through good character.

Explanation of the True Nature of Good Character and Bad Character

Know that people have spoken about the essence of good character and what it truly is, yet they have not addressed its reality itself. Rather, they have addressed its fruits, and even then they have not encompassed all of its fruits. Instead, each one mentioned from its fruits only what occurred to him and what was present in his mind, without directing care to mention its definition and reality with all its fruits in detail and completeness. This is like the saying of al-Hasan: "Good character is a cheerful countenance, offering generosity, and refraining from harm." And al-Wasiti said: "It is not to dispute and not to be disputed due to the intensity of one's knowledge of God Almighty." And Shah al-Kirmani said: "It is refraining from harm and enduring burdens." And some said: "It is to be close to people while being a stranger among them." And al-Wasiti said on another occasion: "It is pleasing the creation in ease and hardship." And Abu 'Uthman said: "It is contentment with God Almighty." And Sahl al-Tustari was asked about good character, and he said: "Its lowest level is forbearance, abandoning retaliation, showing mercy to the oppressor, seeking forgiveness for him, and having compassion for him." And he said another time: "It is not to accuse the Truth in provision, to trust in Him, to find peace in His fulfillment of what He has guaranteed, obeying Him and not disobeying Him in all matters, between Him and oneself and between oneself and people." And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "Good character lies in three traits: avoiding the forbidden, seeking the lawful, and providing generously for one's family." And al-Husayn ibn Mansur said: "It is that the harshness of creation does not affect you after you have contemplated the Truth." And Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz said: "It is that you have no concern other than God Almighty." This and its like are many, and it is an address to the fruits of good character, not to its essence itself; moreover, it does not encompass all the fruits either. And lifting the veil from the reality is more fitting than transmitting differing sayings.

We say: "Khulq" (character) and "khalq" (form) are two terms used together. It is said: "So-and-so is of beautiful khulq and khalq"—meaning beautiful in both inward and outward state. Thus, by "khalq" is meant the outward form, and by "khulq" is meant the inward form. This is because the human being is composed of a body perceived by the sight and of a spirit and soul perceived by the inner vision. Each of these has a state and a form, either ugly or beautiful. The soul perceived by the inner vision is of greater worth than the body perceived by the sight. For this reason, God magnified its affair by attributing it to Himself, as He, the Exalted, said: "Indeed, I am creating a human being from clay. So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down to him in prostration." Thus, He indicated that the body is ascribed to the clay and the spirit to the Lord of the worlds. The meaning of spirit and soul in this context is one.

Thus, "khulq" (character) is an expression for a firmly established state within the soul, from which actions emanate with ease and facility, without need for thought and deliberation. If that state is such that beautiful, praiseworthy actions—by reason and by sacred law—emanate from it, then that state is called a good character. If what emanates from it are ugly actions, then the state which is the source is called a bad character.

We said it is a firmly established state because one who gives away money on rare occasions due to a passing need is not said to have the character of generosity, unless that becomes firmly rooted within his soul. And we stipulated that the actions emanate from him with ease, without deliberation, because one who forces himself to give money or to remain silent when angry, with effort and deliberation, is not said to have the character of generosity and forbearance.

Here are four matters: first, the performance of what is beautiful and what is ugly. Second, the capacity for both. Third, the knowledge of both. Fourth, a disposition of the soul by which it inclines toward one of the two sides and finds one of the two matters—either the beautiful or the ugly—facilitated for it.

Character is not merely an expression of action, for there may be a person whose innate character is generosity, yet he does not give—either due to lack of wealth or because of some hindrance. Conversely, one may have an innate character of miserliness, yet he gives—either due to an incentive or for show. Nor is character simply an expression of capacity; for the capacity to withhold and to give—indeed, to both opposites—is equally present in every individual. Every human being is naturally endowed with the ability to give and to withhold, yet this does not necessitate an innate character of miserliness or generosity. Nor is character an expression of knowledge alone, for knowledge pertains equally to what is commendable and what is reprehensible. Rather, it is an expression of the fourth meaning: it is the disposition by which the soul is predisposed to either withholding or giving. Character, therefore, is the inner disposition and hidden form of the soul.

Just as outward beauty in general is not perfected by the beauty of the eyes alone, without the nose, mouth, and cheeks—but rather requires the beauty of all parts to complete outward comeliness—so too in the inner realm there are four pillars, all of which must be sound for good character to be perfected. When these four pillars are balanced, harmonious, and proportionate, then good character is achieved. They are: the power of knowledge, the power of anger, the power of desire, and the power of justice that balances these three forces.

As for the power of knowledge, its virtue and soundness lie in becoming such that through it one easily discerns the distinction between truth and falsehood in statements, between right and wrong in beliefs, and between the beautiful and the ugly in actions. When this power is rectified, the fruit of wisdom is attained from it, and wisdom is the pinnacle of good character—concerning which God has said, “And whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant good.”

As for the power of anger: its virtue lies in its contraction and expansion being regulated to the extent required by wisdom. Likewise, the appetite’s virtue and soundness lie in being under the direction of wisdom—that is, the direction of intellect and sacred law.

As for the power of justice, it is to restrain desire and anger under the command of intellect and divine law.

Thus, the intellect is like a sincere advisor. The power of justice is capability, and its likeness is that of an executor who carries out the intellect's directive. Anger is that through which the directive is executed, and its likeness is that of a hunting dog, for it must be disciplined so that its pursuit and restraint are according to the directive, not according to the agitation of the soul's appetite. The appetite is like a horse ridden in pursuit of game; sometimes it is trained and disciplined, and sometimes it is unruly. Whoever possesses these traits in a balanced and moderate state is of good character absolutely. Whoever has some of them in moderation but not others is of good character specifically in relation to that particular aspect, like one whose face has some beautiful features but not others. The goodness and moderation of the irascible power is termed courage, and the goodness and moderation of the appetitive power is termed chastity.

If the faculty of anger deviates from moderation toward the extreme of excess, it is called recklessness; and if it inclines toward weakness and deficiency, it is called cowardice and timidity. If the faculty of desire inclines toward the extreme of excess, it is called greed; and if it inclines toward deficiency, it is called stagnation.

The praiseworthy is the middle path, which is virtue, while the two extremes are vices and blameworthy. When justice is absent, it does not have two sides of excess and deficiency; rather, it has a single opposite and counterpart, which is injustice.

As for wisdom, its excess when employed for corrupt purposes is termed cunning and craftiness, while its deficiency is called foolishness, and the mean is what is specifically designated as wisdom.

Therefore, the foundational sources of character traits are four: wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. By wisdom, we mean a state of the soul through which it discerns right from wrong in all voluntary actions. By justice, we mean a state of the soul and a power that directs anger and desire according to the dictates of wisdom, and restrains them in their expansion and contraction as wisdom requires. By courage, we mean that the power of anger is subservient to reason in its advance and retreat. By temperance, we mean the disciplining of the power of desire by the discipline of reason and sacred law.

From the equilibrium of these four foundations, all noble character traits emanate.

For when the intellect's power is balanced, it yields sound management, keenness of mind, penetrating insight, correct intuition, and alertness to the subtleties of actions and the hidden flaws of souls. From its excess arise cunning, deceit, trickery, and guile. From its deficiency emerge foolishness, imprudence, stupidity, and madness—by 'imprudence' I mean a lack of cultivation in matters despite sound imagination, for a person may be imprudent in one thing but not another. The distinction between stupidity and madness is that the stupid person's aim is sound, but his method of proceeding is corrupt, so he lacks sound deliberation in following the path that leads to the objective; whereas the madman chooses what ought not to be chosen, making the very foundation of his choice and preference corrupt.

As for the virtue of courage: from it emanate generosity, gallantry, nobility, self-restraint, forbearance, clemency, steadfastness, suppression of anger, dignity, affection, and the like—these are praiseworthy traits. As for its excess, which is recklessness: from it emanate arrogance, extravagance, fury, pride, and vanity. As for its deficiency: from it emanate disgrace, abasement, impatience, baseness, pettiness of soul, and shrinking from claiming one's due right.

As for the creation of chastity: from it emanate generosity, modesty, patience, forbearance, contentment, piety, gentleness, helpfulness, gracefulness, and lack of greed. As for its inclination toward excess or deficiency: from it arise avarice, gluttony, insolence, malice, extravagance, stinginess, ostentation, shamelessness, buffoonery, frivolity, flattery, envy, rejoicing in others' misfortune, groveling before the wealthy, despising the poor, and the like.

The mothers of virtuous character traits are these four excellences: wisdom, courage, chastity, and justice. All others are their branches.

None attained the perfection of balance in these four except the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. After him, people vary in their nearness to and distance from it. Whoever draws near to him in these character traits draws near to God, the Exalted, in proportion to his nearness to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Whoever gathers the perfection of these character traits deserves to be among creation as an obeyed sovereign to whom all creation returns and whom they emulate in all actions. And whoever is stripped of all these character traits and is described by their opposites deserves to be expelled from the lands and the servants, for he has drawn near to the accursed Satan who causes remoteness, and thus he should be distanced. Just as the former is near to the angel who brings near, and thus he should be emulated and drawn close to, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was sent only to perfect noble character traits, as he said.

The Quran has alluded to these moral traits in its descriptions of the believers, as God Almighty said: "The true believers are only those who believe in God and His Messenger, then do not doubt, and strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of God. It is they who are the truthful." Thus, belief in God and His Messenger without doubt is the strength of certainty and the fruit of the intellect, representing the ultimate wisdom. Striving with wealth is generosity, which stems from restraining the power of desire. Striving with one's life is courage, which stems from employing the power of anger under the condition of the intellect and the limit of moderation. God Almighty described the Companions, saying: "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves," indicating that severity has its proper place and mercy has its proper place. Perfection does not lie in severity in every situation, nor in mercy in every situation. This, then, clarifies the meaning of character, its goodness and its ugliness, and explains its pillars, its fruits, and its branches.

Explanation of How Character Traits Can Be Changed Through Spiritual Discipline

Know that some, upon whom idleness has prevailed, find striving, spiritual discipline, and the occupation with purifying the soul and refining character burdensome. Their souls do not permit that this be due to their own deficiency, shortcoming, and base inner nature. Thus, they claim that character traits cannot conceivably be changed, for innate dispositions do not change.

Two arguments were presented therein. First: Character is the form of the inner self, just as creation is the form of the outward self. The outward creation cannot be altered by one’s power—the short cannot make himself tall, nor can the tall make himself short, nor can the ugly beautify his appearance. Likewise, inner ugliness follows this same course. Second: They said that good character suppresses desire and anger. We have tested this through prolonged spiritual struggle and have learned that it arises from one’s temperament and innate nature, which never entirely depart from a human being. Thus, to occupy oneself with it is to waste time without benefit. For what is sought is to sever the heart’s attachment to immediate gratifications, and that is impossible to achieve.

We say: If moral traits were incapable of change, then all admonitions, exhortations, and disciplines would be rendered futile. Nor would the Messenger of God ﷺ have said, "Refine your moral character." How can this be denied for the human being, when changing the disposition of an animal is possible? For the falcon is transformed from wildness to familiarity, the dog from voracious gluttony to discipline, restraint, and abstinence, and the horse from stubbornness to gentleness and obedience—and all of that is a change of inherent dispositions.

The clarifying statement that lifts the veil on this matter is to say: Existing things are divided into that in which a human being and his choice have no involvement in its origin and its particulars, such as the heavens and the stars, and indeed the limbs of the body, both internal and external, and all other parts of living creatures. In sum, everything that is a complete, finished entity, whose existence and perfection have been fully realized. And into that which came into existence in an incomplete state and was endowed with a capacity to receive perfection after its condition is met. Its condition may be tied to the choice of the servant. For the seed is not an apple tree nor a date palm; however, it was created with a nature that enables it to become a date palm if cultivation is added to it, and it will never become an apple tree at all except through cultivation. So, if the seed becomes subject to choice, such that it accepts some states and not others, then likewise is anger and appetite. If we wished to suppress and subdue them completely so that no trace of them remained, we would be utterly incapable of it. But if we wished to soften and tame them through spiritual discipline and struggle, we would be capable of that. And we have been commanded to do that, and it has become the cause of our salvation and our arrival unto God, exalted is He. Indeed, innate dispositions differ; some are quick to accept and some are slow to accept, and for their difference there are two causes.

One: The strength of the instinct in the root of the disposition and the length of the period of existence. For the forces of appetite, anger, and arrogance exist in the human being, but the most difficult in affair and the most resistant to change is the force of appetite, for it is the earliest in existence. Indeed, the child at the beginning of his natural state is created with appetite, then after seven years perhaps anger is created in him, and after that the power of discernment is created.

The second cause is that character may become entrenched through frequent action in accordance with it, obedience to it, and the belief that it is good and pleasing. People in this regard are of four levels.

The first is the heedless human who does not distinguish between truth and falsehood, nor between the beautiful and the ugly. Rather, he remains as he was created, devoid of all convictions, and his appetite has not yet been perfected by pursuing pleasures. Such a one is extremely quick to accept treatment and needs only a teacher and a guide, along with an inner motivation that drives him to strive, so his character may be reformed in the shortest time.

The second is one who has come to recognize the ugliness of the ugly, but has not accustomed himself to righteous action. Instead, his evil deeds have been made appealing to him, so he engages in them in submission to his appetites and in turning away from the correctness of his own opinion, due to the domination of appetite over him. Yet he knows of his shortcoming in his action. His case is more difficult than the first, for the duty upon him has multiplied: he must first uproot what has become ingrained in his soul from long habituation to corruption, and then implant in his soul the quality of habituation to righteousness. But on the whole, he is a place receptive to discipline if he rises to it with earnestness, exertion, and resolve.

The third is one who believes that ugly traits are obligatory and commendable, that they are truth and beauty, and he has been raised upon them. Treatment for such a one is nearly impossible, and his rectitude is scarcely hoped for except rarely, due to the multiplication of the causes of misguidance.

The fourth is one who, along with being nurtured upon corrupt opinion and raised to act upon it, sees virtue in abundant evil and the destruction of souls, boasts of it, and imagines that this elevates his status. This is the most difficult of the levels. Concerning his like it is said: "Among labors is training an old dog; among torments is refining a wolf." The first of these is merely ignorant. The second is ignorant and astray. The third is ignorant, astray, and dissolute. The fourth is ignorant, astray, dissolute, and wicked.

As for the other illusion they argued with: their statement that as long as a human is alive, desire, anger, love of this world, and all such traits do not cease from him—this is an error that befell a group who thought the aim of spiritual struggle is to suppress these attributes completely and erase them. Far from it! For desire was created for a benefit and is necessary in one's innate disposition. If the desire for food were cut off, man would perish; if the desire for intercourse were cut off, progeny would cease; and if anger were utterly eliminated, man would not repel from himself what would destroy him, and he would perish. As long as the root of desire remains, love for wealth—which leads to fulfilling desire—inevitably remains, to the point that it drives him to withhold wealth. What is required is not to remove this entirely, but to restore it to moderation, which is the midpoint between excess and neglect. What is required in the attribute of anger is noble protectiveness, such that it is free from both recklessness and cowardice alike. In sum, one should be strong within himself, yet with his strength obedient to reason. For this reason, God Almighty said, "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves" (48:29), describing them with severity—and severity stems from anger. If anger were nullified, striving would be nullified. How can one aim to uproot desire and anger completely when the prophets, peace be upon them, were not free from that? As He said, "I am only a human; I become angry as humans become angry" (Hadith). And when something he disliked was said in his presence, he would become angry until his cheeks reddened, but he would only speak the truth. Thus, peace be upon him, his anger did not lead him away from truth. And God Almighty said, "And those who restrain anger and pardon people" (3:134), but He did not say, "those who lack anger." So anger and desire are to be returned to the limit of moderation, such that neither overpowers reason nor overcomes it; rather, reason is the regulator and master over them, which is possible. This is what is meant by transforming character, for sometimes desire can dominate a person to the point that his reason is too weak to repel it, and he proceeds to indulge in indecencies. Through spiritual discipline, it returns to the limit of moderation, proving that this is possible—and experience and observation indicate this with undeniable evidence. What indicates that the aim is the middle course in character, not the two extremes, is that generosity is a praiseworthy trait in the Law, being the midpoint between the two extremes of wastefulness and stinginess. God praised it, saying, "And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but hold a medium between that" (25:67), and He said, "And do not make your hand chained to your neck nor stretch it forth completely" (17:29). Likewise, the aim regarding the desire for food is moderation, not gluttony nor abstinence. God said, "Eat and drink, but do not be extravagant. Indeed, He does not love the extravagant" (7:31). Regarding anger, He said, "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves" (48:29). And the Prophet said, "The best of matters are the middle ones" (Hadith). This has a secret and a reality: that happiness is tied to the heart's soundness from the afflictions of this world. God said, "Except he who comes to God with a sound heart" (26:89). Stinginess is an affliction of the world, and wastefulness is also an affliction of the world. The condition of the heart is to be sound from both—that is, not inclined toward wealth, nor eager to spend it or to withhold it. For one eager to spend has his heart turned toward spending, just as one eager to withhold has his heart turned toward withholding. The perfection of the heart is to be pure from both descriptions. Since that is not attainable in this world, we seek what most resembles the absence of both descriptions and is farthest from the extremes, which is the middle course. For the lukewarm is neither hot nor cold but is between them, as if free from both descriptions. So too is generosity between wastefulness and stinginess, courage between cowardice and recklessness, chastity between gluttony and abstinence. Thus, both extremes of matters are blameworthy; this is the aim, and it is possible. Yes, it is incumbent upon the guiding shaykh for the disciple to make anger utterly reprehensible to him and to condemn withholding wealth outright, not permitting him any of it, for if he permitted the slightest amount, the disciple would take it as an excuse to retain his stinginess and anger, thinking it the permitted measure. When he aims at the root and strives intensely, and only achieves breaking its intensity so that it returns to moderation, the correct course for him is to aim at uprooting the root until the intended measure becomes attainable. This secret should not be disclosed to the disciple, for it is a place of delusion for the foolish, who would think his anger is justified and his withholding is justified.

Explanation of the Cause by Which Good Character is Attained in General

You have come to know that good character stems from the balance of the intellect's power and the perfection of wisdom, and from the balance of the powers of anger and desire, making them obedient to both the intellect and the Sacred Law. This balance is achieved in two ways:

The first is through divine generosity and innate perfection, whereby a person is created and born with complete intellect and noble character, having been spared the tyranny of desire and anger. Rather, these two are created in moderation, subservient to intellect and sacred law. Thus, he becomes knowledgeable without instruction and refined without discipline, like Jesus son of Mary and John son of Zechariah, peace be upon them both, and likewise all the prophets, may God’s blessings be upon them all. It should not be thought that what is attainable through acquisition cannot also be present in one’s innate nature and disposition. For many a child is created truthful in speech, generous, and bold, while another may be created with the opposite traits. Yet such qualities may also be acquired through habituation and keeping company with those who embody these morals, and they may also be attained through learning.

The second approach is acquiring these character traits through struggle and discipline, meaning compelling the soul to perform the acts required by the desired trait. For example, one who wishes to attain the trait of generosity must force himself to perform the acts of the generous, which is giving wealth. He must persistently demand it of himself and adhere to it, forcing and struggling against his soul until it becomes second nature and easy for him, thus becoming generous. Similarly, one who wishes to attain the trait of humility while being dominated by pride must persistently perform the acts of the humble for an extended period, struggling against and forcing himself until it becomes a trait and nature for him, thus becoming easy. All praiseworthy traits in the religious law are attained through this path. Its ultimate goal is for the act emanating from him to become pleasurable. Thus, the generous one is he who finds pleasure in giving the wealth he gives, unlike one who gives with aversion. The humble one is he who finds pleasure in humility. Religious traits will not become firmly rooted in the soul until the soul becomes accustomed to all good habits and abandons all bad actions, and until it persists in them with the persistence of one who yearns for beautiful acts and delights in them, and dislikes ugly acts and is pained by them, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "And the comfort of my eyes has been placed in prayer." Whenever acts of worship and abstaining from prohibitions are done with aversion and reluctance, it is deficiency, and perfect happiness is not attained through it. Indeed, persisting in it through struggle is good, but relative to abandoning it, not relative to performing it willingly. Therefore, Allah the Exalted said, "And indeed, it is difficult except for the humble," and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Worship Allah with contentment; if you cannot, then patience over what you dislike holds much good." Furthermore, in attaining the promised happiness through good character, finding pleasure in obedience and aversion to sin should not be for a time only; rather, it should be constant and throughout one's entire lifetime. The longer the life, the more firmly established and complete the virtue. Therefore, "when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about happiness, he said: 'A long life in obedience to Allah the Exalted.'" This is why the prophets and the righteous disliked death, for this world is the cultivation field for the Hereafter. The longer the life and the more acts of worship, the greater the reward, the purer and cleaner the soul, and the stronger and more firmly established the character traits. The purpose of acts of worship is their effect on the heart, and their effect is strengthened by frequent persistence in worship. The ultimate goal of these traits is that love for this world is severed from the soul and love for Allah the Exalted becomes firmly rooted within it, so that nothing is more beloved to him than meeting Allah the Almighty. Thus, he uses all his wealth only in the manner that brings him to Him, and his anger and desire are subservient to him, so he uses them only in the manner that brings him to Allah the Exalted, which is by being weighed with the scales of the religious law and intellect. Thereafter, he is joyful and finds pleasure in it. One should not consider it far-fetched for prayer to reach a level where it becomes the comfort of the eyes, and for acts of worship to become pleasurable, for habit produces in the soul wonders stranger than that. Indeed, we see kings and those living in luxury in constant sorrow, and we see the gambler overcome with joy and pleasure in his gambling and what he is engaged in, to the extent that he finds the joy of others in non-gambling burdensome, even though gambling may strip him of his wealth, ruin his home, and leave him bankrupt—yet he loves it and finds pleasure in it due to long familiarity and dedicating himself to it over time. Similarly, the pigeon fancier may stand all day in the heat of the sun on his feet without feeling its pain due to his joy in the birds, their movements, flight, and soaring in the sky's atmosphere. Indeed, we see the wicked braggart pride himself and his strength in enduring that, even considering it a source of pride. One of them may be cut limb from limb rather than admit what he or another has done, persisting in denial and disregarding punishments, joyful in what he believes is perfection, courage, and manliness. Thus, their conditions, despite the punishment involved, have become the comfort of his eyes and a cause for his pride. Indeed, no condition is baser or uglier than that of the effeminate man in his imitation of females by plucking hair, tattooing the face, and mixing with women. You see the effeminate man joyful in his condition and proud of a perfection in his effeminacy, boasting of it among other effeminate men, to the extent that boasting and rivalry occur among cuppers and sweepers just as it occurs among kings and scholars. All of that is the result of habit and persistent adherence to a single pattern constantly over a long period, and observing it among associates and acquaintances. If the soul, through habit, finds falsehood pleasurable and inclines toward it and toward vile things, how could it not find truth pleasurable if it were returned to it for a period and committed to persisting in it? Rather, the soul's inclination toward these vile matters is contrary to nature, resembling an inclination to eat clay, which may overcome some people through habit. As for its inclination toward wisdom and love...

God the Exalted, and knowing Him and worshipping Him, is like the inclination towards food and drink, for it is the demand of the heart's innate nature, as it is a divine matter. Its inclination towards the demands of base desire is alien to its essence and incidental to its nature. Indeed, the nourishment of the heart is wisdom, knowledge, and the love of God Almighty. However, it turns away from the demand of its nature due to an illness that has befallen it, just as illness may befall the stomach so that it no longer desires food and drink, which are the two causes of its life. Thus, every heart that inclines to love something other than God the Exalted is not free from illness, in proportion to its inclination, unless it loves that thing for being an aid to it in loving God the Exalted and in His religion. In that case, it does not indicate that illness.

Therefore, you have now come to know with certainty through this that these beautiful character traits can be acquired through spiritual discipline, which is the deliberate practice of the actions stemming from them initially, so that they become innate nature ultimately. This is among the wondrous relationships between the heart and the limbs—I mean the soul and the body—for every quality that appears in the heart overflows its effect upon the limbs, so that they inevitably move only in accordance with it. And every action performed by the limbs, an effect from it may ascend to the heart. The matter therein is cyclical. This is known by an example: whoever wishes to become skilled in writing, as a psychological quality—so that he becomes a writer by nature—has no path except to undertake with the limb of the hand what the skilled writer undertakes and to persist in it for a long duration, imitating beautiful handwriting. For the action of the writer is the beautiful handwriting, so he resembles the writer through deliberate effort. Then he continues to persist in it until it becomes a firmly established quality in his soul, and ultimately beautiful handwriting issues from him by nature, just as it issued from him initially through effort. Thus, the beautiful handwriting is what made his handwriting beautiful. But the first was through effort, except that an effect from it ascended to the heart, then descended from the heart to the limb, so that he came to write beautiful handwriting by nature.

Likewise, whoever wishes to become one with a soul versed in religious understanding has no path thereto except to undertake the actions of the jurists—which is the repeated engagement with jurisprudence until the quality of understanding bends from it onto his heart, and he thus becomes one with a soul truly learned. Similarly, whoever desires to become generous, pure of soul, forbearing, and humble must oblige himself to undertake the actions of such people, even if by conscious effort, until it becomes his innate disposition. There is no remedy for him except this. And just as the seeker of spiritual understanding does not despair of attaining this station by neglecting a single night, nor does he attain it by the repetition of a single night, so too the seeker of the soul's purification, perfection, and adornment with good works does not attain it through the worship of a single day, nor is he deprived of it by the disobedience of a single day. This is the meaning of our saying that a single major sin does not necessitate eternal wretchedness, but idleness on a single day calls to its like, then they accumulate little by little until the soul becomes accustomed to laziness and abandons attainment altogether, thus missing the virtue of true understanding. Likewise, minor sins draw one to another until the very root of happiness is lost by the destruction of the root of faith at the final moment. And just as the repetition of a single night is not felt in its effect upon spiritual understanding—rather, spiritual understanding appears gradually, bit by bit, like the growth of the body and the increase in stature—so too a single act of obedience is not felt in its immediate effect upon the soul's purification and cleansing. Yet one should not belittle a small act of obedience, for the great multitude of them is effective, and the multitude is but gathered from single units; each one of them has an effect. There is no act of obedience except that it leaves an effect, even if hidden, and for it there is inevitably a reward. For the reward corresponds to the effect, and likewise for disobedience. How many a person of understanding belittles neglecting a day and a night, and so on in succession, postponing for himself day after day until his nature departs from accepting true understanding. Similarly, whoever belittles minor sins and postpones repentance for himself successively until death snatches him suddenly, or the darkness of sins accumulates upon his heart and repentance becomes difficult for him. For the little calls to the much, and the heart becomes shackled by chains of desires from whose clutches it cannot be freed. This is the meaning of the closing of the door of repentance, and it is what is intended by His Exalted saying, "And We have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them" [Qur'an 36:9]. Therefore, it was said—may God be pleased with him—"Verily, faith begins in the heart as a white spot; whenever faith increases, that whiteness increases until, when the servant's faith is complete, his heart becomes entirely white. And verily, hypocrisy begins in the heart as a black spot; whenever hypocrisy increases, that blackness increases until, when hypocrisy is complete, his heart becomes entirely black."

When you understand that virtuous character traits arise at times from innate disposition and natural constitution, at times from habitual practice of beautiful deeds, and at times from observing the masters of beautiful deeds and keeping their company—for they are companions of goodness and brothers in righteousness—since nature steals from nature both evil and good. Thus, whoever is favored by all three aspects until he becomes one possessing virtue by nature, habit, and learning, he is at the pinnacle of virtue. And whoever is base by nature and happens to have wicked companions, learning from them and finding the means of evil facilitated until he becomes accustomed to it, he is at the farthest remove from God, Mighty and Majestic. Between these two ranks are those who differ in these aspects, and each degree in nearness and remoteness is according to what his form and state necessitate. "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. And God wronged them not, but they wronged themselves."

Detailed Exposition of the Path to Refining Morals

You have previously learned that moderation in character constitutes the soundness of the soul, and deviation from moderation is its infirmity and sickness. Just as moderation in the body's temperament is its health, and deviation from moderation is its illness, let us take the body as an example. We say: The example of the soul in its treatment—by eradicating vices and base traits from it and acquiring virtues and beautiful character traits for it—is like the example of the body in its treatment—by removing ailments from it and attaining health for it and bringing it to it. And just as moderation predominantly characterizes the original temperament, and it is only due to external factors like foods, climates, and conditions that harm befalls the stomach, so too is every newborn born moderate and sound in innate disposition; it is only his parents who make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Magian—meaning, through habituation and teaching, vices are acquired. And just as the body is not created complete at the outset, but rather is perfected and strengthened through growth and upbringing with nourishment, so too the soul is created deficient yet receptive to perfection; it is only perfected through upbringing, refinement of character, and nourishment with knowledge. And just as if the body is healthy, the physician's role is to establish the regimen that preserves health, and if it is sick, his role is to bring health to it, so too with your soul: if it is pure, clean, and refined, you should strive to preserve it and bring increased strength to it and acquire greater clarity; and if it is devoid of perfection and clarity, you should strive to bring that to it. And just as the ailment that alters the body's moderation and causes illness is only treated by its opposite—if it is from heat, then with cold; if from cold, then with heat—so too the vice, which is a sickness of the heart, is treated by its opposite. Thus, the sickness of ignorance is treated by learning, the sickness of miserliness by generosity, the sickness of arrogance by humility, and the sickness of greed by restraining oneself from desires with effort. And just as it is necessary to endure the bitterness of medicine and to strictly abstain from desires for the treatment of sick bodies, so too it is necessary to endure the bitterness of struggle and patience for curing the sickness of the heart—indeed, more so. For the sickness of the body ends with death, but the sickness of the heart—God forbid—is a sickness that endures after death for all eternity. And just as not every cooling agent is suitable for an ailment whose cause is heat except when it is of a specific degree—and this varies in intensity and weakness, duration and lack thereof, abundance and scarcity—and it must have a measure by which the beneficial amount is known, for if its measure is not observed, corruption increases, so too the opposites by which character traits are treated must have a measure. And just as the measure for the medicine is taken from the gauge of the ailment, to the extent that the physician does not treat until he knows whether the ailment is from heat or cold; if it is from heat, he knows its degree: is it weak or strong? When he knows that, he then considers the conditions of the body, the conditions of the time, the patient's occupation, his age, and all his other conditions, and then treats accordingly.

Likewise, the spiritual guide who is followed, who treats the souls of disciples and heals the hearts of seekers, should not rush upon them with spiritual exercises and obligations in a specific manner and on a specific path until he knows their character traits and their ailments. Just as a physician, if he treated all patients with one remedy, would kill most of them, so too the guide, if he prescribed one pattern of spiritual exercise to the disciples, would ruin them and deaden their hearts. Rather, he must consider the disciple's ailment, his condition, his age, his temperament, and what his constitution can bear of spiritual exercise, and base his regimen upon that. If the disciple is a beginner, ignorant of the boundaries of the Sacred Law, he first teaches him purification, prayer, and the outward aspects of worship. If he is occupied with unlawful wealth or is committing a sin, he first commands him to abandon it. When his outward aspect becomes adorned with acts of worship and his limbs are purified from apparent sins, he then looks, through the indications of states, to his inward being to discern his character traits and the diseases of his heart. If he sees that he possesses wealth beyond the measure of his necessity, he takes it from him and spends it in charitable works, emptying his heart of it so that he does not turn his attention to it. If he sees that frivolity, arrogance, and self-importance are dominant in him, he commands him to go out to the markets for labor and begging, for self-importance and love of leadership are not broken except through humiliation, and there is no humiliation greater than the humiliation of begging. He then obliges him to persist in that for a period until his arrogance and self-importance are broken, for arrogance is among the destructive diseases, as is frivolity. If he sees that cleanliness of body and clothes is dominant in him, and sees his heart inclined to that, rejoicing in it and attentive to it, he employs him in tending the latrine, cleaning it, sweeping filthy places, and frequenting the kitchen and places of smoke, until his frivolity regarding cleanliness is disturbed. For those who clean their clothes and adorn them, and seek clean patches and colored rugs, there is no difference between them and a bride who adorns herself all day long. There is no difference between a person worshipping himself and worshipping an idol. Whenever one worships other than God Almighty, he is veiled from God. And whoever pays regard in his garment to something other than it being lawful and pure—a regard to which his heart turns—he is occupied with himself.

Among the subtleties of spiritual discipline is that when a seeker is not readily willing to abandon recklessness outright, or to relinquish another trait, and does not permit its opposite all at once, he should be transferred from the blameworthy character trait to another blameworthy trait that is lighter than it—like one who washes blood with urine, then washes the urine with water, if water alone does not remove the blood. Just as a boy is enticed to the schoolroom through playing with a ball and polo stick and the like, then is transferred from play to adornment and fine garments, then from that is transferred through enticement to leadership and seeking status, then from status is transferred through enticement to the Hereafter. So likewise, whoever’s soul does not permit him to abandon status all at once, let him transfer to a status lighter than it, and so with all other traits. Similarly, if he sees greed for food prevailing over him, he should oblige him to fast and reduce food, then charge him to prepare delicious foods and present them to others while he does not eat from them, until he thereby strengthens his soul, becomes accustomed to patience, and his greed is broken. Likewise, if he finds him a youth yearning for marriage but incapable of endurance, he orders him to fast; perhaps his desire is subdued by that, then he orders him to break his fast one night with water without bread, and another night with bread without water, and prohibits him from meat and condiments outright, until his soul is humbled and his vigor broken. Thus, there is no remedy at the beginning of spiritual resolve more beneficial than hunger. And if he sees anger prevailing over him, he obliges him to forbearance and silence, and sets over him a companion of ill character, and obliges him to serve one whose character is bad, until he trains his soul in endurance with him.

As it is related of some that he would train himself in forbearance and remove from himself the intensity of anger, so he would hire someone to insult him before a gathering of people and compel himself to patience, suppressing his rage until forbearance became a habit for him to the point that he was proverbial for it. Some felt cowardice and weakness of heart within themselves and desired to acquire the trait of courage, so they would ride the sea in winter when the waves were turbulent. The ascetics of India treat laziness in worship by standing all night on one foot. Some shaykhs, at the beginning of their resolve, were lazy about standing in prayer, so they obliged themselves to stand on their heads all night to become willing to stand on their feet voluntarily. And some treated the love of wealth by selling all his possessions and throwing them into the sea, since distributing it among people would have been reckless generosity and ostentation in giving.

These examples acquaint you with the method of treating hearts. Our aim is not to enumerate the remedy for every ailment—for that will come in the remaining books—but rather our present purpose is to alert you that the comprehensive path in this involves traversing the way of opposition to everything the soul desires and inclines toward. God has gathered all of this in His Mighty Book in a single verse, saying, exalted is He: "But as for him who feared the standing before his Lord and restrained the soul from caprice, indeed Paradise will be the refuge." The essential foundation in spiritual struggle and fulfilling one's resolve is that when one resolves to abandon a desire, its means become readily available, and this becomes a trial and test from God, exalted is He. Thus, one must be patient and persevere, for if he accustoms his soul to abandoning resolve, it becomes habituated to that and is corrupted. And if it happens that he breaks his resolve, he must impose upon his soul a punishment for it—as we mentioned in the discipline of the soul in the Book of Self-Reckoning and Vigilance—for if he does not intimidate the soul with punishment, it overcomes him, and partaking in the desire becomes pleasing to him, thereby ruining the spiritual training entirely.

Explanation of the Signs of Heart's Ailments and the Signs of Its Return to Health

Know that every limb of the body is created for a specific function, and its ailment is that its designated action becomes difficult or impossible, either ceasing entirely or occurring with some disturbance. The ailment of the hand is the hindrance of its particular function for which it was created. Likewise, the ailment of the heart is the hindrance of its specific function for which it was created: namely, knowledge, wisdom, recognition, love for God Most High, worship of Him, delight in His remembrance, and preferring that over every other desire, while employing all desires and limbs in its service. God Most High says, "I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." Thus, every limb has a benefit, and the benefit of the heart is wisdom and knowledge. The distinctive quality of the human soul, by which it is set apart from beasts, is not its capacity for eating, mating, seeing, or the like, but rather its ability to know things as they truly are. The origin, creator, and inventor of all things is God Almighty, who brought them into being. So if one knew everything yet did not know God Almighty, it is as if he knew nothing. The sign of true knowledge is love; whoever knows God Most High loves Him, and the sign of love is that one does not prefer this world or any other beloved over Him, as God Most High says, "Say, 'If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your spouses...'" up to His words, "...are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until God brings about His command.'" Whoever holds something dearer than God has a sick heart, just as any stomach that prefers clay over bread and water, or loses its appetite for bread and water, is sick. These are the signs of sickness, and by this it is known that all hearts are sick except by God's will. However, some ailments are unknown to their possessor, and the sickness of the heart is among those its owner does not recognize; thus, he remains heedless of it. And if he does recognize it, enduring the bitterness of its cure becomes difficult, for its remedy lies in opposing desires, which is like extracting the soul. Even if one finds within himself the strength to endure it, he will hardly find a skilled physician to treat him, for the physicians are the scholars, and the sickness has overtaken them. A sick physician seldom attends to his own healing. Hence, the malady has become chronic, the disease entrenched, this knowledge has been effaced, the medicine for hearts has been utterly denied, and their sickness has been rejected. People have turned to love of this world, and to deeds whose outward appearance is worship but whose inward reality is mere habit and ostentation. These are the signs of the root ailments.

As for the signs of its return to health after treatment, it is to examine the ailment being treated. If one is treating the disease of miserliness—which is the destroyer that distances one from God, Exalted and Glorified—its cure lies in spending and disbursing wealth. However, one may spend to the point of becoming wasteful, and wastefulness is also a disease. It is like treating coldness with heat until heat predominates, which then becomes a disease as well. Rather, what is required is moderation between heat and cold. Similarly, moderation is required between wastefulness and stinginess, so that one remains at the midpoint, at the furthest remove from both extremes. If you wish to know the midpoint, observe the action dictated by the feared character trait: if it is easier and more pleasing to you than its opposite, then that character trait which necessitates it dominates you. For example, if holding onto wealth and accumulating it is more pleasing and easier for you than spending it on its rightful due, know that the trait of miserliness dominates you. Increase your persistence in spending. But if spending on what is not rightful becomes more pleasing and lighter for you than withholding what is rightful, then wastefulness has overcome you, so return to persistence in withholding. Continue to watch over yourself and infer your character from the ease or difficulty of actions, until your heart’s attachment to turning toward wealth is severed, so that you incline neither to spending nor to withholding. Rather, wealth becomes like water to you: you seek only to withhold it for the need of one in need or to spend it for the need of one in need, and spending does not outweigh withholding in your estimation. Any heart that becomes thus has come to God sound from this station in particular. And it must be sound from all other traits, so that it has no attachment to anything pertaining to this world, until the soul departs from the world with its attachments severed, not turning toward it nor longing for its means. At that point, it returns to its Lord as the contented soul returns—pleased and pleasing, entering the company of God’s servants drawn near: the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous—and excellent are those as companions.

Since the true middle path between extremes is of utmost subtlety—indeed, finer than a hair and sharper than a sword—it is no wonder that whoever treads this straight path in this world will cross a similar path in the Hereafter. Rarely does a servant avoid deviating from the straight path—that is, the middle way—without inclining to one of the two sides, so that his heart becomes attached to the side toward which he leaned. For this reason, he does not escape some punishment and passage through the Fire, even if swift as lightning. God Almighty has said, "There is not one of you but will pass over it; this is a decree your Lord must fulfill. Then We will deliver those who were God-fearing"—that is, those whose nearness to the straight path was greater than their distance from it. Due to the difficulty of steadfastness, it is incumbent upon every servant to beseech God Almighty seventeen times each day in his words, "Guide us to the straight path," since the recitation of the Opening Chapter is obligatory in every unit of prayer.

It has been narrated that one of them saw the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in a dream and said, "You said, O Messenger of God, that Surah Hud has aged me. Why did you say that?" He, upon him be peace, said, "Because of the saying of God, the Exalted: 'So remain steadfast as you have been commanded.'" Now, steadfastness upon the straight path is of the utmost subtlety, but a person should strive to draw near to steadfastness if he cannot attain its true reality. For whoever desires salvation, there is no salvation for him except through righteous deeds, and righteous deeds do not issue forth except from good character. So let every servant examine his traits and his character, let him enumerate them, and let him occupy himself with treating them one by one, in order. We ask God, the Generous, to make us among the God-fearing.

Explanation of the Path by Which a Person May Recognize the Faults Within Their Own Soul

Know that when God Almighty wills good for a servant, He grants him insight into the faults of his own soul. Whosever insight is penetrating, his faults will not remain hidden from him. Once he recognizes his faults, treatment becomes possible for him. Yet most of creation are ignorant of their own faults: one of them sees the speck in his brother’s eye but fails to see the beam in his own eye.

Whoever wishes to know the faults of his soul has four paths:

The first is to sit before a spiritual master who is discerning of the soul’s faults, acquainted with the hidden depths of its afflictions, to submit himself to his judgment, and to follow his guidance in his spiritual struggle. This is the relationship of the seeker with his master and the student with his teacher. Thus his teacher and master make known to him the faults of his soul and show him the way to treat them. But such a one has become rare to find in this age.

The second is to seek a truthful, insightful, and devout friend, appointing him as a watcher over one's own soul to observe its conditions and actions, so that he may alert one to any disliked traits, deeds, or hidden and apparent faults. Thus did the wise and the great among the leaders of religion act.

Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "May God have mercy on a man who points out my faults to me." He would ask Salman about his faults. When Salman came to him, he said: "What have you heard about me that you dislike?" Salman sought to be excused, but Umar insisted. So he said: "I have heard that you combine two dishes on one table, and that you have two garments—one for the day and one for the night." Umar asked: "Have you heard anything else?" He replied: "No." Umar said: "As for these two, I have already taken care of them." He would also ask Hudhayfah, saying to him: "You are the keeper of the Messenger of God's secret concerning the hypocrites; do you see in me any trace of hypocrisy?" Thus, despite his immense stature and lofty position, such was his suspicion of his own soul—may God be pleased with him!

Every individual endowed with greater intellect and higher station possesses less self-admiration and greater self-reproach. However, such a person has become rare, and few among friends are those who abandon flattery to inform you of your faults, or who forsake envy so as not to exceed the bounds of what is due. Thus, among your friends, you will not be free from either an envious companion or one with personal motives who sees a fault where none exists, or from a flatterer who conceals from you some of your shortcomings.

For this reason, Dawud al-Ta'i had withdrawn from people. He was asked, "Why do you not mix with people?" He replied, "What am I to do with folk who conceal my faults from me?" Thus, the desire of the people of religion was to be alerted to their faults by the alerting of others. Yet, in the likes of us, the matter has reached the point where the most hateful of creation to us is he who counsels us and makes us aware of our faults. This almost serves to declare a weakness of faith. For bad character traits are serpents and stinging scorpions. If someone were to alert us that beneath our garment was a scorpion, we would feel indebted to him, rejoice at it, and busy ourselves with removing the scorpion, keeping it away, and killing it. Its sting is only upon the body, and its pain lasts a day or less. But the sting of vile character traits is upon the very core of the heart, and I fear its pain may last eternally after death, for thousands of years. Yet we do not rejoice at one who alerts us to them, nor do we busy ourselves with removing them. Rather, we busy ourselves with confronting the advisor with words like his, saying to him, "You also do such and such." Our enmity with him distracts us from benefiting by his counsel. This seems to stem from the hardness of heart produced by abundant sins. The root of all that is weakness of faith. So we ask God, Mighty and Majestic, to inspire us with our right guidance, to make us see our faults, to occupy us with curing them, and to grant us success in duly thanking whoever makes us aware of our demerits, by His grace and favor.

The third path is to gain awareness of one's own faults through the tongues of one's enemies, for the eye of displeasure reveals defects. Perhaps a person benefits more from a contentious adversary who reminds him of his faults than from a flattering friend who praises him, extols him, and conceals his faults from him—except that human nature is predisposed to disbelieve the enemy and attribute what he says to envy. Yet the insightful one does not fail to benefit from the words of his enemies, for his faults are bound to be spread upon their tongues.

The Fourth Path: To mingle with people, so that whenever one observes a blameworthy trait among the creatures, he should hold his own soul accountable for it and attribute it to himself. For the believer is a mirror to the believer; thus he sees in the faults of others the faults of his own soul and knows that human dispositions are akin in following caprice. Whatever quality is found in one companion, the other companion is not free from its root, or from something greater, or from something of it. So let him examine his soul and purify it from all that he condemns in others—and sufficient is this as a discipline. For if all people were to abandon what they dislike in others, they would have no need for a disciplinarian.

It was said to Jesus, peace be upon him, “Who disciplined you?” He replied, “No one disciplined me; I saw the ignorance of the ignorant as a blemish, so I avoided it.” All of this is a stratagem for one who lacks a knowledgeable, wise, and insightful guide—one who is aware of the soul’s defects, compassionate, sincere in religion, free from disciplining his own self, and occupied with disciplining the servants of God Almighty, sincere to them. Whoever finds such a guide has indeed found the physician; so let him cling to him, for he is the one who will deliver him from his illness and save him from the destruction that he is facing.

Explanation of Evidences Transmitted from the Possessors of Insight

The evidences of the Sacred Law indicate that the path to treating the diseases of the heart lies in abandoning desires, and that the very substance of its maladies is the pursuit of desires.

Know that if you contemplate what we have mentioned with the eye of reflection, your inner sight will open, and the ailments, diseases, and cures of the hearts will be unveiled to you through the light of knowledge and certainty. If you are unable to achieve this, then you should not miss out on belief and faith by way of receiving and following one who is worthy of being followed, for faith has its rank just as knowledge has its rank. Knowledge is attained after faith and lies beyond it. God Almighty has said: "God will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees." Thus, whoever believes that opposing base desires is the path to God, may He be exalted, without comprehending its cause and secret, is among those who have believed. And when one comprehends what we have mentioned regarding the allies of base desires, then he is among those who were given knowledge. And to both, God has promised the best reward.

The evidence necessitating belief in this matter from the Qur’an, the Sunnah, and the statements of the scholars is too abundant to enumerate. God Almighty said, “And as for him who feared standing before his Lord and restrained his soul from base desires, surely Paradise will be his refuge.” And He said, “Those are the ones whose hearts God has tested for piety.” It is said that love of base desires was stripped from them. And it is related, “The believer is beset by five severe trials: a believer who envies him, a hypocrite who hates him, an unbeliever who fights him, a devil who misleads him, and a soul that contends with him.” Thus, it is made clear that the soul is a contentious enemy that one must strive against.

It is related that God Almighty revealed to David, peace be upon him: "O David, warn and admonish your companions against consuming desires, for the hearts attached to worldly pleasures have their intellects veiled from Me." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Blessed is he who abandons a present desire for an absent promise he has not seen." And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to a people who had returned from military struggle: "Welcome to you, you have come from the lesser struggle to the greater struggle." It was asked, "O Messenger of God, what is the greater struggle?" He said, "The struggle against the self." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The struggler is he who struggles against his self in obedience to God, the Mighty and Majestic." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Restrain your harm from your self and do not follow its caprice in disobedience to God Almighty, lest it dispute with you on a day when one part of you will not avail another, except that God Almighty forgives and conceals." And Sufyan al-Thawri said: "I have grappled with nothing more difficult for me than my self; sometimes it is for me and sometimes against me." And Abu al-'Abbas al-Mawsili would say to his self: "O self, neither in this world do you luxuriate with the sons of kings, nor in seeking the Hereafter do you strive with the worshippers. It is as if I see you detained between Paradise and the Fire. O self, do you not feel shame!" And al-Hasan said: "No unruly mount is in greater need of a firm bridle than your self."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh al-Razi said: Strive against your soul with the swords of discipline. And discipline is of four aspects: restriction in food, reduction in sleep, sparing in speech, and enduring harm from all people. From scant food, the death of desires is born; from scant sleep, the purity of intentions; from scant speech, safety from calamities; and from enduring harm, attainment of the ultimate goals. Nothing is harder upon a servant than forbearance in the face of harshness and patience in enduring harm. And when from the soul stirs the desire for lusts and sins, and from it surges the sweetness of superfluous speech, then draw the swords of scant food from the sheath of night vigil and scant sleep, and strike it with the hands of stillness and scant speech, until it desists from oppression and vengeance. Thus, you become secure from its sudden assaults among all people, and you purify it from the darkness of its lusts, so you are saved from the perils of its calamities. Then it becomes at that point clean and luminous, light and spiritual, roaming in the field of good deeds and traversing the paths of obedience like a galloping horse in the arena and like a king strolling in the garden.

He also said: The enemies of man are three: his world, his devil, and his soul. So guard against the world by renouncing it, against the devil by opposing him, and against the soul by abandoning lusts.

One of the wise said: Whoever is overpowered by his soul becomes a captive in the love of its lusts, confined in the prison of its caprice, overpowered and bound, its reins in its hand, dragging him wherever it wills, thus preventing his heart from benefits.

Ja'far ibn Hamid said: The scholars and the wise have unanimously agreed that bliss is not attained except by abandoning comfort.

Abu Yahya al-Warraq said: Whoever satisfies the limbs with lusts has planted in his heart the tree of regrets.

Wahb ibn al-Ward said: Whatever exceeds bread is desire. He also said: Whoever loves the lusts of the world, let him prepare for humiliation.

It is narrated that the wife of al-‘Azīz said to Joseph, peace be upon him—after he had been given mastery over the treasuries of the earth and she had positioned herself for him upon a raised part of the road on the day of his procession, while he was riding amidst about twelve thousand of the nobles of his kingdom—"Glory be to the One who makes kings slaves through disobedience and makes slaves kings through their obedience to Him. Verily, greed and lust have made kings slaves, and that is the recompense of the corrupt; and verily, patience and God-consciousness have made slaves kings." Then Joseph said—as God, the Exalted, has informed us concerning him—"Indeed, whoever is conscious of God and is patient, then surely God does not allow the reward of the virtuous to be lost."

Junayd said: I stayed awake one night and rose for my litany, but did not find the sweetness I used to find. I wished to sleep but could not, so I sat but could not bear sitting. I went out, and there was a man wrapped in a cloak, lying on the road. When he sensed me, he said: “O Abu al-Qasim, until this hour?” I said: “O my master, without an appointment?” He said: “Yes, I asked God, mighty and glorious, to stir your heart toward me.” I said: “He has done so—what is your need?” He said: “When will the soul’s ailment become its remedy?” I replied: “When the soul opposes its own caprice.” He turned to his own soul and said: “Listen! I have answered you with this seven times, but you refused to hear it except from Junayd. Now you have heard it.” Then he departed, and I did not know who he was.

Yazid al-Raqashi said: “Keep away from me the cool water of this world, lest I be deprived of it in the Hereafter.”

A man asked ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, may God have mercy on him: “When should I speak?” He said: “When you desire silence.” He asked: “When should I remain silent?” He said: “When you desire to speak.”

‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: “Whoever yearns for Paradise turns away from worldly desires.”

Malik ibn Dinar would walk about, and if he saw something he desired, he would say to his soul: “Be patient, for by God, I only restrain you out of my esteem for you.”

Thus, scholars and sages have unanimously agreed that there is no path to the happiness of the Hereafter except by restraining the soul from caprice and opposing base desires; therefore, faith in this is obligatory. As for the detailed knowledge of which desires are to be abandoned and which are not, it cannot be attained except through what we have previously set forth. The essence and secret of spiritual discipline is that the soul should not indulge in anything that will not be found in the grave, except to the extent of necessity. Thus, one should restrict oneself in eating, intercourse, clothing, shelter, and everything one is compelled to, only to the measure of need and necessity. For if it indulges in any of these, it becomes attached and accustomed to it, so that when death comes, it longs to return to this world because of it. And none longs to return to this world except one who has no share in the Hereafter whatsoever. There is no deliverance from this except by having the heart occupied with the knowledge of God, love for Him, contemplation of Him, and devotion to Him alone. And there is no strength for this except through God. One should limit worldly matters to only what removes the obstacles to remembrance and reflection. Whoever is incapable of the full reality of this, let him draw near to it. And concerning this, people are of four kinds: a man whose heart is utterly absorbed in the remembrance of God, so he pays no heed to the world except for life’s necessities—he is among the truthful. And one does not reach this rank except through prolonged discipline and enduring patience in abstaining from desires for an extended period.

The second type is a man whose heart is wholly consumed by the world, leaving no remembrance of God Almighty in his heart except through fleeting thoughts, where he mentions Him with the tongue but not with the heart; such a one is among the doomed.

The third type is a man who engages in both worldly affairs and religion, yet the predominant force in his heart is religion. Such a person will inevitably enter the Fire, but he will swiftly be saved from it, in proportion to the dominance of the remembrance of God Almighty in his heart.

The fourth type is a person who engages in both, yet worldly matters dominate his heart. He will thus abide long in the Fire, but he will inevitably emerge from it due to the strength of the remembrance of God, exalted be He, within his heart and its firm rooting in the very core of his being, even though the remembrance of the world is dominant in his heart. O God, we seek refuge in You from Your disgrace, for You are the refuge.

Perhaps one might say that indulging in permissible pleasures is itself permissible, so how could such indulgence become a cause of remoteness from God, Exalted and Glorified? This is a feeble illusion; rather, love of this world is the root of every sin and the cause of nullifying every good deed. Even that which is permissible, when it exceeds the measure of necessity, is also of the world and a cause of remoteness—this will be elaborated in the Book of Condemning the World. Ibrahim al-Khawwas once said: I was on Mount Lukkam when I saw some pomegranates and desired them. I took one, split it open, and found it sour, so I left it and went on. Then I saw a man lying on the ground with wasps swarming over him. I said, "Peace be upon you." He replied, "And upon you be peace, O Ibrahim." I asked, "How did you know me?" He said, "Whoever knows God, Exalted and Glorified, nothing remains hidden from him." I said, "I see you have a special state with God, Exalted and Glorified; why not ask Him to protect you from these wasps?" He replied, "And I see you have a special state with God, Exalted and Glorified; why not ask Him to protect you from the craving for pomegranates? For the sting of the pomegranate is felt by a person in the Hereafter, while the sting of wasps is felt in this world." So I left him and went on. And al-Sari said: For forty years my soul has been urging me to dip a piece of bread in syrup, but I have never granted it that desire.

Therefore, the heart cannot be rectified to tread the path of the Hereafter unless one restrains oneself from indulging in what is permissible. For if the soul is not prevented from some permissible things, it will covet the forbidden. Thus, whoever wishes to guard their tongue from backbiting and idle talk must commit to silence—except for the remembrance of God and except for essential matters of religion—until the desire for speech dies within them, so that they speak only what is right. Then their silence becomes worship and their speech becomes worship. Whenever the eye becomes accustomed to casting its gaze upon every beautiful thing, it fails to guard against looking at what is unlawful, and likewise with all other desires. For the very faculty by which one desires the lawful is the same by which one desires the unlawful; the desire is one, and it is incumbent upon the servant to restrain it from the forbidden. If one does not accustom it to moderation, limiting it to necessity, it will overpower them. This is one of the permissible matters, and beyond it lie great perils, greater than this: that the soul delights in worldly pleasures, leans upon them, and finds contentment in them with arrogance and pride, until it becomes intoxicated like a drunkard who does not sober from his stupor. That delight in the world is a deadly poison that flows through the veins, expelling from the heart fear, sorrow, remembrance of death, and the terrors of the Day of Resurrection—and this is the death of the heart. God Almighty has said, "And they are content with the life of this world and feel secure therein" (Quran 10:7), and He said, "And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion" (Quran 3:185), and He said, "Know that the life of this world is but play and amusement, adornment and boasting among you, and rivalry in wealth and children" (Quran 57:20). All of this is censure of it, and we ask God for safety.

Those of firm resolve among the masters of hearts tested their hearts in the state of joy brought by the world's indulgence, and found them hardened, averse, and distant from being affected by the remembrance of God and the Final Day. They tested them in the state of sorrow and found them soft, tender, pure, and receptive to the impression of remembrance. Thus they knew that salvation lies in perpetual sorrow and distancing from the causes of joy and complacency. So they weaned their hearts from their delights and accustomed them to patience regarding their desires—both the lawful and the forbidden—and they knew that its lawful entails reckoning, its forbidden entails punishment, and its ambiguous entails reproach, which is a form of chastisement; for whoever is subjected to detailed reckoning on the plains of Resurrection has indeed been chastised. Thus they purified themselves from its torment and attained freedom and everlasting sovereignty in this world and the next by being liberated from the bondage and servitude of desires, and by finding intimacy in the remembrance of God, the Almighty, and occupying themselves with obedience to Him.

They did with the soul what is done with a falcon when intending to train it and transfer it from leaping and wildness to compliance and discipline: it is first confined in a dark chamber and its eyes are sewn shut until it is weaned from flying in the open air and forgets the accustomed nature of unrestrained freedom; then it is gently treated with meat until it becomes familiar with its keeper and grows so accustomed that when called, it responds, and whenever it hears his voice, it returns to him. Likewise, the soul does not become familiar with its Lord nor find intimacy in His remembrance except when it is first weaned from its habits through seclusion and isolation, so that hearing and sight are guarded from familiar things, and then secondly accustomed in seclusion to praise, remembrance, and supplication until intimacy with the remembrance of God, the Almighty, prevails over it as a substitute for intimacy with the world and all other desires. This is burdensome for the seeker at the beginning but becomes a source of delight in the end, like an infant weaned from the breast, which is hard for him when he cannot endure being without it for an hour—hence his crying and distress are intense during weaning, and his aversion is strong to the food offered to him instead of milk. But if milk is withheld from him outright, day by day, and his struggle in enduring it becomes great, and hunger overcomes him, he takes the food reluctantly, then it becomes natural for him. If he were returned to the breast after that, he would not revert to it; he would abandon the breast, dislike the milk, and become accustomed to solid food.

Similarly, a mount initially shies away from the saddle, bridle, and being ridden, so it is compelled to it by force, and first prevented from the freedom it was accustomed to by chains and tethers, then it becomes so familiar with it that it is left in its place and stands there without restraint. Likewise, the soul is disciplined as birds and mounts are disciplined. Its discipline is by preventing it from gazing upon, finding intimacy in, and rejoicing in the pleasures of the world—indeed, in everything that will be parted from at death, for it is said to one: Love whatever you wish, for you shall part from it. So when he knows that whoever loves something must inevitably part from it and will be wretched due to that parting, he occupies his heart with love for that which does not part from him, which is the remembrance of God, the Exalted, for that accompanies him in the grave and does not leave him. All of this is accomplished first through patience for a few days, for life is short compared to the duration of the Hereafter. There is no rational person except that he is content to endure a journey, learn a craft, or the like for a month in order to enjoy comfort for a year or a lifetime. One's entire lifespan compared to eternity is less than a month compared to the life of this world. Therefore, patience and striving are essential, for at dawn the people praise the night journey, and the blindness of slumber departs from them, as said by Ali, may God be pleased with him.

The path of striving and spiritual exercise differs for each person according to the differences in their states. The principle in it is that each one abandons that by which he finds joy from the means of this world. So whoever finds joy in wealth, status, acceptance in preaching, prestige in judgment and authority, or numerous followers in teaching and imparting benefit should first abandon that by which he finds joy. For if he is prevented from something of that and is told, "Your reward in the Hereafter is not diminished by being prevented," yet he dislikes it and is pained by it, then he is among those who rejoice in the life of this world and feel content with it, and that is ruinous for him. Then, when he abandons the causes of joy, let him seclude himself from people, withdraw alone with himself, and watch over his heart so that he occupies himself only with the remembrance of God, the Exalted, and reflection upon Him. And let him be vigilant for whatever desire or whisper appears in his soul, so that he suppresses its source whenever it manifests, for every whisper has a cause and does not vanish except by severing that cause and connection. And let him adhere to that for the rest of his life, for striving has no end except with death.

Explanation of the Signs of Good Character

Know that every person is ignorant of their own faults. When one struggles against their soul even minimally, to the point of abandoning grave sins, they may imagine that they have refined their soul, improved their character, and no longer need to strive. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the signs of good character. For good character is faith, and bad character is hypocrisy. God Almighty has mentioned the attributes of the believers and the hypocrites in His Book, and these, in their totality, are the fruit of good and bad character. So let us present a summary of these so that you may know the signs of good character.

God Almighty said: "Successful indeed are the believers, who are humble in their prayer, and who turn away from idle talk..." up to His words: "It is they who will be the inheritors." And He, the Exalted, said: "Those who repent, those who worship, those who praise..." up to His words: "And give glad tidings to the believers." And He, the Exalted, said: "The believers are only those whose hearts tremble when God is mentioned..." up to His words: "It is they who are the true believers." And He, the Exalted, said: "And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say words of peace..." to the end of the chapter. Whoever is uncertain of their own state, let them measure themselves against these verses. The presence of all these attributes is a sign of good character, their complete absence is a sign of bad character, and the presence of some but not others indicates a corresponding partiality. Therefore, let one strive to acquire what is lacking and preserve what is found.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, described the believer with many attributes, all of which point to noble character. He said: "The believer loves for his brother what he loves for himself." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him honor his guest." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him honor his neighbor." And he said: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent." He indicated that the attributes of the believers are good character, saying: "The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best of them in character." And he, peace be upon him, said: "When you see a believer who is quiet and dignified, draw near to him, for he bestows wisdom." And he said: "He who is pleased by his good deed and displeased by his evil deed is a believer." And he, peace be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for a believer to frighten another believer." And he, peace be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for a Muslim to frighten a Muslim." And he, peace be upon him, said: "When two people sit together, they do so under the trust of God, the Mighty and Majestic, so it is not lawful for one of them to disclose about his brother something he dislikes."

Some have summarized the signs of good character, saying: It is that one be abundant in modesty, minimal in harm, abundant in rectitude, truthful in speech, sparing in talk, abundant in action, minimal in error, minimal in meddling, dutiful and maintaining ties, dignified, patient, grateful, content, wise, gentle, chaste, compassionate—not given to cursing, nor to insulting, nor to tale-bearing, nor to backbiting, nor hasty, nor resentful, nor stingy, nor envious—but cheerful and genial, loving for the sake of God, hating for the sake of God, pleased for the sake of God, and angered for the sake of God. This, then, is good character.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked about the sign of the believer and the hypocrite, and he said: "Indeed, the believer's concern is for prayer, fasting, and worship, while the hypocrite's concern is for food and drink, like a beast." Hatim al-Asamm said: The believer is occupied with reflection and taking heed, while the hypocrite is occupied with greed and hope. The believer despairs of everyone except God, while the hypocrite hopes in everyone except God. The believer feels secure from everyone except God, while the hypocrite fears everyone except God. The believer gives precedence to his wealth over his religion, while the hypocrite gives precedence to his religion over his wealth. The believer does good and weeps, while the hypocrite does evil and laughs. The believer loves solitude and being alone, while the hypocrite loves mixing with people and crowds. The believer sows and fears corruption, while the hypocrite uproots and hopes for harvest. The believer commands and forbids for the sake of good governance, so he sets things right, while the hypocrite commands and forbids for the sake of leadership, so he corrupts.

The foremost means by which good character is tested is patience in the face of harm and enduring harsh treatment. Whoever complains of another's bad character thereby indicates his own bad character, for good character is the endurance of harm. It has been narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was walking one day with Anas when a Bedouin caught up to him and pulled him violently by his cloak—a thick Najrani cloak with a coarse trim. Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "I saw the mark of the cloak's trim on the neck of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, from the severity of the pull." The Bedouin said: "O Muhammad, give me some of God's wealth that you possess." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he be given something. And when the Quraysh increased in harming and striking him, he said: "O God, forgive my people, for they do not know." It is said this was on the day of Uhud, and for that reason God, the Exalted, revealed: "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." It is recounted that Ibrahim ibn Adham went out one day to some wilderness and was met by a soldier who said: "Are you a slave?" He said: "Yes." The soldier said to him: "Where is the inhabited area?" He pointed to the graveyard. The soldier said: "I meant the inhabited area?" He said: "It is the graveyard." This angered him, so he struck his head with a whip, wounding him, and turned him back toward the town. His companions met him and said: "What is the news?" The soldier told them what he had said to him. They said: "This is Ibrahim ibn Adham!" The soldier dismounted from his horse, kissed his hands and feet, and began to apologize to him. It was later said to Ibrahim: "Why did you say to him 'I am a slave'?" He said: "He did not ask me, 'Whose slave are you?' Rather, he said: 'Are you a slave?' So I said: 'Yes,' for I am a slave of God. When he struck my head, I asked God to grant him Paradise." It was said: "How, when he wronged you?" He said: "I knew that I would be rewarded for what I suffered from him, and I did not want my portion from him to be good while his portion from me was evil." Abu 'Uthman al-Hiri was invited to a meal—the host had intended to test him. When he reached his house, the host said to him: "I have no face [i.e., I am ashamed]." So Abu 'Uthman returned. When he had gone not far, the host called him a second time, saying: "O master, return." He returned, and the host said to him the same as his first statement, so he returned. Then he called him a third time and said: "Return, as the occasion demands." He returned, and when he reached the door, the host said the same as his first statement, so Abu 'Uthman returned. Then he came to him a fourth time and turned him away, treating him thus repeatedly, while Abu 'Uthman did not change because of it. The host fell upon his feet and said: "O master, I only intended to test you—how excellent is your character!" He said: "What you saw from me is the character of a dog, for if a dog is called, it answers, and if driven away, it withdraws." It is also narrated from him that he passed one day through an alley and a basin of ashes was thrown upon him. He dismounted from his mount, prostrated in gratitude, then began to shake the ashes from his clothes and said nothing. It was said: "Will you not rebuke them?" He said: "Whoever deserves the Fire but is reconciled with ashes has no right to be angry." It is narrated that 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, mercy of God be upon him, had a complexion leaning toward darkness—for his mother was black—and in Nishapur there was a bathhouse at the door of his residence. When he wished to enter the bath, the bath attendant would clear it for him. One day he entered, and the attendant locked the door and went off on some errand. A rustic man approached the bath door, opened it, entered, removed his clothes, and went in. He saw 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida and thought he was one of the bath servants, so he said to him: "Get up and bring me water." 'Ali ibn Musa arose and complied with all he commanded him to do. The attendant returned, saw the rustic's clothes, and heard his speech with 'Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, so he feared and fled, leaving them. When 'Ali ibn Musa came out, he asked about the attendant and was told: "He feared what had occurred and fled." He said: "He should not have fled; the fault lies with him who placed his water [i.e., his lineage] with a black slave woman." It is narrated that Abu 'Abdullah al-Khayyat would sit in his shop, and he had a Magian customer for whom he would sew. Whenever he sewed something for him, the Magian would bring him counterfeit dirhams. Abu 'Abdullah would take them from him, not informing him of this nor returning them to him. It happened one day that Abu 'Abdullah got up for some need, and the Magian came and did not find him, so he gave the payment to his apprentice and retrieved what he had sewn. It was a counterfeit dirham. When the apprentice looked at it, he recognized it as counterfeit and returned it to him. When Abu 'Abdullah returned, he was informed of this and said: "What you did was bad. This Magian has been treating me this way for a year, and I have been patient with him, taking the dirhams from him and throwing them in a well so that no Muslim would be deceived by them." Yusuf ibn Asbat said: "The signs of good character are ten traits: seldom swearing oaths, fairness in judgment, refraining from seeking out faults, putting the best construction on apparent misdeeds, seeking excuses [for others], enduring harm, attributing blame to oneself, being alone in knowing one's own faults without knowing the faults of others, a cheerful countenance toward young and old, and gentle speech to those below and above him." Sahl was asked about good character and said: "Its lowest degree is enduring harm, refraining from retaliation, having mercy on the wrongdoer, seeking forgiveness for him, and feeling compassion for him." Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays was asked: "From whom did you learn forbearance?" He said: "From Qays ibn 'Asim." It was said: "What was the extent of his forbearance?" He said: "While he was sitting in his house, a slave girl of his came to him with a skewer of roasted meat. It fell from her hand and landed on his small son, killing him. The girl was distraught, and he said to her: 'Do not be afraid; you are free for the sake of God, the Exalted.'" It is said that Uways al-Qarani, when children saw him, would throw stones at him, and he would say to them: "O my brothers, if it must be done, then throw small ones at me so you do not wound my leg and prevent me from prayer." A man insulted al-Ahnaf ibn Qays, and he did not reply but followed him. When he neared the neighborhood, he stopped and said: "If anything remains in your heart, say it now so that some foolish person of the neighborhood does not hear you and harm you." It is narrated that 'Ali, may God honor his face, called a servant, and he did not answer. He called a second and third time, and he did not answer. He went to him and found him lying down. He said: "Do you not hear, O servant?" He said: "Yes." He said: "What caused you to neglect answering me?" He said: "I felt secure from your punishment, so I was lazy." He said: "Go, for you are free for the sake of God, the Exalted." A woman said to Malik ibn Dinar, mercy of God be upon him: "O hypocrite!" He said: "O woman, you have found the name which the people of Basra have lost for me." Yahya ibn Ziyad al-Harithi had a bad servant, and it was said to him: "Why do you keep him?" He said: "To learn forbearance through him."

These souls have been humbled through spiritual discipline, so their character traits have become balanced, and their inner selves have been purified from deceit, rancor, and malice. Thus, they have borne the fruit of contentment with all that God, the Exalted, has decreed—and this is the ultimate excellence of character. For whoever dislikes the act of God and is not content with it, that is the extreme of bad character. Thus, in these individuals, the signs have become manifest in their outward states, as we have mentioned. Whoever does not find these signs within themselves should not be deceived by their own soul into presuming they possess good character. Rather, they ought to occupy themselves with spiritual discipline and striving until they attain the rank of excellent character, for it is a lofty rank attained only by those brought near and the truthful.

Explanation of the Method in the Spiritual Training of Children

At the beginning of their upbringing and in the manner of disciplining them and refining their character.

Know that the method of disciplining children is among the most important and essential matters. Children are a trust placed with their parents, and their pure heart is a precious, unblemished jewel, free from every engraving and image. It is receptive to whatever is inscribed upon it and inclined toward whatever it is swayed toward. If he is accustomed to good and taught it, he will grow up upon it and prosper in this world and the next, and his father, along with every teacher and mentor, will share in his reward. But if he is accustomed to evil and neglected like cattle, he will be wretched and ruined, and the burden will be upon the neck of the guardian responsible for him. God Almighty has said, "O you who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire." If a father protects his child from the fire of this world, how much more fitting is it that he protect him from the Fire of the Hereafter. His protection lies in disciplining him, refining him, teaching him noble character, guarding him from bad companions, and not accustoming him to luxury, nor making adornment and comfort beloved to him, lest he waste his life seeking them when he grows up and thus perish eternally.

Rather, one must watch over him from the very beginning, employing for his nursing and breastfeeding only a religious woman who eats what is lawful, for milk produced from the unlawful contains no blessing. When the child's growth is founded upon it, his very nature is kneaded from impurity, and his disposition inclines toward what corresponds to foul things. Whenever signs of discernment appear in him, he should be carefully supervised. The first of these is the emergence of the beginnings of modesty, for when he feels bashful, is ashamed, and refrains from certain actions, it is only due to the dawning light of intellect upon him, so that he sees some things as ugly and contrary to others, and thus becomes ashamed of one thing but not another. This is a gift from God Almighty to him and a glad tiding indicating sound character and purity of heart; it heralds the perfection of his intellect upon reaching maturity. A modest child should not be neglected; rather, his modesty and discernment should be utilized in his upbringing.

Among the first traits that dominate him is greed for food, so he must be disciplined regarding it: such as not taking food except with his right hand, saying "In the name of God" when taking it, eating from what is nearest to him, not rushing to food before others, not staring intently at the food or at those eating, not eating hastily, chewing well, not taking consecutive bites, not soiling his hand or his garment, and being accustomed to eating plain bread at times so that he does not come to see condiments as a necessity. He should be taught to view excessive eating as ugly by comparing everyone who eats excessively to animals, and by criticizing in his presence a child who eats much while praising a well-mannered child who eats little. He should be taught to love preferring others with food, to care little for it, and to be content with coarse food, whatever it may be. He should be taught to prefer white garments over colored ones and silk, and it should be established for him that such is the way of women and the effeminate, and that men disdain it; this should be repeated to him. Whenever he sees a child wearing a silk or colored garment, he should express disapproval and criticize it. The child should be guarded from children accustomed to luxury and comfort and wearing fine garments, and from associating with anyone who tells him things that would make him desire them, for if a child is neglected at the beginning of his growth, he will most often emerge with bad character: a liar, envious, a talebearer, insistent, given to jesting, laughter, cunning, and frivolity. He is only protected from all that by good discipline.

Then he should be occupied in the school, learning the Quran, reports of the traditions, and stories of the righteous and their states, so that love for the righteous becomes implanted in his soul. He should be guarded from poems that mention passion and its people, and from associating with men of letters who claim that such is part of refinement and delicacy of nature, for that plants the seeds of corruption in the hearts of children.

Whenever a child displays a noble character or a praiseworthy deed, he should be honored for it and rewarded in a manner that brings him joy and earns him praise among people. If he deviates from this on occasion, even once, it is advisable to overlook it, not expose his fault, nor confront him openly, nor let him perceive that anyone would dare to do such a thing—especially if the child conceals it and strives to hide it; for revealing it to him might embolden him to the point of disregarding exposure. If he repeats it a second time, then he should be admonished privately, the matter should be emphasized, and he should be told: "Beware of doing this again, lest you be discovered in such an act and become disgraced among people." Do not constantly admonish him with excessive words, for it will make him heedless of reproach and accustomed to committing vile deeds, and the impact of words will lose its effect on his heart. The father should maintain the awe of his words, reprimanding him only occasionally, while the mother should caution him with the father and deter him from misdeeds.

He should be prevented from sleeping during the day, as it breeds laziness, but not from sleeping at night. However, he should be kept from soft bedding so that his limbs may strengthen and his body not grow plump, lest he become unable to endure hardship; rather, he should be accustomed to roughness in bedding, clothing, and food. He should be prevented from anything he does in secret, for he only hides it believing it to be vile. If he refrains, he becomes accustomed to avoiding vile actions. He should be accustomed to walking, movement, and exercise during part of the day so that laziness does not overcome him. He should be taught not to expose his limbs, nor walk hastily, nor let his hands hang loose but rather keep them close to his chest.

He should be prevented from boasting to his peers about anything his parents possess, or about his food, clothing, slate, or inkwell. Instead, he should be taught humility and respect for all his companions, and gentleness in speech with them. He should be prevented from taking anything from other children out of shame if he is from a respectable family; rather, he should learn that nobility lies in giving, not in taking, and that taking is base, lowly, and ignoble. If he is from a poor family, he should learn that greed and taking are degrading and humiliating, and that such behavior is akin to that of a dog, which wags its tail in anticipation of a morsel and covets it.

In summary, it is unseemly for children to love gold and silver or to covet them, and they should be warned against these more than they are warned against snakes and scorpions. For the affliction of loving gold and silver and coveting them is more harmful to children—indeed, even to adults—than the affliction of poisons. He should be accustomed not to spit in his sitting place, nor to clean his nose, nor to yawn in the presence of others, nor to turn his back to another, nor to place one leg over the other, nor to rest his chin on his palm, nor to support his head with his forearm, for these are signs of laziness. He should be taught the manner of sitting and restrained from excessive speech, and it should be made clear to him that this indicates insolence and is the behavior of base-born children. He should be entirely forbidden from swearing—whether truthfully or falsely—so that he does not become accustomed to it in childhood. He should be prevented from initiating speech and accustomed to speak only in response and to the extent of the question, and to listen attentively whenever someone older than him speaks, and to rise for his superior, make room for him, and sit before him. He should be restrained from idle and foul speech, from cursing and insulting, and from keeping company with those whose tongues engage in such, for this inevitably spreads from evil companions. The foundation of disciplining children is protecting them from evil companions. When the teacher strikes him, he should not cry out or make much noise, nor seek intercession from anyone; rather, he should endure patiently, and it should be reminded to him that this is the way of the brave and men, while excessive crying is the way of slaves and women. After leaving school, he should be permitted to engage in wholesome play to relax from the fatigue of study, provided he does not become exhausted in play. For preventing a child from play and constantly burdening him with learning deadens his heart, dulls his intelligence, and makes life bitter for him, until he seeks a way to escape it altogether. He should be taught obedience to his parents, his teacher, his tutor, and anyone older than him—whether relative or stranger—and to regard them with eyes of reverence and honor, and to refrain from playing in their presence. Once he reaches the age of discernment, he should not be excused from neglecting purification and prayer, and he should be commanded to fast on some days of Ramadan. He should be kept from wearing silk brocade, silk, and gold, and taught everything he needs from the boundaries of the Sacred Law.

He warns against theft, consuming the forbidden, treachery, lying, obscenity, and all that commonly overcomes children. If the upbringing is sound in childhood, then as he nears maturity, it becomes possible to acquaint him with the secrets of these matters. He is reminded that foods are medicines, and their purpose is solely to strengthen a person for the obedience of God, Mighty and Majestic is He; that this entire world has no true foundation, for it has no permanence; that death cuts off its pleasures; that it is a passage, not a permanent abode; that the Hereafter is a permanent abode, not a passage; that death is awaited at every moment; and that the intelligent, prudent one is he who provisions himself from this world for the Hereafter, so that his rank may be exalted with God, Exalted is He, and his bliss expanded in the Gardens. If the upbringing is righteous, this discourse at the age of maturity will be impactful, effective, and penetrating, settling in his heart as an inscription settles in stone. But if the upbringing is otherwise, such that the child becomes accustomed to play, obscenity, insolence, greed for food and clothing, adornment, and boastfulness, then his heart will recoil from accepting the truth as a wall recoils from dry earth. Thus, the initial stages are what must be observed, for the child is by essence created receptive to both good and evil, and it is his parents who incline him to one of the two sides. He (the Prophet) said, "Every child is born upon the natural disposition; it is his parents who make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Magian." Sahl ibn ‘Abd Allāh al-Tustarī said: "When I was three years old, I would stay up at night observing the prayer of my uncle, Muḥammad ibn Sawwār. One day he said to me, 'Will you not remember God, who created you?' I said, 'How should I remember Him?' He said, 'Say in your heart, when you turn in your bed three times, without moving your tongue with it: "God is with me, God is watching over me, God is witnessing me."' I said that for several nights, then informed him. He said, 'Say it seven times every night.' I said that, then informed him. He said, 'Say it eleven times every night.' I said it, and its sweetness settled in my heart. After a year, my uncle said to me, 'Guard what I have taught you and persist in it until you enter the grave, for it will benefit you in this world and the next.' I remained upon that for years and found a sweetness for it in my innermost being. Then my uncle said to me one day, 'O Sahl, one with whom God is, who is watching over him and witnessing him—would he disobey Him? Beware of disobedience.' I would seclude myself, then they sent me to the school. I said, 'I fear my concern will become divided, but stipulate with the teacher that I go to him for a time to learn, then return.' I went to the school, learned the Qur’an, and memorized it when I was six or seven years old. I would fast continuously, and my sustenance was barley bread for twelve years. An issue occurred to me when I was thirteen, so I asked my family to send me to the people of Basra to ask about it. I came to Basra and asked its scholars, but none satisfied me with anything. I went out to ‘Abbādān to a man known as Abū Ḥabīb Ḥamzah ibn Abī ‘Abd Allāh al-‘Abbādānī and asked him about it, and he answered me. I stayed with him for a period, benefiting from his speech and being refined by his manners. Then I returned to Tustar and made my sustenance economical, such that a *farq* of barley was bought for me for a dirham, ground, and baked for me. I would break my fast at the pre-dawn hour with an ounce every night, with nothing but water, without salt or condiment. That dirham would suffice me for a year. Then I resolved to fast three nights, then break my fast for a night; then five nights; then seven nights; then twenty-five nights. I remained upon that for twenty years. Then I went out wandering the earth for years, then returned to Tustar, and I would stand in prayer the entire night, as God, Exalted is He, willed." Aḥmad said: "I never saw him eat salt until he met God, Exalted is He."

Explanation of the Conditions of Will and the Preliminaries of Spiritual Striving

And the gradual progression of the seeker in traversing the path of spiritual discipline.

Know that whoever witnesses the Hereafter with the heart through a vision of certainty inevitably becomes one who desires the cultivation of the Hereafter, yearns for it, treads its paths, and holds the pleasures and delights of this world in contempt. For if someone possesses a bead and then beholds a precious gem, he retains no desire for the bead and his resolve to sell it for the gem becomes strong. But whoever does not desire the cultivation of the Hereafter nor seeks the meeting with God Almighty—that is due to a lack of faith in God and the Last Day—and I do not mean by faith mere inner speech or the movement of the tongue with the two testimonies without sincerity and truthfulness. For that resembles the statement of one who affirms that the gem is better than the bead, yet knows nothing of the gem except its name, while its reality remains unknown to him. Such an affirmant, if accustomed to the bead, may not abandon it, nor will his longing for the gem become great. Thus, the barrier to attainment is the absence of spiritual wayfaring; the barrier to wayfaring is the absence of resolve; and the barrier to resolve is the absence of faith. The cause of the absence of faith is the scarcity of guides, admonishers, and scholars of God Almighty who direct to His path and awaken others to the insignificance and transience of this world and the greatness and permanence of the Hereafter. So mankind is heedless, immersed in their desires and sunk in their slumber, and among the scholars of religion there is none to rouse them. If one among them does awaken, he is unable to tread the path due to his ignorance. If he seeks the path from the scholars, he finds them inclined toward caprice and deviating from the way. Thus, weakness of resolve, ignorance of the path, and the scholars’ utterance of caprice become reasons for the path of God Almighty to be deserted by wayfarers. Whenever the sought is concealed, the guide is lost, caprice prevails, and the seeker is heedless, attainment is inevitably prevented and the paths are rendered impassable. If someone awakens—whether from within himself or through the admonition of another—and a resolve is stirred within him for the cultivation and commerce of the Hereafter, then he must know that there are conditions which must be presented at the outset of resolve, a support to which he must cling, and a fortress in which he must take refuge to be safe from the enemies who cut off his path, and there are duties he must constantly uphold during the time of wayfaring.

As for the conditions that must be presented at the outset of resolve, they are the removal of the barrier and the veil that stand between him and the Truth. For the deprivation of creation from the Truth is due to the accumulation of veils and the placement of a barrier upon the path. God Almighty has said, “And We have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and We have covered them, so they do not see.”

The barrier between the seeker and the Truth is fourfold: wealth, status, blind imitation, and sin. The veil of wealth is only lifted by its departure from his possession, such that nothing remains for him except the measure of necessity. As long as a single dirham remains to which he turns his attention, he is bound by it and veiled from God, the Almighty and Majestic. The veil of status is only lifted by distancing oneself from the place of status through humility, preferring obscurity, fleeing from the causes of renown, and undertaking actions that repel the hearts of creation from him. The veil of blind imitation is only lifted by abandoning fanaticism for schools of thought and by believing in the meaning of "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the Messenger of God" with the conviction of faith. He must strive to realize its truth by removing every object of worship besides God the Exalted—and the greatest object of worship is one's own desire—until, when this is done, the true reality of the matter in the meaning of his belief, which he had merely received through imitation, is unveiled to him. He should seek the unveiling of this through spiritual struggle, not through disputation. For if fanaticism for his belief overcomes him and no room remains in his soul for anything else, this becomes a shackle and a veil for him, as it is not a condition for the seeker to belong to a specific school of thought at all. As for sin, it is a veil, and nothing lifts it except repentance: departing from injustices, firmly resolving to not return, truly regretting what has passed, restoring rights to those wronged, and appeasing adversaries. For whoever does not make his repentance sound and does not abandon outward sins, yet wishes to perceive the mysteries of religion through unveiling, is like one who wishes to perceive the mysteries of the Quran and its interpretation while he has not yet learned the language of the Arabs. For the translation of the Quran's Arabic must necessarily be presented first, then one ascends from it to the mysteries of its meanings. Likewise, the Sacred Law must necessarily be rectified first and last, then one ascends to its depths and mysteries.

When one fulfills these four conditions and divests oneself of wealth and status, one becomes like a person who has purified oneself, performed ablution, and removed impurity, thus becoming fit for prayer. Such a person then needs an imam to follow. Similarly, the seeker inevitably requires a shaykh and master to emulate, so that he may guide him to the straight path. For the path of religion is obscure, while the paths of Satan are many and manifest. Whoever lacks a shaykh to guide him will inevitably be led by Satan onto his ways. Thus, whoever traverses the perilous deserts without a guide risks his own soul and destroys it. The one who relies solely on himself is like a tree that grows on its own: it withers quickly, and even if it lasts a while and sprouts leaves, it bears no fruit. Therefore, after fulfilling the mentioned conditions, the seeker’s refuge is his shaykh. Let him hold fast to him as a blind man clings to his guide on the riverbank, entrusting his affair to him completely, without opposing him in his coming or going, leaving nothing in following him undone. Let him know that his benefit in the shaykh’s error is greater than his benefit in his own correctness, even if he were right. When such a refuge is found, it becomes incumbent upon the one seeking refuge to protect and shield him within a strong fortress that wards off the highway robbers, which are four matters: seclusion, silence, hunger, and vigil. This is a fortification against the interceptors, for the aim of the seeker is to rectify his heart so that through it he may witness his Lord and become fit for His proximity.

As for hunger, it diminishes the blood of the heart and whitens it, and in its whiteness lies its light; it melts the fat of the inner heart, and in its melting lies its tenderness. This tenderness is the key to spiritual unveiling, just as its hardness is the cause of veiling. Whenever the blood of the heart diminishes, the passage of the enemy narrows, for its channels are the veins filled with desires. Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "O company of disciples, empty your bellies so that your hearts may see your Lord!" And Sahl ibn ‘Abdullah al-Tustari said: "The saints became saints only through four traits: through hollowing the bellies, vigil, silence, and seclusion from people." The benefit of hunger in illuminating the heart is a manifest matter, attested by experience, and the manner of its gradual application will be explained in the Book of Breaking the Two Desires.

As for vigil, it polishes the heart, purifies it, and illuminates it. This is then added to the purity attained from hunger, so it becomes like a brilliant star and a polished mirror, wherein the beauty of the Truth becomes manifest. In it, one witnesses the sublime degrees of the Hereafter and the baseness and afflictions of this world. Thereby, his aversion to the world and his turning toward the Hereafter are perfected. Vigil is also a consequence of hunger, for vigil with satiety is not possible. Sleep hardens the heart and deadens it, unless it is out of sheer necessity, in which case it becomes a cause for the unveiling of the unseen's secrets. It has been said in describing the *Abdāl* (the righteous substitutes): "Their eating is out of need, their sleep is out of overpowering drowsiness, and their speech is out of necessity." And Ibrāhīm al-Khawwāṣ, may God have mercy on him, said: "The consensus of seventy righteous saints was that excessive sleep results from excessive drinking of water."

As for silence, it is facilitated by seclusion, yet the recluse cannot avoid encountering someone who provides his food and drink and manages his affairs. Thus, one should speak only to the extent of necessity, for speech distracts the heart, and the heart's craving for speech is immense. Indeed, the heart finds relief in it and feels burdened by the austerity of remembrance and contemplation, so it seeks solace in speech. Silence fertilizes the intellect, brings about piety, and teaches God-consciousness.

As for the life of seclusion, its benefit lies in repelling distractions and restraining hearing and sight, for they are the vestibule of the heart. The heart is, in effect, like a basin into which foul, turbid, and filthy waters flow from the rivers of the senses. The aim of spiritual discipline is to empty the basin of those waters and the sediment accumulated from them, so that the basin's source may gush forth, producing clean, pure water. How can one properly bail water from the basin while the rivers remain open to it, constantly replenishing more than is diminished? It is essential to restrain the senses except to the degree of necessity, and this cannot be achieved except through seclusion in a dark chamber. If one has no dark place, let him wrap his head in his garment or cover himself with a cloak or waist-wrapper, for in such a state he hears the call of Truth and beholds the majesty of the Divine Presence. Do you not see that the call to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) reached him while he was in such a condition, and it was said to him, "O you wrapped in garments—O you covered [in a cloak]"?

These four are a shield and fortress by which one repels the obstacles and prevents the disruptive impediments on the path. When one does this, he then occupies himself with traversing the way. His journey consists of overcoming barriers, and there is no barrier on the path to God Almighty except the attributes of the heart whose cause is turning toward this world. Some of those barriers are greater than others. The order in overcoming them is to begin with the easiest, then the next easiest—namely, those attributes; I mean the hidden ties that were severed at the beginning of resolve, and their traces; I mean wealth, status, love of the world, preoccupation with creation, and longing for sins. One must cleanse the inward from their traces just as he cleansed the outward from their apparent causes. In this lies prolonged struggle, and it varies according to different states. For some, many attributes are already subdued, so the struggle is not prolonged for them. We have mentioned that the way of struggle is opposing desires and contradicting whims in every dominant trait of the seeker’s soul—as previously mentioned. When that is subdued or weakened through struggle and no attachment remains in his heart, he then occupies himself with a remembrance that adheres to his heart perpetually and prevents him from multiplying outward litanies. Rather, he limits himself to obligatory duties and regular practices, and his litany becomes a single one. This is the essence and fruit of litanies; I mean the heart’s constant remembrance of God Almighty after being emptied of remembrance of anything else. He should not occupy himself with it as long as his heart is turned toward his attachments. Al-Shibli said to Al-Husri: “If anything other than God Almighty crosses your heart from the Friday you come to me until the next Friday, then it is forbidden for you to come to me.” This detachment is not attained except with sincere resolve and the dominance of love for God Almighty over the heart, until one becomes like a heedless lover who has no concern but one. When he is thus, the shaykh assigns him a secluded corner to be alone in and appoints someone to provide him with a minimal amount of lawful sustenance, for the foundation of the religious path is lawful provision. Then, the shaykh teaches him a remembrance from the remembrances until his tongue and heart are occupied with it. He sits and says, for example, “Allah, Allah,” or “Glory be to God, Glory be to God,” or whatever words the shaykh sees fit. He persists in it until the movement of the tongue ceases and the word flows on the tongue without motion. Then he persists until the trace vanishes from the tongue and the form of the utterance remains in the heart. Then he continues until the letters and form of the utterance are erased from the heart, and the true meaning remains, adhering to the heart, present with it, dominating it, having emptied it of all else. For when the heart is occupied with something, it becomes empty of everything else—whatever it may be. So when it is occupied with the remembrance of God Almighty, which is the aim, it inevitably becomes empty of all else. At that point, he must monitor the whisperings of the heart and thoughts related to the world, and whatever memories arise of his past states or those of others. For whenever he repels all whisperings and returns the soul to this word, whisperings come to him about this word itself: What is it? What is the meaning of our saying “Allah”? For what reason is He God and worshipped? At that time, thoughts assail him that open the door of reflection, and perhaps whisperings from Satan come to him that are disbelief and innovation. As long as he is averse to that and strives to remove it from his heart, it will not harm him. These are divided into what one knows with certainty that God Almighty is exalted above, but Satan casts it into his heart and runs it through his mind. His condition is that he should disregard it and flee to the remembrance of God Almighty, beseeching Him to repel it from him, as God Almighty said: “And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing.” And He said: “Indeed, those who fear Allah—when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight.” And as for what he doubts, he should present it to his shaykh. Indeed, everything he finds in his heart of states—whether lethargy, vigor, turning to an attachment, or sincerity in resolve—he should disclose to his shaykh and conceal from others, letting no one know of it. Then his shaykh examines his condition and contemplates his intelligence and acumen. If he knows that if he leaves him and commands him to reflect, he will awaken on his own to the reality of the Truth, then he should direct him to reflection and command him to adhere to it until a light is cast into his heart that unveils its reality to him. If he knows that this is beyond his capacity, he returns him to decisive belief through admonition that his heart can bear and evidence close to his understanding. It is essential that the shaykh be meticulous and gentle with him, for these are the perils of the path and places of its dangers. How many a seeker has engaged in spiritual discipline, only to be overcome by a corrupt fantasy he could not unveil, so his path was cut off and he occupied himself with idleness and took the path of permissiveness? That is the great ruin. Whoever devotes himself to remembrance and repels the distracting attachments from his heart is not free from such thoughts, for he has embarked on a ship of danger. If he is saved, he is among the kings of religion; if he errs, he is among the ruined.

Therefore, it is said, "Adhere to the religion of the elderly women," which means embracing the foundation of faith and the outward aspects of belief through imitation and engaging in righteous deeds, for the danger in deviating from this is great. Hence, it is said that the spiritual guide must discern the aptitude of the disciple. If the disciple is not intelligent, perceptive, and firmly grounded in outward belief, the guide should not occupy him with remembrance and contemplation, but rather return him to outward acts and regularly practiced litanies, or engage him in serving those devoted to contemplation so that he may be encompassed by their blessings. For one incapable of striving in the ranks of combat should water the troops and tend to their mounts, so that on the Day of Resurrection he may be resurrected among their company and enveloped by their blessings, even if he does not attain their rank. As for the disciple devoted to remembrance and contemplation, he may be hindered by many obstacles, such as pride, ostentation, and delight in the spiritual states that are unveiled to him or the initial signs of miracles. Whenever he turns his attention to any of these and his soul becomes preoccupied with them, it becomes a weakening in his path and a halt. Rather, he should adhere to his state throughout his entire life, like the thirst that is not quenched by oceans even if poured upon him, and he must persist in this. His capital is detachment from creation for the sake of the Truth and seclusion.

One of the spiritual wayfarers said: I asked one of the devoted saints who had withdrawn from creation, "What is the path to true realization?" He replied, "To be in the world as if you are a passerby on a road." And on another occasion I said to him, "Guide me to a practice in which I may find my heart constantly with God, exalted be He." He said to me, "Do not look upon creation, for looking upon them is darkness." I said, "I cannot avoid that." He said, "Then do not listen to their speech, for their speech is harshness." I said, "I cannot avoid that." He said, "Then do not interact with them, for interacting with them is desolation." I said, "I am among them; I cannot avoid interacting with them." He said, "Then do not find rest in them, for finding rest in them is ruin." I said, "This is difficult." He said, "O you! Do you look upon the heedless, listen to the speech of the ignorant, interact with the idle, and yet desire to find your heart constantly with God, exalted be He? That will never come to pass."

Thus, the ultimate aim of spiritual discipline is for one's heart to abide perpetually with God Almighty, and this cannot be attained except by becoming empty of all else. One cannot become empty of all else except through prolonged struggle. When his heart attains to God, the majesty of the Divine Presence is unveiled to him, the Truth is manifested, and subtleties of decisive insights become apparent to him, such that he speaks with admonition and sincere counsel and undertakes to remind others. Then he finds in this a delight beyond which there is no delight. That delight then urges him to ponder how to convey those meanings, to beautify the expressions that convey them, to arrange their mention, and to adorn them with narratives, proofs from the Qur'an and traditions, and to refine the art of speech so that hearts and ears may incline to it. Perhaps Satan then deludes him into imagining that this is you reviving the hearts of the dead who are heedless of God Almighty, whereas you are merely an intermediary between God Almighty and creation, calling His servants to Him, having no share in it for yourself, nor any delight for your own soul. Satan's guile becomes clear when there appears among his peers one whose speech is more beautiful, whose expression is more eloquent, and who is more capable of attracting the hearts of the common folk. For then, if his motive was the guile of seeking acceptance, the scorpion of envy will inevitably stir within his inner being. But if his motive was the Truth, out of eagerness to call the servants of God Almighty to His straight path, then his joy is magnified, and he says: "Praise be to God who has strengthened and supported me with one who assists me in reforming His servants." It is like one upon whom it became obligatory, for example, to carry a dead body for burial when he found it abandoned and it was religiously incumbent upon him to do so; if someone came to assist him in it, he would rejoice and not envy the one who helps him. The heedless are the dead of heart, and the preachers are those who awaken and revive them. In their multitude there is relief and mutual support, so one should greatly rejoice in that. This, however, is exceedingly rare in existence. Therefore, the seeker must be wary of it, for it is the greatest of Satan's snares in cutting off the path for one who has had the beginnings of the path opened to him. Indeed, preferring the life of this world is a dominant trait in man, and for this reason God Almighty said: "Nay, but you prefer the life of this world." Then He made clear that evil is ancient in human nature and that this is mentioned in the previous scriptures, saying: "Indeed, this is in the former scrolls, the scrolls of Abraham and Moses." This, then, is the method of disciplining the seeker and gradually nurturing him toward the meeting with God Almighty. As for the detailed discipline concerning each trait, it will come later, for the traits most prevalent in man are his belly and his private part—meaning the lusts related to them—then anger, which is like an army for protecting those lusts. Then, whenever a man loves the lust of the belly and private part and finds comfort in them, he loves the world, and he cannot attain it except through wealth and status. When he seeks wealth and status, pride, vanity, and love of leadership arise in him. When that appears, his soul does not consent to abandon the world outright, and he clings to that part of religion in which there is leadership, and self-deception overcomes him. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us, after presenting these two books, to complete the Quarter of the Destructive Traits with eight books, God willing: a book on breaking the lust of the belly and private part; a book on the harms of the tongue; a book on breaking anger, malice, and envy; a book on dispraising the world and detailing its deceptions; a book on breaking the love of wealth and dispraising miserliness; a book on dispraising ostentation and love of status; a book on dispraising pride and vanity; and a book on the occasions of self-deception. By mentioning these destructive traits and teaching the methods of treating them, our purpose in the Quarter of the Destructive Traits will be completed, God willing. For what we mentioned in the first book is an explanation of the traits of the heart, which is the mine of destructive and saving traits, and what we mentioned in the second book is a general indication of the way to refine character and treat the diseases of the heart. As for their details, they will come in these books, God willing.

The Book of Disciplining the Soul and Refining Morals is completed by the praise of God and His aid and His gracious enabling. It will be followed, if God Most High wills, by the Book of Breaking the Two Appetites. And praise be to God alone, and may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and his companions, and upon every chosen servant from among the people of the earth and the heavens. My success is not but from God; in Him I place my trust and to Him I turn.
