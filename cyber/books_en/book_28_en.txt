The Book on the Condemnation of Worldly Status and Ostentation

This is the eighth book of the Quarter of the Perilous Matters from the work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, the Knower of the unseen, the One who perceives the secrets of hearts, the One who pardons major sins, the Knower of what consciences conceal from the hidden mysteries, the All-Seeing of the secrets of intentions and the hidden depths of inner states, who accepts from deeds only what is complete and fulfilled, and purified from the taints of ostentation and polytheism, made sincere. For He is the Unique Sovereign of the dominion, and He is the Most Self-Sufficient of the self-sufficient, beyond any need for partners. And blessings and peace be upon Muhammad and his family and his companions, who are absolved of treachery and falsehood, and abundant salutations.

Now then: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, the thing I fear most for my community is ostentation and the hidden desire that is more concealed than the crawling of a black ant upon a solid rock in a dark night." For this reason, even the brokers among the scholars have been unable to stand guard against its perils, let alone the common worshippers and the pious. It is among the final perils of the soul and the innermost of its snares. Only the scholars, the worshippers, and those who roll up their sleeves in earnest to tread the path of the Hereafter are afflicted by it. For whenever they subdue their souls, struggle against them, wean them from desires, protect them from dubious matters, and compel them by force to perform various acts of worship, their souls become incapable of coveting the outward sins that occur through the limbs. They then seek relief in displaying goodness and manifesting deeds and knowledge. Thus, they find an escape from the hardship of struggle to the pleasure of acceptance among creation and being viewed with eyes of reverence and honor. They hasten to display obedience and contrive to make creation aware, not content with the awareness of the Creator. They rejoice in the praise of people, not content with the praise of God alone. They know that if people become aware of their abandoning desires, avoiding suspicions, and enduring the hardships of worship, they will unleash their tongues in praise and commendation, exaggerate in eulogy and acclaim, look upon them with eyes of veneration and respect, seek blessing in their sight and meeting, desire the blessing of their supplication, strive to follow their opinion, greet them with service and salutations, honor them in gatherings to the utmost degree, show leniency in buying and transactions, give them precedence in assemblies, favor them with food and clothing, humble themselves before them in submission, and yield to their purposes with respect. The soul thereby attains a pleasure that is the greatest of pleasures and a desire that is the most overpowering of desires. It then belittles the abandonment of sins and faults, and the harshness of persistence in acts of worship becomes softened for it, as it perceives inwardly the pleasure of pleasures and the desire of desires. He thinks that his life is for God and with His sickly worship, but his life is actually with this hidden desire that even penetrating, powerful intellects are blinded from perceiving. He sees himself as sincere in obeying God and avoiding God's prohibitions, while the soul has concealed this desire, adorning it for the worshippers and feigning for creation, rejoicing in the status and respect it has attained. It thereby nullifies the reward of acts of obedience and the recompense of deeds, while his name is recorded in the register of the hypocrites, though he thinks he is among those brought near to God. This is a snare of the soul from which none are safe except the truthful, and a chasm from which none ascend except those brought near. Therefore, it is said: The last thing to depart from the heads of the truthful is the love of leadership.

Since ostentation is the hidden malady that constitutes the greatest snare of the devils, it becomes obligatory to expound upon its cause, its true nature, its degrees, its categories, the methods for its treatment, and the caution required against it. The purpose of this will be made clear by arranging the book into two parts:

The First Half

On the Love of Status and Fame

This section elucidates the censure of fame and the virtue of obscurity, explains the condemnation of status and the meaning and reality of status, clarifies the reason it is loved more intensely than wealth, demonstrates that status is an illusory perfection and not a true perfection, distinguishes between praiseworthy and blameworthy love of status, and expounds the cause for loving praise and commendation while detesting censure. It further outlines the remedy for love of status, the treatment for love of praise, the cure for aversion to blame, and the varying conditions of people regarding praise and censure. These constitute twelve chapters from which the meanings of ostentation arise; thus, they must be presented first. Success comes only from God, through His grace, bounty, and generosity.

An Exposition on the Censure of Seeking Renown and the Spread of Reputation

Know, may God guide you aright, that the root of vanity is the spread of reputation and fame, and it is blameworthy. Rather, what is praiseworthy is obscurity, except for the fame granted by God Almighty for the propagation of His religion, without any striving for fame from it. Anas, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "It is enough evil for a person that people point fingers at him concerning his religion and his worldly affairs, except whom God protects." And Jabir ibn Abdullah reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A person considers it from evil—except whom God protects from harm—that people point fingers at him concerning his religion and his worldly affairs. Verily, God does not look at your forms but looks at your hearts and your deeds." Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, mentioned the hadith with an interpretation, and there is no harm in it, for when this hadith was narrated to him, it was said: "O Abu Sa'id, when people see you, they point fingers at you." He replied: "He did not mean this; rather, he meant the innovator in his religion and the corrupt in his worldly affairs." And Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: "Give generously but do not seek fame; do not elevate yourself to be remembered. Learn and conceal; be silent and you will be safe. You will gladden the righteous and enrage the wicked." Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, said: "Whoever loves fame has not been truthful to God." And Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani said: "By God, no servant is truthful to God except that he is pleased not to have his place known." From Khalid ibn Ma'dan, it is reported that when his gathering grew large, he would stand up for fear of fame. From Abu al-'Aliyah, it is reported that if more than three people sat with him, he would stand up. Talha saw some people walking with him, about ten, and said: "Wolves of greed and fuel for the fire." And Sulaym ibn Hanthala said: "While we were around Ubayy ibn Ka'b, walking behind him, Umar saw him and struck him with a whip. He said: 'Look, O Commander of the Faithful, what are you doing?' He replied: 'This is humiliation for the follower and a trial for the followed.'" From al-Hasan, it is reported: "Ibn Mas'ud came out of his house one day, and some people followed him. He turned to them and said: 'Why do you follow me? By God, if you knew what is behind my closed door, not even two of you would follow me.'" And al-Hasan said: "The sound of sandals around men seldom remains long in the hearts of the foolish." Al-Hasan went out one day, and some people followed him. He said: "Do you have any need? Otherwise, what remains of this in the heart of a believer?" It is reported that a man accompanied Ibn Muhayriz on a journey, and when he parted from him, he said: "Advise me." He replied: "If you are able to be known without making yourself known, to walk without others walking to you, to ask without being asked, then do so." Ayyub went on a journey, and many people bid him farewell. He said: "If I did not know that God knows from my heart that I dislike this, I would fear God's wrath, Almighty and Glorious is He." Ma'mar said: "I reproached Ayyub for the length of his shirt. He replied: 'In the past, fame was in its length, and today it is in shortening it.'" Someone said: "I was with Abu Qilabah when a man wearing fine garments entered upon him. He said: 'Beware of this braying donkey!'—referring to the seeking of fame." Al-Thawri said: "They used to dislike fame from both fine garments and poor garments, for eyes are drawn to both." A man said to Bishr ibn al-Harith: "Advise me." He replied: "Make your mention obscure and make your food pure." Hawshab would weep and say: "My name has reached the congregational mosque." Bishr said: "I do not know a man who loves to be known except that his religion departs and he is disgraced." He also said: "A man who loves to be known by people will not find the sweetness of the Hereafter." May God's mercy be upon him and upon them all.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Obscurity

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "How many a dishevelled, dust-covered man in two worn garments, who is given no regard, if he were to swear by God, God would fulfill it for him—among them is Al-Bara' ibn Malik." And Ibn Mas'ud said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "How many a man in two worn garments, who is given no regard, if he were to swear by God, God would fulfill it for him. If he were to say, 'O God, I ask You for Paradise,' He would grant him Paradise and would not give him anything of this world." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Shall I not guide you to the people of Paradise? Every weak and downtrodden person, if he were to swear by God, God would fulfill it for him. And the people of the Fire are every arrogant, haughty, and coarse person." And Abu Huraira said: He, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the people of Paradise are every dishevelled, dust-covered man, not in two worn garments, who is given no regard; who, when they seek permission from the rulers, are not granted it; and when they propose to women, they are not married; and when they speak, their words are not heeded. The needs of one of them are pent up within his chest. If his light were to be distributed among the people on the Day of Resurrection, it would suffice them." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, among my community is he whom, if one of you were to come to him asking for a dinar, he would not give it to him; and if he were to ask him for a fals, he would not give it to him. Yet if he were to ask God for Paradise, He would grant it to him; and if he were to ask Him for this world, He would not give it to him. And He withholds it from him only due to its insignificance in his sight. How many a man in two worn garments, who is given no regard, if he were to swear by God, God would fulfill it for him." And it is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, entered the mosque and saw Mu'adh ibn Jabal weeping at the grave of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He said: "What makes you weep?" He said: "I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: 'A small amount of ostentation is polytheism. And God loves the pious, the hidden ones, who, when they are absent, are not missed, and when they are present, are not recognized. Their hearts are lamps of guidance; they are saved from every dark and dusty tribulation.'"

Muhammad ibn Suwayd said: The people of Medina suffered a drought, and there was among them a righteous man, unnoticed and unheeded, who was constant in the Prophet's mosque. While they were in their supplication, a man came to them wearing two worn-out garments. He prayed two brief rak'ahs, then stretched forth his hands and said, "O Lord, I adjure You, unless You send rain upon us this very hour!" He did not lower his hands nor cease his supplication until the sky was overcast with clouds, and they received rain until the people of Medina cried out for fear of drowning. He then said, "O Lord, if You know they have had enough, then lift it from them," and it subsided. His companion who had sought the rain followed the man until he learned his dwelling. He went to him early the next morning and said, "I come to you with a need." He asked, "What is it?" He said, "Grant me a special supplication." He replied, "Glory be to God! You are *you*, and you ask me to grant you a special supplication?" Then he said, "What has brought you to what you witnessed?" He answered, "I obeyed God in what He commanded me and forbade me, so I asked God and He granted me."

Ibn Mas'ud said: Be springs of knowledge, lamps of guidance, keepers of the homes, lanterns of the night, with renewed hearts and worn-out garments. You will be known among the people of heaven and hidden among the people of earth.

Abu Umamah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "God Almighty says, 'The most enviable of My allies is a believing servant, light in possessions, having a share of prayer, who worships his Lord excellently and obeys Him in secret, being obscure among the people, not pointed at with fingers, then remains patient upon that.'" He said: Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, tapped with his hand and said, "His term is hastened, his inheritance is little, and his mourners are few."

Abdullah ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said: The most beloved of God's servants to God are the strangers. It was asked, "And who are the strangers?" He said, "Those who flee with their religion; they will gather on the Day of Resurrection to the Messiah, peace be upon him."

Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said: It reached me that God Almighty says in some of what He bestows upon His servant: "Have I not bestowed favor upon you? Have I not concealed you? Have I not made your mention obscure?"

Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad used to say: O God, make me, in Your sight, among the highest of Your creation, and make me, in my own sight, among the lowest of Your creation, and make me, in the sight of people, among the middle of Your creation.

Al-Thawri said: I found my heart rectified in Mecca and Medina with a people who were strangers, possessors of scant provision and hardship.

Ibrahim ibn Adham said: My eye found contentment in the world not for a single day, except once. I spent a night in one of the mosques of the villages of Syria, and I had a stomach ailment. The mu'adhdhin dragged me by my leg until he expelled me from the mosque.

Al-Fudayl said: If you are able not to be known, then do so. What is it to you not to be known? What is it to you not to be praised? What is it to you to be blamed among people if you are praiseworthy with God Almighty?

These narrations and reports acquaint you with the blameworthiness of fame and the virtue of obscurity. What is sought by fame and the spread of reputation is status and position in hearts, and the love of status is the source of every corruption.

If you ask: What fame could surpass that of the prophets, the rightly-guided caliphs, and the leading scholars? How then did the virtue of obscurity elude them? Know that what is blameworthy is the *pursuit* of fame. As for its existence being granted by God Almighty, without any contrivance from the servant, that is not blameworthy. Yet, it is a trial for the weak, not for the strong. They are like a drowning man who is among a group of drowning people. It is best for him if none of them recognize him, for they would cling to him and he would be too weak for them, thus perishing with them. As for the strong one, it is best that the drowning recognize him so they may cling to him, and he may save them and be rewarded for it.

An Exposition on the Condemnation of Ignorance and Its Meaning

God Almighty has said, "That abode of the Hereafter We assign to those who seek not exaltation on earth nor corruption" (Qur'an 28:83), conjoining the desire for corruption and exaltation, and indicating that the abode of the Hereafter is for those free from both desires. And He, glorified and exalted, has said, "Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments—We will fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they will not be deprived therein. Those are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire, and what they did therein is wasted, and worthless is what they used to do" (Qur'an 11:15-16). This also encompasses, in its generality, the love of status, for it is a greater pleasure than the pleasures of worldly life and a more abundant adornment than its adornments. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "The love of wealth and status cause hypocrisy to grow in the heart just as water causes plants to grow." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Two hungry wolves let loose among a flock of sheep do not cause more ruin than the love of prestige and wealth cause to the religion of a Muslim man." And he, peace be upon him, said to Ali, may God honor his countenance, "Indeed, the destruction of people lies in following caprice and the love of praise." We ask God for pardon and well-being, by His grace and generosity.

Explanation of the Meaning and Reality of Ignorance

Know that status and wealth are the two pillars of this world. The meaning of wealth is possession of tangible assets from which benefit is derived, and the meaning of status is possession of hearts that are sought to be honored and obeyed. Just as the wealthy is he who possesses dirhams and dinars—that is, has power over them to attain through them desires, aims, and the fulfillment of passions and all other appetites of the self—so too the one of status is he who possesses the hearts of people, that is, has the ability to maneuver them so as to employ their owners through them for his own purposes and objectives. And just as one acquires wealth through various crafts and professions, so too one acquires the hearts of creation through various kinds of dealings. Hearts become subservient only through knowledge and beliefs, for whoever’s heart believes in someone a quality from the qualities of perfection submits to him and becomes subservient to him according to the strength of the heart’s belief and according to the degree of that perfection in its view. It is not required that the quality be perfection in itself; rather, it suffices that it be perfection in his view and in his belief. One may even believe what is not perfection to be perfection, and his heart yields to the one described by it with a necessary submission according to his belief, for the submission of the heart is a state of the heart. The states of hearts follow the beliefs, knowledge, and imaginings of hearts. And just as the lover of wealth seeks to own slaves and servants, the seeker of status seeks to enslave free people, subjugate them, and gain mastery over their necks by mastering their hearts. Indeed, the enslavement sought by the person of status is greater, for the master owns the slave by coercion while the slave is inherently resistant; if left to his own opinion, he would slip away from obedience. But the person of status seeks obedience willingly and desires that free people become his slaves by nature and by choice, rejoicing in servitude and obedience to him. Thus, what he seeks is far above what the owner of slaves seeks. Therefore, the meaning of status is: the establishment of rank in the hearts of people—that is, the hearts’ belief in an attribute from the attributes of perfection in him. To the extent they believe in his perfection, their hearts submit to him, and to the extent of the hearts’ submission is his power over the hearts, and to the extent of his power over the hearts is his joy and love for status. This is the meaning and reality of status, and it has fruits such as praise and commendation, for the one who believes in perfection does not remain silent about mentioning what he believes, so he extols him; and such as service and assistance, for he does not withhold offering himself in obedience according to his belief, thus becoming a tool for him like a slave for his purposes; and such as preference, abstaining from rivalry, honor, and reverence—through initiating greetings, yielding the seat of honor in gatherings, and giving precedence in all matters. These are effects that issue from the establishment of status in the heart. And the meaning of the establishment of status in the heart is the hearts’ encompassing a belief in attributes of perfection in a person, whether through knowledge, worship, good character, lineage, authority, beauty in form, strength in body, or anything that people believe to be perfection. For all these qualities magnify his station in hearts and thus become a cause for the establishment of status. And God, the Exalted, knows best.

Explanation of Why Ignorance is Naturally Beloved

until no heart is free from it except through intense spiritual struggle.

Know that the very cause which necessitates the love of gold, silver, and all other types of wealth is the same that necessitates the love of status—indeed, it necessitates that status be more beloved than wealth, just as it necessitates that gold be more beloved than silver when they are equal in measure. This is because you know that dirhams and dinars have no intrinsic purpose, for they are not suitable for food, drink, marriage, or clothing; they are, in essence, like pebbles. Yet they are beloved because they are a means to all beloved things and an instrument for fulfilling desires. Likewise, status, for the meaning of status is the mastery over the hearts of free people and the ability to subdue them, which yields the power to attain all objectives. Thus, the sharing in the cause necessitates the sharing in love, and the preference of status over wealth necessitates that status be more beloved than wealth. Moreover, the possession of status holds preference over the possession of wealth in three aspects.

The first: That attaining wealth through prestige is easier than attaining prestige through wealth. For the scholar or the ascetic who has established prestige in hearts, if he intends to acquire wealth, it is facilitated for him. Indeed, the wealth of those who possess hearts is subservient to hearts and readily offered to one in whom perfection is believed. As for the base man who is not characterized by any attribute of perfection, if he finds a treasure but has no prestige to safeguard his wealth, and he wishes to attain prestige through wealth, it is not facilitated for him. Therefore, prestige is an instrument and a means to wealth. Thus, whoever possesses prestige has indeed possessed wealth, but whoever possesses wealth does not, in every case, possess prestige. For this reason, prestige becomes more beloved.

The second is that wealth is exposed to trials and loss, being subject to theft, usurpation, and the covetousness of rulers and oppressors. It requires guards, watchmen, and treasuries for its protection, and is vulnerable to many dangers. As for hearts, when they possess it, they are not exposed to these afflictions; they are, in truth, ready treasuries that thieves cannot reach, nor can the hands of plunderers and usurpers seize it. The most secure of properties is real estate, yet even it is not safe from usurpation and injustice, nor can it do without supervision and protection. But the treasuries of hearts are preserved and guarded by their very essence, and spiritual rank therein is secure and safe from usurpation and theft. Indeed, hearts are only usurped through manipulation, the vilification of one's state, and the alteration of belief in the truthful attributes of perfection—and that is something easily repelled and not readily accomplished by those who attempt it.

Third: The dominion over hearts spreads, grows, and multiplies without need for toil or hardship, for when hearts submit to a person and believe in his perfection—whether in knowledge, deed, or otherwise—tongues inevitably express what lies within. Thus, he describes what he believes to others, and that heart, too, is captured for him. It is for this reason that human nature loves fame and the spread of renown, because when it flies across regions, it captures hearts and calls them to submission and veneration. It continually spreads from one to another and increases, with no specific limit to its reach. As for wealth, whoever possesses some of it owns it, yet cannot increase it except through toil and hardship. Influence, however, perpetually grows by itself, and there is no limit to its place, while wealth remains stagnant. Hence, when influence becomes great and fame spreads, and tongues are unleashed in praise, wealth is deemed insignificant in comparison. These are the main points favoring influence over wealth, and if elaborated, the aspects of preference would multiply.

If you say: The problem persists with both wealth and influence, so a person should not love wealth or influence. Indeed, the amount needed to attain pleasures and ward off harms is known—such as one in need of clothing, shelter, or food, or one afflicted by illness or punishment if they cannot avert punishment from themselves except through wealth or influence. Their love for wealth and influence is understandable, since whatever is indispensable for attaining what is loved is itself loved. Yet in human nature lies a wondrous matter beyond this: the love of all wealth, hoarding treasures, storing reserves, and amassing treasuries beyond all needs—so much so that if a servant had two valleys of gold, he would seek a third. Likewise, a person loves the expansion of influence and the spread of fame to the farthest lands, even if he knows for certain he will never tread them or meet their inhabitants, so that they may venerate him, offer him wealth, or aid him in some aim. Despite despairing of this, he takes utmost delight in it, and this love is ingrained in nature. One might almost think this ignorance, for it is love of what holds no benefit, neither in this world nor the next. We say: Yes, this love is inseparable from hearts. It has two causes: one apparent, understood by the masses; and another hidden, which is the greater of the two, yet the subtlest, most concealed, and farthest from the comprehension of the intelligent, let alone the foolish. This is because it draws from a hidden vein in the soul and a nature concealed within disposition, which none but the deep divers can discern.

As for the first cause: it is the repelling of the pain of fear, for the compassionate person, due to bad suspicion, is prone to it. A person, even if presently self-sufficient, is long in hope, and it occurs to his mind that the wealth which suffices him may perhaps perish, so he would need other than it. When this occurs to his mind, fear stirs from his heart, and the pain of fear is not repelled except by the security attained through the existence of other wealth to which he can flee if a calamity befalls this wealth. Thus, due to his compassion for himself and his love for life, he constantly estimates a long life, estimates the onslaught of needs, and estimates the possibility of afflictions befalling wealth. He then senses fear from that, so he seeks what repels his fear, which is abundance of wealth, so that if a portion of his wealth is afflicted, he can rely on the other. This is a fear for which no specific measure of wealth can be set as a limit. Therefore, one like him has no stopping point until he possesses all that is in the world. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Two greedy ones are never satisfied: the greedy seeker of knowledge and the greedy seeker of wealth." A similar cause applies to his love for establishing status and prestige in the hearts of those distant from his homeland and country, for he does not cease from estimating a cause that might disturb him from his homeland or disturb those people from their homelands to his homeland, and he needs to seek their aid. Whenever that is possible and his need for them is not an obvious impossibility, the soul finds joy and pleasure in the establishment of prestige in their hearts, because of the security it provides from this fear.

As for the second reason, which is the strongest: because it is a divine command, with which God the Exalted described it when He said, glorified is He: "And they ask you about the spirit. Say, 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord.'" Or the meaning of it being divine is that it is from the secrets of the sciences of unveiling, and there is no permission to disclose it if the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, did not disclose it. But before knowing that, you know that the heart has an inclination toward bestial attributes like eating and copulation; and toward predatory attributes like killing, striking, and harming; and toward satanic attributes like cunning, deceit, and leading astray; and toward lordly attributes like arrogance, might, tyranny, and seeking supremacy. This is because it is composed of different origins whose explanation and detail would be lengthy. Thus, due to what it contains of the divine command, it loves lordship by nature. And the meaning of lordship is uniqueness in perfection and singularity in existence in a manner of independence. So perfection became from the attributes of divinity, thus it became beloved by nature to man. And perfection is through singularity in existence, for partnership in existence is inevitably a deficiency. The perfection of the sun is that it exists alone; if there were another sun with it, that would be a deficiency in its right, as it would not be singular with the perfect meaning of sun-ness. And the One singular in existence is God the Exalted, for there is no existent with Him other than Him. For what is other than Him is an effect from the effects of His power, having no subsistence by itself; rather, it subsists through Him. So it is not existent *with* Him, because togetherness necessitates equality in rank, and equality in rank is a diminishment in perfection. Rather, the perfect is the one who has no peer in His rank. And just as the shining of the sun's light in the horizons is not a diminishment in the sun, but is from the totality of its perfection—indeed, the sun's diminishment would be by the existence of another sun equaling it in rank while being independent of it—so too the existence of everything in the world returns to the shining of the lights of power, so it is a follower and not followed. Therefore, the meaning of lordship is singularity in existence, and that is perfection. And every person, by his nature, loves to be the one singular in perfection. For that reason, some of the Sufi masters said: "There is no person except that within his inner being is what Pharaoh explicitly stated in his saying, 'I am your highest Lord,' but he does not find an avenue for it." And it is as he said, for servitude is a constraint upon the soul, and lordship is beloved by nature due to the divine connection alluded to in His saying, the Exalted: "Say, 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord.'" But since the soul is incapable of attaining the ultimate degree of perfection, it lowers its desire for perfection. So it loves perfection, longs for it, and delights in it for its own sake, not for a meaning beyond perfection. And every existent loves itself and the perfection of its self, and hates annihilation, which is the non-existence of its self or the non-existence of the attributes of perfection from its self. Indeed, perfection is only after singularity in existence is secured in gaining mastery over all existents. For the most complete perfection is that the existence of another be from you; if it is not from you, then that you gain mastery over it. Thus, gaining mastery over all became beloved by nature, because it is a type of perfection. And every existent that knows itself loves itself and loves the perfection of its self and delights in it. Except that gaining mastery over a thing is through the ability to influence it and to change it according to will, and for it to be subservient to you, turning it as you wish. So man loves to have mastery over all existing things with him. Except that existents are divided into: that which does not accept change in its essence, like the essence of God the Exalted and His attributes; and that which accepts change but cannot be mastered by the power of creation, like the angels, the planets, the dominion of the heavens, the souls of the angels, the jinn, and the devils, and like the mountains and the seas; and that which accepts change by the power of the servant, like the earth and its parts, and what is upon it of minerals, plants, and animals—and among them are the hearts of people, for they are receptive to influence and change, like their bodies and the bodies of animals.

When existents are divided into those over which man has the power to exercise control, such as earthly matters, and those over which he has no power, such as the Essence of God Most High, the angels, and the heavens, man desires to gain mastery over the heavens through knowledge, encompassing them, and unveiling their secrets—for that is a form of mastery. Indeed, the known that is encompassed is as if brought under knowledge, and the knower is like one who has gained mastery over it. Therefore, he desires to know God Most High, the angels, the celestial spheres, the stars, all the wonders of the heavens, and all the wonders of the seas, the mountains, and others, because that is a form of mastery over them, and mastery is a kind of perfection. This resembles the longing of one who is incapable of producing a wondrous craft to know the method of its craftsmanship, like one who is unable to devise chess—he may yearn to know how to play it and how it was devised. Or like one who sees a wondrous craft in geometry, sleight of hand, moving heavy objects, or the like, while feeling within himself some incapacity and shortcoming regarding it, yet he longs to know its manner. Thus, he is pained by some incapacity yet delights in the perfection of knowledge if he attains it.

As for the second category: it is the earthly matters over which man has been given power, for he naturally loves to gain mastery over them through the ability to dispose of them as he wishes. And these are of two kinds: bodies and spirits.

As for bodies, they are like dirhams, dinars, and possessions—loving to have power over them to do with them as one wills, in raising and lowering, granting and withholding, for that is power, and power is perfection, and perfection is among the attributes of lordship, and lordship is naturally beloved. Thus, wealth is loved even if one has no need of it for clothing, food, or personal desires. By the same token, the enslavement of slaves and the subjugation of free persons is sought, even by force and domination, so that one may dispose of their bodies and persons through servitude, even without possessing their hearts—for perhaps their hearts do not acknowledge his perfection so that he becomes beloved to them, and coercion takes its place within them. Indeed, coercive restraint is also pleasurable because of the power it contains.

The Second Category: The souls and hearts of human beings, which are the most precious entities upon the face of the earth. Thus, one loves to have mastery and power over them so that they may be subjugated to him, moving under his direction and will. This is due to the perfection inherent in mastery and the emulation of the attributes of Lordship. Hearts are only subjugated through love, and they love only by believing in perfection. For every perfection is beloved because perfection is among the divine attributes, and all divine attributes are beloved by nature due to the lordly meaning within the totality of human meanings. It is that which death does not corrupt and annihilate, nor does dust gain dominion over it to consume it. For it is the abode of faith and gnosis, and it is what connects to the meeting with God Almighty and strives toward Him. Therefore, the meaning of prestige is the subjugation of hearts. And for whom hearts are subjugated, he has power and mastery over them, and power and mastery are among the descriptions of Lordship. Thus, what the heart loves by its nature is perfection through knowledge and power. Wealth and prestige are among the means to power. There is no end to what can be known and no end to what can be achieved. As long as something knowable or achievable remains, longing does not subside and deficiency does not vanish. For this reason, it is said, "Two are insatiable..." Therefore, what hearts seek is perfection, and perfection is through knowledge and power, with degrees of variation therein being limitless. The joy and pleasure of every person is according to the measure of perfection he attains. This is the reason why knowledge, wealth, and prestige are beloved, and it is a matter beyond being beloved for the sake of attaining desires. For this cause may persist even with the cessation of desires. Indeed, a person loves from the sciences that which is not suitable for attaining purposes; indeed, it may even cause him to miss a whole range of purposes and desires. But nature demands the pursuit of knowledge in all wonders and complexities, because in knowledge there is mastery over the known, which is a type of perfection that is among the attributes of Lordship, thus it is beloved by nature. However, in the love for the perfection of knowledge and power there are pitfalls that must be clarified, God willing.

Explanation of True Perfection and Illusory Perfection

That which has no true reality

You have come to know that there is no perfection after the cessation of exclusive possession of existence except in knowledge and power. However, the true perfection therein is intermingled with illusory perfection. Its explanation is that the perfection of knowledge belongs to God, exalted is He, and this is from three aspects: The first is from the perspective of the abundance and vastness of the objects of knowledge, for He encompasses all objects of knowledge. Therefore, whenever the servant's knowledge is greater, he is closer to God, exalted is He. The second is from the perspective of the relation of knowledge to the known exactly as it is, and the known being unveiled by it with a complete unveiling. For the objects of knowledge are unveiled to God, exalted is He, with the most perfect types of unveiling, exactly as they are. Therefore, whenever the servant's knowledge is clearer, more certain, more truthful, and more in accordance with the known in the details of the attributes of knowledge, he is closer to God, exalted is He. The third is from the perspective of the permanence of knowledge for all eternity, such that it does not change nor vanish. For the knowledge of God, exalted is He, is permanent; it is inconceivable that it should change. Likewise, whenever the servant's knowledge is of objects that do not admit change and transformation, he is closer to God, exalted is He.

Knowledge is of two categories: that which is subject to change and that which is eternal.

As for mutable matters: an example is the knowledge that Zayd is in the house, for it is knowledge of a known thing, yet one can imagine Zayd leaving the house while the belief that he is in the house remains as it was, thus turning into ignorance. Hence it becomes a deficiency, not a perfection. Whenever you hold a belief that corresponds to reality, yet it is conceivable for that belief to change from what you hold, you are in a position where your perfection may turn into deficiency, and your knowledge may revert to ignorance. To this example belong all mutable matters of the world, such as your knowledge of a mountain's height, the area of a land, the distance between countries and the miles or leagues separating them, and all that is mentioned in travelogues and chronicles. Likewise, knowledge of languages, which are conventions that change with changing eras, nations, and customs—these are sciences whose objects are like quicksilver, shifting from one state to another. Thus, there is no perfection in them except in the present moment, nor does perfection remain fixed in the heart.

The second category is the eternal knowledge, which pertains to the possibility of possible things, the necessity of necessary things, and the impossibility of impossible things. For these are eternal, everlasting knowledges, since the necessary can never become possible, nor the possible impossible, nor the impossible necessary. All these categories fall within the knowledge of God, what is necessary for Him, what is impossible concerning His attributes, and what is possible concerning His actions. Thus, knowledge of God Almighty, His attributes, His actions, and His wisdom in the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and the ordering of this world and the Hereafter, and what pertains to it, is the true perfection which brings near to God Almighty those who are characterized by it, and it remains a perfection for the soul after death. This knowledge becomes a light for the knowers after death: "Their light runs before them and on their right hands; they say, 'Our Lord, perfect for us our light.'" That is, this knowledge becomes the capital that leads to the unveiling of what was not unveiled in this world. Just as one has a hidden lamp, it is possible that it becomes a cause for increasing the light by another lamp kindled from it, thus completing the hidden light by way of perfection. But he who has no original lamp has no hope in that; so he who has no original knowledge of God Almighty has no hope in this light. He remains like one whose likeness is in darkness, not emerging from it, but "like darkness upon an unfathomable sea, covered by a wave, above which is a wave, above which are clouds—layers of darkness, one above another." Therefore, there is no felicity except in the knowledge of God Almighty. As for other knowledges besides this, some are of no benefit whatsoever, such as knowledge of poetry and Arab genealogies and the like; and some have benefit in assisting toward the knowledge of God Almighty, such as knowledge of the Arabic language, exegesis, jurisprudence, and reports. For knowledge of the Arabic language assists in knowing the interpretation of the Quran, and knowledge of exegesis assists in knowing what the Quran contains regarding the manner of worship and works that benefit the purification of the soul. Knowledge of the way to purify the soul benefits the soul's readiness to accept guidance to the knowledge of God, glory and majesty be to Him, as He Almighty said, "He has succeeded who purifies it," and He, mighty and majestic, said, "And those who strive in Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways." Thus, the totality of these knowledges is like means to the realization of the knowledge of God Almighty. True perfection lies in the knowledge of God and the knowledge of His attributes and His actions, and within it is enfolded all knowledges encompassing existent things, for all existent things are from His actions. So whoever knows them inasmuch as they are an action of God Almighty, and inasmuch as they are connected to power, will, and wisdom, that is part of the completion of the knowledge of God Almighty. This is the ruling concerning the perfection of knowledge, which we have mentioned, even if it is not fitting for the rulings of status and ostentation, but we have presented it to complete the categories of perfection.

As for power, there is no true perfection for the servant therein; rather, the servant possesses true knowledge but does not possess true power. True power belongs to God alone, and whatever occurs following the servant's will, power, and movement is brought into being by God's creation—as we established in the Book of Patience and Gratitude, the Book of Reliance, and various places in the Quarter of Deliverances. Thus, the perfection of knowledge remains with him after death and leads him to God, exalted be He. As for the perfection of power, he has no perfection from the aspect of power in relation to his state; it is merely a means for him to attain the perfection of knowledge, like the soundness of his limbs, the strength of his hand for striking, his foot for walking, and his senses for perception. For these powers are instruments by which one reaches the reality of knowledge's perfection. The full acquisition of these faculties may require power through wealth and status to attain food, drink, clothing, and shelter, up to a known limit. If he does not employ it to reach the recognition of God's majesty, there is no good in it whatsoever, except from the aspect of immediate pleasure that soon vanishes. Whoever considers that to be perfection is ignorant, and most of creation are perishing in the flood of this ignorance, for they think that power over bodies through subduing modesty, over substantial wealth through abundant riches, and over the reverence of hearts through extensive status is perfection. When they believed that, they loved it; when they loved it, they sought it; when they sought it, they became preoccupied with it and consumed by it, thus forgetting the true perfection that necessitates nearness to God, exalted be He, and to His angels—which is knowledge and freedom. As for knowledge, it is what we mentioned of knowing God, exalted be He. As for freedom, it is liberation from the captivity of desires and the sorrows of this world, and mastering them by subduing them in emulation of the angels, whom desire does not agitate nor anger allure. For repelling the effects of desire and anger from the self is among the perfections that are attributes of the angels. Among the attributes of perfection for God, exalted be He, is the impossibility of change or being affected; thus, whoever is farther from change and being affected by contingencies is closer to God, exalted be He, more similar to the angels, and his station with God is greater. This is a third perfection besides the perfection of knowledge and power, and we did not include it among the divisions of perfection because its reality reverts to non-existence and deficiency, for change is a deficiency since it signifies the absence and destruction of an existing attribute, and destruction is a deficiency in delights and in the attributes of perfection.

Thus, perfections are three—if we count (the absence of change by passions and the absence of submission to them) as a perfection, like the perfection of knowledge and the perfection of freedom; and by this I mean the absence of servitude to passions and the desire for worldly causes—and the perfection of power for the servant is a path to acquiring the perfection of knowledge and the perfection of freedom, but there is no path for him to acquire the enduring perfection of power after his death, for his power over material possessions and over harnessing hearts and bodies is severed by death, whereas his knowledge and freedom do not vanish with death but remain as a perfection within him and a means to nearness to God Almighty. So observe how the ignorant have turned and plunged upon their faces like the plunging of the blind, so they have turned to seeking the perfection of power through status and wealth, which is the perfection that does not endure, and even if it endures, it has no permanence, and they have turned away from the perfection of freedom and knowledge which, when attained, is eternal with no severance. These are the ones who have purchased the worldly life in exchange for the Hereafter, so it is no wonder that the punishment is not lightened for them, nor are they helped. They are the ones who have not understood His saying, Almighty is He: "Wealth and children are the adornment of the worldly life, but the enduring righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward and better in hope." Thus, knowledge and freedom are the enduring righteous deeds that remain as a perfection in the soul, while wealth and status are that which perishes in nearness, and it is as God Almighty has likened it where He said: "The likeness of the worldly life is like water which We send down from the sky, and the plants of the earth mix with it" to the end of the verse. And He Almighty said: "And strike for them the likeness of the worldly life: like water which We send down from the sky" to His saying: "Then it becomes dry stubble scattered by the winds." And all that is scattered by the winds of death is the flower of the worldly life, and all that is not cut off by death is the enduring righteous deeds. Thus, you have come to know by this that the perfection of power through wealth and status is a presumed perfection with no foundation, and that whoever restricts his time to seeking it and believes it to be the objective is ignorant, and to this Abu al-Tayyib alluded in his saying:

He who spends his hours amassing wealth for fear of poverty—that very act is poverty.

Except for the measure of sufficiency from them to reach true perfection. O Allah, make us among those whom You have granted success in goodness and guided by Your grace.

Explanation of What is Praiseworthy and What is Blameworthy in the Love of Status

Whenever you understand that the meaning of status is the mastery over hearts and the power to influence them, its ruling is like the ruling of possessing wealth. For it is a transient aspect of worldly life, severed by death just as wealth is severed. This world is the cultivation ground for the Hereafter, so everything created in this world can be provisioned from it for the Hereafter. And just as a minimum of wealth is necessary for the essential needs of food, drink, and clothing, so too is a minimum of status necessary for the essential needs of living among creation. As a person cannot do without food to consume—and it is permissible for him to love the food or the wealth with which he buys food—so too he is not free from the need for a servant to serve him, a companion to assist him, a teacher to guide him, and a ruler to protect him and repel the injustice of the wicked. His love for having a place in the heart of his servant that motivates him to serve is blameworthy; but his love for having a place in the heart of his companion that facilitates good companionship and assistance is not blameworthy; and his love for having a place in the heart of his teacher that facilitates good guidance, instruction, and care is not blameworthy; and his love for having a place in the heart of his ruler that incites him to repel harm from him is not blameworthy. For status is a means to attainments, just as wealth is; there is no difference between them except that thorough investigation in this matter leads to the realization that wealth and status in themselves are not loved for their own sake. Rather, it is akin to a person loving to have a water closet in his house because he is compelled to it for answering a need, and he would wish to be free from the need to relieve himself so that he could be free from the water closet. In truth, this is not love for the water closet itself. Thus, whatever is desired as a means to attain something beloved, the beloved is the intended goal reached by that means. The distinction can be grasped with another example: a man may love his wife insofar as she relieves excess desire, just as a water closet relieves excess food. If he were relieved of the burden of desire, he would divorce his wife, just as if he were relieved of the need to relieve himself, he would not enter the water closet nor concern himself with it. But a man may love his wife for her own sake, with the love of passionate lovers; even if relieved of desire, he would remain attached to marital union with her. This is love, unlike the former. Likewise, it is with status and wealth. Each of them may be loved in these two ways: loving them for the sake of using them to achieve bodily necessities is not blameworthy, but loving them for their own appearances beyond the necessity and need of the body is blameworthy. However, one is not described as sinful and disobedient unless that love drives him to commit an act of disobedience. As for what is attained through falsehood, deceit, and committing prohibitions, and what is not attained through worship—for attaining status and wealth through worship is a transgression against religion and is forbidden—this returns to the meaning of the prohibited ostentation, as will come later.

If you ask: "Is seeking status and prestige in the heart of one's teacher, servant, companion, or ruler, and anyone connected to his affairs, absolutely permissible in any manner; or is it permissible only to a specific extent and in a specific way?" I say: That is sought in three ways; two are permissible, and one is forbidden.

As for the prohibited aspect: it is to seek a standing in their hearts by making them believe he possesses a quality from which he is actually detached, such as knowledge, piety, or lineage, so he presents himself to them as an Alawi, a scholar, or a pious person while he is not so. This is forbidden because it is falsehood and deception, whether through speech or conduct.

As for the first of the two permissible cases: it is when one seeks a position of standing by means of a quality he genuinely possesses, as in the saying of Joseph, peace be upon him, as the Lord, Exalted is He, informed about him: "Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I am a knowing guardian." For he sought the position in his heart on account of being a knowing guardian, and he was in need of it, and he was truthful in it. "The second" is when one seeks to conceal a fault from his faults or a sin from his sins, so that it is not known and thus his standing is not removed because of it. This too is permissible, because preserving the veil over disgraceful matters is allowed, and it is not permissible to rend the veil and expose what is disgraceful. This does not involve deception; rather, it is blocking the path to knowledge of that in which there is no benefit in knowing, like one who conceals from the ruler that he drinks wine, yet does not present himself to him as being scrupulously pious. For his statement, "I am scrupulously pious," would be deception, whereas his not confessing to drinking does not necessitate the belief that he is scrupulous; it merely prevents knowledge of the drinking.

Among the prohibited matters is beautifying prayer before others to make them think well of one's devotion, for that is ostentation. It is a deception, as it gives the illusion that one is among the sincere and humble worshippers of God, while in reality one is showing off through one's actions—so how can such a person be sincere? Seeking status through this means is forbidden, as is doing so through any act of disobedience, and it is akin to acquiring unlawful wealth without distinction. Just as it is not permissible for one to take possession of another's property through deception in exchange or otherwise, it is not permissible to take possession of another's heart through forgery and deceit, for possessing hearts is greater than possessing wealth.

Explanation of the Reason for the Love of Praise and Commendation

The soul finds comfort in it and the nature inclines toward it, while it detests blame and recoils from it.

Know that the love of praise and the heart's delight in it have four causes. The first cause, which is the strongest, is the soul's awareness of perfection. For we have established that perfection is beloved, and everything beloved is delightful to perceive. Whenever the soul becomes aware of its own perfection, it finds rest, takes pride, and experiences delight. Praise makes the soul of the praised one aware of its perfection, for the attribute for which one is praised is either evident and apparent or subject to doubt.

If it is evident, apparent, and tangible, the delight in it is lesser, yet it is not devoid of pleasure, such as praising someone for being tall or fair-skinned. This is a type of perfection, but the soul often overlooks it and thus remains unaware of its delight. When it becomes conscious of it, the emergence of awareness inevitably brings about pleasure. If, however, that attribute is subject to doubt, the delight in it is greater—such as praising someone for perfect knowledge, perfect piety, or absolute beauty. For a person may doubt the perfection of their beauty, knowledge, or piety and yearn to remove this doubt by becoming certain of being unparalleled in these matters, as their soul finds tranquility in it. When another mentions it, this produces tranquility and confidence through the awareness of that perfection, and thus their delight increases. Indeed, the delight is magnified by this cause whenever praise comes from one who is insightful into these attributes, knowledgeable about them, and does not speak recklessly except with certainty. This is like the joy of a student when their teacher praises them for intelligence, cleverness, and abundant virtue, for they experience the utmost delight. But if it comes from one who speaks recklessly or lacks insight into that attribute, the delight is weakened.

For this same reason, blame is also detested and disliked, for it makes one aware of their soul's deficiency. Deficiency is the opposite of beloved perfection, so the feeling of it is hateful and painful. Therefore, the pain is great when blame comes from a trusted and insightful person, as we mentioned regarding praise.

The second reason: Praise indicates that the heart of the praiser is enslaved to the praised, that he is desirous of him, believes in him, and is subjugated under his will. The mastery over hearts is beloved, and the sensation of attaining it is delightful. Due to this cause, the pleasure is magnified whenever praise issues from one whose power is vast and from whose heart's capture benefit is derived, such as kings and notables; and it is diminished whenever the praiser is one who is not heeded and has no power over anything. For the power over him, by mastering his heart, is a power over an insignificant matter; thus, praise indicates nothing but a limited power. Due to this same cause, blame is detested and the heart is pained by it, and if it comes from notables, its injury is greater because what is lost by it is greater.

The third reason: The praise of the one who praises and the commendation of the commender is a cause for capturing the heart of everyone who hears it, especially when it comes from one whose word is heeded and whose praise is valued. This is specific to praise that occurs publicly. Thus, undoubtedly, the more numerous the gathering and the more worthy the praiser is of having his word heeded, the more delightful the praise and the more severe the blame upon the soul.

The fourth cause: Praise indicates the dignity of the praised one and the compulsion of the praiser to unleash the tongue in extolling the praised, whether willingly or by force. For dignity is also delightful due to the coercion and power it contains. This delight occurs even if the praiser does not inwardly believe what he praises with, but his being compelled to mention it is a kind of coercion and mastery over him. Thus, the delight is in proportion to the praiser's restraint and strength, so the delight of praise from a strong, restrained person who abstains from humility in praise is more intense.

These four causes may combine in the praise of a single praiser, thereby magnifying the pleasure, or they may separate, diminishing the delight. As for the first cause, which is the perception of perfection, it is repelled when the praised one knows that he is not truthful in his statement, as when he is praised for being noble, generous, knowledgeable, or abstaining from prohibitions while he knows from himself the opposite. Then the delight whose cause is the perception of perfection vanishes, and the delight of mastery over his heart and tongue and the remaining delights remain. If he knows that the praiser does not believe what he says and knows his emptiness of this attribute, the second delight—which is mastery over his heart—is nullified, and the delight of mastery and dignity over the compulsion of his tongue to utter praise remains. If that is not out of fear but rather by way of play, all delights are nullified, and there is no delight in it at all due to the absence of the three causes. This is what unveils the cause of the soul's delight with praise and its pain due to blame. We have mentioned this only so that the way of treatment for the love of status, love of praise, and fear of blame may be known, for what is not known in its cause cannot be treated, since treatment is the dissolution of the causes of illness. God grants success through His generosity and grace, and may God bless every chosen servant.

Explanation of the Treatment for Love of Status

Know that whoever is overcome in their heart by love of status becomes confined in concern to observing people, infatuated with endearing themselves to others and seeking their approval for their sake. Such a person remains in their words and deeds constantly turning toward what elevates their standing in people's eyes. This is the seed of hypocrisy and the root of corruption, and it inevitably leads to negligence in acts of worship and performing them for show, and to plunging into prohibitions in order to capture hearts. For this reason, the Messenger of God ﷺ likened the love of prestige and wealth and their corruption of religion to two ravenous wolves, and he ﷺ said, "Indeed, it causes hypocrisy to grow just as water causes plants to grow." Thus, hypocrisy is the contradiction between outward appearance and inward reality in word or deed. Whoever seeks a place in people's hearts is compelled to hypocrisy with them and to displaying praiseworthy qualities they are devoid of, and that is the very essence of hypocrisy.

Thus, love of status is among the destructive traits, so it is imperative to treat it and remove it from the heart, for it is a nature firmly ingrained in the heart, just as love of wealth is ingrained; and its treatment is composed of knowledge and action.

As for knowledge: it is to know the reason for which one desires status—which is the perfection of power over people’s persons and their hearts. We have already explained that if this is pure and sound, its end is death, and thus it is not among the enduring good deeds. Indeed, even if every soul upon the face of the earth, from east to west, were to prostrate to you, within fifty years neither the one prostrating nor the one prostrated to would remain, and your state would become like the state of those who possessed status before you, along with those who humbled themselves before them. This is not worth abandoning the religion for—the religion which is eternal life without end. And whoever comprehends true perfection and illusory perfection—as previously mentioned—will see status as insignificant in his eyes, except that this only becomes insignificant in the sight of one who looks to the Hereafter as if he beholds it, who holds the fleeting world in contempt, and for whom death is as if already present. His condition is like that of al-Hasan al-Basri when he wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz: “As for what follows: it is as though the last person upon whom death was decreed has already died.” See how he extended his gaze toward the future and considered it as already occurring. Likewise was the state of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz when he wrote in reply: “As for what follows: it is as though the world had never been, and as though the Hereafter had never ceased.” These individuals turned their attention to the final outcome, so they acted for it with piety, knowing that the outcome belongs to the God-fearing. Thus they held status and wealth in this world in contempt. The vision of most people is weak, limited to the immediate, its light not extending to witnessing the consequences. Therefore, the Almighty has said: “Rather, you prefer the life of this world, while the Hereafter is better and more enduring.” And He, the Exalted, has said: “No! But you love the immediate and neglect the Hereafter.” Whoever is in this condition must treat his heart from the love of status through knowledge of immediate harms—that is, by reflecting on the dangers that those who seek status are exposed to in this world. For every possessor of status is envied, targeted for harm, constantly fearful for his standing, and guarded lest his station in people’s hearts change. Hearts are more changeable than a boiling pot, wavering between turning toward and turning away. Thus, whatever is built upon the hearts of creation resembles what is built upon the waves of the sea, for it has no stability. Occupying oneself with tending to hearts, preserving status, warding off the schemes of the envious, and preventing the harm of enemies—all these are immediate sorrows that tarnish the pleasure of status. In this world, its hoped-for benefits do not outweigh its feared harms, let alone what is lost in the Hereafter. Through this, weak insight should be treated. As for one whose insight penetrates and whose faith is strong, he does not turn toward this world—this is the cure from the perspective of knowledge.

As for the practical aspect: it is to remove the love of status from the hearts of people by engaging in actions for which one is blamed, until one falls from the sight of creation and departs from the pleasure of acceptance, finding comfort in obscurity, rejecting people, and being content with acceptance from the Creator. This is the way of the Malamatiyya; for they plunged into apparent vices to lower themselves in the eyes of people, thus being safe from the affliction of status. This is not permissible for one who is followed, for it weakens religion in the hearts of Muslims. As for one who is not followed, it is not permissible for him to commit a prohibition for that purpose, but he may do from the permissible things what lowers his standing among people; as it is narrated that a certain king intended to visit a certain ascetic. When the ascetic learned of his approach, he requested food and vegetables and began to eat with greed and enlarge the morsel. When the king looked at him, he fell from his eye and departed. The ascetic said: "Praise be to God who turned you away from me." Among them are those who drank a lawful drink from a cup the color of wine, so that it was thought he was drinking wine, and thus he fell from the eyes of people. Regarding its permissibility, there is consideration from the jurisprudential perspective, except that the people of spiritual states may treat themselves with what jurists do not issue a fatwa for, whenever they see the rectification of their hearts in it, then they make up for what they have neglected in the form of shortcoming. As some of them did, for he was known for asceticism and people turned to him, so he entered a bathhouse, wore the clothes of another, and came out and stood in the road until they recognized him, so they seized him, beat him, took back the clothes, and said: "He is a thief," and they shunned him. The strongest way to cut off status is to seclude oneself from people and emigrate to a place of obscurity. For the one secluded in his house in the town where he is famous is not free from love of the position that becomes established in hearts due to his seclusion. For perhaps he thinks he does not love that status, but he is deluded. His soul only became tranquil because it has attained its objective. If people changed from what they believed about him, blaming him or attributing to him something unbecoming, his soul would become anxious and pained, and he might strive to apologize for that and remove that dust from their hearts. He might even need falsehood and deception to remove that from their hearts, and he would not care about it, and thereby it becomes clear afterward that he loves status and position. Whoever loves status and position is like one who loves wealth, rather it is worse, for the trial of status is greater. He cannot but love a position in the hearts of people as long as he has hope in people. If he secures his sustenance from his own earning or from another source and cuts off his hope from people entirely, then all people become to him like the lowly. He does not care whether he has a position in their hearts or not, just as he does not care about what is in the hearts of those who are in the farthest east from him, because he does not see them nor hope from them. Hope from people is only cut off by contentment. So whoever is content becomes independent of people, and when independent, his heart is not preoccupied with people, and the establishment of his position in hearts has no weight with him. Abandoning status is only perfected by contentment and cutting off hope. One is aided in all of that by the reports transmitted in censuring status and praising obscurity and lowliness, such as their saying: "The believer is never without lowliness, or scarcity, or ailment." And one should look at the conditions of the predecessors and their preference for lowliness over honor and their desire for the reward of the Hereafter—may God be pleased with them all.

Explanation of the Method for Treating the Love of Praise and Aversion to Blame

Know that the greatest of people have perished only due to fear of people's blame and love of their praise, so all their actions became dependent on what aligns with people's approval, hoping for praise and fearing blame. And this is among the destructive traits, so it must be remedied. The method lies in observing the reasons for which one loves praise and dislikes blame.

As for the first cause: it is the perception of perfection due to the words of the praiser. Your way in this is to return to your intellect and say to yourself: "Is this attribute for which you are praised one that you actually possess or not?" If you do possess it, then it is either an attribute deserving of praise, such as knowledge and piety, or an attribute not deserving of praise, such as wealth, status, and worldly ephemera. If it is among the worldly ephemera, then rejoicing in it is like rejoicing in the plants of the earth that soon become dry, scattered straw, blown by the winds. This is from a lack of intellect. Rather, the intelligent one says as al-Mutanabbi said:

The deepest grief to me is the certain knowledge that from his joy, his companion has departed.

Therefore, it is not fitting for a person to rejoice in the fleeting things of this world; and if he does rejoice, he should not rejoice in the praise of the one who praises him for possessing them, for praise is not the cause of their existence. And if the attribute is something that merits joy, such as knowledge and piety, then he should not rejoice in it because the final outcome is unknown. This joy is only warranted because it draws one nearer to God, yet the peril of the final end remains. Thus, the fear of a bad ending preoccupies one from rejoicing in anything of this world. Indeed, the world is an abode of sorrows and griefs, not an abode of joy and delight. Furthermore, if you do rejoice in it with the hope of a good ending, your joy should be in God's favor upon you through knowledge and God-consciousness, not in the praise of the praiser. For delight lies in the awareness of perfection, and perfection exists by the grace of God, not by praise; praise is merely a consequence of it. So you should not rejoice in praise, for praise does not increase your merit. And if the attribute for which you are praised is absent in you, then your joy in that praise is the height of madness. Your example is like that of a man mocked by someone who says, "Glory to God! How abundant is the perfume in his bowels and how sweet are the fragrances that emanate from him!" after he has relieved himself, while he knows what his intestines contain of filth and foulness, yet he rejoices in that. Likewise, if they commend you for righteousness and piety and you rejoice in it, while God is aware of the hidden evils within you, the perils of your secret thoughts, and the impurities of your attributes—that is the height of ignorance. Therefore, if the praiser is truthful, let your joy be in your attribute, which is from God's favor upon you; and if he is false, then it should grieve you, and you should not rejoice in it.

As for the second cause: which is that praise indicates the warming of the praiser's heart and its being a cause for the subjugation of another heart, this reverts to the love of status and rank in hearts—and the manner of treating it has preceded. That is by cutting off hope from people and seeking rank with God, and by knowing that seeking rank in the hearts of people and your rejoicing in it diminishes your rank with God! So how can you rejoice in it? As for the third cause: which is the sense of shame that compelled the praiser to praise, it also reverts to a transient ability for which there is no proof and which does not merit joy; rather, the praise of the praiser should grieve you, and you should dislike it and be angered by it—as that has been transmitted from the predecessors—because the harm of praise upon the praised one is immense, as we have mentioned in the Book of the Harms of the Tongue. Some of the predecessors said: "Whoever rejoices in praise has enabled Satan to enter his belly." And some of them said: "You are an excellent man," and it became more beloved to you than being told, "You are a wicked man," so by God, you are a wicked man. And it is reported in some narrations—if authentic, it is a backbreaker—that a man praised another man with good before the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he said: "If your companion were present and pleased with what you said, and died upon that, he would enter the Fire." And he, peace be upon him, once said to a praiser: "Woe to you, you have broken his back; if he heard you, he would not prosper until the Day of Resurrection." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, do not praise, and when you see those who praise, cast dust in their faces." For this reason, the Companions, may God be pleased with them all, were in great fear of praise and its trial and the great joy that enters the heart because of it, to the extent that one of the rightly-guided caliphs asked a man about something, and he said: "You, O Commander of the Faithful, are better and more knowledgeable than I," so he became angry and said: "I did not command you to declare me pure." And it was said to one of the Companions: "People will remain in goodness as long as God keeps you," so he became angry and said: "I consider you an Iraqi." And one of them, when praised, said: "O God, indeed Your servant has drawn near to You with what You detest, so bear witness to my detestation of it." They only disliked praise out of fear that they would rejoice in the praise of creation while they were detested by the Creator. Thus, their hearts' preoccupation with their state with God, exalted is He, made the praise of creation hateful to them, because the truly praised one is he who is brought near to God, and the truly blamed one is he who is distanced from God, cast into the Fire with the wicked. So this praised one, if he is among the people of the Fire in the sight of God, how immense is his ignorance if he rejoices in the praise of another; and if he is among the people of Paradise, he should not rejoice except in the grace of God, exalted is He, and His praise upon him, for his affair is not in the hands of creation. Whenever one knows that provisions and lifespans are in the hand of God, exalted is He, his attention to the praise and blame of creation diminishes, and the love of praise falls from his heart, and he busies himself with what concerns him from the matter of his religion. And God grants success to what is correct through His mercy.

Explanation of the Treatment for Aversion to Criticism

It has been previously established that the reason for the dislike of blame is the opposite of the reason for the love of praise, and its remedy is likewise understood from this. The concise statement regarding it is that one who blames you cannot be free from one of three conditions.

Either he spoke truthfully with the intention of sincere counsel and compassion; or he was truthful but intended harm and obstinacy; or he was a liar.

If he is truthful and his intention is sincere counsel, then it is not fitting for you to blame him, be angry with him, or harbor malice because of him. Rather, you should accept his favor, for whoever points out your faults to you has guided you to the peril so that you may avoid it. Therefore, you should rejoice in him and occupy yourself with removing the blameworthy trait from yourself if you are able. As for your distress because of him, your dislike for him, and your blame of him, that is the height of ignorance.

If his intention was to find fault, then you have still benefited from his words, for he has guided you to your fault if you were ignorant of it, reminded you of your fault if you were heedless of it, or made its ugliness apparent in your sight to spur your eagerness to remove it if you had considered it good. All of that is a cause of your happiness, and you have gained it from him. So occupy yourself with seeking happiness, for its means have been made available to you due to the blame you heard.

Whenever you intend to enter upon your king while your garment is soiled with filth and you are unaware, and if you were to enter upon him thus you would fear he would sever your neck for soiling his assembly with filth, and then someone were to say, "O you who are soiled with filth, purify yourself," you should rejoice in him, for his alerting you with his words is a gain. All moral faults are ruinous in the Hereafter, and a person only comes to know them from the words of his enemies; thus, he should seize the opportunity. As for the enemy's intention to find fault, that is a transgression from him against his own religion, and it is a blessing from him upon you. So why should you be angry with him for words from which you benefited and he was harmed?

The third case is that he falsely accuses you of something from which you are innocent before God, the Exalted. It is not fitting for you to dislike that or occupy yourself with blaming him. Rather, reflect upon three matters:

The first is that if you are free from that specific fault, you are not free from others like it and similar to it. What God has concealed of your faults is greater. So give thanks to God, the Exalted, that He did not inform him of your faults and diverted him from you by mentioning something you are innocent of.

The second is that this serves as an expiation for your remaining faults and sins. It is as if he has thrown at you a fault you are innocent of and purified you from sins with which you are soiled. Everyone who backbites you has gifted you his good deeds, and everyone who praises you has broken your back. So why do you rejoice at the breaking of your back and grieve at the gifts of good deeds that bring you nearer to God, the Exalted, while you claim to love nearness to God?

As for the third, it is that the wretch has transgressed against his own religion, to the point of falling in the sight of God and destroying himself by his falsehood, exposing himself to His painful punishment. It is not fitting for you to be angry with him while God is angry with him, so that Satan gloats over him and you say, "O God, destroy him." Rather, you should say, "O God, set him right. O God, accept his repentance. O God, have mercy on him," just as He (the Prophet) said, "O God, forgive my people. O God, guide my people, for they do not know," when they broke his tooth, wounded his face, and killed his uncle Hamzah on the day of Uhud. And Ibrahim ibn Adham prayed for forgiveness for the one who wounded his head. When he was asked about that, he said, "I knew I was rewarded because of it, and nothing but good reached me from him, so I would not be pleased for him to be punished because of me."

Among what makes dislike of blame easy for you is cutting off hope. For whoever you have no need of, if he blames you, the effect of that will not be great in your heart. The foundation of religion is contentment, and through it, hope for wealth and status is severed. As long as hope remains, love for status and praise in the heart of the one from whom you hope will be dominant, and your aspiration will be directed toward attaining a place in his heart. That is not attained except by destroying religion. Therefore, one who seeks wealth and status, loves praise, and hates blame should not hope for the safety of his religion, for that is very far indeed.

An Exposition on the Differing Conditions of People in Praise and Blame

Know that people have four states in relation to blame and praise. The first state is to rejoice in praise and thank the praiser, to become angry at blame and harbor resentment toward the blamer, and to repay him or desire to repay him. This is the condition of most of creation, and it is the utmost degree of sinfulness in this matter.

The second state is when one inwardly resents the critic but restrains one's tongue and limbs from retaliating, and when one's inner self rejoices and finds ease in the praiser but one guards one's outward appearance from showing delight. This is a deficiency, yet in comparison to what precedes it, it is a perfection.

The third state: This is the first degree of perfection, wherein one's detractor and praiser become equal in his sight, such that censure does not grieve him nor does praise gladden him out of a sense of burden. Some worshippers may imagine this of themselves, yet they are deluded if they do not test themselves by its signs. Its signs are: that he finds in himself no greater burden in sitting long with the detractor than he finds with the praiser; that he finds in his heart no increased eagerness and vigor in fulfilling the needs of the praiser beyond what he finds in fulfilling the need of the detractor; that the departure of the detractor from his gathering is not easier for him than the departure of the praiser; that the death of the praiser who extols him is not a more severe blow to his heart than the death of the detractor; that his grief over the affliction of the praiser and what befalls him from his enemies is not more than his grief over the affliction of the detractor; and that the fault of the praiser is not lighter upon his heart and in his eye than the fault of the detractor. Whenever the detractor becomes as light upon his heart as the praiser, and they are equal in every respect, then he has attained this rank. How distant it is, and how severe upon the hearts! Most worshippers harbor within their hearts a hidden joy at the praise of people for them, and they are unaware because they do not test themselves by these signs. Perhaps the worshipper senses an inclination of his heart toward the praiser over the detractor, and Satan makes this seem fair to him, saying: "The detractor has disobeyed God by censuring you, and the praiser has obeyed God by praising you, so how can you equate them? Your aversion to the detractor is from pure religion." Herein lies pure deception. For if the worshipper reflected, he would know that among people are those who commit major sins greater than what the detractor committed in his censure, yet he does not feel burdened by them nor recoil from them. And he would know that the praiser who praised is not free from censuring others, yet he finds in himself no aversion to him for censuring others as he finds for censuring himself. Censure, insofar as it is a sin, does not differ whether he is the one censured or another. Thus, the worshipper deluded about himself becomes angry and resentful for his own desire. Then Satan makes it appear to him that it is from religion, until he argues for God with his own desire, increasing thereby his distance from God. Whoever is not wary of the snares of Satan and the afflictions of the souls, most of his worship is wasted toil, causing him to lose this world and suffer loss in the Hereafter. Concerning them, God Almighty has said: "Say, 'Shall we inform you of the greatest losers in respect of their works? Those whose effort goes astray in the life of this world, while they think they are doing good.'"

The fourth state: It is sincerity in worship; that one detests praise and despises the praiser, knowing that it is a trial for him, a back-breaker, harmful to his religion, and loves the censurer, knowing that he is pointing out his faults and guiding him to his shortcomings and directing him to his good deeds. For it has been said, "The essence of humility is that you dislike being mentioned for righteousness and piety." And it has been narrated in some reports what is a back-breaker for the likes of us, if authentic, as it is narrated that he said, "Woe to the fasting person, and woe to the praying person, and woe to the wearer of wool, except for..." It was said, "O Messenger of God, except for whom?" He said, "Except for one whose soul has abstained from the world, loathed praise, and preferred blame." This is extremely severe, and the utmost aspiration for the likes of us is the second state, which is to conceal joy and dislike regarding the censurer and the praiser, and not to manifest that in speech or action. As for the third state, which is equanimity between the praiser and the censurer, we do not aspire to it. Then, if we examine ourselves for a sign of the second state, we find it lacking, for inevitably we hasten to honor the praiser and fulfill his needs, and are reluctant to honor the censurer, praise him, and fulfill his needs. We are unable to equalize between them in outward action, just as we are unable in the heart's secret. Whoever is capable of equanimity between the praiser and the censurer in outward action is truly worthy of being taken as a model in this age, if found, for he is the red sulfur of which people speak but do not see. How then about what is beyond it from the two ranks? And each one of these ranks also has degrees.

As for the degrees in praise: Among people are those who desire praise, commendation, and the spread of reputation, and they strive to attain that by every means possible, even to the point of showing off in acts of worship, and they do not care about abandoning prohibitions to win people's hearts and make their tongues speak praise—this one is among the perishing. Among them are those who want that and seek it through permissible means and not through acts of worship, and do not engage in prohibitions; this one is on the edge of a crumbling precipice, for the boundaries of speech that wins hearts and the boundaries of actions are such that he cannot regulate them, and he is likely to fall into what is not permissible to attain praise—he is very close to the perishing. Among them are those who do not desire praise nor strive to seek it, but if praised, joy rushes to his heart; if he does not counter that with struggle and does not force dislike, he is close to being drawn by the excess of joy to the rank before it. But if he struggles against himself in that and forces his heart to dislike and makes joy hateful to him by reflecting on the harms of praise, then he is in the peril of struggle, sometimes prevailing and sometimes being overcome. Among them are those who, when they hear praise, are not pleased by it, nor grieved by it, nor is it affected by it—this is upon goodness, even if a remnant of sincerity remains lacking. Among them are those who dislike praise when they hear it, but it does not reach the point of anger at the praiser and rebuking him; the utmost of his degrees is that he dislikes and becomes angry and manifests anger, being truthful in it, not that he manifests anger while his heart loves it, for that is hypocrisy itself, because he wants to show sincerity and truthfulness from himself while he is bankrupt of it.

Likewise, inversely, the conditions vary regarding the censurer, and the first of its degrees is showing anger, and the last is showing joy. Joy and its manifestation are only from one in whose heart there is wrath and malice against his own soul for its rebellion against him, its multitude of faults, its false promises, and its wicked deceptions, so he hates it with the hatred of an enemy. A person rejoices from one who censures his enemy, and this person's enemy is his own soul, so he rejoices when he hears its censure and thanks the censurer for that, and considers him perceptive and intelligent for having discerned its faults. Thus, that becomes like taking vengeance for him against himself, and it becomes a gain for him, for through censure he becomes lower in the sight of people so that he is not afflicted with the trial of people. And if good deeds are attributed to him, he does not exert effort in them, so his striving becomes better for his faults which he is incapable of removing. If the seeker were to struggle against himself his entire life in this single trait—that the censurer and praiser become equal to him—it would be an all-engrossing occupation for him, leaving him no leisure for anything else. Between him and felicity are many obstacles; this is one of them. And he does not overcome any of them except through intense struggle over a long lifetime.

The Second Part of the Book

In Seeking Status and Position Through Acts of Worship

This is Hypocrisy (Riya'): Herein lies an exposition on the censure of hypocrisy, an exposition on the reality of hypocrisy and what is shown off, an exposition on the degrees of hypocrisy; an exposition on hidden hypocrisy; an exposition on what nullifies deeds due to hypocrisy and what does not nullify them; an exposition on the remedy and cure for hypocrisy; an exposition on the dispensation for displaying acts of obedience and the dispensation for concealing sins; an exposition on abandoning acts of obedience for fear of hypocrisy and corruptions, and an exposition on what is valid from a servant's zeal for acts of worship due to seeing other people; and an exposition on what the spiritual seeker must bind his heart to before the act of obedience and after it. These are ten chapters, and success is from God.

An Exposition on the Censure of Ostentation

Know that ostentation is forbidden, and the ostentatious person is detested in the sight of God. This is attested by verses, reports, and traditions.

As for the verses: There is His Exalted Word: "So woe to those who pray, who are heedless of their prayer, who make a show." And His Mighty and Glorious Word: "Those who plot evil deeds—for them is a severe punishment, and the plotting of such will come to nothing." Mujahid said: They are the people of ostentation. And He said: "We feed you only for the sake of God’s Countenance; we desire no reward from you, nor thanks." Thus He praised the sincere by negating any desire other than seeking God’s Countenance, while ostentation is its opposite. And He said: "So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work and associate no one in the worship of his Lord." This was later revealed concerning those who seek reward and praise through their acts of worship and deeds.

As for the narrations: Indeed, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said when a man asked him, "O Messenger of God, wherein lies salvation?" He replied, "That the servant does not perform an act of obedience to God while intending thereby [to impress] people." And Abu Hurairah said in the hadith of the three—the one slain in the path of God, the one who gives charity with his wealth, and the one who recites the Book of God, as we have cited in the Book of Sincerity—"And God, Mighty and Majestic, says to each one of them: 'You have lied. Rather, you intended that it be said, "So-and-so is generous." You have lied. Rather, you intended that it be said, "So-and-so is courageous." You have lied. Rather, you intended that it be said, "So-and-so is a reciter."'" So the Prophet (peace be upon him) informed "that they are rewarded, but their ostentation is what nullified their deeds." And Ibn 'Umar (may God be pleased with them both) said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever shows off, God will expose him. And whoever makes himself heard [for fame], God will make him heard [for disgrace]." And in another lengthy hadith: "Indeed, God, Exalted is He, says to His angels, 'This one did not intend Me with his deed, so place him in Sijjeen.'" And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Indeed, the thing I fear most for you is the lesser polytheism." They said, "And what is the lesser polytheism, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Ostentation. God, Mighty and Majestic, says on the Day of Resurrection when He recompenses the servants for their deeds: 'Go to those for whom you used to show off in the world and see if you find any reward with them.'" And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Seek refuge with God, Mighty and Majestic, from the pit of sorrow." It was said, "And what is it, O Messenger of God?" He said, "A valley in Hell, prepared for the reciters who show off." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "God, Mighty and Majestic, says: 'Whoever performs a deed for Me in which he associates another with Me, it is wholly for that other, and I am free of it. I am the Most Rich of the rich, free of any association.'" And Jesus the Messiah (peace be upon him) said: "When it is the day of fasting for one of you, let him oil his head and beard and wipe his lips, so that people do not see that he is fasting. And when he gives with his right hand, let him conceal it from his left. And when he prays, let him lower the curtain of his door, for God apportions praise as He apportions provision." And our Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "God, Mighty and Majestic, does not accept any deed in which there is an atom's weight of ostentation." And 'Umar said to Mu'adh ibn Jabal when he saw him weeping, "What makes you weep?" He said, "A hadith I heard from the occupant of this grave," meaning the Prophet (peace be upon him), "saying, 'The slightest ostentation is polytheism.'" And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The thing I fear most for you is ostentation and hidden desire," which also returns to the sins and subtleties of ostentation. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Indeed, in the shade of the Throne on a day when there is no shade except its shade, will be a man who gave charity with his right hand and almost concealed it from his left." And for that reason, it has been reported that "the virtue of a secret deed over an open one is seventyfold." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Indeed, the one who shows off will be called out to on the Day of Resurrection: 'O transgressor, O betrayer, O show-off! Your deed is lost and your reward is nullified. Go and take your reward from the one for whom you were working.'" And Shaddad ibn Aws said: "I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) weeping, so I said, 'What makes you weep, O Messenger of God?' He said, 'I fear for my community polytheism. Not that they will worship an idol, or the sun, or the moon, or a stone, but they will show off with their deeds.'" And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "When God created the earth, it swayed with its inhabitants, so He created the mountains and made them pegs for the earth. The angels said, 'Our Lord has not created a creation mightier than the mountains.' Then God created iron, and it cut the mountains. Then He created fire, and it melted the iron. Then God commanded water to extinguish the fire, and commanded the wind to stir the water. The angels differed and said, 'We ask God, Exalted is He.' They said, 'O Lord, what is the mightiest thing You have created among Your creation?' God, Exalted is He, said, 'I have not created a creation mightier for Me than the heart of the son of Adam when he gives charity with his right hand and conceals it from his left. This is the mightiest creation I have created.'" And 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak narrated with his chain from a man that he said to Mu'adh ibn Jabal: "Relate to me a hadith you heard from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)." He said: Mu'adh wept until I thought he would not stop, then he became silent, then said: I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) say to me, "O Mu'adh." I said, "At your service, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of God." He said, "I will tell you a narration; if you preserve it, it will benefit you, and if you neglect it and do not preserve it, your plea will be cut off before God on the Day of Resurrection. O Mu'adh, God, Exalted is He, created seven angels before He created the heavens and the earth. Then He created the heavens and appointed for each of the seven heavens an angel as its gatekeeper, having clothed him in greatness. The recording angels ascend with the deed of a servant from morning until evening, its light like the light of the sun, until when they ascend with it to the lowest heaven, they purify it and multiply it. Then the angel says to the recording angels, 'Strike the face of the owner of this deed with it. I am the angel of backbiting; my Lord commanded me not to let any deed of one who backbites people pass beyond me to another.'" He said, "Then the recording angels come with a righteous deed from the deeds of the servant, and it passes by, and they purify it and multiply it until it reaches the second heaven. The angel entrusted with it says to them, 'Stop, and strike the face of the owner of this deed with it. He intended with this deed the worldly status. My Lord commanded me not to let his deed pass beyond me to another; he used to boast with it among people in their gatherings.'" He said, "And the recording angels ascend with a deed whose light rejoices from charity, fasting, and prayer, which amazed the recording angels, and they pass with it to the third heaven. The angel entrusted with it says to them, 'Stop and strike the face of the owner of this deed with it. I am the angel of arrogance; my Lord commanded me not to let his deed pass beyond me to another; he used to be arrogant over people in their gatherings.'" He said, "And the recording angels ascend with the deed of the servant, shining as the shining star shines, with a hum from glorification, prayer, Hajj, and 'Umrah, until they pass with it to the fourth heaven. The angel entrusted with it says to them, 'Stop and strike the face of the owner of this deed with it. Strike his back and his belly with it. I am the angel of self-admiration; my Lord commanded me not to let his deed pass beyond me to another; when he performed a deed, he introduced self-admiration into his deed.'" He said, "And the recording angels ascend with the deed of the servant until they pass with it to the fifth heaven, as if it were a bride escorted to her family. The angel entrusted with it says to them, 'Stop and strike the face of the owner of this deed with it, and carry it on his shoulder. I am the angel of envy. He used to envy people who learn and act like his deed, and everyone who attained a virtue in worship, he envied them and fell into it. My Lord commanded me not to let his deed pass beyond me to another.'" He said, "And the recording angels ascend with a deed of the servant from prayer, zakah, Hajj, 'Umrah, and fasting, and they pass with it to the sixth heaven. The angel entrusted

As for the narrations: It is related that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, saw a man bowing his neck and said: “O you with the neck, raise your head! Humility is not in the necks; humility is in the hearts.” And Abu Umamah al-Bahili saw a man in the mosque weeping in his prostration and said: “You, you! If only this were in your home.” And ‘Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: “The hypocrite has three signs: he is lazy when alone, active when among people; he increases in action when praised and decreases when censured.” And a man said to ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit: “I fight with my sword in the path of God, desiring thereby the Face of God the Exalted and the praise of people.” He said: “You have nothing.” He asked him three times, and each time he said: “You have nothing.” Then he said on the third: “Indeed God says: ‘I am the Most Rich, the Most Independent of any partner...’” (the hadith). And a man asked Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab, saying: “When one of us does a good deed, he loves to be praised and rewarded.” He said to him: “Would you love to be hated?” He said: “No.” He said: “Then when you perform a deed for God, make it sincere.” And al-Dahhak said: “Let none of you say, ‘This is for the Face of God and for your face,’ nor say, ‘This is for God and for kinship,’ for God the Exalted has no partner.” And ‘Umar struck a man with a whip and then said to him: “Take retaliation from me!” He said: “No, rather I relinquish it for God and for you.” ‘Umar said to him: “You have done nothing. Either you relinquish it for me, so I am indebted, or you relinquish it for God alone.” He said: “I relinquish it for God alone.” He said: “Then it is well.” And al-Hasan said: “I have kept company with people such that if wisdom presented itself to one of them, had he spoken it, it would have benefited him and his companions, but nothing prevented him from it except fear of fame. And if one of them passed by and saw harm in the road, nothing prevented him from removing it except fear of fame.” And it is said: “The hypocrite will be called on the Day of Resurrection by four names: ‘O hypocrite, O betrayer, O loser, O wicked one! Go and take your reward from the one for whom you worked, for you have no reward with Us.’” And al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad said: “They used to show off with what they did, but today they show off with what they do not do.” And ‘Ikrimah said: “Indeed God gives the servant according to his intention what He does not give him according to his action, because the intention has no hypocrisy in it.” And al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, said: “The hypocrite seeks to overcome the decree of God the Exalted. He is a man of evil who wishes people to say he is a righteous man. How can they say that when he has taken with his Lord the station of the wicked? The hearts of the believers must recognize him.” And Qatadah said: “When a servant shows off, God the Exalted says: ‘Look at My servant, mocking Me.’” And Malik ibn Dinar al-Farra’ said: “There are three kinds of reciters: reciters of the All-Merciful, reciters of the world, and reciters of kings. And Muhammad ibn Wasil is among the reciters of the All-Merciful.” And al-Fadl said: “Whoever wishes to look upon a hypocrite, let him look at me.” And Muhammad ibn al-Mubarak al-Suri said: “Display solemn demeanor by night, for it is nobler than your demeanor by day, because demeanor by day is for the creation and demeanor by night is for the Lord of the worlds.” And Abu Sulayman said: “Guarding against [showing] an action is more difficult than the action itself.” And Ibn al-Mubarak said: “A man would circumambulate the House while he was in Khurasan.” It was said to him: “How is that?” He said: “He loved that it not be mentioned that he was a resident of Mecca.” And Ibrahim ibn Adham said: “He has not been truthful to God who desires to become famous.”

An Exposition on the Reality of Ostentation and That Which is Done to Show Off

Know that ostentation (riya') is derived from "seeing," and reputation-seeking (sum'ah) from "hearing." Ostentation fundamentally means seeking status in the hearts of people by displaying to them traits of goodness, except that prestige and status are sought in the heart through deeds other than acts of worship, and also through acts of worship. The term "ostentation" is conventionally specific to seeking status in hearts through worship and displaying it. Thus, the definition of ostentation is: intending that creatures observe one's obedience to God. Therefore, the ostentatious person is the worshipper, and those for whom ostentation is performed are the people whose observation is sought to gain status in their hearts. That which is displayed ostentatiously are the traits that the ostentatious person intends to show, and ostentation itself is his intention to display that. The objects of ostentation are many, summarized in five categories, which encompass all that a servant adorns himself with before people: the body, attire, speech, actions, followers, and external things. Likewise, the people of this world engage in ostentation through these five causes, except that seeking prestige and intending ostentation through deeds not among the acts of obedience is less severe than ostentation through acts of worship.

The First Category: Ostentation in Religion through the Body: This is by displaying emaciation and pallor to feign thereby intense striving and profound grief over the affairs of religion and the overpowering fear of the Hereafter, and to indicate by the emaciation scant eating and by the pallor night vigils, abundant striving, and immense sorrow for religion. Likewise, one shows off by disheveling the hair to indicate by it total preoccupation with concern for religion and lack of leisure to comb the hair. Whenever these causes become apparent, people infer from them these matters, and the soul finds comfort in their recognition; therefore, the soul urges him to display them to attain that comfort. Similar to this is lowering the voice, making the eyes appear sunken, and letting the lips become withered, so that it may be inferred from this that he is persistent in fasting, and that either the dignity of the Sacred Law is what lowered his voice or the weakness from hunger is what diminished his strength. Concerning this, Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "When any of you fasts, let him anoint his head, groom his hair, and apply kohl to his eyes." Similarly, it is reported from Abu Hurairah, and all of that is due to what is feared for him from the incitement of Satan through ostentation; and for that reason Ibn Mas'ud said: "Become fasting people who are anointed." This is the ostentation of the people of religion through the body.

As for the people of this world, they seek to be seen by displaying plumpness, a clear complexion, a well-proportioned stature, a handsome face, cleanliness of the body, and the strength and symmetry of the limbs.

The second type is ostentation in appearance and attire. As for appearance, it includes disheveling the hair of the head, shaving the mustache, lowering the head while walking, moving with subdued calmness, leaving the mark of prostration on the face, wearing coarse garments and woolen clothes, hiking them up near the shin, shortening the sleeves, neglecting to clean one's garment and leaving it torn—all of this is done ostentatiously to display oneself as following the Sunnah in these matters and emulating the righteous servants of God in them. Among these is wearing patched garments, praying on a prayer mat, and wearing blue garments in imitation of the Sufis while being bankrupt of the true realities of Sufism inwardly. Also included is draping the waist-wrapper over the turban and letting the cloak fall over the eyes so that one may be seen as having reached such austerity as to be wary of the dust of the road, and so that eyes may be drawn to him due to his distinction by that sign. Likewise, wearing the scholar's robe and mantle by one who is devoid of knowledge, to give the impression that he is among the people of knowledge.

The hypocrites in attire are of various ranks: Among them are those who seek status with the pious by displaying asceticism, so they don tattered, dirty, short, coarse garments to show off through their coarseness, filth, shortness, and tatters that they are unconcerned with the world. Were he compelled to wear a moderate, clean garment of the kind the early righteous wore, it would be to him like slaughter, for fear that people would say he has turned away from asceticism, receded from that path, and desired the world. Another rank seeks acceptance from the righteous and from worldly people—kings, ministers, and merchants. If they wore luxurious garments, the devout would reject them, and if they wore tattered, shabby clothes, the eyes of kings and the wealthy would scorn them. Thus, they wish to combine acceptance from both the religious and the worldly, so they seek fine wools, delicate wraps, dyed patched garments, and thin shawls to wear them. Perhaps the value, color, and appearance of a wealthy man's garment matches that of the righteous, so they seek acceptance from both groups. Were these compelled to wear a rough or dirty garment, it would be to them like slaughter, fearing to fall from the eyes of kings and the wealthy. And were they compelled to wear fine brocade, delicate white linen, or embroidered silk—even if its value were less than their own garments—it would be grave upon them, fearing that the righteous would say they have inclined to the attire of worldly people. Each rank among them sees their station in a specific attire, so shifting to what is beneath it—even if permissible—becomes burdensome, out of fear of blame.

As for the people of this world, their ostentation lies in precious garments, lofty mounts, and varieties of extravagance and adornment in clothing, dwellings, and household furnishings, as well as in the abundance of horses, dyed garments, and valuable cloaks. This is evident among people, for they wear coarse garments in their homes and would be distressed if they appeared before others in that state without having exaggerated in embellishment.

The third: Ostentation in speech—the ostentation of religious people through preaching, admonition, speaking wisdom, and memorizing reports and traditions, for the purpose of using them in discourse and to display an abundance of knowledge, indicating intense concern for the conditions of the righteous predecessors; moving the lips in remembrance in the presence of people; commanding right and forbidding wrong in the sight of creation; displaying anger at wrongdoings and showing sorrow over people’s commission of sins; lowering the voice in speech and softening it in reciting the Qur’an, to thereby indicate fear and grief; claiming memorization of a hadith and meeting with scholars; meticulously correcting one who narrates a hadith by pointing out a flaw in its wording, so that it may be known he is discerning in hadiths; hastening to declare a hadith sound or unsound to show excellence therein; and arguing with the aim of silencing an opponent so that people may see his strength in religious knowledge. Ostentation in speech is abundant and its types are innumerable.

As for worldly people, their ostentation in speech lies in memorizing poems and proverbs, using eloquent expressions, mastering rare grammar to confound people of merit, and displaying affection toward others to win over hearts.

The fourth type is ostentation in deeds: such as when the one who prays displays lengthy standing, prolonged bowing, extended prostration, deep inclination of the head, refraining from turning aside, and exhibiting calmness and stillness, aligning the feet and hands. Likewise, in fasting, fighting in the way of God, pilgrimage, charity, feeding others, and in humility while walking when meeting others—such as lowering the eyelids, bowing the head, and speaking with gravity—to the extent that the ostentatious person may hasten in walking toward his need, but if someone from among the people of religion appears to him, he returns to gravity and inclines his head, fearing that he will be ascribed to haste and lack of dignity. Then, if the man is absent, he reverts to his haste; if he sees him, he returns to his humility. He does not bring to mind the remembrance of God in order to renew humility for Him; rather, it is for the notice of a person upon him, fearing that he will not be believed to be among the worshippers and the righteous. Among them is he who, upon hearing this, feels ashamed that his walking in seclusion differs from his walking in the sight of people, so he forces himself to walk well in seclusion so that when people see him, he will not need to change and he thinks he is thereby freed from ostentation—yet his ostentation has thereby multiplied, for he has become in his seclusion also ostentatious. Indeed, he only improves his walking in seclusion to be so in public, not out of fear of God and shame before Him.

As for the people of this world, their ostentation lies in strutting and swaggering, swinging their hands, shortening their steps, clutching the edges of their garments, and swaying their shoulders—all to display their status and dignity.

The fifth is ostentation through companions, visitors, and associates: such as one who contrives to have a scholar visit him so it may be said that so-and-so visited so-and-so, or a devout worshipper so it may be said that religious people seek blessings by visiting him and frequent his company, or a king among kings or an official of the sultan so it may be said that they seek blessings through him due to his high rank in religion. And such as one who frequently mentions the shaykhs to appear as though he has met many shaykhs and benefited from them, thus boasting of his shaykhs—and his boasting and ostentation seep from him during disputes, so he says to another: “Which shaykhs have you met? For I have met so-and-so and so-and-so, traveled the lands, and served the shaykhs?” and the like. These are the main arenas in which the ostentatious show off, and all of them seek through this prestige and status in the hearts of people. Among them are those content with favorable opinions held of them—how many a monk has secluded himself in his monastery for many years? And how many a worshipper has withdrawn to a mountain cave for a long duration, yet concealed himself only because he knew his prestige remained in the hearts of creation? Had he known they attributed a sin to him in his monastery or hermitage, his heart would have been disturbed, and he would not have been content with God’s knowledge of his innocence; rather, his grief would intensify, and he would strive by every means to remove that from their hearts, even though he had severed his hope for their wealth—but he loves mere prestige, for it is pleasurable as we mentioned in its causes—since it is a kind of power and perfection in the moment, though swiftly vanishing, and none are deceived by it except the ignorant, yet most people are ignorant. Among the ostentatious are those not content with establishing their status but seek from it the tongue’s release in praise and commendation. Among them are those who desire fame to spread across the lands so that many journey to them. Among them are those who wish to become known to kings so that their intercession is accepted and needs are fulfilled through their hands, thereby gaining prestige among the common folk. Among them are those who aim through this to amass possessions and acquire wealth, even from endowments and the wealth of orphans and other unlawful sources—and these are the worst category of the ostentatious who show off through the means we have mentioned. This is the reality of ostentation and that through which ostentation occurs.

If you ask: Is ostentation forbidden, disliked, permissible, or is there a detailed ruling? I say: There is a detailed ruling. Ostentation is the pursuit of status, and it is either through acts of worship or through other matters. If it is through other than acts of worship, it is the pursuit of worldly gain, and it is not forbidden in itself, as it is the pursuit of a place in the hearts of people. However, just as wealth can be acquired through deceit and prohibited means, so too can status. And just as acquiring a small amount of wealth that a person needs is praiseworthy, so too is acquiring a small amount of status that protects one from harm also praiseworthy. This is what Joseph, peace be upon him, sought when he said, "Indeed, I am a guardian, knowledgeable." And just as wealth contains a deadly poison and a beneficial antidote, so too does status. And just as abundant wealth distracts, leads to arrogance, and makes one forgetful of the remembrance of God and the Final Abode, so too does abundant status—indeed, more severely so. The trial of status is greater than the trial of wealth. And just as we say that possessing abundant wealth is forbidden, we do not say that possessing the hearts of many is forbidden, unless the abundance of wealth and status leads one to engage in what is impermissible. Indeed, the preoccupation of the heart with expanding one's status is the origin of evils, just as the preoccupation with amassing wealth is. The lover of status and wealth is incapable of abandoning the sins of the heart, the tongue, and others. As for having a wide status without you being eager to seek it and without being grieved if it vanishes, then there is no harm in it. There is no status wider than the status of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the status of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the religious scholars after them. However, the preoccupation of the heart with seeking status is a deficiency in religion, though it is not described as forbidden. Based on this, we say: Adorning the garment one wears when going out to people is ostentation, and it is not forbidden because it is not ostentation in worship but in worldly matters. Apply this analogy to all beautification and adornment for people. The proof for this is what was narrated from Aisha, may God be pleased with her: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, intended to go out one day to his companions, and he looked into the water vessel, straightened his turban, and arranged his hair. She said, "Do you do that, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Yes, for God Almighty loves that when a servant goes out to his brothers, he adorns himself for them." Indeed, this was from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, an act of worship because he was commanded to call the creation and encourage them to follow him and to win their hearts. Had he fallen in their eyes, they would not have been inclined to follow him. It was incumbent upon him to show them the goodness of his states so that their eyes would not look down upon him, for the eyes of the common people are drawn to outward appearances, not inner realities. That was the intention of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. But if someone intends by this to make himself appear good in their eyes out of caution from their blame and censure, and seeking comfort in their respect and honor, then he has intended a permissible matter, for a person may guard against the pain of blame and seek the comfort of intimacy with brothers. If they find him burdensome and despicable, he will not find intimacy with them.

Thus, ostentation in matters not pertaining to acts of worship may be permissible, may be an act of obedience, or may be blameworthy, depending on the intended purpose behind it. Therefore, we say: If a man spends his wealth on a group of wealthy people, not in the context of worship or charity, but so that people may believe him to be generous, this is ostentation and is not forbidden, and likewise are its examples.

As for acts of worship such as charity, prayer, fasting, military expedition, and pilgrimage, the hypocritical show-off has two states concerning them.  
One is that he has no intention except pure ostentation, without seeking reward. This invalidates his worship, for deeds are judged by intentions, and this is not an intention for worship. It does not merely render his worship futile, so that we say he returns as he was before the act; rather, he sins thereby and incurs guilt, as indicated by the reports and verses.

The meaning herein comprises two aspects. The first pertains to the servants of God, which is deception and guile, for he made it appear to them that he was sincere and obedient to God and that he was among the people of religion, while he was not so. Deception in worldly matters is also forbidden; even if he settled the debts of a group and made people believe he was donating to them so they would think him generous, he would sin because of the deception involved and the capturing of hearts through trickery and guile. The second aspect pertains to God, which is that whenever one intends, by worshipping God the Exalted, to create [an impression] among God's creation, he is mocking God. For this reason, Qatadah said: When a servant shows off, God says to His angels, "Look at him, how he mocks Me."

An example is one who stands before a king throughout the day, as is the custom of servants, yet his standing is only to observe a maiden among the king's maidens or a lad among his attendants. This is mockery of the king, for he did not intend closeness to the king through his service, but rather aimed thereby at one of his servants. What greater contempt is there than for a servant to intend, through obedience to God Most High, the showing off to a weak servant who possesses for him neither harm nor benefit? Is that not because he imagines that servant more capable of attaining his desires than God? And that he is more deserving of closeness than God, since he prefers him over the King of Kings, making him the object of his worship? What mockery exceeds elevating the servant above the Master? This is among the major destructive sins, and for this reason the Messenger of God ﷺ called it the lesser polytheism.

Indeed, some degrees of ostentation are more severe than others—as will be explained in the degrees of ostentation, if God Almighty wills—and nothing of it is free from a grave or light sin according to what the ostentation entails. Even if there were nothing in ostentation except that one prostrates and bows to other than God, that would be sufficient, for even if he did not intend drawing near to God, he intended other than God. By my life, if he were to magnify other than God through prostration, he would have committed clear unbelief. However, ostentation is hidden unbelief, because the ostentatious person has magnified people in his heart, and that magnification necessitated that he prostrate and bow, so the people are the ones magnified through prostration in a sense. Whenever the intention to magnify God through prostration vanishes and the magnification of creation remains, that is close to polytheism, except that he intended to magnify himself in the heart of the one he magnifies by displaying from himself the appearance of magnifying God. Hence, this is hidden polytheism, not clear polytheism, and that is the utmost ignorance. None embarks upon it except one whom Satan has deceived and made him imagine that the servants possess more of his harm, benefit, provision, term, worldly interests, and ultimate outcome than what God Almighty possesses. Therefore, he turned his face away from God toward them and directed his heart to them to win over their hearts thereby. If God Almighty were to entrust him to them in this world and the Hereafter, that would be the least recompense for his deed, for all servants are incapable regarding themselves; they possess no benefit or harm for themselves, so how could they possess it for others? This is in this world, so what about a day when no parent can avail his child, nor can any child avail his parent anything? Rather, the prophets will say therein, "Myself, myself!" How then does the ignorant one exchange the reward of the Hereafter and attaining nearness to God for what he anticipates through his false greed in this world from people? Thus, we should not doubt that the ostentatious person, through obeying God, is in the displeasure of God from both transmitted and rational perspectives—this is if he did not intend the reward. As for if he intended both the reward and praise together in his charity or prayer, that is the polytheism which contradicts sincerity. We have mentioned its ruling in the Book of Sincerity, and what we have transmitted from the narrations is indicated by the saying of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: Indeed, he has no reward in it at all.

An Exposition on the Degrees of Ostentation

Know that some doors of ostentation are more severe and grave than others, and its variation lies in the difference of its pillars and the disparity of degrees within it. Its pillars are three: that by which one shows off, that for the sake of which one shows off, and the very intention of ostentation itself.

The First Pillar: The intention of ostentation itself. This cannot be free from one of two states: either it is purely for ostentation without any intention to worship God, Exalted is He, and attain reward; or it is coupled with the intention to attain reward. If it is the latter, then it cannot be free from one of three further states: either the desire for reward is stronger and predominant, or it is weaker, or it is equal to the desire for worship. Thus, the degrees become four.

The **First Degree**, which is the most severe, is when the person does not desire the reward at all. Like one who prays in the presence of people, but if he were alone, he would not pray. He might even pray without ritual purity when among people. This one's intention is purely for ostentation, and he is the one detested by God, Exalted is He. Similarly, one who gives charity out of fear of people's blame, not intending the reward, nor would he have given it if he were alone with himself—this is the highest degree of ostentation.

The second type is when one also intends to seek reward, but this intention is weak, such that if one were in seclusion, one would not perform the act, and that intention would not compel one to act. Yet, if there were no intention for reward, ostentation would drive one to perform it. This is similar to the previous case, and the taint of seeking reward within it—which is insufficient to compel action—does not remove from it the divine displeasure and sin.

The third type is when one's intention for reward and intention for ostentation are equal, such that if either were absent alone, it would not motivate the action, but when combined, desire is stirred; or when each, if isolated, would independently suffice to prompt the action. This has corrupted as much as it has rectified, so we hope it may be balanced—neither in his favor nor against him—or that his reward equals his punishment. However, the apparent meanings of the reports indicate he will not be safe, and we have discussed this in the Book of Sincerity.

The fourth: that people's awareness serves as an incentive and reinforcement for his diligence, for were it not so, he would not abandon worship. If the intention of ostentation alone were present, he would not have proceeded with it. What we believe—and knowledge rests with God—is that it does not nullify the foundation of the reward, but rather diminishes from it, or he is punished according to the measure of his intention for ostentation and rewarded according to the measure of his intention for reward. As for His saying, "God says: I am the Most Self-Sufficient of the self-sufficient, free from any association," it is interpreted as applying when the two intentions are equal or when the intention of ostentation predominates.

The second pillar: Ostentation in it, which pertains to acts of obedience, and this is divided into ostentation concerning the fundamental acts of worship and ostentation concerning their specific attributes.

The first category, which is the most severe: ostentation in the fundamentals of faith, and it comprises three levels.

The first type is ostentation concerning the very foundation of faith. This is the gravest form of ostentation, and its practitioner is consigned eternally to the Fire. It is he who utters the two testimonies of faith outwardly, while his inner being is filled with denial, yet he displays the external appearance of Islam. This is the one whom God, exalted is He, mentioned in His Book in various places, such as His saying, mighty and majestic: "When the hypocrites come to you, they say, 'We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God.' And God knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and God bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars" — meaning in their indication by their speech of what is in their hearts. And He, exalted is He, said: "And among the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life, and he calls God to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the fiercest of opponents. And when he turns away, he strives upon the earth to cause corruption therein." And He, exalted is He, said: "And when they meet you, they say, 'We believe,' but when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage." And He, exalted is He, said: "They show off to people and do not remember God except a little, wavering between that." The verses concerning them are many. Hypocrisy was prevalent in the early days of Islam among those who entered the outward appearance of Islam initially for a purpose, and this has become less common in our time. However, hypocrisy is now prevalent among those who slip away from the religion inwardly, denying Paradise, the Fire, and the Abode of the Hereafter, inclining toward the statements of the atheists; or who believe in accordance with the foundation of the Sacred Law and its rulings while inclining toward the people of permissiveness; or who hold to disbelief or innovation while displaying its opposite. These are among the hypocrites and ostentatious ones who are consigned eternally to the Fire. There is no ostentation beyond this ostentation. The state of these people is more severe than that of the disbelievers who are open in their disbelief, for they have combined the inner disbelief with the hypocrisy of the outward appearance.

The second type is ostentation in the fundamentals of worship while affirming the foundation of faith. This too is grave in the sight of God, yet far lesser than the first. Its example is when a man’s wealth is in another’s possession, and he orders him to pay the zakah out of fear of blame, while God knows that had it been in his own hand he would not have paid it. Or when the time of prayer arrives while he is in company, though his habit in solitude is to abandon prayer. Likewise, he fasts Ramadan while longing for seclusion from people in order to break the fast. Or he attends the Friday prayer, though were it not for fear of blame he would not attend. Or he maintains kinship ties or treats his parents dutifully not out of desire but from fear of people. Or he goes on military expedition or performs pilgrimage in the same manner. This is hypocrisy accompanied by the root of faith in God—he believes there is no deity but Him, and if he were compelled to worship other than God or prostrate to another he would not do it. Yet he abandons acts of worship out of laziness and becomes diligent when people are watching, so that his standing with creation becomes dearer to him than his standing with the Creator. His fear of people’s blame is greater than his fear of God’s punishment, and his desire for their pleasure is stronger than his desire for God’s reward. This is the height of ignorance, and how deserving is its possessor of contempt—even though he has not entirely severed from the root of faith in terms of belief.

The third type is not showing off with faith or obligatory acts, but rather with supererogatory and recommended practices which, if omitted, would not constitute disobedience. However, he neglects them in private due to the weakening of his desire for their reward and his preference for the pleasure of laziness over the hoped-for recompense. Then ostentation spurs him to perform them, such as attending congregational prayer, visiting the sick, following funeral processions, washing the deceased, exerting oneself in night prayer, fasting on the Day of Arafah, Ashura, and on Mondays and Thursdays. Indeed, the ostentatious person may do all of this out of fear of blame or seeking praise, while God Almighty knows that if he were alone with himself, he would not go beyond performing the obligatory acts. This too is grave, but it is less than what preceded it, for the former preferred the praise of creation over the praise of the Creator, while this one has also done that and feared the blame of creation more than the blame of the Creator. Thus, the blame of creation became greater in his sight than the punishment of God. As for this one, he did not do it because he did not fear punishment for abandoning a supererogatory act if he were to abandon it, and it is as if he is at half of the first, and his punishment is half of his. This is ostentation in the foundations of worship.

The second category: Ostentation in the attributes of worship, not in its foundations, and it is also of three degrees.

The first type is to engage in ostentation by performing an act whose omission would diminish the worship, such as one whose aim is to lighten the bowing and prostration and not prolong the recitation, yet when people see him, he improves his bowing and prostration, refrains from turning his head, and completes the sitting between the two prostrations. Indeed, Ibn Mas'ud said, "Whoever does that, it is a contempt that he shows contempt with toward his Lord, Mighty and Majestic is He;" meaning that he does not care about God's awareness of him in seclusion, but when a human being observes him, he improves the prayer. And whoever sits before a person cross-legged or reclining, then his servant enters, so he sits upright and improves his sitting posture, that is from him giving precedence to the servant over the master and inevitably showing contempt for the master. This is the condition of one who ostentatiously beautifies the prayer in public but not in private. Likewise, one who habitually gives zakah from defective dinars or from poor-quality grain, but when someone else observes him, he gives it from the good quality out of fear of their blame. Likewise, the fasting person guards his fast from backbiting and obscenity for the sake of people, not to complete the worship of fasting out of fear of blame. This too is from the prohibited ostentation because in it there is giving precedence to the creation over the Creator, but it is less than ostentation with the fundamentals of the acts of worship.

If the hypocrite says: "I only did that to protect their tongues from backbiting, for when they see the lightening of the bowing and prostration and the frequent turning of the head, they unleash their tongues in blame and backbiting, and I only intended to shield them from this sin?" Then it is said to him: This is a deception of Satan upon you and a confusion, and the matter is not so. For the harm from the deficiency in your prayer, which is a service from you to your Master, is greater than the harm from the backbiting of others. If your motive were religion, your concern for yourself would be greater. In this, you are but like one who presents a maidservant to a king to attain from him favor and an authority to assume—and he presents her to him while she is one-eyed, ugly, and with severed limbs, and he does not care about this if the king is alone. Yet if he is in the presence of some of his servants, he refrains out of fear of the censure of his servants. That is absurd; rather, whoever is mindful of the side of the king's servant, his vigilance toward the king should be greater.

For the show-off, there are two situations: one is that he seeks through it status and praise among people, and that is absolutely forbidden. The second is that he says, "Sincerity in beautifying the bowing and prostration does not come to me, and if I were to make them light, my prayer would be considered deficient by them, and people would harm me with their blame and backbiting. So, I benefit by beautifying my posture to repel their censure, and I do not hope for reward from God for it." This is better than abandoning the beautification of the prayer, thereby missing the reward and incurring blame. There is the slightest consideration in this. The correct view is that it is obligatory upon him to beautify and be sincere. If the intention does not come to him, he should continue with his habit in seclusion, for it is not for him to repel blame through showing off in an act of obedience to God, for that is mockery, as has preceded.

The second degree is to perform acts of ostentation in matters where omission incurs no deficiency, yet their performance is considered a completion and perfection of one's worship. Such as prolonging the bowing and prostration, extending the standing posture, beautifying one's outward form, raising the hands, hastening to the first takbir, perfecting the uprightness, and reciting more than the customary chapters. Likewise, frequent seclusion during the Ramadan fast and prolonged silence, or choosing the superior over the merely good in giving zakah, and manumitting an expensive slave for expiation. All of these are such that, if left to oneself, one would be incapable of them.

The third type is ostentation in additional acts beyond the supererogatory prayers themselves, such as attending congregational prayer before others, deliberately seeking the first row, positioning oneself to the right of the imam, and similar actions. All of these are matters wherein God knows that if the person were alone, he would not care where he stood or when he commenced the prayer. These are degrees of ostentation relative to what is performed for show, some being more severe than others, and all are blameworthy.

The third pillar: The ostentatious person, for he inevitably has an aim; he only shows off to attain wealth, status, or some objective without fail. This too has three levels:

The first and most severe form is when one's aim is to enable disobedience, such as a person who performs acts of worship ostentatiously, displays piety and scrupulousness through abundant supererogatory prayers, and abstains from consuming doubtful matters—all with the intention of being known for trustworthiness so that he may be appointed as a judge, administrator of endowments, executor of wills, or guardian of orphans' wealth, in order to seize it. Or so that the distribution of zakat or charitable donations is entrusted to him, enabling him to appropriate whatever portion he can. Or so that deposits are entrusted to him, which he then takes and denies. Or so that funds designated for expenditure on the pilgrimage route are handed to him, and he withholds some or all of them. Or so that he may use them to gain followers among the pilgrims and exploit their strength to achieve his corrupt aims in sins.

Some may even adopt the attire of Sufism, the demeanor of humility, and the speech of wisdom for the purpose of admonition and reminder, yet their true aim is to endear themselves to a woman or a youth for the sake of immorality. They may attend gatherings of knowledge, reminders, and Quranic circles, feigning eagerness to hear knowledge and the Quran, while their real objective is to gaze upon women and boys. Or they set out for pilgrimage with the aim of pursuing someone in the caravan—a woman or a youth. These are the most detestable hypocrites in the sight of God Almighty, for they have made obedience to their Lord a stepping stone to disobedience and have turned it into a tool, a trade, and merchandise for their own depravity.

Close to these, though lesser in degree, is one who has committed a crime of which he is accused and persists in it, yet seeks to clear himself of the accusation by displaying piety to dispel suspicion. Like one who denies a deposit entrusted to him, and when people accuse him of it, he gives charity so that it may be said, "He gives charity from his own wealth, so how could he appropriate the wealth of another?" Similarly, one who is accused of immorality with a woman or a youth and defends himself from the accusation through feigned humility and outward piety.

The second type is when one's aim is to attain a permissible share of worldly benefits—such as wealth or marriage to a beautiful or noble woman—like one who displays grief and weeping and occupies himself with preaching and reminding so that wealth may be bestowed upon him and women may desire to marry him. Thus, he intends either a specific woman to marry or a noble woman in general; or like one who desires to marry the daughter of a learned, devout man and so displays knowledge and devotion to make him desire to give his daughter in marriage to him. This is forbidden hypocrisy, because through obedience to God he seeks the enjoyment of worldly life, yet it is lesser than the first type, for what is sought through this is in itself permissible.

The third is when one does not intend to attain a share or acquire wealth or marriage, but displays his worship out of fear that he will be viewed with an eye of deficiency and not be counted among the elite and the ascetics, and that he will be considered among the common masses. Like one who walks hastily, then people notice him, so he improves his walking and abandons haste lest it be said that he is among the people of frivolity and heedlessness, not among the people of dignity. Similarly, if he is quick to laughter or joking appears from him, he fears that he will be seen with an eye of contempt, so he follows that with seeking forgiveness, sighing deeply, and displaying sorrow, saying, "How great is the heedlessness of the human being concerning himself!" And God knows about him that if he were in seclusion, that would not weigh heavily upon him. He only fears being viewed with an eye of contempt, not an eye of reverence. And like one who sees a group praying the Tarawih prayers, or performing night vigil, or fasting on Thursday and Monday, or giving charity, so he joins them for fear of being ascribed to laziness and being lumped with the common folk, whereas if he were alone with himself, he would not do any of that. And like one who is thirsty on the day of Arafah or Ashura or during the Sacred Months, so he does not drink for fear that people will know he is not fasting. Then, if they assume he is fasting, he refrains from eating for that reason. Or he is invited to food and refuses so that it may be thought he is fasting, though he may not explicitly state he is fasting but says, "I have an excuse." And he combines two vile things, for he sees himself as fasting, then sees himself as sincere, not a show-off, and that he is cautious from mentioning his worship to people so as not to be a hypocrite. Thus, he wants it to be said that he is concealing his worship. Then, if he is compelled to drink, he cannot refrain from mentioning an excuse for himself regarding it, explicitly or implicitly, by feigning an illness that necessitates excessive thirst and prevents fasting, or by saying, "I broke my fast to please so-and-so's heart." Then he may not mention that connected to his drinking so that it is not thought he is making excuses hypocritically, but he endures and then mentions his excuse in the course of a story incidentally; such as saying, "So-and-so loves the brethren greatly and is very eager for a person to eat from his food, and he insisted on me today, and I found no alternative but to please his heart." Or such as saying, "My mother is weak-hearted and compassionate towards me; she thinks that if I fasted a day I would fall ill, so she does not let me fast." This and what runs in its course are among the afflictions of hypocrisy, and it does not readily come to the tongue except due to the deep-rooted vein of hypocrisy within. As for the sincere one, he does not care how the creation views him. If he has no desire for fasting, and God knows that from him, he does not want others to believe something contrary to God's knowledge, for that would be deceptive. And if he has a desire for fasting for God's sake, he is content with the knowledge of God Almighty and does not associate anyone with Him in it. It may occur to him that in displaying it there is others following his example and stirring people's desire for it, but in that there is deceit and delusion—and an explanation of that and its conditions will come later.

These are the degrees of hypocrisy and the ranks of its various practitioners, all of whom are beneath the contempt and wrath of God. It is among the gravest causes of ruin, and so severe is it that it contains impurities more hidden than the crawling of ants, as the report has conveyed. Even leading scholars stumble therein, let alone ignorant worshippers, due to the maladies of the souls and the perils of the hearts. And God knows best.

Explanation of Hidden Ostentation, Which is More Subtle Than the Crawling of Ants

Know that ostentation is both manifest and hidden. The manifest is that which motivates and compels one to perform a deed, even if reward is intended, and this is its most evident form. Slightly more concealed than this is that which does not, by itself, compel one to perform a deed, yet it lightens the deed one intends for the sake of God's countenance. Like one who is accustomed to praying the night vigil every night and finds it burdensome, but when a guest stays with him, he becomes vigorous for it and finds it light, knowing that were it not for the hope of reward, he would not pray merely due to the ostentation for the guests.

More hidden than that is what does not affect the deed itself, nor its facilitation and lightening, yet it is nevertheless concealed within the heart. As long as it does not affect the invitation to perform the deed, it is only known by signs. The clearest sign of it is that one is pleased by people becoming aware of his obedience. For many a servant is sincere in his deed and does not believe in ostentation; rather, he detests it, rejects it, and completes the deed likewise. But if people become aware of it, he is pleased by that and finds comfort in it, and that alleviates from his heart the hardship of worship. This pleasure indicates a hidden ostentation within him from which the pleasure seeps. Were the heart not inclined towards people, his pleasure at people's awareness would not have appeared. Indeed, the ostentation was lying hidden in the heart like fire hidden in a stone, and the awareness of creation brought forth from it the trace of joy and pleasure. Then, if he feels the delight of pleasure due to awareness and does not counter that with aversion, it becomes nourishment and sustenance for the hidden vein of ostentation until it stirs within him with a subtle movement, so it demands in a subtle way that he contrive a means for people to become aware of him through allusion and casting speech indirectly, even if it does not lead to explicit statement. It may be so hidden that it does not lead to display through speech, whether allusive or explicit, but rather through mannerisms, such as displaying emaciation and pallor, lowering the voice, dryness of the lips, lack of saliva, traces of tears, and overwhelming drowsiness indicating lengthy night vigil.

More hidden than that is what is concealed to the extent that one does not desire people's awareness nor is pleased by the manifestation of his obedience. Yet, despite that, if he sees people, he loves that they initiate greeting him, that they meet him with cheerfulness and reverence, that they praise him, that they are eager in fulfilling his needs, that they are lenient with him in buying and selling, and that they make room for him. If someone falls short in this, it weighs heavily on his heart and he finds that strange within himself, as if he demands respect along with the obedience he has hidden, even though he has not been observed. Had that obedience not preceded from him, he would not have found people's shortcoming in his right strange. As long as the existence of worship is not like its non-existence in all that pertains to creation, one has not been content with God's knowledge and is not free from an admixture of hidden ostentation, more hidden than the crawling of ants. All of that is liable to nullify the reward, and none are safe from it except the truthful.

It has been narrated from Ali, may God honor his countenance, that he said: Indeed God, Mighty and Majestic, will say to the reciters on the Day of Resurrection, "Was not the price made affordable for you? Did you not initiate the greeting of peace? Were not your needs fulfilled?" And in the hadith: "You have no reward, for you have already received your full recompense." And Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak said: It is narrated from Wahb ibn Munabbih that he said: A man among the ascetics said to his companions, "We only left wealth and children fearing transgression, so we fear that there may have entered into this affair of ours from transgression more than what entered upon the people of wealth in their wealth. For if one of us meets someone, he loves to be honored due to his religious standing." This reached their king, so he rode out in a procession of people until the plain and the mountain were filled with people. The ascetic said, "What is this?" It was said, "The king has come upon you." He said to the servant, "Bring me some food." So he brought him herbs, oil, and tree-hearts. He began stuffing his cheek and eating voraciously. The king said, "Where is your companion?" They said, "This is he." He said, "How are you?" He said, "Like the people," and in another narration: "In good state." The king said, "There is no good in this one!" and turned away from him. The ascetic said, "Praise be to God who turned you away from me while you are my detractor." Thus, the sincere ones remained fearful of hidden ostentation, striving to deceive people concerning their righteous deeds, being more eager to conceal them than people are eager to conceal their indecencies. All of that hoping that their righteous deeds would be made pure, so that God would recompense them on the Day of Resurrection for their sincerity before an assembly of the pure, since they knew that God does not accept on the Day of Resurrection except what is pure, and they knew the severity of their need and poverty on the Day of Resurrection, and that it is a day when wealth will not avail, nor children, and no parent will be recompensed for their child. The truthful will be preoccupied with themselves, each one saying, "Myself! Myself!" let alone others. So they were like visitors to the House of God when they set out for Mecca, for they take with them pure Moroccan gold, knowing that the people of the desert do not accept counterfeit and tinsel. Need becomes severe in the wilderness, with no homeland to flee to and no intimate friend to cling to, so nothing saves except pure coin. Likewise, the possessors of hearts will witness on the Day of Resurrection, and the provision they have stored for it is piety. Therefore, the impurities of hidden ostentation are many and cannot be enumerated. Whenever one perceives in himself a distinction between whether a human or an animal observes his worship, there is in that a branch of ostentation. For when he cut off his hope from animals, he did not care whether animals or suckling infants were present or absent, whether they observed his movements or not. If he were sincere, content with God's knowledge, he would deem the intelligent among the worshippers as insignificant as he deems their infants and their insane, knowing that the intelligent cannot provide for him sustenance, nor term of life, nor increase in reward and decrease in punishment, just as animals, infants, and the insane cannot. If he does not find that, then there is in him a hidden impurity. However, not every impurity invalidates the reward and corrupts the deed; rather, there is gradation in it.

If you say: "We see no one free from joy when his acts of obedience become known. Is all joy blameworthy, or is some praiseworthy and some blameworthy?" We say: Firstly, not all joy is blameworthy; rather, joy is divided into praiseworthy and blameworthy.

As for the praiseworthy [rejoicing], it is of four types. The first is that one’s intention is to conceal the act of obedience and to be sincere to God alone. Yet when people become aware of it, he knows that God has made them aware and has manifested the beauty of his states, so he infers from this the goodness of God’s making for him, His care for him, and His subtle kindness toward him. For He veils both obedience and disobedience, then God veils his disobedience and reveals his obedience. And there is no subtle kindness greater than veiling what is ugly and displaying what is beautiful. Thus his joy is in the beauty of God’s regard, not in the praise of people or the standing he gains in their hearts. God Almighty has said, “Say: ‘In the bounty of God and in His mercy—in that let them rejoice.’” So it is as though it has become clear to him that he is accepted by God, and he rejoices in that.

The second is to infer from God's manifestation of beauty and concealment of ugliness upon him in this world that He will act likewise in the Hereafter, as the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "God does not conceal a sin for a servant in this world except that He will conceal it for him in the Hereafter." Thus, the first rejoices in acceptance in the present without regard for the future, while this one turns attention to the future.

The third is that he anticipates the desire of those who observe him to follow his example in obedience, thereby multiplying his reward. Thus, he receives the reward for public deeds through what he later manifests, and the reward for secret deeds through what he initially intended. And whoever follows him in an act of obedience receives a reward equal to that of the deeds of those who follow him, without anything being diminished from their rewards. Expecting this is truly worthy of being a cause of joy, for the appearance of signs of profit is delightful and inevitably brings about joy.

The fourth is that He is praised by those who witness His obedience, and He rejoices in their obedience to God through their praise and love for the obedient one, and in the inclination of their hearts toward obedience. For among the people of faith are those who see the people of obedience and despise them, envy them, blame them, mock them, or attribute their actions to hypocrisy, without praising them for it. This one rejoices in the sound faith of God's servants. The sign of sincerity in this type is that one's joy in praising others is like one's joy in being praised by them.

As for the blameworthy type, which is the fifth: it is that one rejoices due to the establishment of his status in the hearts of people, so that they praise him, honor him, attend to fulfilling his needs, and receive him with reverence in his comings and goings. This is reprehensible, and God, the Exalted, knows best.

Explanation of What Nullifies Works Through Hidden and Manifest Ostentation, and What Does Not

We say regarding this matter: When a servant establishes worship with sincerity, and then the thought of ostentation arises, it does so either after completing the act or before its completion. If it arises after completion, as a mere joy in being seen without any active display, this does not corrupt the deed, for the deed was completed with the attribute of sincerity, safe from ostentation. What occurs afterward, one hopes, will not revert to affect it, especially if he did not strive to display it or speak of it, nor did he wish for its display and mention, but its becoming known happened by God's will. From him, there was only what entered his heart of joy and contentment. Indeed, if the deed was completed with sincerity, without any intent of ostentation, but afterward a desire to display it appeared, so he spoke of it and made it known, this is a cause for fear.

In the transmitted reports and narrations, there are indications that it can nullify [the reward]. It has been narrated from Ibn Mas‘ud that he heard a man say, “I recited Surah al-Baqarah last night,” so he said, “That is his share from it.” And it has been narrated from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he said to a man who told him, “I have fasted perpetually, O Messenger of God,” so he said to him, “You have neither fasted nor broken your fast.” Some said he said that only because the man made it public, and it is said it is an allusion to the dislike of perpetual fasting. However it may be, it is plausible that this from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and from Ibn Mas‘ud is an inference that his heart during the worship was not free from the knot of ostentation and his aim for it, since he displayed speaking about it. For it is far-fetched that what occurs after the act would nullify the reward of the act; rather, the more reasonable position is to say that he is rewarded for his past act and punished for his ostentation through obeying God after completing it, unlike if his intention changed to ostentation before finishing the prayer, for that may invalidate the prayer and nullify the deed. As for if a thought of ostentation arises before finishing the prayer, for example, and he had formed the intention for sincerity, but a thought of ostentation occurs during it, then it is not free from either being mere delight that does not affect the act, or being ostentation that motivates the act. If it motivates the act and he concludes the worship with it, his reward is nullified. Its example is that he is in a voluntary prayer and a spectator appears to him, or a king from among kings is present while he desires to be seen by him, or he remembers something he forgot of his wealth and he wants to seek it, and were it not for the people he would have cut the prayer short, but he completes it fearing people’s blame—then his reward is nullified and he must repeat it if it was an obligatory prayer. And he, peace be upon him, said, “The deed is like a vessel: if its end is good, its beginning is good,” meaning looking to its conclusion. And it is narrated, “Whoever shows off for an hour, his previous deed is nullified.” This is applied to the prayer in this form, not to charity nor to recitation, for each part of those is separate, so what occurs spoils what remains, not what has passed; fasting and pilgrimage are of the category of prayer. As for if the thought of ostentation and the aim to beautify the prayer for the sake of their viewing occurs, and were they not present he would have completed it also, this is ostentation that has affected the act and has become a motive for the movements. If it overpowers until the feeling of the aim for worship and reward is effaced with it, and the aim of worship becomes submerged, then this too should corrupt the worship, however much a pillar of its pillars has passed in this manner, for we suffice with the prior intention at the commencement on the condition that nothing occurs to it that overpowers or submerges it. And it is plausible to say it does not corrupt the worship, considering the state of the intention and the persistence of the aim for the fundamental reward, even if weakened by the assault of an aim that is more dominant than it.

Indeed, the ascetic al-Muhasibi, may God have mercy upon him, went so far as to declare invalidation concerning a matter lighter than this. He said: If one intends nothing but mere delight in people becoming aware—meaning a delight akin to the love of status and prestige—he said: People have differed regarding this; thus, a group held that it invalidates because it nullifies the initial sincere resolve and leans toward the praise of created beings, and one did not seal his deed with sincerity, for a deed is only perfected by its conclusion. Then he said: Yet I do not decisively rule its invalidation, even if he did not increase the deed, nor do I deem him safe from it, and I had paused on it due to the disagreement among people. What predominates in my heart is that it invalidates if he seals his deed with ostentation. Then he said: If it is said, indeed al-Hasan, may God have mercy upon him, said: They are two states; if the first was present, the second does not harm him. And it has been narrated that a man said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "O Messenger of God, I conceal a deed, not desiring that anyone become aware of it, yet it becomes known and delights me." He said: "For you are two rewards: the reward of secrecy and the reward of openness." Then he discoursed on the report and the tradition, saying: As for al-Hasan, by his statement 'it does not harm him,' he meant that he does not abandon the deed, and the passing thought does not harm him while he intends God. He did not say that if ostentation is contracted after sincerity is contracted, it does not harm him. As for the hadith, he discoursed upon it with lengthy speech, the essence of which returns to three aspects: The first is that it may be interpreted that he intended the appearance of his deed after completion, and there is nothing in the hadith indicating it was before completion. The second is that he intended to be delighted by it for others to emulate him, or for another praiseworthy delight from what we mentioned before, not a delight due to the love of praise and status, evidenced by him granting a reward for it. And none from the community holds that delight in praise carries a reward; at most it is overlooked. So how could the sincere have one reward and the ostentatious have two? The third is that he said: Most who narrate the hadith narrate it not connected to Abu Hurairah; rather, most stop it at Abu Salih, and some elevate it. Therefore, ruling by the general principles conveyed regarding ostentation is preferable. This is what he mentioned, and he did not decisively rule it but showed an inclination toward invalidation.

The soundest view in our estimation is that if this measure does not manifest its effect in the deed, but the deed remains issued from the motive of religion, and there is merely added to it the joy of being observed, then the deed is not corrupted, because the foundation of his intention is not thereby nullified, and that intention remains the motive for the deed and the impetus for its completion.

As for the reports that have come concerning ostentation, they are understood to refer to when nothing but the creation is intended by it.  
As for what has come concerning partnership [with God], it is understood to refer to when the intention of ostentation equals the intention of reward or predominates over it. However, if it is weak in comparison to it, then the reward of charity and other deeds is not entirely nullified, nor should it invalidate the prayer. It is not far-fetched to say that what obliges one is a prayer purely for the sake of God—and the pure is that which is not mixed with anything—so one would not be fulfilling the obligation with this admixture, and knowledge thereof rests with God. We have mentioned in the Book of Sincerity a more comprehensive discussion than what we have presented here, so let reference be made to it. This, then, is the ruling regarding ostentation that occurs after the establishment of the act of worship, whether before its completion or after its completion.

The Third Category: That which accompanies the state of contracting [the prayer] by beginning the prayer with the intention of showing off. If he persists in it until the end, there is no disagreement that he must repeat it and his prayer is not counted. If he regrets it during that [prayer], seeks forgiveness, and returns [to sincerity] before completion, then concerning what is incumbent upon him there are three opinions. One group said: His prayer is not contracted with the intention of showing off, so he must start anew. Another group said: He is obliged to repeat the actions, such as bowing and prostrating, and his actions are invalidated, but not the opening *takbir* of the prayer, because the opening *takbir* is a contract, and showing off is a fleeting thought in his heart; it does not remove the opening *takbir* from being a contract. Another group said: He is not obliged to repeat anything; rather, he should seek God's forgiveness in his heart and complete the worship with sincerity, looking to the conclusion of the worship. Just as if he had begun with sincerity and concluded with showing off, his deed would be invalidated.

They likened this to a white garment soiled by an incidental impurity; when the incidental is removed, it returns to its original state. Thus they said that prayer, bowing, and prostration are for God alone—if one were to prostrate to other than God, he would be an unbeliever. However, an incidental element of ostentation became attached to it, then vanished through remorse and repentance, and he returned to a state where he cares not for the praise or blame of people, so his prayer becomes valid. The position of the other two groups falls far outside juristic analogy, especially that of those who say he must repeat the bowing and prostration but not the opening, because if the bowing and prostration are invalid, they become superfluous acts within the prayer and thus invalidate it. Likewise, the statement of those who say that if he concludes with sincerity, looking only to the latter part, is also weak, because ostentation vitiates the intention, and the most appropriate time for observing the rulings of intention is at the opening. What aligns with juristic analogy is to say: If his motive at the inception of the contract was purely ostentation, without seeking reward or obeying the command, then his opening is not validly contracted and what follows is invalid. This applies to one who, when alone, would not pray, but when he sees people, he begins prayer to show off—and who, even if his garment were impure, would still pray for the sake of people. Such a prayer contains no intention, for intention is the response to the motive of religion; here there is neither motive nor response. As for one who, even without people, would still pray, except that a desire for praise also arose in him, so the two motives combined—this case may occur in charity, recitation, or matters not involving lawful and unlawful, or in the contract of prayer and pilgrimage. If it is in charity, he has disobeyed by responding to the motive of ostentation and obeyed by responding to the motive of reward: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it." Thus he receives reward according to his sound intention and punishment according to his corrupt intention, and one does not nullify the other. If it is in a prayer that accepts corruption due to a defect affecting the intention, it is either obligatory or supererogatory. If supererogatory, its ruling is like that of charity: he has disobeyed in one aspect and obeyed in another, since the two motives coexisted in his heart. It cannot be said that his prayer is invalid and following him is void—even if one praying Tarawih reveals from circumstantial evidence that ostentation drives him to display beautiful recitation, and were it not for the people behind him, and he were alone in his house, he would not pray—it is not valid to say following him is invalid, for resorting to this is very far-fetched. Rather, a Muslim is presumed to intend reward also in his voluntary prayer, so his prayer is valid by virtue of that intention, and following him is valid, even if accompanied by another intention for which he is sinful. As for when it is in an obligatory prayer and the two motives combine, each insufficient alone, and the impetus arises only from their combination, this does not relieve him of the obligation, because the obligation did not become a motive for him independently. But if each motive is independent, such that without the motive of ostentation he would still perform the obligations, and without the motive of obligation he would initiate a voluntary prayer for ostentation, this is a matter for consideration and is highly ambiguous. It may be said that the obligation is a prayer purely for God's sake, and he has not performed the pure obligation; or it may be said that the obligation is to obey the command with an independent motive, which exists, so the attachment of another does not prevent the obligation from being discharged—just as if one prays in an usurped property: though he sins by performing prayer in the usurped property, he is obedient in the essence of prayer and discharges the obligation from himself. The conflict of possibilities lies in the conflict of motives in the essence of prayer. As for when ostentation is, for example, in hastening rather than in the essence of prayer—like one who hastens to pray at the beginning of the time due to the presence of a congregation, whereas if alone he would delay to the middle of the time, and were it not for the obligation he would not initiate prayer for ostentation—this is clearly valid prayer discharging the obligation, because the motive for the essence of prayer as prayer is not opposed by another, only in specifying the time, which is further from vitiating the intention. This concerns ostentation that motivates and drives the act; as for mere pleasure in people's awareness, if its effect does not reach the point of influencing the act, it is unlikely to invalidate the prayer. This is what we deem fitting to the principles of jurisprudence. The issue is obscure in that jurists have not addressed it in the discipline of jurisprudence, and those who delved into it and opined did not observe juristic principles and the implications of jurists' verdicts on prayer's validity and invalidity. Rather, their zeal for purifying hearts and seeking sincerity led them to invalidate acts of worship due to passing thoughts. What we have mentioned is the most balanced view in our opinion, and knowledge thereof rests with God Almighty—the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

Explanation of the Remedy for Ostentation and the Method of Treating the Heart from It

From what has preceded, you have come to know that ostentation nullifies deeds and is a cause for wrath from God, the Exalted, and that it is among the grave, destructive sins. That which is so described is most worthy of rolling up one's sleeves to the utmost in removing it, even through spiritual struggle and enduring hardships. For there is no cure except in drinking the bitter, repugnant medicines. This is a struggle to which all servants are compelled, for the child is created weak in intellect and discernment, with an eye extended toward creation and much covetousness of them. He sees people affecting piety for one another, and so a love for affectation necessarily overcomes him and becomes entrenched in his soul. He only becomes aware of its destructive nature after his intellect matures, by which time ostentation has already taken root in his heart and become firmly established, so that he cannot suppress it except through intense struggle and contending against the force of desires. Thus, no one is free from the need for this struggle, though it is arduous at first and becomes lighter later. In its treatment are two stages: "the first" is uprooting its veins and foundations from which it branches, "and the second" is repelling what occurs from it in the immediate moment.

The First Station: Uprooting its foundations and eradicating its roots. Its origin is the love of status and prestige. When examined, it reverts to three fundamental sources: the pleasure of praise, fleeing from the pain of blame, and coveting what is in people's hands. That ostentation is driven by these causes, and that they are what incite the ostentatious person, is attested by what Abu Musa reported: A Bedouin asked the Prophet, peace be upon him, saying, "O Messenger of God, a man fights out of tribal zeal" – meaning he is too proud to be overpowered or blamed for being vanquished – and he said, "and a man fights to be seen in his position" – this is the pursuit of the pleasure of prestige and rank in hearts – "and a man fights for renown" – this is praise by tongue. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever fights so that the word of God may be supreme, he is in the cause of God." Ibn Mas'ud said, "When two battle lines meet, the angels descend and record people according to their ranks: so-and-so fights for manliness, and so-and-so fights for dominion." Fighting for dominion points to coveting worldly gain. Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "They say so-and-so is a martyr, yet perhaps he had filled the two saddlebags of his mount with documents." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever goes on a military expedition seeking nothing but a camel's hobbling rope, for him is what he intended." This points to covetousness.

A person may not desire praise nor covet it, but he may fear the pain of blame, like a miser among generous people who give much wealth in charity; he gives a little so he is not called miserly, though he does not covet praise, as others have preceded him. Or like a coward among the brave who does not flee from the advance out of fear of blame, though he does not covet praise, as others have plunged into the battle line. But if he despairs of praise, he dislikes blame, like a man among people who pray all night; he prays a few counted rak'ahs so he is not blamed for laziness, though he does not covet praise.

A person may be capable of enduring abstinence from the pleasure of praise, yet incapable of enduring the pain of blame. Therefore, he may refrain from asking about knowledge he needs, fearing he will be blamed for ignorance; or he may give a legal opinion without knowledge; or he may claim knowledge of a hadith while being ignorant of it—all of this out of caution from blame. These three matters are what move the ostentatious person to ostentation, and its cure is what we mentioned in the first part of the book in summary.

But we now mention what pertains specifically to hypocrisy (riya'), and it is not hidden that a person only intends a thing and desires it because he assumes it to be good, beneficial, and pleasurable for him, either immediately or ultimately. If he knows it is pleasurable immediately but harmful ultimately, it becomes easy for him to sever his desire for it, like one who knows honey is sweet but, when it becomes clear to him that it contains poison, turns away from it. Similarly, the way to sever this desire is to know the harm within it. Whenever the servant recognizes the harm of hypocrisy, what it causes him to miss of his heart's rectitude, what it deprives him of presently in terms of divine facilitation (tawfiq) and in the Hereafter in terms of station with God, and what it exposes him to of great punishment, severe wrath, and manifest disgrace—where he will be called out before all creation: "O wicked one, O treacherous one, O hypocrite! Were you not ashamed when you sold God's obedience for the fleeting world, watched the hearts of creatures, mocked obedience to God, sought the affection of creatures by earning God's enmity, adorned yourself for them with ugliness before God, drew near to them by distancing yourself from God, sought praise from them by incurring blame from God, and sought their pleasure by exposing yourself to God's wrath? Was anyone more trivial to you than God!"—whenever the servant reflects on this disgrace and compares what he gains from creatures and adorning himself for them in this world with what he misses in the Hereafter and what nullifies the reward of deeds, considering that a single deed might have tipped the scale of his good deeds had it been sincere, but if corrupted by hypocrisy it is turned to the scale of evil deeds, tipping it and causing him to plummet into the Fire; if there were nothing in hypocrisy but the nullification of a single act of worship, that would suffice to know its harm. Even if, alongside that, his other good deeds are weighty, he could have attained through this good deed a lofty rank with God among the company of the Prophets and the Truthful, but due to hypocrisy he is lowered from them and returned to the ranks of the sandals among the stations of the saints. This is besides what he is exposed to in this world of scattered concern due to observing the hearts of creation, for the pleasure of people is an unattainable goal. Whatever pleases one group angers another, and the pleasure of some lies in the displeasure of others. Whoever seeks their pleasure in God's displeasure, God becomes displeased with him and makes them displeased with him as well. Then what purpose has he in their praise, preferring the blame of God for the sake of their commendation? Their praise does not increase his provision or his lifespan, nor will it benefit him on the day of his poverty and need, which is the Day of Resurrection. As for coveting what is in their hands, let him know that God Almighty is the One who subdues hearts by withholding and giving, that creation is compelled therein, and there is no provider but God. Whoever covets from creation is not free from humiliation and disappointment; even if he attains his desire, he is not free from obligation and degradation. How can he abandon what is with God for a false hope and corrupt delusion that may hit or miss, and if it hits, its pleasure does not equal the pain of its obligation and humiliation? As for their blame, he should not fear it, for their blame does not increase anything for him unless God has decreed it for him; it does not hasten his term nor delay his provision, nor make him among the people of the Fire if he is from the people of Paradise, nor make him hated by God if he is praiseworthy with God, nor increase him in wrath if he is already the object of wrath with God. For all creatures are impotent; they possess for themselves neither harm nor benefit, nor do they possess death, life, or resurrection. When the harm of these causes and their detriment is firmly established in his heart, his desire weakens and his heart turns to God. For the intelligent one does not desire what has abundant harm and little benefit. It suffices him that if people knew what is in his inward of the intent of hypocrisy and the showing of sincerity, they would despise him. And God will expose his secret until He makes him hated by people and makes them know that he is a hypocrite and the object of wrath with God. Had he been sincere to God, God would have revealed his sincerity to them, endeared him to them, subdued them for him, and loosened their tongues in praise and commendation of him—even though there is no perfection in their praise nor deficiency in their blame, as the poet of Banu Tamim said: "Indeed my praise is adornment and my blame is disgrace!" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to him, "You have lied; that is God, there is no god but He, for there is no adornment except in His praise and no disgrace except in His blame. So what good is the praise of people to you when you are blameworthy with God and among the people of the Fire? And what harm is the blame of people to you when you are praiseworthy with God among the company of the near ones?" Whoever brings to his heart the Hereafter and its eternal bliss and the lofty stations with God will deem trivial what pertains to creatures during the days of life, with all its impurities and vexations. His concern becomes unified, his heart turns to God, and he is freed from the humiliation of hypocrisy and the struggle with the hearts of creation. From his sincerity, lights bend upon his heart, by which his chest expands, and there open for him from the subtleties of unveilings what increases his intimacy with God, his alienation from creation, his disdain for the world, and his magnification of the Hereafter. The place of creatures falls from his heart, the urge of hypocrisy is dissolved from him, and the path of sincerity is made easy for him. This, along with what we presented in the first part, are the intellectual remedies that uproot the seedlings of hypocrisy.

As for the practical remedy: it is to train oneself to conceal acts of worship and to shut the doors upon them, just as doors are shut upon indecencies, until his heart is content with God’s knowledge or His awareness of his devotions, and his soul no longer contends with him to seek the knowledge of anyone other than God concerning them. It has been related that one of the companions of Abu Hafs al-Haddad censured the world and its people, whereupon he said: “You have disclosed what you ought to have concealed. Do not sit with us after this.” He did not permit the disclosure of even this much, because within censuring the world lies a claim to asceticism in it. Thus, there is no cure for ostentation like concealment, though this is difficult at the outset of spiritual struggle. If one perseveres in it for a time with effort, its burden will lift and it will become easy for him through the continuity of God’s subtle favors and what He supplies His servants with of good success, support, and guidance. “Indeed, God does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.” From the servant comes the struggle, and from God comes guidance; from the servant comes knocking at the door, and from God comes opening the door. “And God does not waste the reward of the doers of good; and if it is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from His presence a great reward.”

The Second Station: On Repelling Incidental Thoughts During Worship, which must also be learned. For one who strives against his soul, uproots the seeds of ostentation from his heart through contentment, severs covetousness, removes himself from the sight of creatures, and holds the praise or blame of creatures in contempt—even such a person is not left alone by Satan during acts of worship. Rather, he opposes him with whisperings of ostentation, and his temptations do not cease, nor is the inclination and leaning of the soul entirely erased. Thus, one must gird himself to repel whatever thought of ostentation arises.

The whisperings of ostentation are three—they may occur all at once like a single thought, or they may follow one another gradually. The first is knowledge that people are observing, or hope that they will observe. This is followed by the stirring of desire within the soul for their praise and for attaining status in their eyes. Then follows the stirring of desire for the soul’s own acceptance of this and contentment with it, and the firm resolve of the heart to realize it. So the first is knowledge, the second is a state called craving and desire, and the third is an act called determination and firm resolution. The perfection of strength lies in repelling the first thought and turning it back before the second follows it.

Thus, if the knowledge that people are observing, or the hope that they will observe, occurs to him, he repels it by saying: “What have you to do with people, whether they know or do not know? God is aware of your state—what benefit is there in the knowledge of another?” If desire stirs toward the pleasure of praise, he reminds himself of what has been firmly rooted in his heart beforehand regarding the affliction of ostentation, his exposure to God’s wrath on the Day of Resurrection, and his disappointment in the time of greatest need for his deeds. For just as knowledge that people are observing stirs up craving and desire for ostentation, so knowledge of the affliction of ostentation stirs up aversion to it, which counters that craving—as he reflects on his exposure to God’s wrath and painful punishment. Craving calls him to acceptance; aversion calls him to refusal. And the soul inevitably complies with whichever is stronger and more dominant.

Therefore, repelling ostentation necessarily requires three matters: knowledge, aversion, and refusal. A servant may commence worship with the resolve of sincerity, then a thought of ostentation arises, and he accepts it, while the knowledge and aversion that the conscience inherently holds are not present to him. The cause of this is the heart being filled with fear of blame and love of praise, and the domination of greed over it to such an extent that no room remains in the heart for anything else. Thus, the prior knowledge of the afflictions of ostentation and the evil of its consequence slips away from the heart, as no place remains in the heart vacant from the desire for praise or fear of blame. This is like one who reminds himself of forbearance and the blameworthiness of anger, and resolves to exercise forbearance when the cause of anger arises, then such causes occur that intensify his anger, so he forgets his prior resolve, and his heart becomes filled with rage that prevents him from recalling the affliction of anger and occupies his heart away from it. Similarly, the sweetness of desire fills the heart and repels the light of knowledge, like the bitterness of anger. To this, Jabir alluded by his saying: "We pledged allegiance to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, beneath the tree on the condition that we would not flee, and we did not pledge allegiance to him to die." Then we forgot it on the day of Hunayn until it was called out: "O companions of the tree!" and they returned. That is because the hearts became filled with fear, so they forgot the prior covenant until they were reminded. Most desires that assault suddenly are like this, as one forgets the knowledge of its harm, which is included in the covenant of faith. Whenever knowledge is forgotten, aversion does not appear, for aversion is the fruit of knowledge. A person may remember and his intellect may recognize his caprice, yet he is unable to abandon the pleasure of the state, so he postpones repentance or becomes preoccupied from reflecting upon that due to the intensity of the desire. How many a scholar is present with speech that does not call him to act except for the ostentation of creation, and he knows that, yet he persists in it, so the proof against him becomes more compelling? For he accepts the caller of ostentation while knowing its peril and that it is blameworthy before God, and his knowledge does not benefit him if the knowledge is devoid of aversion. Knowledge and aversion may be present, yet despite that, he accepts the caller of ostentation because the aversion is weak in comparison to the strength of the desire. This also does not benefit from his aversion, for the purpose of aversion is to turn one away from the action.

Therefore, there is no benefit except in the conjunction of three things: which are knowledge, aversion, and refusal. For refusal is the fruit of aversion, and aversion is the fruit of knowledge. The strength of knowledge is according to the strength of faith and the light of understanding, and the weakness of knowledge is according to heedlessness, love of this world, forgetfulness of the Hereafter, lack of reflection upon what is with God, and lack of contemplation on the afflictions of this worldly life and the immense bliss of the Hereafter. Some of these things produce and bear fruit from others, and the root of all of that is love of this world and the dominance of desires, for it is the head of every misstep and the source of every sin. Because the sweetness of love for status, rank, and the pleasures of this world is what angers the heart, robs it, and comes between it and reflecting on the final outcome, being illuminated by the light of the Book and the Sunnah, and the lights of knowledge.

If you ask: What of one who finds in himself an aversion to ostentation, and this aversion compels him to refuse it, yet he is not free from his nature's inclination toward it and his love for it, and his soul contends with him for it—except that he is averse to his own love and inclination for it and does not find it pleasing—is such a person among the ranks of the ostentatious? Then know that God does not task His servants except with what they can bear. It is not within a servant's power to prevent Satan from his whisperings, nor to subdue his nature so that it does not incline toward desires or yearn for them. His utmost limit is to oppose his desire with an aversion stirred by knowledge of consequences, religious understanding, and the fundamentals of faith in God and the Last Day. If he does this, he has reached the utmost in fulfilling what he has been tasked with.

This is indicated by reports, such as what was narrated that the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) complained to him, saying: "Thoughts occur to our hearts such that we would prefer to be snatched from the sky by birds or cast by the wind into a desolate abyss rather than speak of them." He (peace be upon him) said, "Have you truly experienced that?" They said, "Yes." He said, "That is pure faith." They experienced nothing but the whispering and an aversion to it. It cannot be said that by "pure faith" he meant the whispering itself, so it remains to interpret it as the aversion that accompanies the whispering. Ostentation, though grave, is lesser than whispering in the sight of God Almighty. If the harm of the greater is repelled by aversion, then it is more fitting that the harm of the lesser be repelled by it.

Similarly, it is narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the hadith of Ibn Abbas that he said, "Praise be to God, Who has turned the scheme of Satan into mere whispering." Abu Hazim said: "That which is from your own soul, and your soul dislikes it for itself, will not harm you, for it is from your enemy. But that which is from your soul, and your soul is pleased with it for itself, then reproach yourself for it." Therefore, the whispering of Satan and the contention of the soul do not harm you as long as you repel their aim with refusal and aversion.

The thoughts that are knowledge, reminders, and imaginings of the causes that incite ostentation are from Satan. The desire and inclination following those thoughts are from the soul. The aversion is from faith and the effects of the intellect. However, Satan has a cunning here: when he is unable to compel one to accept ostentation, he deludes him into thinking that the soundness of his heart lies in occupying himself with disputing Satan and prolonging the rebuttal and argument, thereby depriving him of the reward of sincerity and the heart's presence, because preoccupation with disputing Satan and resisting him is a diversion from the secret intimacy with God, and this causes a diminishment in his station with God.

Those who are liberated from ostentation in repelling thoughts of ostentation are at four levels. The first is to refute it as from Satan and reject it, yet not stop there but engage in disputing with him and prolong the argument, believing this safer for his heart—though in truth it is a deficiency, for he has turned away from intimate discourse with God and from the good he was pursuing, and has diverted himself to fighting highway robbers; and to detour into fighting highway robbers is a shortcoming on the spiritual path. The second is to recognize that disputing and fighting are a deficiency on the path, so he confines himself to rejecting and repelling it without engaging in argument. The third is not to occupy himself even with rejection, for that is a pause, however brief; rather, he has firmly resolved in the covenant of his conscience to abhor ostentation and deem Satan a liar, so he continues as he was, holding fast to that abhorrence without busying himself with rejection or contention. The fourth is to have come to know that Satan will envy him when causes of ostentation arise, so he resolves that whenever Satan stirs up mischief, he will increase in the sincerity and devotion to God he is already engaged in, and in concealing charity and worship, to spite Satan—for that is what enrages Satan, suppresses him, and brings about his despair and hopelessness so that he does not return. It is related from al-Fudayl ibn Ghazwan that someone said to him, “So-and-so mentions you,” and he replied, “By God, I will spite the one who commanded him.” He was asked, “And who commanded him?” He said, “Satan. O God, forgive him.” Meaning: I will spite him by obeying God concerning him. Whenever Satan recognizes this habit in a servant, he desists from him, fearing that he will increase in good deeds. Ibrahim al-Taymi said, “Indeed, Satan calls a servant to a door of sin, but he does not obey him and instead performs a good deed at that moment; when Satan sees him thus, he leaves him.” He also said, “If Satan sees you hesitant, he becomes hopeful of you; but if he sees you steadfast, he despairs and leaves you.”

Al-Harith al-Muhasibi, may God have mercy upon him, gave an excellent parable for these four, saying: Their likeness is that of four men who set out for an assembly of knowledge and discourse, seeking thereby benefit, virtue, guidance, and right direction. A misguided innovator, envious of them for this and fearing they would come to know the truth, approached the first. He prevented him and turned him away from that, inviting him instead to an assembly of misguidance. The man refused. When the innovator perceived his refusal, he busied him with argumentation, and the man engaged with him, thinking to repel his misguidance and believing this to be a benefit for him. This was the aim of the misguided one: to cause him to miss [the assembly] by the measure of his delay. When the second passed by him, the innovator forbade him and detained him. The man stopped and struck the misguided one in the chest, but did not become entangled in fighting and hastened on. The misguided one rejoiced at his stopping for the time it took to strike him. The third passed by him and paid him no heed, neither busying himself with repelling him nor with fighting him, but continued on as he was. Thus, the innovator's hope in him was utterly disappointed. The fourth passed by and did not pause for him; wishing to vex him, he increased his haste and abandoned measured walking. It is likely that if they were to return and pass by him again, all would be assailed once more except this last one, for he would not be assailed again, lest he gain even more benefit by his hastening.

If you ask: Since Satan's whisperings are not to be trusted, is it then obligatory to be on guard against him before his arrival, in anticipation of his coming, or is it obligatory to rely upon God to be the one who repels him, or is it obligatory to occupy oneself with worship and be heedless of him? We say: People have differed concerning this into three views. A group from the people of Basra held that the strong have dispensed with the need for caution from Satan because they have devoted themselves exclusively to God and occupied themselves with His love, so Satan has withdrawn from them, despaired of them, and retreated from them—just as he despairs of weak worshippers concerning the invitation to wine and fornication—so that worldly comforts, even if permissible, became like wine and swine to them. Thus, they departed entirely from love for them, leaving Satan no avenue to them, so they have no need for caution. A group from the people of Syria held that being on guard for caution from him is only needed by one whose certainty is weak and whose reliance is deficient. For how can it be, when there is no partner to God in His management, that one should fear other than Him, knowing that Satan is a lowly creature with no command, and nothing occurs except what God has willed? He is the One who harms and benefits. The knower would be ashamed to fear other than Him, so certainty in divine oneness suffices him from caution. A group from the people of knowledge said: Caution from Satan is indispensable. What the Basrans mentioned—that the strong have dispensed with caution and their hearts are entirely empty of love for the world, which is Satan's means—is nearly delusion, for the prophets, peace be upon them, were not free from Satan's whisperings and incitements, so how could others be free? Not every whisper of Satan is from lusts and love of the world; rather, it is also concerning the attributes and names of God Almighty, in beautifying innovations and misguidance, and other matters. No one is safe from danger therein, and therefore God Almighty said, "And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet but that when he spoke [or desired], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But God abolishes that which Satan throws in; then God makes precise His verses." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, it covers my heart," even though his Satan had submitted and only commands him to good. So whoever thinks that his occupation with the love of God is greater than that of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and the rest of the prophets, peace be upon them, is deluded. That did not secure them from Satan's guile, and therefore Adam and Eve were not safe from him in Paradise, the abode of security and joy, after God said to them, "Indeed, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer. Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed. And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun." And even though He only forbade one tree and permitted beyond that what they desired, if a prophet among the prophets was not safe from Satan's guile while in Paradise, the abode of security and happiness, how can it be permissible for another to feel safe in the abode of this world, which is the source of trials and tribulations, the mine of pleasures and forbidden lusts? And Moses, peace be upon him, said as God informed about him, "This is from the work of Satan." Therefore, God cautioned all creation from him, saying, "O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise," and He, glory be to Him, said, "Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them." The Qur'an, from beginning to end, is a caution from Satan. How could it be otherwise when He has commanded caution from the enemy, just as He commanded caution from the disbelievers, saying, "And let them take their precaution and their arms," and saying, "And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war"? If caution from the disbelieving enemy is incumbent upon you by God's command, and you see him, then caution from an enemy who sees you while you do not see him is more incumbent. Therefore, Ibn Muhayriz said: A prey you see but does not see you, you are likely to capture it; a prey that sees you but you do not see it, it is likely to capture you—pointing to Satan. How much more so when heedlessness towards the enmity of a disbeliever only results in killing, which is martyrdom, whereas neglecting caution from Satan exposes one to the Fire and painful punishment? Occupying oneself with God does not mean turning away from what God has cautioned against, and this invalidates the view of the second group in their assumption that this detracts from reliance. For taking up the shield and weapon, gathering troops, and digging the trench did not detract from the reliance of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, so how could fearing what God has warned against and being cautious from what He has commanded caution from detract from reliance? We have mentioned in the Book of Reliance what clarifies the error of those who claim that the meaning of reliance is complete abandonment of means, and His saying, "And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war," does not contradict compliance with reliance, as long as the heart believes that the One who harms and benefits, gives life and causes death, is God Almighty. Likewise, one is cautious of Satan while believing that the Guide and Misguider is God, seeing the means as subservient intermediaries—as we mentioned in reliance.

This is what al-Harith al-Muhasibi, may God have mercy on him, chose, and it is the correct position, attested to by the light of knowledge. What precedes it resembles the speech of worshippers whose knowledge is not deep, who imagine that the state of total absorption in God, which occasionally overwhelms them, will persist perpetually—and this is far from the truth.

Then this group differed in three ways regarding the manner of caution. Some said: When we are cautious of God Almighty’s enemy, nothing should dominate our hearts more than remembering him, being wary of him, and watching for him, for if we are heedless of him for a moment, he may well destroy us. Others said: That leads to emptying the heart of the remembrance of God and occupying all concern with Satan, and that is what Satan desires from us. Rather, we should occupy ourselves with worship and the remembrance of God Almighty, yet not forget Satan and his enmity and the need to be cautious of him, thus combining the two matters. For if we forget, perhaps an attack will come from where we do not expect; and if we devote ourselves solely to remembering him, we would have neglected the remembrance of God, so combining is preferable. But the verified scholars said: Both groups are mistaken. As for the first, they devoted themselves to remembering Satan and forgot the remembrance of God—their error is not hidden. We were only commanded to be cautious of Satan lest he divert us from remembrance, so how can we make remembering him the most dominant thing in our hearts, when that is the ultimate harm of the enemy? Moreover, that leads to emptying the heart of the light of the remembrance of God Almighty. If Satan aims at such a heart, wherein there is no light of God’s remembrance nor strength of occupation with it, he may well prevail over it, and it cannot repel him. Thus, we were not commanded to await Satan nor to persist in remembering him. As for the second group, they shared with the first by combining in the heart the remembrance of God and Satan; and to the extent the heart is occupied with remembering Satan, it diminishes from the remembrance of God. God has commanded creation to remember Him and forget all else—Iblis and others. The truth is that the servant should oblige his heart to be cautious of Satan and affirm within himself his enmity. When he believes that sincerely and settles caution within, he occupies himself with the remembrance of God and plunges into it with all concern, and the matter of Satan does not cross his mind. For if he occupies himself with that after knowing his enmity, then Satan occurs to him, he becomes alert to him. Upon alertness, he occupies himself with repelling him, and being occupied with God’s remembrance does not prevent vigilance at Satan’s whisper. Rather, a man may sleep while fearing to miss an important matter at dawn; he obliges himself to caution and sleeps intending to awaken at that time, so he awakens at night several times before the hour due to the caution settled in his heart, even though he is heedless of it in sleep. So how does his occupation with God’s remembrance prevent his alertness? Such a heart is the one strong enough to repel the enemy when its occupation with the pure remembrance of God Almighty has killed within it caprice and revived the light of intellect and knowledge, and removed the darkness of desires. Thus, the people of insight made their hearts feel the enmity of Satan and watch for him, and obliged them to caution, yet did not occupy themselves with remembering him, but with remembering God. They repelled the evil of the enemy through remembrance, and were illuminated by the light of remembrance until they turned away the enemy’s suggestions. The heart is like a well that one wishes to purify of foul water so that pure water may gush forth. He who occupies himself with remembering Satan has left the foul water in it. He who combined the remembrance of Satan and God has drawn out the foul water from one side but left it flowing into it from another, so his toil is prolonged and the well does not dry of foul water. The insightful one is he who placed a dam for the flow of foul water and filled it with pure water; when foul water comes, he repels it with the barrier and dam without effort, trouble, or added toil.

Explanation of the Permissibility in Intending to Display Acts of Obedience

Know that within the concealment of deeds lies the benefit of sincerity and deliverance from ostentation, while in their public display lies the benefit of setting an example and encouraging people toward goodness—though it carries the affliction of showing off. Al-Hasan said: "The Muslims have known that secrecy is more secure for the two deeds, yet there is also benefit in public display." For this reason, God the Exalted praised both the hidden and the manifest, saying: "If you disclose your charitable gifts, it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you."

And manifestation is of two types: one is within the act itself, and the other is speaking of what one has done.

The First Category: Displaying one's deed openly, such as giving charity publicly to encourage people in it, as narrated concerning the Ansari who brought a purse (of charity) and people followed in giving when they saw him, whereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever initiates a good practice and it is acted upon, he will have its reward and the reward of those who follow him." And all other deeds follow this same course—prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, jihad, and others—but emulation in charity is more natural to human dispositions. Indeed, when a warrior intends to depart and prepares and packs his saddle before others, urging them to move, that is better for him because jihad in its essence is among public deeds that cannot be concealed; thus hastening to it is not from ostentation but is pure encouragement. Likewise, a man may raise his voice in night prayer to alert his neighbors and household so they may follow him. So for every deed that cannot be concealed, like pilgrimage, jihad, and the Friday prayer, the best is to hasten to it and display eagerness in it for encouragement, provided there is no taint of ostentation. As for what can be concealed, like charity and prayer, if displaying charity harms the recipient and encourages people to charity, then secrecy is better because causing harm is forbidden. If there is no harm, people have differed regarding what is superior. Some said: Secrecy is better than openness even if there is emulation in openness. Others said: Secrecy is better than openness without emulation, but openness for the sake of emulation is better than secrecy. This is indicated by the fact that God Almighty commanded the prophets to display deeds for emulation and singled them out for the station of prophethood, and it is not permissible to suppose that they were deprived of the better of the two deeds. It is also indicated by his saying (peace be upon him), "He will have its reward and the reward of those who act upon it," and it is narrated in the hadith, "Indeed a secret deed is multiplied over an open deed seventyfold, and an open deed, if others follow its doer, is multiplied over a secret deed seventyfold." There is no room for dispute in this, for whenever the heart is free from the taint of ostentation and sincerity is perfected to the same degree in both situations, that which is followed is undoubtedly better. The fear is only from the emergence of ostentation; whenever any trace of ostentation occurs, the emulation of others does not benefit him, and he is ruined by it. Thus there is no dispute that secrecy is better than that.

However, for one who displays good deeds, there are two duties. The first is to display them only where he knows or reasonably presumes that he will be emulated. For a man may be emulated by his household but not by his neighbors; or by his neighbors but not by the people of the marketplace; or by the people of his own quarter. Only the well-known scholar is he whom people in general emulate. As for one who is not a scholar, if he displays acts of obedience, he may be accused of ostentation and hypocrisy, be censured, and not be followed. Thus, for him, there is no benefit in display. Display is only valid when intended as an example by one who is in a position to be emulated, for those who are in a position to emulate him.

The second duty is to vigilantly watch over his heart, for within it may lurk a hidden love of ostentation, which then prompts him to display under the pretext of setting an example. In truth, his desire is to be adorned by the deed and to be the one who is emulated. This is the condition of all who display their works, except for the strong, sincere ones—and how few they are. Therefore, the weak should not deceive themselves in this matter and thus perish unknowingly. The likeness of the weak is that of a drowning man who possesses weak swimming skills. Seeing a group of drowning people, he takes pity on them and goes to them until they cling to him, and they all perish together. Drowning in water in this world brings momentary pain—would that perishing through ostentation were like it! Nay, its punishment is lasting for a long duration.

This is a place where the feet of worshippers and scholars stumble, for they imitate the strong in displaying deeds while their hearts lack the strength for sincerity, and thus their rewards are nullified by ostentation. Discerning this is subtle. Its test is to present to oneself the scenario: if it were said to him, "Conceal your work so that people may emulate another worshipper among your peers, and you will have in secret the same reward as if it were public," and if his heart then inclines toward being the one emulated and the one displaying the work, then his motive is ostentation, not the pursuit of reward or the desire for people to emulate him and incline toward good. For they would have inclined toward good by looking to another, and his reward would have been secured for him in secrecy. So why would his heart incline toward display, if not for observing the eyes of creation and seeking their admiration?

Let the servant beware of the deceptions of the self, for the self is deceitful, Satan lies in wait, and the love of status overwhelmingly dominates the heart. Rarely are outward deeds safe from defects; thus, nothing should be preferred over safety, and safety lies in concealment. In display, there are dangers that the likes of us cannot withstand. Therefore, caution against display is more incumbent upon us and upon all the weak.

The second category: to speak of what one has done after completion, and its ruling is the same as displaying the deed itself.  
The danger in this is greater because the burden of speech is light upon the tongue, and in the telling there may occur exaggeration and hyperbole, and the soul finds pleasure in making grand claims. However, if ostentation were to intrude upon it, it would not affect the corruption of the past act of worship after its completion; thus, from this perspective, it is less severe. The ruling concerning it is that for one whose heart is strong, whose sincerity is perfected, who regards people as insignificant in his eyes, and for whom their praise and blame are equal, and who mentions that before someone from whom he hopes for emulation and a desire for good on account of it—then it is permissible, indeed it is recommended if the intention is pure and free from all defects, because it encourages toward good, and encouraging toward good is itself good. Such has been transmitted from a group of the strong predecessors.  

Sa‘d ibn Mu‘ādh said: “I have never prayed a prayer since I accepted Islam and then thought of anything else during it, nor have I followed a funeral procession and then thought of anything other than what it is saying and what is being said for it, and I have never heard the Prophet ﷺ say a word except that I knew it was truth.”  

‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: “I do not care whether I wake up in hardship or ease, for I do not know which of them is better for me.”  

Ibn Mas‘ūd said: “I have never woken up in a state and wished to be in another.”  

‘Uthmān, may God be pleased with him, said: “I have not sung, nor have I wished, nor have I touched my private part with my right hand since I pledged allegiance to the Messenger of God ﷺ.”  

Shaddād ibn Aws said: “I have not spoken a word since I accepted Islam without weighing and bridling it—except this one!” And he had said to his servant: “Bring us the meal tray so we may send it and catch the midday meal.”  

Abū Sufyān said to his family when death approached him: “Do not weep over me, for I have not committed a sin since I accepted Islam.”  

‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz, may God have mercy on him, said: “God has never decreed a decree for me but that I was pleased for it to have been decreed for me, and I have never awakened with a desire except in the places of God’s decree.”

All of this demonstrates noble states, yet they become the height of hypocrisy when emanating from one who intends to show off through them, and they become the height of encouragement when emanating from one who is emulated. Thus, for those strong in faith, displaying such acts with the intention of being followed is permissible under the conditions we have mentioned. Therefore, the door to manifesting good deeds should not be closed, for human nature is predisposed to love imitation and emulation. Indeed, the display of worship by a hypocrite, when people are unaware of his hypocrisy, contains much good for others, though it is evil for the hypocrite himself. How many sincere worshippers found the cause of their sincerity in emulating someone who, in the sight of God, was a hypocrite? It has been related that a person passing through the alleys of Basra at dawn would hear the voices of worshippers reciting the Quran from their homes. Then someone authored a book exposing the subtleties of hypocrisy, causing them to abandon this practice and people to lose their desire for it, so much so that they would say, "If only that book had never been written!" For the display by a hypocrite contains much good for others if his hypocrisy remains unknown. Verily, God supports this religion through a sinful man and through people who have no share of virtue, as has been reported in the narrations, and among them are some hypocrites who are emulated. And God, the Exalted, knows best.

Explanation of the Permissibility in Concealing Sins

and the aversion to letting people see them, and the aversion to their censuring him.

Know that the foundation of sincerity is the equivalence of one's inner state and outward appearance, as 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said to a man: "Adhere to the action of the outward." The man said: "O Commander of the Faithful, and what is the action of the outward?" He replied: "That which, if it were observed of you, you would not be ashamed." And Abu Muslim al-Khawlani said: "I know of no action I would mind people observing me in, except my approaching my wife, urination, and defecation—though this is a great station not attained by everyone." A person is not free from sins of the heart or limbs, which he conceals and dislikes people becoming aware of, especially the fleeting thoughts in desires and wishes. God is aware of all that. The servant's desire to hide these from other servants might lead one to think it is forbidden ostentation, but it is not so. Rather, the forbidden act is to conceal it in order to show people that he is pious and fears God Almighty, while in reality he is not. This is the concealment of the hypocrite.

As for the sincere one who does not show off, he has a covering over his misdeeds, and his intention therein is sound, and his distress at people becoming aware of them is sound in eight aspects: The first is that he rejoices at God's covering over him, and if he is exposed, he is distressed by God's tearing away his cover and fears that his cover will be torn away on the Day of Resurrection, for it has come in the report that "Whoever God covers for in this world a sin, God will cover for him in the Hereafter." This is a distress that arises from the strength of faith.

The second point is that it is known that God, exalted be He, detests the exposure of sins and loves their concealment, as He said, "Whoever commits any of these foul deeds, let him conceal himself with the veil of God." Thus, even if he disobeys God through sin, his heart is not devoid of love for what God loves. This arises from the strength of faith in God's abhorrence of the exposure of sins, and the effect of sincerity in him is that he also detests the exposure of sin by others and is grieved on account of it.

The third is to dislike being censured by people because it distresses him and preoccupies his heart and mind from obeying God Most High, for human nature is pained by blame, contends with reason, and distracts from obedience. For the same reason, one should also dislike praise that distracts him from the remembrance of God Most High, consumes his heart, and diverts him from mindfulness. This too stems from the strength of faith, for the sincere desire to empty the heart for the sake of obedience is part of faith.

The fourth is that one conceals and desires it due to aversion to the censure of people, in that his nature is pained by it, for censure is painful to the heart just as striking is painful to the body. The fear of the heart's pain from censure is not forbidden, nor is a person thereby sinful. One only sins when his soul is agitated by the censure of people and it urges him to what is not permissible out of caution from their censure. It is not incumbent upon a person to not be grieved by the censure of creation nor to be pained by it. Indeed, the perfection of sincerity is that his regard for creation vanishes, so that his censurer and praiser become equal to him, due to his knowledge that the One who harms and benefits is God, and that all servants are incapable; but that is exceedingly rare. Most natures are pained by censure because of the feeling of deficiency it contains. Sometimes, pain from censure is praiseworthy if the censurer is from the people of insight in religion, for they are the witnesses of God, and their censure indicates the censure of God, the Exalted, and a deficiency in religion—so how could one not be grieved by it? Indeed, the blameworthy grief is to grieve over missing praise through scrupulous piety, as if he loves to be praised for his scrupulous piety. It is not permissible to love being praised for obeying God, for then he would have sought, through obeying God, a reward from other than Him. If he finds that in himself, he must confront it with aversion and rejection.

As for the aversion to blame due to sin from the standpoint of natural disposition, it is not blameworthy, for it entails concealment out of caution from that. It is conceivable that a servant may be in such a state that he does not love praise but dislikes blame. His true aim is that people leave him, neither with praise nor blame. For how many are those who patiently abstain from the pleasure of praise, yet cannot endure the pain of blame? Since praise is a pursuit of pleasure, and the absence of pleasure does not cause pain, whereas blame is indeed painful. The love of praise for obedience is a seeking of immediate reward for that obedience. As for the aversion to blame for sin, there is no harm in it except for one matter: that his grief over people becoming aware of his sin distracts him from God's awareness of it, for that is the utmost deficiency in religion. Rather, his grief and sense of blame over God's awareness and His censure of him should be greater.

The fifth is to dislike being criticized, because the critic has thereby disobeyed God the Exalted, and this is part of faith. Its sign is that one also dislikes criticizing others, for this distress does not distinguish between oneself and another, unlike distress arising from natural disposition.

The sixth is to conceal it so that one is not targeted by malice when his sin becomes known. This goes beyond the pain of blame, for blame is painful in that the heart feels its own deficiency and baseness, even if it comes from one whose malice is not feared. Yet one may fear the harm of whoever becomes aware of his sin for any reason, so he may conceal it out of caution from him.

The seventh is pure modesty, for it is a type of pain beyond the pain of blame and the intention of evil, and it is a noble character trait that arises in early youth whenever the light of reason shines upon it, so one feels shame at disgraceful acts when they are witnessed, and it is a praiseworthy attribute, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Modesty is entirely good." And he said: "Modesty is a branch of faith." And he said: "Modesty brings nothing but good." And he said: "Indeed, God loves the modest and forbearing." Thus, the one who commits immorality and does not care to display his immorality to people combines immorality with shamelessness, indecency, and a lack of modesty, and his condition is more severe than one who conceals and feels shame. However, modesty is mixed with ostentation and greatly resembles it, and few are those who discern this. Every hypocrite claims that he is modest and that the reason for beautifying his acts of worship is modesty before people, but that is false. Rather, modesty is a character trait that springs from a noble nature, and in its wake stir the call of ostentation and the call of sincerity, and it is conceivable that one may be sincere with it, and it is conceivable that one may be hypocritical with it.

The explanation is that a man seeks a loan from a friend, yet his own soul is unwilling to lend, except that he feels ashamed to refuse him. He knows that if he were to send a message through another, he would feel no shame and would not lend—neither out of hypocrisy nor in pursuit of reward. In that situation, he has several states: one is to openly refuse to his face without concern, thereby being attributed to a lack of modesty, and this is the act of one who has no shame. For the one who feels shame will either make an excuse or lend.

If he is given, three states may be imagined for him: The first is that he is stirred by shame, such that shame is aroused within him and rejection becomes ugly in his sight. Then the thought of ostentation stirs and says: "You ought to give so that you may be praised, thanked, and your name spread for generosity; or you ought to give so that you are not blamed nor ascribed to miserliness." Thus, if he gives, he has given with ostentation, and what moved the ostentation was the arousal of shame.

The second is when one is prevented from refusal by shame, yet miserliness lingers in the soul, making giving difficult. Then the call to sincerity stirs and says to him: "Almsgiving yields one reward, but a loan brings eighteen; thus it holds great merit and brings joy to a friend's heart—and that is praiseworthy in the sight of God, the Exalted." Thereupon the soul becomes generous in giving for that reason. This is a sincere one whose shame stirred his sincerity.

The third is that one should have no desire for reward nor fear of blame, nor love for praise, because if he sought it through correspondence, it would not be granted; rather, it is given purely out of shame—that is, the pain of shame he feels in his heart. Were it not for shame, he would reject it. And if someone from whom he feels no shame—such as strangers or vile persons—were to come to him, he would reject it even if it contained abundant praise and reward. This is mere shame, and this occurs only with disgraceful traits like miserliness and the commission of sins. The hypocrite, however, feels shame even in permissible matters, to the extent that if he is seen walking hastily, he returns to calmness, or if laughing, he reverts to restraint, claiming it is shame when it is in fact hypocrisy. It has been said that some shame is weakness, and this is true—referring to shame regarding what is not disgraceful, such as shame from admonishing people or leading them in prayer. This is praiseworthy in children and women, but not praiseworthy in the wise. You may witness a sin from an elder and feel ashamed, due to his gray hair, to rebuke him, for honoring the gray-haired Muslim is part of honoring God. This shame is good, but better is to feel shame before God, so that enjoining good is not neglected. The strong person prefers shame before God over shame before people, while the weak may not be capable of this. These are the reasons for which it is permissible to conceal disgraceful traits and sins.

The eighth is to fear that by revealing one's sin, others may become emboldened to commit it and follow his example. This single cause applies to the display of obedience as well—that of being an exemplar—and pertains specifically to leaders or those who are emulated. For this same reason, a sinner should also conceal his transgression from his family and children, for they learn from him.

In the concealment of sins, there are these eight excuses, but in the display of obedience, there is no excuse except this single one. And if the intention behind concealing a sin is to make people imagine he is pious, then he is a hypocrite, just as if he intended that by displaying obedience.

If you ask: Is it permissible for a servant to love people's praise for his righteousness and their love for him because of it, when a man said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "Guide me to that which will make Allah love me and people love me." He said, "Renounce the world, and Allah will love you; and cast away this worthless stuff to them, and they will love you." We say: Your love for people's love of you may be permissible, praiseworthy, or blameworthy. The praiseworthy is that you love it to thereby know Allah's love for you, for when the Exalted loves a servant, He makes him beloved in the hearts of His servants. The blameworthy is that you love their love and praise for your pilgrimage, your religious ostentation, your prayer, or for a specific act of obedience, for that is seeking an immediate recompense for obeying Allah other than Allah's reward. The permissible is that you love for them to love you for praiseworthy qualities other than specific, praiseworthy acts of worship; your love for that is like your love for wealth, for possessing hearts is a means to objectives just as possessing wealth is—there is no difference between them.

Explanation of Abandoning Acts of Worship Out of Fear of Ostentation and the Ingress of Defects

Know that among people are those who abandon righteous deeds out of fear that they may be performed for show, and this is an error and compliance with Satan. Rather, the truth concerning which deeds to abandon and which not to abandon, for fear of such afflictions, is what we shall mention. It is that acts of obedience are divided into two categories:

First, that in which there is no inherent pleasure—such as prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and jihad—for they involve hardship and struggle. They only become pleasurable insofar as they lead to the praise of people, and the praise of people is pleasurable, but that occurs only when people become aware of them.

Second, that which is inherently pleasurable—and this is most of what is not confined to the body alone, but relates to creation, such as leadership, judgeship, governorships, market inspection, leading prayer, giving admonition, teaching, spending wealth on people, and other similar matters. In these, the affliction is great because they are connected to creation and because of the pleasure inherent in them.

The First Category: Bodily Acts of Worship - Those not involving others and containing no inherent pleasure
- Such as fasting, prayer, and pilgrimage. Within these, the whisperings of ostentation are threefold. The first is what enters before the act, inciting one to begin for people to see, with no religious motive present. This should be abandoned, for it is disobedience containing no obedience, as one dons the guise of worship to seek status. If a person can repel the incitement of ostentation from himself and say to his soul: "Do you not feel shame before your Master? You do not exert yourself in work for His sake, yet exert yourself in work for the sake of His servants?" until the incitement of ostentation is repelled and the soul willingly works for God as a punishment upon itself for the whisper of ostentation and an expiation for it, then let him engage in the act.

The second is to be incited for God's sake, but ostentation intrudes upon the intention of worship and its beginning. The act should not be abandoned because a religious motive is found. Let him commence the act and strive against his soul to repel ostentation and perfect sincerity through the treatments we mentioned: obliging the soul to detest ostentation and refusing acceptance.

The third is to resolve upon sincerity, then ostentation and its prompts occur. One should strive to repel it and not abandon the act, so that he may return to the resolve of sincerity and force his soul back to it until the act is completed. For Satan first calls you to abandon the act. If you do not comply and engage, he calls you to ostentation. If you do not answer and repel it, he remains saying to you: "This act is not sincere, you are an ostentatious show-off, and your toil is wasted. What benefit is there for you in an act without sincerity?" until he thereby induces you to abandon the act. If you abandon it, his objective is achieved. The example of one who abandons an act for fear of being ostentatious is like one to whom his master entrusted wheat containing chaff and said: "Purify it from the chaff and refine it thoroughly." He then abandons the work entirely and says: "I fear if I engage in it, it will not be purified purely and cleanly." Abandoning the work for this reason is abandoning sincerity along with the work itself; it is meaningless. Of this kind is abandoning work for fear that people will say he is ostentatious, thus seeking God's protection through it. This is from the snares of Satan, for first he thinks ill of the Muslims—it was not his right to think that of them—and even if they do say it, their words do not harm him, yet he misses the reward of worship. Abandoning work for fear they will say he is ostentatious is ostentation itself. Were it not for his love of their praise and fear of their blame, what concern would he have with their saying he is ostentatious or sincere? What difference is there between abandoning work for fear of being called ostentatious, and beautifying work for fear of being called negligent and deficient? Indeed, abandoning the work is more severe. All these are Satan's snares for ignorant worshippers. How then can he hope to be free from Satan by abandoning work, when Satan does not leave him but says: "Now people say you abandoned work so it would be said you are sincere and do not desire fame." He thereby compels you to flee. If you flee and enter a burrow underground, he casts into your heart the sweetness of people's recognition to make you renounce and flee from them, and their esteem for you in their hearts for that. How then will you be free from him? Indeed, there is no salvation from him except by obliging your heart to know the affliction of ostentation—that it is harm in the Hereafter and contains no benefit in this world—so that detestation and refusal become ingrained in your heart. Persist with that in the work and do not care. If the enemy, the whisperer of nature, provokes, it never ceases. Abandoning work for that reason leads to idleness and abandoning good deeds. As long as you find a religious motive for the work, do not abandon it. Strive against the whisper of ostentation, and oblige your heart to feel shame before God when your soul calls you to substitute His praise with the praise of creatures. He is aware of your heart, even if creation were aware of your heart and that you seek their praise, they would despise you. Rather, if you are able to increase in the work out of shame before your Lord and as a punishment upon your soul, then do so. If Satan says to you: "You are ostentatious," know his lie and deception by what you find in your heart of detesting ostentation, refusing it, fearing it, and your shame before God Almighty. If you find in your heart no detestation for it and no fear of it, and no religious motive remains, but the motive of ostentation stands alone, then abandon the act at that point—though this is remote. For whoever begins a work for God, the fundamental intention of reward must necessarily remain with him.

If you say: There are reports of people abandoning acts of worship for fear of ostentation. It is related that a person entered upon Ibrahim al-Nakha’i while he was reciting the Qur’an, so he closed the Mus’haf and ceased reciting, saying, "Let him not see that we are reciting at every hour." And Ibrahim al-Taymi said: "If speech pleases you, be silent; and if silence pleases you, speak." And al-Hasan said: "Indeed, one of them would pass by harmful litter on the road, and nothing would prevent him from removing it except aversion to ostentation; and one of them would be overcome by weeping, yet would turn it to laughter for fear of ostentation." Many narrations have come regarding this.

We say: This is countered by what has come concerning the open performance of devotions by countless individuals, and al-Hasan al-Basri’s very statement of this in the context of exhortation is closer to being motivated by fear of ostentation than weeping or removing litter from the road—yet he did not abandon it.

In summary, abandoning supererogatory acts is permissible, and the discussion concerns which is superior. Superiority is only attainable by the strong, not the weak. The superior course is to complete the act, strive for sincerity, and not abandon it. However, the practitioners of worship may sometimes compel themselves to act contrary to what is superior due to intense fear; therefore, emulation should be of the strong.

As for Ibrahim al-Nakha’i closing the Mus’haf, it is possible he knew he would need to stop reciting upon the person’s entry and would resume after his departure due to being occupied with conversing with him. He considered that not being seen reciting was further removed from hypocrisy, as he was determined to stop for the sake of attending to the visitor until he could return to it afterward.

As for abandoning the removal of harmful litter, that is from one who fears for himself the affliction of ostentation and people turning to him and occupying him with matters that distract him from acts of worship greater than removing a piece of wood from the road. Thus, abandoning it is for the preservation of greater acts of worship, not merely from fear of hypocrisy.

As for al-Taymi’s saying, "If speech pleases you, be silent," it is plausible that he meant permissible speech, such as eloquence in storytelling and the like, for that begets vanity. Likewise, vanity over permissible silence is a danger; thus, it is shifting from one permissible to another permissible out of caution against vanity. He did not specify righteous, recommended speech, since the affliction is greater in speech, and this falls into the second category. Our discussion, however, concerns acts of worship specific to the servant’s body that do not involve others and in which the afflictions are not as great.

Finally, al-Hasan’s statement about them abandoning weeping and removing litter for fear of ostentation may be a description of the state of the weak who do not recognize the superior course nor perceive these subtleties. He mentioned it only to warn people of the affliction of ostentation and to deter them from seeking it.

The second category pertains to interactions with creation, wherein the perils and risks are magnified. The gravest of these is the caliphate, followed by judicial authority, then admonition and teaching and issuing legal rulings, and then the expenditure of wealth.

As for the caliphate and leadership: they are among the finest acts of worship when accompanied by justice and sincerity. The Prophet ﷺ said, "A single day of a just ruler is better than the worship of a man alone for sixty years." How great is a worship whose single day equals the worship of sixty years! And he ﷺ said, "The first to enter Paradise are three: the just ruler" being one of them. Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Three whose supplication is not rejected: the just ruler" is one of them. And he ﷺ said, "The people closest to me in seating on the Day of Resurrection is a just ruler," as narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Thus, leadership and the caliphate are among the greatest acts of worship, yet the God-fearing have consistently abandoned them, guarded against them, and fled from assuming them due to the immense peril involved, for it stirs the hidden traits within, and the soul is overcome by love of status, the pleasure of domination, and the execution of command, which is the greatest of worldly delights. When authority becomes beloved, the ruler strives for his own share, and he is prone to follow his desires, refraining from anything that might tarnish his status and authority even if it is right, and pursuing what enhances his position even if it is false. At that point, he is ruined, and a day under a tyrannical ruler becomes worse than sixty years of sinfulness, as understood from the hadith we mentioned. Due to this immense peril, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to say, "Who will take it with what it entails?" And how could it not be so, when the Prophet ﷺ said, "There is no ruler of ten except that he will come on the Day of Resurrection with his hand shackled to his neck; his justice will free him or his injustice will doom him," as narrated by Mi'qal ibn Yasar. 'Umar appointed him to a governorship, and he said, "O Commander of the Faithful, advise me." He said, "Sit down and keep silent." Al-Hasan narrated that a man was appointed by the Prophet ﷺ, and he said to the Prophet, "Choose for me." He said, "Sit down." Likewise is the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Samurah when the Prophet ﷺ said to him, "O 'Abd al-Rahman, do not ask for authority, for if you are given it without asking, you will be aided in it; but if you are given it because of asking, you will be left to it." And Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said to Rafi' ibn 'Umar, "Do not command even two," while he himself held the caliphate and undertook it. Rafi' said to him, "Did you not tell me not to command even two, while you have taken charge of the community of Muhammad ﷺ?" He replied, "Yes, and I say that to you: whoever is not just in it, upon him is the curse of God." Perhaps one of little insight sees what has been reported regarding the merit of leadership and what has been reported prohibiting it as contradictory, but it is not so. Rather, the truth in it is that the spiritually strong elite in religion should not refrain from assuming positions of authority, while the weak should not revolve around it and thus perish. By "the strong," I mean one whom the world does not sway, whom greed does not agitate, and whom no blame from any blamer deters for the sake of God. They are those for whom creation has fallen from their eyes, who are ascetic toward the world and weary of it and of mingling with people, who have subdued their souls and mastered them, and who have suppressed Satan so that he despairs of them. These are moved only by truth and settled only by truth, even if their souls perish in the process. They are the ones deserving of attaining the merit in leadership and the caliphate. Whoever knows he is not of this description, it is forbidden for him to delve into positions of authority. And whoever tests himself and finds it patient with the truth, abstaining from desires outside of authority, but fears it may change if it tastes the pleasure of authority, begins to relish status and delight in the execution of command, and thus dislikes removal, so he compromises out of fear of removal—concerning this, the scholars have differed: is he obliged to flee from assuming authority? Some said: It is not obligatory, for this is a fear of a future matter, while presently he has not known himself except as strong in adhering to truth and abandoning personal pleasures. The correct view is that he must be cautious, for the soul is deceitful, claiming truth and promising good. If it promised good with certainty, one would fear it might change upon assuming authority, so how much more when it shows hesitation? Refusing to accept authority is easier than removal after commencement, for removal is painful, and as it is said, "Removal is the divorce of men." Once begun, his soul does not willingly permit removal and inclines toward compromise and neglecting the truth, dragging him into the depths of Hell. He cannot withdraw from it except through death or forced removal, and therein lies immediate punishment for every lover of authority. Whenever the soul inclines toward seeking authority and is driven to ask and request it, that is a sign of evil. Therefore, he ﷺ said, "We do not appoint to our affair one who asks us for it." When you understand the differing rulings for the strong and the weak, you know that Abu Bakr's prohibition to Rafi' concerning authority and then his own assumption of it is not contradictory.

As for the judiciary: it is, even if below the caliphate and governorship, in their meaning. For every possessor of authority is an amir—that is, he has an effective command—and authority is beloved by nature. The reward in judging is immense with adherence to the truth, and the punishment in it is also immense with deviation from the truth. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Judges are three: two judges in the Fire and one judge in Paradise." And he, upon him be peace, said: "Whoever seeks to be appointed a judge has slaughtered himself without a knife." Thus, its ruling is the ruling of governorship: the weak and everyone for whom the world and its pleasures have weight in his sight should abandon it, and it should be undertaken by the strong whom no blamer's blame deters in the path of God. Whenever the rulers are oppressive and the judge is incapable of judging except by flattering them and neglecting some rights for their sake and for the sake of those attached to them—knowing that if he judged them by the truth they would depose him or not obey him—then it is not for him to undertake the judiciary. And if he does undertake it, then he must demand the rights from them, and fear of deposition is not an excuse permitting him to neglect at all. Rather, if he is deposed, the responsibility falls from him, so he should rejoice in deposition if he judges for God. If his soul does not permit that, then he is judging for the following of caprice and Satan, so how can he expect reward? He will be with the oppressors in the lowest depth of the Fire.

As for admonition, issuing legal rulings, teaching, narrating Hadith, and compiling elevated chains of transmission—and all that expands one's prestige and magnifies one's status—its peril is likewise great, akin to the peril of holding positions of authority. The God-fearing predecessors used to shun issuing legal rulings as much as they could, and they would say: "It is one of the doors of worldly life." And whoever says, "He narrated to us," has in effect said, "Make room for me." Bishr buried such-and-such a satchel of Hadith and said, "What prevents me from narrating is that I desire to narrate. If I desired not to narrate, I would narrate." The admonisher finds in his admonition, and in the people's hearts being moved by it, and in their successive weeping and cries and their turning to him, a pleasure unmatched by any other. When this overpowers his heart, his nature inclines toward every embellished speech that appeals to the common folk, even if it is false, and he flees from every speech the common folk find weighty, even if it is true. His entire concern becomes directed solely toward what stirs the hearts of the common folk and elevates his standing in their hearts. Thus, he hears no narration or wisdom except that his joy in it is from the perspective that it is suitable to be mentioned from the pulpit. Yet his joy in it should be from the perspective that he has come to know the path of felicity and the way of treading the path of religion, so that he may act upon it first, and then say: "When God bestows this blessing upon me and benefits me with this wisdom, I will convey it so that my Muslim brothers may share in its benefit." This, too, is among matters wherein fear and trial are great, so its ruling is the ruling of positions of authority. Thus, whoever has no motive except seeking prestige, status, profiting by religion, boasting, and vying in abundance should abandon it and oppose his desire therein, until his soul becomes disciplined, his resolve in religion strengthens, and he is secure from trial concerning himself. At that point, he may return to it.

If you say: "If this judgment is applied to all scholars, knowledge would cease and be obliterated, and people would fall into universal ignorance?" We respond: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) forbade seeking leadership and warned against it, saying, "You are eager for leadership, yet it will be regret and remorse on the Day of Resurrection, except for one who takes it rightfully." And he said, "How excellent is the wet-nurse, and how wretched is the weaned one." It is known that if sovereignty and leadership were abandoned, both religion and worldly affairs would be ruined, fighting would erupt among people, security would vanish, lands would be devastated, and livelihoods would cease. So why were they forbidden despite this? Umar (may God be pleased with him) struck Ubayy ibn Ka‘b when he saw people following him, while Ubayy was saying, "Ubayy is the master of the Muslims," and they would recite the Quran to him. Umar prevented them from following him, saying that it is a trial for the followed and humiliation for the follower. Yet Umar himself would preach and admonish without abstaining. A man asked Umar for permission to admonish people after the dawn prayer, but Umar refused. The man said, "Do you prevent me from sincerely advising people?" Umar replied, "I fear you will become inflated until you reach the Pleiades," seeing in him signs of desire for the prestige of preaching and people's acceptance. Judgeship and caliphate are among the things people need in their religion, like preaching, teaching, and issuing legal opinions. Each of these involves trial and pleasure, so there is no difference between them. As for the claim that forbidding this leads to the obliteration of knowledge, it is mistaken, for the Prophet’s prohibition of judgeship did not lead to its abandonment. Rather, leadership and love for it compel people to seek it. Likewise, love for leadership does not cause knowledge to be obliterated; even if people were imprisoned and chained from seeking knowledge that brings acceptance and leadership, they would escape and seek it. God has promised to support this religion through people who have no share (in the Hereafter), so do not occupy your heart with people's affairs, for God will not neglect them. Look to yourself. Moreover, I say: If there is a group in a town who undertake preaching, for example, the prohibition only means some abstain, for it is known that not all will abstain or abandon the pleasure of leadership. If there is only one in the town whose preaching benefits people due to his good speech, apparent good reputation, and his portrayal to the common people that he intends God alone in his preaching and has turned away from the world, we do not forbid him but say: Engage and struggle against your soul. If he says, "I cannot control myself," we say: Engage and struggle, for we know that if he abandoned it, all people would be ruined since no one else would undertake it. If he persists while his aim is prestige, he alone is ruined, and the safety of the religion of all is dearer to us than his alone. So we make him a ransom for the people, saying perhaps he is the one about whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "God supports this religion through people who have no share (in the Hereafter)." The preacher is one who encourages the Hereafter and renounces the world through his speech and outward conduct. As for what preachers in these times have introduced of embellished words and emboldening toward sins with fleeting witticisms, they must be expelled from lands, for they are deputies of the False Messiah and successors of Satan. Our discussion concerns a preacher of good preaching and fair outward appearance who inwardly harbors love for acceptance without intending otherwise. In what we have cited in the Book of Knowledge regarding the warning against evil scholars, there is clarification of the necessity to beware the trials and perils of knowledge. For this reason, Jesus (peace be upon him) said: O evil scholars, you fast, pray, and give charity, yet you do not do what you command; you teach what you do not practice. How evil is your judgment! You repent with words and wishes but act on desires. What avails you that you cleanse your skins while your hearts are filthy? By truth, I say to you: Do not be like a sieve that lets fine flour pass but retains the bran. Likewise, you let wisdom pass from your mouths but retain malice in your breasts. O slaves of the world, how can one attain the Hereafter whose desire for the world does not cease nor his craving for it cut off? By truth, I say to you: Your hearts weep over your deeds. You have placed the world under your tongues and deeds under your feet. By truth, I say to you: You have ruined your Hereafter by rectifying your world, so the rectification of the world is dearer to you than that of the Hereafter. What people are more base than you, if you but knew! Woe to you! How long will you describe the path to the misguided and reside in the abode of the tyrants? As if you call the people of the world to leave it for you! Wait, wait! Woe to you! What avails a dark house if a lamp is placed on its roof while its interior is a dark wilderness? Likewise, it avails you not that the light of knowledge is on your tongues while your interiors are desolate and empty! O slaves of the world, not like devout slaves nor like noble freemen, soon the world will uproot you from your foundations and cast you on your faces, then overturn you on your noses, then take your sins by your forelocks, then knowledge will push you from behind, then deliver you to the Sovereign Judge barefoot, naked, and alone. You will be stood before your disgrace, then recompensed for your evil deeds. Al-Harith al-Muhasibi narrated this saying in one of his books, then said: These evil ones are devils among mankind and a trial for people. They desired worldly gain and elevation, preferred it over the Hereafter, and subjugated religion to the world. In this life, they are disgrace and shame, and in the Hereafter, they are among the losers.

If you say: These afflictions are evident, yet there have come many encouragements regarding knowledge and admonition, such that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "For God to guide a man through you is better for you than the world and all it contains." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Any caller who calls to guidance and is followed in it will have his reward and the reward of those who follow him," among other virtues of knowledge. Thus, it might be said to the scholar: Occupy yourself with knowledge and abandon showing off to people, just as it is said to one afflicted with ostentation in prayer: Do not abandon the deed, but complete it and strive against your soul.

Know then that the virtue of knowledge is great and its peril immense, like the virtue of caliphate and leadership. We do not say to any of God's servants: Abandon knowledge, for there is no affliction in knowledge itself; rather, the affliction lies in displaying it by undertaking admonition, teaching, and narrating Hadith. Nor do we say to him: Abandon it as long as he finds within himself a religious motive mixed with a motive of ostentation. However, if nothing moves him except ostentation, then abandoning display is more beneficial and safer for him. Likewise, with supererogatory prayers, if the motive in them is purely ostentation, it is obligatory to leave them off. But if whispers of ostentation occur to him during the prayer while he dislikes them, he should not abandon the prayer, for the affliction of ostentation in acts of worship is weak; it only becomes grave in positions of authority and in undertaking major offices in knowledge.

In summary, the ranks are three: The first is positions of authority; the afflictions therein are great, and a group of the early predecessors abandoned them out of fear of these afflictions. The second is fasting, prayer, pilgrimage, and jihad; both the strong and the weak among the early predecessors engaged in them, and it is not reported that they abandoned them for fear of affliction. This is due to the weakness of the afflictions that enter into them and the ability to repel them while completing the work for God with minimal strength. The third rank, which is intermediate between the two, is undertaking the positions of preaching, issuing legal rulings, narration, and teaching. The afflictions in these are less than those in positions of authority and more than those in prayer. For prayer, neither the weak nor the strong should abandon it, but they should repel the thought of ostentation. As for positions of authority, the weak should abandon them outright, but not the strong. The positions of knowledge lie between them. Whoever has experienced the afflictions of the positions of knowledge knows that they more closely resemble positions of authority, and that caution regarding them is safer for the weak. And God knows best.

Here is a fourth rank: to gather wealth and take it in order to distribute it among those who are deserving. For in spending and displaying generosity lies the pursuit of praise, and in bringing joy to the hearts of people lies a delight for the soul—though the pitfalls therein are also many.

And for this reason, Al-Hasan was asked about a man who seeks his sustenance and then refrains, and another who seeks beyond his sustenance and then gives it in charity. He said: "The one who sits back is superior, for they recognize the scarcity of safety in this world, and that part of asceticism is abandoning it as a means of drawing near to God, Exalted is He." And Abu al-Darda' said: "It would not please me that I were to stand on the steps of the mosque of Damascus, earning fifty dinars every day to give in charity. Not that I forbid buying and selling, but I desire to be among those whom neither trade nor commerce distracts from the remembrance of God."

The scholars have differed on this matter. Some said: When one seeks worldly provision through lawful means, remains safe from its harms, and gives charity from it, this is superior to occupying oneself with acts of worship and supererogatory devotions. Others said: Remaining constantly engaged in the remembrance of God is superior, for taking and giving distract from God. Indeed, the Messiah, peace be upon him, said: "O seeker of the world to do good with it, your abandoning it is more pious." And he said: "The least of it is that its rectification distracts one from the remembrance of God, and the remembrance of God is greater and superior." This applies to one who remains safe from afflictions. As for one who is exposed to the affliction of showing off, abandoning it is more pious, and there is no disagreement that occupying oneself with remembrance is superior.

In summary, whatever pertains to creation and in which the soul finds pleasure is a source of afflictions. It is most beloved that one should act and repel these afflictions. If one is unable, then let him reflect, strive diligently, and seek the counsel of his heart. Let him weigh the good within it against the evil within it, and let him act according to what the light of knowledge indicates, not what natural inclination leans toward.

In summary, what one finds lighter upon the heart is, for the most part, more harmful to him, because the soul only directs to evil and rarely delights in good or inclines toward it—though this may not be far from occurring in some circumstances. These are matters whose details cannot be judged with absolute negation or affirmation; they are entrusted to the heart's diligent discernment, so that one may consider what is for his religion and abandon what causes him doubt for what does not. Yet, from what we have mentioned, deception may befall the ignorant, so he withholds wealth and does not spend it, fearing loss, and this is precisely miserliness. There is no dispute that distributing wealth in permissible matters, let alone in charity, is better than hoarding it. The disagreement lies rather for one who needs to earn a livelihood: is it better to earn and spend, or to devote oneself solely to remembrance? This is due to the harms inherent in earning. As for wealth already obtained lawfully, distributing it is better than withholding it in every circumstance.

If you ask, "By what sign can the scholar and the preacher be known to be truthful in his admonition, not seeking the ostentation of people?" Then know that for this there are signs. One of them is that if someone appears whose admonition is more beautiful or whose knowledge is more abundant, and people accept him more readily, he rejoices in it and does not envy him. Yes, there is no harm in *ghibṭah* (emulative desire), which is to wish for oneself the like of his deed. Another is that when the eminent ones attend his gathering, his speech does not change, but he remains as he was, looking upon creation with a single eye. Another is that he does not love for people to follow him on the road or walk behind him in the markets. And for this there are many signs, too numerous to count.

It has been narrated from Sa'id ibn Abi Marwan, who said: I was sitting beside al-Hasan when al-Hajjaj entered upon us from one of the mosque gates with his guards, mounted on a yellow steed. He entered the mosque on his steed and began glancing around the mosque, but he did not see any study circle more crowded than the circle of al-Hasan, so he headed towards it until he drew near. Then he bent his thigh and dismounted, walking towards al-Hasan. When al-Hasan saw him approaching, he shifted aside from his place in the gathering. Sa'id said: I also shifted aside from my place until there was a space between me and al-Hasan, and a seat for al-Hajjaj. Al-Hajjaj came and sat between me and him while al-Hasan was speaking his words—he would speak every day—and al-Hasan did not interrupt his speech. Sa'id said: I said to myself, 'I will test al-Hasan today and see whether al-Hasan's sitting with al-Hajjaj will cause him to increase his speech to draw near to him, or whether awe of al-Hajjaj will cause al-Hasan to decrease his speech?' But al-Hasan spoke a single discourse, similar to what he would speak every day, until he reached the end of his words. When al-Hasan finished his speech, unconcerned with him, al-Hajjaj raised his hand and struck it upon al-Hasan's shoulder, then said, 'The elder has spoken truthfully and rightly. Upon you is to attend these gatherings and their like; take them as circles and a regular practice, for it has reached me from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that "the gatherings of remembrance are the gardens of Paradise." Were it not for the burden of governing the people, you would not have surpassed us in these gatherings, due to our knowledge of their virtue.' Then al-Hajjaj paused and spoke until al-Hasan and those present marveled at his eloquence. When he finished, he promptly stood up. A man from the people of Syria came to al-Hasan's gathering—after al-Hajjaj had stood—and said, 'O servants of God, Muslims, are you not astonished that I am an old man, that I go on campaign and am burdened with a horse and a mule, and burdened with a tent, and that I have three hundred dirhams as stipend, and that I have seven daughters among my dependents?' He complained of his condition until al-Hasan and his companions felt compassion for him, while al-Hasan was bowed down. When the man finished speaking, al-Hasan raised his head and said, 'What is wrong with them? May God destroy them! They have taken the servants of God as chattel and the wealth of God as spoils, and they kill people for a dinar and a dirham. When the enemy of God goes on campaign, he goes in spacious tents and on swift mules, but when he sends his brother on campaign, he sends him hungry and on foot?' Al-Hasan did not cease until he reminded them of the ugliest and most severe blame. A man from the people of Syria who had been sitting with al-Hasan rose and went to inform al-Hajjaj, relating his words to him. It was not long before messengers from al-Hajjaj came to al-Hasan and said, 'Answer the commander.' Al-Hasan rose, and we feared for him because of the severity of the words he had spoken. But it was not long before al-Hasan returned to his gathering smiling—rarely did I see him open his mouth in laughter; he would only smile—and he came forward and sat in his place. He spoke of the gravity of trust and said, 'You only sit in company by trust. It is as if you think betrayal is only in dinars and dirhams. Indeed, the gravest betrayal is that a man sits with us, and we feel at ease beside him, then he goes off and sows a spark from a fire! I went to this man, and he said, "Restrain your tongue and your speech: 'When the enemy of God goes on campaign, he goes thus and so, and when he sends his brother, he sends him thus!' Woe to you! Do you incite the people against us? Yet we do not doubt your sincere counsel, so restrain your tongue."' He said, 'And God turned him away from me.' Al-Hasan mounted a donkey intending to go home, and while he was riding, he turned and saw people following him. He stopped and said, 'Do you have a need, or do you ask about something? If not, then return, for what does this leave in the heart of a servant?' By these signs and their like, the inner secret becomes clear. Whenever you see the scholars showing mutual aversion and envy, not being intimate and not cooperating, know that they have purchased the life of this world at the expense of the Hereafter; they are the losers. O God, have mercy on us by Your gentleness, O Most Merciful of the merciful.

Explanation of What Constitutes Valid Human Effort in Worship

Due to the perception of creation and what is not permissible.

Know that a man may lodge with people in a place, and they rise for night vigil prayer, or some of them rise and pray the whole night or part of it, while he is one who rises in his own home for only a short while. When he sees them, his zeal is stirred to join them, so that he increases beyond what he was accustomed to, or he prays even though he was not accustomed to praying at night at all. Likewise, it may occur in a place where the people of that place are fasting, and zeal for fasting is stirred in him—and were it not for them, this zeal would not have been stirred. This might lead him to suppose it is ostentation and that the obligation is to abandon conformity, but it is not so absolutely; rather, it has a detailed explanation.

For every believer is desirous of worshiping God Most High, of standing in night prayer and fasting by day, but obstacles may hinder him, preoccupations may prevent him, indulgence in pleasures may overcome him, or heedlessness may beguile him. Perhaps witnessing others becomes a cause for the removal of heedlessness, or obstacles and preoccupations are pushed aside in some situations, and zeal is stirred in him. A man may be in his home, and various reasons cut him off from night vigil, such as the ease of sleeping on a soft bed, the ability to enjoy his wife, conversing with his family and relatives, being occupied with his children, or reviewing accounts with his business partners. If he finds himself in a stranger’s home, these distractions that weaken his desire for good are pushed away from him, and he attains incentives for good, such as seeing them turning to God and turning away from the world. He looks at them and competes with them, and it grieves him that they should precede him in obeying God, so the motive of religion is stirred, not ostentation. Or perhaps sleep leaves him due to the unfamiliarity of the place or another reason, and he seizes the absence of sleep, whereas in his home sleep may overcome him. Additionally, he is in his home constantly, and the soul does not permit night vigil always but permits it for a short time, so that becomes a cause for this zeal along with the removal of other obstacles.

Fasting may be difficult for him in his home with delicious foods present, and patience from them is hard for him. If those foods are unavailable, it is not hard for him, so the motive of religion for fasting is stirred, for present appetites are obstacles and drives that overcome the motive of religion; when one is safe from them, the motive is strengthened. This and similar causes are conceivable, and the cause in it is witnessing people and being with them. Yet Satan may hinder from action and say, “Do not act, for you will be an ostentatious person if you do not act in your home and do not increase beyond your accustomed prayer.” Or his desire for increase may be for the sake of seeing them and fearing their blame and attributing laziness to him, especially if they suppose about him that he performs night prayer, for his soul does not permit falling in their eyes, so he wishes to preserve his standing. At that, Satan may say, “Pray, for you are sincere and not praying for their sake but for God; you were not praying every night due to many obstacles, and your motive is the removal of obstacles, not their observation.” This is a matter ambiguous except for those of insight.

If he knows that the motivator is ostentation, he should not increase beyond what he was accustomed to, not even a single rak’ah, for he disobeys God by seeking people’s praise through obeying God. But if his stirring is to push away obstacles and the movement of emulation and competition due to their worship, then let him conform. The sign of that is to present to himself: if he saw these people praying from where they do not see him—behind a veil—while he is in that very place, would his soul be generous with prayer while they do not see him? If his soul is generous, then let him pray, for his motive is true. If it would be burdensome on his soul were he absent from their eyes, then let him leave it, for his motive is ostentation.

Likewise, a person may attend the Friday prayer in the mosque with a zeal for prayer that he does not have every day. It is possible that this is due to love of their praise, and it is possible that his zeal is due to their zeal and the removal of his heedlessness because of their turning to God Most High. The motive of religion may be stirred by that, and alongside it the soul’s inclination to love praise may accompany it. Whenever he knows that the predominant in his heart is the desire for religion, he should not abandon the action due to what he finds of love for praise; rather, he should repel that upon himself with dislike and occupy himself with worship.

Likewise, a group may weep, and he looks at them and weeping comes to him out of fear of God Most High, not ostentation, though if he heard that speech alone he would not weep. But the weeping of people affects the softening of the heart. Weeping may not come to him, so he forces weeping—sometimes ostentatiously and sometimes with sincerity—for he fears hardness of heart for himself when they weep and his eye does not shed tears, so he forces weeping with effort, and that is praiseworthy. The sign of sincerity in it is to present to himself: if he heard their weeping from where they do not see him, would he fear hardness of heart for himself and force weeping or not? If he does not find that upon imagining concealment from their eyes, then his fear is only that it be said he has a hard heart, so he should abandon forcing weeping. Luqman, peace be upon him, said to his son, “Do not let people see that you fear God so that they honor you while your heart is wicked.”

Likewise, the cry, sighing, and groaning at the Quran or remembrance or some passing states: sometimes they are from sincerity, grief, fear, remorse, and regret; and sometimes they are due to witnessing the grief of another and the hardness of his own heart, so he forces sighing and groaning and feigns sorrow, and that is praiseworthy. But the desire for it may accompany it to indicate that he is much grieved so that he be known by that. If this motive is isolated, it is ostentation. If it is accompanied by the motive of grief, then if he rejects it and does not accept it and dislikes it, his weeping and forcing weeping are safe. But if he accepts that and relies on it in his heart, his reward is nullified, his effort is lost, and he is exposed to the displeasure of God Most High by it. The origin of groaning may be from grief, but he extends it and increases in raising the voice—that increase is ostentation, and it is forbidden because it is in the ruling of initiating purely for ostentation. Fear may stir what the servant cannot control himself with, but the thought of ostentation precedes him and he accepts it, so it calls to increasing the sorrowfulness of the voice or raising it or preserving the tear on the face so that it is seen after it flowed for fear of God, but he preserves its trace on the face for the sake of ostentation.

Likewise, he may hear the remembrance and his strength weakens from fear so he falls, then he is ashamed that it be said to him that he fell without loss of consciousness and a severe state, so he cries out and feigns ecstasy to be seen as having fainted, though the beginning of the fall was from sincerity. His consciousness may leave so he falls, but he recovers quickly, and his soul is distressed that it be said his state is not stable but is like a fleeting lightning bolt, so he prolongs the cry and dancing to be seen as having a lasting state. Likewise, he may recover after weakness, but his weakness leaves quickly, and he is distressed that it be said his fainting was not genuine—if it were, his weakness would have lasted—so he prolongs displaying weakness and groaning, leaning on another to be seen as too weak to stand, swaying in walking, and shortening steps to show he is too weak for fast walking. All these are the snares of Satan and the whisperings of the soul.

If they occur, their remedy is to remember that if people knew his hypocrisy inwardly and were aware of his conscience, they would despise him, and God is aware of his conscience and is more severe in despising him. As related from Dhul-Nun, mercy of God upon him, that he stood and cried out, and another elder stood with him who saw in him the effect of affectation and said, “O elder! Who sees you when you stand?” So the elder sat down. And all that is from the deeds of the hypocrites.

It has been reported in the tradition: "Seek refuge with Allah from the hypocrisy of outward devotion." For the hypocrisy of outward devotion is when the limbs show humility while the heart is not humble. Among such matters are seeking forgiveness and seeking refuge with Allah from His punishment and wrath, for this may arise from a thought of fear, remembrance of a sin, and regret over it, or it may be for show. These are thoughts that come upon the heart—opposing, successive, and closely resembling one another. Despite their closeness, they are similar. So, watch over your heart in everything that occurs to you, and consider what it is and from where it comes. If it is for Allah, then proceed with it, but beware lest some aspect of ostentation, which is like the crawling of ants, remains hidden from you. Be apprehensive about your worship: is it accepted or not? I fear for you regarding sincerity within it. Beware lest a thought of relying on people's praise arises anew after you have begun with sincerity, for that occurs very frequently. If such a thought occurs to you, then reflect upon Allah's awareness of you and His displeasure with you. Remember what one of the three who debated with Job, peace be upon him, said when he stated: "O Job, do you not know that a servant may lose the outward acts with which he deceived himself, and he is recompensed according to his secret inner state." And the saying of some: "I seek refuge with You that people see me as fearing You while You hold me in contempt." And among the supplications of Ali ibn al-Husayn, may Allah be pleased with them both, was: "O Allah, I seek refuge with You that I make my outward deeds pleasing in the sight of people while my secret inner state is ugly to You, preserving the ostentation for people from myself while neglecting what You are aware of from me. I display to people the best of my affairs and convey to You the worst of my deeds, drawing near to people with my good deeds and fleeing from them to You with my sins, so that Your displeasure settles upon me and Your wrath becomes incumbent upon me. Grant me refuge from that, O Lord of the worlds." And one of the three men said to Job, peace be upon him: "O Job, do you not know that those who guarded their outward deeds and neglected their secret inner states when beseeching the Most Merciful for their needs—their faces will turn black." These are the summary of the harms of ostentation. So let the servant watch over his heart to recognize them, for in the tradition it is said: "Indeed, ostentation has seventy gates." And you have come to know that some of it is more subtle than other parts, to the extent that some of it is like the crawling of ants, and some of it is more hidden than the crawling of ants. How can what is more hidden than the crawling of ants be perceived except through intense scrutiny and vigilance? And if only one could perceive it after exerting great effort, then how can one hope to perceive it without scrutinizing the heart, examining the soul, and investigating its deceptions? We ask Allah, the Exalted, for well-being through His grace, generosity, and kindness.

Explanation of What the Seeker Ought to Adhere to in His Conduct

Before the deed, during it, and after it.

Know that the foremost obligation binding the seeker's heart in all moments is contentment with God's knowledge in all his acts of obedience. None is content with God's knowledge save he who fears none but God and hopes in none but God. As for one who fears another and places hope in him, he desires that other to behold the excellence of his states. If he is in this rank, let him bind his heart to detest this from the standpoint of intellect and faith, due to the peril of incurring divine wrath. Let him vigilantly watch his soul during great, arduous acts of worship that none but he can perform, for at such times the soul nearly boils with eagerness to disclose, saying: "Such a mighty deed, such profound fear, such copious weeping—if creation knew of it from you, they would prostrate to you! None among creation is capable of the like, so how can you be content to conceal it, leaving people ignorant of your station, denying your worth, and deprived of following your example?" In such a matter, he must stand firm and recall, in contrast to the greatness of his deed: the greatness of the dominion of the Hereafter, the bliss of Paradise and its everlasting perpetuity, and the greatness of God's anger and wrath upon those who seek through their obedience a reward from His servants. Let him know that displaying his deeds to others is beloved to him but a degradation before God, nullifying the great work. So let him say: "How can I follow such a deed with the praise of creation, who are powerless, unable to provide me with provision or term of life?" Let this bind his heart, and he must not despair, saying: "Only the strong are capable of sincerity; as for the sincere, it is not their affair," thereby abandoning the struggle for sincerity. For the sincere is in greater need of this than the God-fearing, because if the God-fearing's supererogatory acts are corrupted, his obligatory acts remain complete and sound, whereas the one who mixes his deeds cannot keep his obligations free from deficiency and need for compensation through supererogatory acts. If they are not sound, he is seized for his obligations and perishes by them. Thus, the one who mixes is in greater need of sincerity. Tamim al-Dari reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "The servant will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection. If his obligation is deficient, it will be said: 'Look, does he have any voluntary deeds?' If he has voluntary deeds, his obligation is completed with them. If he has no voluntary deeds, he is seized by his edges and cast into the Fire." So the one who mixes will come on the Day of Resurrection with his obligation deficient and many sins upon him; his striving is to compensate the obligations and atone for the misdeeds, and this is only possible through the purity of his supererogatory acts. As for the God-fearing, his effort is for increasing ranks; if his voluntary deeds are nullified, enough of his good deeds remain to outweigh the misdeeds, and he enters Paradise.

Therefore, it is necessary for one's heart to be bound by the fear of being observed by anyone other than God, so that his voluntary acts may be sound. Then, his heart must remain bound by this after completion, so that he does not display it nor speak of it. And if he does all of that, he should be apprehensive of his deed, fearing that perhaps some hidden ostentation, which he did not perceive, has entered into it. Thus, he would be uncertain of its acceptance or rejection, considering it possible that God has recorded against him from his hidden intention that which He detests, and has rejected his deed because of it. This doubt and fear should persist during his deed and after it, except at the moment of initial resolve. Rather, at the outset, he should be certain that he intends by his deed nothing but God, so that his deed may be sound. When he begins and a moment passes in which heedlessness or forgetfulness is possible, then fear of heedlessness regarding a hidden blemish—such as ostentation or vanity—that might nullify his deed is more fitting for him. Yet, his hope should outweigh his fear, because he is certain that he entered with sincerity but doubts whether he has corrupted it with ostentation. Thus, hope for acceptance becomes predominant, and through this, his delight in intimate communion and acts of obedience is magnified.

Sincerity is certainty, while ostentation is doubt. The fear of that doubt is worthy of erasing any trace of ostentation, should it have preceded while one was heedless of it. Whoever draws near to God by striving to fulfill people's needs and imparting knowledge must bind himself to hope for reward solely for bringing joy to the heart of the one whose need he fulfilled, and hope for reward solely for the deed performed by the learner with his knowledge—without expecting thanks, recompense, praise, or commendation from the learner or the beneficiary, for that nullifies the reward. If he anticipates from the learner any assistance in a task or service, or companionship on a journey to feel increased by his following, or frequent visits from him for a need, then he has taken his recompense and has no reward besides it. Yes, if he does not anticipate or intend anything except the reward for his own deed through his knowledge, so that he may have the like of its reward—but the student's personal service is accepted from him—then we hope that this does not nullify his reward, since he neither awaits it nor desires it from him, nor would he reject it if cut off. Despite this, the scholars used to warn against this, to the extent that one of them fell into a well, and people came and lowered a rope to lift him out, but he stipulated that none who had recited a verse of the Quran under him or heard a hadith from him should stand with them, fearing it would nullify his reward. Shaqiq al-Balkhi said: I offered a garment to Sufyan al-Thawri, and he refused it. I said to him: O Abu 'Abdullah, I am not one who hears hadith until you accept it from me. He said: I know that, but your brother hears hadith from me, and I fear my heart may soften more for your brother than for others. A man came to Sufyan with a bag or two of dates—and Abu was a friend of Sufyan, and Sufyan used to visit him often—and said to him: O Abu 'Abdullah, is there something in your heart against my father? He replied: May God have mercy on your father—he was such and such—and he praised him. The man said: O Abu 'Abdullah, you know how this wealth came to me, and I wish you to take this to assist your family. Sufyan accepted it. When the man left, Sufyan said to his son: O Mubarak, catch up to him and return it to me. He returned and said: I wish you to take your wealth. He persisted until he returned it to him. It was as if his brotherhood with his father in God, exalted is He, made him dislike taking it. His son said: When he left, I could not restrain myself from going to him and saying: Woe to you! What is this heart of yours? Stone? Consider that you have no dependents! Do you not have mercy on me? Do you not have mercy on your brothers? Do you not have mercy on our family? I pressed him greatly, and he said to me: O Mubarak, you may eat it with ease and comfort, while I am questioned about it.

Therefore, it is incumbent upon the scholar to bind his heart solely to seeking reward from God for guiding people through him. And it is incumbent upon the student to bind his heart to praising God, seeking His reward, and attaining a station with Him—not with the teacher or with created beings. Perhaps he may think it permissible to show off with his obedience to gain status with his teacher, so that he may learn from him. This is an error, for his intention in his obedience being for other than God is a present loss, and knowledge may or may not benefit. So how can he incur a present loss for an action performed in hand, based on the mere assumption of knowledge! This is not permissible. Rather, he should learn for God, worship God, and serve the teacher for God's sake—not so that the teacher may have a station in his heart—if he desires his learning to be an act of obedience. For the servants have been commanded to worship none but God and to intend with their obedience none but Him. Likewise, one who serves his parents should not serve them to seek a station with them, except insofar as God's pleasure lies in the pleasure of the parents. It is not permissible for him to show off with his obedience to gain thereby a station with his parents, for that is disobedience in the present, and God will expose his ostentation, and his station will also fall from the hearts of his parents. As for the ascetic who withdraws from people, he should bind his heart to the remembrance of God and contentment with His knowledge, and let not the thought of people knowing his asceticism and esteeming his position enter his heart. For that plants ostentation in his breast, making acts of worship easy for him in his seclusion because of it. Indeed, his silence is for people to know of his withdrawal and esteem his position, while he does not realize that it is what lightens the burden of the work upon him.

Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, said: I learned spiritual knowledge from a monk named Simon. I entered his cell and said, "O Simon, how long have you been in this cell?" He said, "For seventy years." I said, "Then what is your food?" He said, "O Hanifi, what calls you to this?" I said, "I wished to know." He said, "Each night, a chickpea." I said, "Then what stirs in your heart such that this single chickpea suffices you?" He said, "Do you see the monastery opposite you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "They come to me once every year, adorn my cell, circle around it, and honor me. So whenever my soul grows sluggish in worship, I remind it of the honor of that hour, and thus I endure the hardship of a year for the honor of an hour! So endure, O Hanifi, the hardship of an hour for the honor of eternity." Then spiritual knowledge settled firmly in my heart. He said, "Is this sufficient for you, or shall I increase you?" I said, "Yes, increase me." He said, "Descend from the cell." I descended, and he lowered a small bucket to me containing twenty chickpeas and said to me, "Enter the monastery, for they have seen what I lowered to you." When I entered the monastery, the Christians gathered around me and said, "O Hanifi, what is it that the elder lowered to you?" I said, "From his moment." They said, "Then what will you do with it, when we are more entitled to it?" Then they said, "Set a price!" I said, "Twenty dinars." So they gave me twenty dinars. I returned to the elder, and he said, "O Hanifi, what have you done?" I said, "I sold it to them." He said, "For how much?" I said, "For twenty dinars." He said, "You erred! Had you bargained with them for twenty thousand dinars, they would have given it. This is the honor from One you do not worship, so consider how the honor from the One you worship would be! O Hanifi, turn to your Lord and abandon coming and going."

The intended meaning is that the soul's perception of the grandeur of majesty within hearts can be an instigator during seclusion, and the servant may not even be aware of it. Therefore, one must oblige oneself to be cautious of it. A sign of safety is that all creation and animals are of equal standing to him. If people were to change their opinion of him, he would not be distressed nor would he feel constrained by it, except for a faint dislike—if he finds it in his heart, he repels it immediately with his intellect and faith. For if he were in worship and all people observed him, it would not increase his humility, nor would any joy enter him because of their observation. If a slight joy does enter, it is evidence of his weakness; however, if he is able to repel it with the aversion of intellect and faith, hastens to do so, and does not accept that joy by acquiescing to it, then it is hoped that his striving will not be in vain. Except that if he increases in humility and restraint when they are present so that they do not become familiar with him, there is no harm in that, but there is deception in it, for the soul may have a hidden desire to display humility and pretends to seek restraint. He must then demand from it, in its claim of intending restraint, a weighty covenant from God: that if he knew their restraint from him occurred because he were to run excessively, laugh excessively, or eat excessively, would his soul be content with that? If it would not be content yet is content with worship, it resembles that its aim is status among them. None is saved from that except one in whose heart it is firmly established that there is no one in existence except God, so he acts as one who, if he were alone on the face of the earth, would perform the same act. Thus, his heart does not turn to creation except for weak fleeting thoughts that are not burdensome to remove. When he is thus, he is not altered by the observation of creation.

Among the signs of sincerity in this is that if he had two companions, one rich and the other poor, he would not find in the approach of the rich any increased agitation in his soul—no honor except if the wealth is accompanied by increased knowledge or increased piety, in which case he honors him for that attribute, not for the wealth. Whoever finds more comfort in observing the rich is either a hypocrite or covetous; otherwise, looking at the poor increases desire for the Hereafter and brings humility to the heart, while looking at the rich has the opposite effect. So how can one find more comfort in looking at the rich than at the poor? It has been related that the rich were never seen more humbled than in the gathering of Sufyan al-Thawri; he would seat them behind the row and give precedence to the poor, to the extent that they wished they were poor in his gathering. Yes, there may be additional honor for the rich if he is closer to you or there is a prior right and friendship between you, but it should be such that if you found that same relationship in a poor person, you would not give the rich person precedence over him in honor and reverence at all. For the poor are more honorable to God than the rich; your preference can only be due to coveting his wealth or hypocrisy toward him. Then, if you equate them in seating, it is to be feared that you display wisdom and humility to the rich more than to the poor, and that is nothing but hidden hypocrisy or hidden covetousness, as Ibn al-Sammak said to his servant girl, "Why is it that when I go to Baghdad, wisdom opens up for me?" She replied, "Covetousness sharpens your tongue," and she spoke the truth! For the tongue speaks in the presence of the rich what it does not speak in the presence of the poor, and likewise, humility is present with him that is not present with the poor. The stratagems and hidden aspects of the soul in this art are innumerable, and nothing saves you from them except that you remove from your heart all but God, and devote yourself with compassion for your soul for the rest of your life, not being content for it with the Fire due to troublesome desires in fleeting days. Be in this world like a king of worldly kings whom desires have empowered and pleasures have assisted, but in his body is an illness, and he fears destruction for himself at every hour if he indulges in desires. He knows that if he restrains himself and struggles against his desire, he will live and his kingdom will endure. So when he realized that, he sat with physicians and associated with apothecaries, accustomed himself to drinking bitter medicines, endured their repulsiveness, abandoned all pleasures, and bore patience in parting from them. His body grows thinner each day due to little eating, but his illness decreases each day due to his intense restraint. Whenever his soul contends with him toward a desire, he reflects on the succession of pains and sufferings that will befall him, leading to the death that separates him from his kingdom and causes his enemies to gloat. Whenever drinking a medicine becomes severe for him, he reflects on what he gains from it of healing, which is the cause of enjoying his kingdom and bliss in a pleasant life, a sound body, a content heart, and effective command. Thus, abandoning pleasures and enduring hardships become light upon him.

Similarly, the believing aspirant to the kingdom of the Hereafter restrains himself from everything that would destroy him in his afterlife—namely, the pleasures and allurements of this world—contenting himself with little from them, choosing thinness, withering, solitude, grief, and fear. He abandons familiarity with creation, fearing that God's wrath might descend upon him and destroy him, and hoping to be saved from punishment. All of that becomes light upon him due to the strength of his certainty and faith in the outcome of his affair and in what has been prepared for him of everlasting bliss in God's pleasure for all eternity. Then he knows that God is Generous, Merciful, ever a help to His servants who desire His pleasure, compassionate and kind to them. Had He willed, He could have spared them the toil, but He desired to test them and know the sincerity of their intention, out of His wisdom and justice. Then, when he bears the toil at its beginning, God turns to him with assistance and facilitation, lightens his burdens, makes patience easy for him, endears obedience to him, and grants him therein from the delight of intimate discourse what distracts him from all other pleasures, strengthens him to mortify desires, and undertakes his governance, strengthening him and supporting him with His aid. For the Generous One does not waste the striving of the hopeful nor disappoint the expectation of the lover. He is the One who says, "Whoever draws near to Me by a span, I draw near to him by a cubit," and He, exalted, says, "Long indeed has been the yearning of the righteous to meet Me, and I am more eager to meet them." So let the servant manifest at the outset his earnestness, sincerity, and purity, and he will not lack from God, exalted, in proximity what is befitting of His bounty, generosity, compassion, and mercy.

The book on the condemnation of ignorance and ostentation is completed, and praise be to God alone.

[1] Hadith: "The most fearful thing I fear for my community is ostentation and the hidden desire." Reported by Ibn Majah and Al-Hakim from the narration of Shaddad ibn Aws, and they both said "polytheism" instead of "ostentation" and interpreted it as ostentation. Al-Hakim said its chain is authentic. I say: Rather, it is weak. It is found in Ibn Al-Mubarak's "Az-Zuhd" and from his route in Al-Bayhaqi's "Ash-Shu'ab" with the wording of the author.

[2] Hadith of Anas: "It suffices a man as evil, except for whom Allah protects, that people point fingers at him concerning his religion and his worldly life." Reported by Al-Bayhaqi in "Ash-Shu'ab" with a weak chain.

[3] Hadith of Jabir: "It suffices a man as evil..." The hadith is similar and adds at its end: "Indeed, Allah does not look at your appearances..." This is not known from the narration of Jabir; it is known from the narration of Abu Hurairah. Reported by At-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" and Al-Bayhaqi in "Ash-Shu'ab" with a weak chain, restricting it to its beginning. Muslim reported it, restricting it to the addition at its end. At-Tabarani and Al-Bayhaqi in "Ash-Shu'ab" reported its beginning from the narration of 'Imran ibn Husayn with the wording: "It suffices a man as sin..." Ibn Yunus reported it in "Tarikh Al-Ghuraba'" from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with the wording: "A man's destruction..." and interpreted "his religion" as innovation and "his worldly life" as transgression. Both their chains are weak.

[4] Hadith: "How many a dishevelled, dust-covered man in two worn-out garments, who is given no attention, if he were to swear by Allah, Allah would fulfill it for him; among them is Al-Bara' ibn Malik." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah: "How many a dishevelled man, pushed away at the doors, if he were to swear by Allah, Allah would fulfill it for him." And for Al-Hakim: "How many a dishevelled, dust-covered man in two worn-out garments, from whom people's eyes turn away, if he were to swear by Allah, Allah would fulfill it for him." And he said its chain is authentic. For Abu Nu'aym in "Al-Hilyah" from the narration of Anas, weak: "How many a man in two worn-out garments who is given no attention, if he were to swear by Allah, Allah would fulfill it for him; among them is Al-Bara' ibn Malik." It is found in Al-Hakim similarly with this addition, and he said its chain is authentic. I say: Rather, it is weak.

[5] Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "How many a man in two worn-out garments who is given no attention, if he were to swear by Allah, Allah would fulfill it for him. If he were to say: 'O Allah, I ask You for Paradise,' He would grant him Paradise and would not give him anything from the worldly life." Reported by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya and from his route Abu Mansur Ad-Daylami in "Musnad Al-Firdaws" with a weak chain.

[6] Hadith: "Shall I not inform you about the people of Paradise? Every weak and oppressed person..." The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Harithah ibn Wahb.

[7] Hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Indeed, the people of Paradise are all dishevelled, dust-covered, in two worn-out garments, who are given no attention; those who, when they seek permission from the rulers, are not granted permission." The statement of Al-'Iraqi: "are not granted permission." The hadith is like this in the copies without a narrator. The commentator said: Al-'Iraqi left it blank, so let it be known.

[8] Hadith: "Indeed, among my community is he whom, if one of you were approached and asked for a dinar, he would not give it to him..." Reported by At-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" from the narration of Thawban with an authentic chain, excluding his statement: "And if he were to ask for the worldly life, he would not give it to him, and he would not withhold it from him except due to its insignificance to him."

[9] Hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal: "Indeed, a little ostentation is polytheism, and Allah loves the pious, the inconspicuous..." Reported by At-Tabarani and Al-Hakim, and the wording is his, and he said its chain is authentic. I say: Rather, it is weak. In it is 'Isa ibn 'Abdur-Rahman, who is Az-Zarqi, abandoned.

[10] Hadith of Abu Umamah: "Indeed, the most enviable of my allies to Me is a believer light in provision..." Reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah with two weak chains.

[11] Hadith: "Wealth and status cause hypocrisy to grow." This preceded at the beginning of this chapter, and I did not find it.

[12] Hadith: "Two hungry wolves sent among a flock of sheep..." This also preceded there.

[13] Hadith: "Indeed, the destruction of people is due to following desires and love of praise." I have not seen it with this wording. It preceded in the Book of Knowledge from the narration of Anas: "Three destructive things: obeyed greed, followed desire..." For Abu Mansur Ad-Daylami in "Musnad Al-Firdaws" from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain: "Love of praise from people blinds and deafens."

[14] Hadith: "Two insatiable ones never become full..." Reported by At-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain, and Al-Bazzar and At-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a lenient chain, and it preceded.

[15] Hadith: "He did not disclose the secret of the spirit." Reported by Al-Bukhari from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and it preceded.

[16] Hadith: "That a man praised another man well, so he said: 'If your companion were present, he would be pleased with what you said.' And he died upon that, he entered the Fire." I did not find any basis for it.

[17] Hadith: "Woe to you, you have broken his back!" He said it to the one praising, and it preceded.

[18] Hadith: "Indeed, do not praise, and when you see those who praise, throw dust in their faces." Preceded, excluding his statement "Indeed, do not praise."

[19] Hadith: "O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know." He said it when his people struck him. Reported by Al-Bayhaqi in "Dala'il An-Nubuwwah" and it preceded. The hadith in the Sahih is that he said it narrating from a prophet among the prophets when his people struck him.

[20] Hadith: "The essence of humility is that one dislikes to be mentioned for righteousness and piety." I did not find any basis for it.

[21] Hadith: "Woe to the fasting person, and woe to the praying person, and woe to the wearer of wool..." I did not find it like this. The author of "Al-Firdaws" mentioned from the narration of Anas: "Woe to him who wears wool, then his action contradicts his statement." He did not report it, and it is in his Musnad.

[22] Hadith concerning the revelation of His saying, the Exalted: "So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord..." regarding one who seeks the Hereafter with his acts of worship and deeds. Reported by Al-Hakim from the narration of Tawus: A man said: "I stand at the station seeking the Face of Allah, and I love that my station be seen." He did not respond to him until this verse was revealed. Like this in my copy of "Al-Mustadrak," and perhaps "Ibn 'Abbas" or "Abu Hurairah" dropped from it. For Al-Bazzar from the narration of Mu'adh with a weak chain: "Whoever fasts for ostentation has committed polytheism..." and in it is that he recited this verse.

[23] Hadith of Abu Hurairah concerning the three: the one killed in the way of Allah, the one who gives charity of his wealth, and the one who recites His Book, for indeed Allah, the Exalted, says to each of them: "You have lied." Reported by Muslim, and it will come in the Book of Sincerity.

[24] Hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever shows off, Allah will show him off, and whoever makes himself heard, Allah will make him heard." Agreed upon
