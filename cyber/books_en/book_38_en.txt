The Book of Vigilance and Self-Reckoning  
Being the Eighth Book of the Quarter of Deliverances from The Revival of the Religious Sciences  

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful  

Praise be to God, the One who sustains every soul by what it has earned, the Watchful over every limb by what it has committed, the Aware of the secrets of hearts when they whisper, the Reckoner over the thoughts of His servants when they stir, from Whose knowledge not an atom’s weight in the heavens or the earth escapes, whether it moves or is still, the Accountant for the speck and the husk, the little and the much of deeds, even if concealed, the Bestower of favor in accepting the obedience of His servants though it be small, the Magnanimous in pardoning their sins though they be many. He calls them to account only that every soul may know what it has brought forth, and reflect on what it has sent ahead and left behind, so that it may realize: were it not for its adherence to vigilance and self-reckoning in this world, it would be laid bare on the plain of Resurrection and perish. And after striving, self-reckoning, and vigilance, were it not for His grace in accepting its paltry offering, it would fail and be lost. So glory be to Him whose favor encompasses all servants, whose mercy envelops and embraces all creatures in this world and the next, and overwhelms them. By the breaths of His grace hearts expand to faith and are opened; by the blessing of His enabling, limbs are bound to acts of worship and disciplined; by the beauty of His guidance, the darkness of ignorance is lifted from hearts and dispelled; by His support and aid, the schemes of Satan are cut off and repelled; by the gentleness of His care, the scale of good deeds gains weight when it is heavy; and by His facilitation, what is made easy of obedience is eased. From Him alone come giving and recompense, distance and nearness, happiness and wretchedness. And blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, master of the prophets, and upon his family, masters of the purified, and upon his companions, leaders of the God-fearing.  

Now then, God Almighty has said: “We shall set up the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection, and no soul will be wronged in the least. Even if it be the weight of a mustard seed, We shall bring it forth. Sufficient are We as reckoners.” (Qur’an 21:47) And He said: “And the Record will be placed, and you will see the guilty fearful of what is in it. They will say, ‘Woe to us! What is this Record that leaves nothing small or great unaccounted?’ They will find all they did present before them, and your Lord wrongs no one.” (Qur’an 18:49) And He said: “On the Day when God will raise them all, He will inform them of what they did. God has kept account of it, while they have forgotten it. God is Witness over all things.” (Qur’an 58:6) And He said: “On that Day, people will come forward in separate groups to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.” (Qur’an 99:6–7) And He said: “Then every soul will be paid in full for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.” (Qur’an 2:281) And He said: “On the Day when every soul will find what good it has done brought forward, and what evil it has done—it will wish there were a great distance between it and that. God warns you of Himself.” (Qur’an 3:30) And He said: “And know that God knows what is in your souls, so be mindful of Him.” (Qur’an 2:235)  

Thus, the possessors of insight among the servants came to know that God Almighty lies in wait for them, that they will be scrutinized in the reckoning, and that they will be called to account for the atom’s weight of passing thoughts and glances. They realized that nothing will save them from these perils except adhering to self-reckoning, sincerity in vigilance, and holding the soul to account in every breath and movement, and reckoning with it over every passing thought and glance. For whoever holds himself to account before he is called to account will have his reckoning lightened on the Day of Resurrection, his answer ready when questioned, and his return and outcome good. But whoever does not hold himself to account will have lasting regrets, his standing in the plains of Resurrection prolonged, and his sins will lead him to disgrace and contempt.  

When this became clear to them, they knew that nothing would save them from it except obedience to God, and He commanded them to patience and steadfast vigilance, saying—mighty is His word: “O you who believe, be patient, persevere, stand firm, and be vigilant.” (Qur’an 3:200) So they made their souls vigilant first through mutual covenant, then through vigilance, then through self-reckoning, then through self-chastisement, then through striving, then through self-admonishment. Thus, in steadfast vigilance they had six stations, which must be explained, their reality and merit clarified, and the detailed actions within them expounded. The foundation of all this is self-reckoning, but every reckoning follows a covenant and vigilance, and is followed, in case of loss, by admonishment and chastisement. So let us mention the explanation of these stations—and with God lies success.  

The First Station of Steadfast Vigilance: The Mutual Covenant  

Know that what partners in trade seek when accounting is the soundness of profit. Just as a merchant enlists his partner, entrusting him with capital to trade, then holds him to account, so too the intellect is the merchant on the path to the Hereafter. Its demand and profit lie in purifying the soul, for in that is its success. God Almighty says: “He has succeeded who purifies it, and he has failed who corrupts it.” (Qur’an 91:9–10) Its success lies in righteous deeds, and the intellect enlists the soul in this trade by employing it and subjugating it in what purifies it, just as a merchant enlists his partner or servant who trades with his wealth.

Just as a partner may become a contentious adversary, vying for profit and thus requiring first to stipulate terms with him, second to monitor him, third to audit him, and fourth to punish or reproach him, so too does the intellect require first to stipulate terms with the soul. It must impose upon it duties, set conditions, guide it to the path of success, and firmly command it to walk those ways. Then it must not neglect to monitor it for a moment, for if it neglects it, it will see from it nothing but betrayal and the squandering of capital—like a treacherous slave when left unsupervised and alone with the wealth. After completion, one must then audit it and demand fulfillment of what was stipulated upon it. For this is a trade whose profit is the highest Paradise and attainment of the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary with the Prophets and the martyrs. Therefore, meticulous accounting in this matter with the soul is far more important than meticulous accounting for worldly profits, even though these are contemptible compared to the bliss of the Hereafter. Moreover, however they may be, their end is to perish and cease. There is no good in a good that does not last; rather, an evil that does not last is better than a good that does not last. For the evil that does not last, when it ceases, leaves lasting joy at its cessation, and the evil has ended. But the good that does not last leaves lasting regret at its cessation, and the good has ended. Thus it has been said: "The most intense grief for me is in a joy whose possessor is certain of its departure." Therefore, let every prudent person who believes in God and the Last Day seal his resolve not to neglect auditing his soul and constraining it in its movements, stillness, fleeting thoughts, and steps. For every breath of life is a precious gem, irreplaceable, with which can be purchased a treasure of treasures whose bliss is endless for all eternity. The wasting of these breaths, or diverting them to what brings ruin, is a tremendous, immense loss that no rational soul should permit. When the servant awakens and completes the obligatory dawn prayer, he should clear his heart for a moment to stipulate terms with his soul, just as a merchant, when delivering goods to a working partner, clears the meeting to stipulate terms with him. He should say to his soul: "I have no commodity except my lifetime. Whenever it perishes, the capital has perished, and despair over the trade and seeking profit sets in. This new day, God has granted me respite in it, postponed my term, and bestowed favor upon me. Had He taken me, I would wish to be returned to the world for a single day to perform righteous deeds therein. So consider that you have died and then been returned. Beware, beware of wasting this day, for every breath is a gem beyond value. Know, O soul, that the day and night are twenty-four hours. It has been reported in a tradition that for the servant, twenty-four treasuries are displayed each day and night, arranged in rows. One of them is opened for him, and he sees it filled with light from his good deeds performed in that hour. He attains from the joy, delight, and gladness at witnessing those lights—which are his means with the Almighty King—such that if distributed among the people of Hell, that joy would overwhelm them from feeling the pain of the Fire. Another treasury is opened for him, black and dark, from which its stench emanates and its darkness envelops him—that is the hour in which he disobeyed. He is struck with such terror and dread that if divided among the people of Paradise, it would spoil their bliss for them. Another treasury is opened for him, empty, containing nothing to please or grieve him—a tradition: 'For the servant, twenty-four treasuries are displayed each day and night, arranged in rows. One of them is opened for him, and he sees it filled with his good deeds.' The full tradition I did not find a source for—that is the hour in which he slept, or was heedless, or occupied with something of the permissible matters of the world. He grieves over its emptiness and is afflicted with the loss of that which befalls one capable of great profit and vast dominion if he neglects and is lax therein until it passes him by. Sufficient is that as regret and loss. Thus, the treasuries of his moments are presented to him throughout his life. So he says to his soul: 'Strive today to fill your treasury, and do not leave it empty of your treasures, which are the causes of your dominion. Do not incline to laziness, laxity, and rest, lest you miss from the highest ranks what others attain, and there remains with you a regret that never leaves you. Even if you enter Paradise, the pain of loss and its regret is unbearable, though it is less than the pain of the Fire.' Some have said: 'Suppose the wrongdoer is forgiven, has he not missed the reward of the doers of good?'—pointing to the loss and regret. And God Almighty said: 'On the Day He assembles you for the Day of Assembly, that is the Day of Mutual Loss.' This is his counsel to his soul regarding its times. Then let him renew for it counsel regarding its seven limbs: the eye, the ear, the tongue, the stomach, the private part, the hand, and the foot—and entrust them to it. For they are subjects serving his soul in this trade, and through them the works of this trade are completed. And indeed, Hell has seven gates; for each gate is an allotted portion. Those gates are designated only for those who disobey God.

He exhorts these limbs to guard them from their sins. As for the eye, he guards it from gazing upon the face of one who is not lawful for him, or at the private parts of a Muslim, or looking at a Muslim with contemptuous eyes—indeed, from every superfluous glance that can be dispensed with. For verily God, exalted is He, will question His servant about superfluous gazing just as He questions him about superfluous speech. Then, when he has turned it away from this, he does not content himself with that until he occupies it with that in which lies its commerce and profit—namely, that for which it was created: gazing upon the wonders of God’s creation with the eye of reflection, looking upon righteous deeds to emulate them, contemplating the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and perusing books of wisdom for admonition and benefit. Thus should the matter be detailed for it, limb by limb, especially the tongue and the stomach.

As for the tongue, it is naturally prone to movement, and there is no effort in its motion, yet its offenses are grave—through backbiting, lying, tale‑bearing, self‑praise, disparaging others, foul speech, cursing, invoking harm upon enemies, quarreling in speech, and other such matters we have mentioned in the Book of the Diseases of the Tongue. It is inclined to all of that, even though it was created for remembrance and reminding, for repeating knowledge and teaching, for guiding God’s servants to the path of God, for reconciling between people, and for all its other goodly functions. Therefore, let him impose upon himself that he will not move his tongue throughout the day except in remembrance; for the believer’s speech is remembrance, his gaze is a lesson, his silence is reflection, and “there is no word he utters but that there is with him a watcher, ready.”

As for the stomach, he obliges it to abandon greed, to reduce eating even of what is lawful, to avoid doubtful matters, and to restrain it from desires. He restricts himself to the measure of necessity and stipulates upon himself that if it contravenes any of that, he will punish it by withholding the stomach’s appetites, so that it loses more than it gained through its cravings. Thus he stipulates upon it in all the limbs—and to enumerate all of that would be lengthy, for the sins and acts of obedience of the limbs are not hidden. Then he renews his exhortation to it regarding the duties of worship that recur upon him day and night, then the supererogatory acts that he is capable of and can increase in, arranging their details, their manner, and how to prepare for them with their causes.

These are conditions needed every day. But if a person accustoms himself to stipulating these upon himself for some days and his soul complies in fulfilling all of them, he becomes free of the need for such stipulation. If it obeys in some but not all, the need remains to renew the stipulation for what remains. Yet no day passes without some new important matter and an occurring event that has a new ruling, and God has a right upon him therein. This increases for one who is occupied with any worldly affair—be it governance, trade, or teaching—for scarcely a day passes without a new event in which he must fulfill God’s right. So he must stipulate upon himself uprightness therein and submission to the truth in its course, and warn it of the consequence of negligence, admonishing it as a runaway, rebellious slave is admonished. For the soul is by nature rebellious against acts of obedience and resistant to servitude, but admonition and discipline affect it, and remembrance, for “the reminder benefits the believers.”

This, and what is similar to it, is the first station of keeping watch over the soul—namely, self‑reckoning before the act. Reckoning sometimes occurs after the act and sometimes before it, as a warning. God, exalted is He, said, “And know that God knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him”—this is for the future. And every examination of the quantity and measure [of deeds] to know increase or decrease is called reckoning. Thus, looking ahead at what lies before the servant during his day to know his increase or decrease is part of reckoning. God, exalted is He, said, “O you who believe, when you go forth in the way of God, make clear…” and He said, “O you who believe, if a wicked person comes to you with news, verify…” and He said, “We have created man and We know what his soul whispers to him”—mentioning that as a warning and an alert to guard against it in the future.

It is reported from ‘Ubādah ibn al‑Ṣāmit that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man who asked him for counsel and admonition, “When you intend a matter, consider its outcome; if it is right guidance, proceed, and if it is misguidance, desist.” The ḥadīth of ‘Ubādah ibn al‑Ṣāmit, “When you intend a matter, consider its outcome,” has preceded. And some of the wise said, “If you wish the intellect to prevail over desire, do not act upon the decree of appetite until you look to the consequence, for the abiding of regret in the heart lasts longer than the fleeting lightness of appetite.” And Luqmān said, “When the believer sees the outcome, he is safe from regret.” It is reported from Shaddād ibn Aws, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said, “The wise one is he who holds his soul to account and works for what is after death, and the fool is he who follows his soul its desires and indulges in wishful thinking about God.” The ḥadīth, “The wise one is he who holds his soul to account and works for what is after death,” has preceded. “Holds his soul to account” means he reckons with it, and “the Day of Reckoning” is the day of accounting. His saying, “Are we indeed to be reckoned with?” means “Are we to be called to account?” And ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said…

Hold yourselves to account before you are called to account, and weigh your deeds before they are weighed, and prepare for the Great Presentation. It was written to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: "Hold your soul to account in times of ease before the accounting in hardship." And it was said to Ka'b: "How do you find it in the Book of God?" He said: "Woe to the judges of the earth from the Judge of the heavens," whereupon he struck him with the whip and said, "Except for one who holds his own soul to account." Ka'b then said, "O Commander of the Faithful, it is near to it in the Torah; there is not a letter between them: 'Except for one who holds his own soul to account.'" All of this points to the accounting for the future, as it was said: "Whoever judges his soul works for what is after death." Its meaning is to weigh matters first, to assess them, to consider and deliberate upon them, then to proceed to them and undertake them.

The second station: Vigilance. When a person admonishes his soul and binds it to what we have mentioned, nothing remains but vigilance over it when plunging into actions and observing it with the watchful eye, for if left unattended, it becomes rebellious and corrupt. Let us mention the virtue of vigilance, then its degrees.

As for its virtue, Gabriel, peace be upon him, asked about spiritual excellence (Ihsan), and he said: "That you worship God as if you see Him," a hadith agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurairah, and Muslim narrated it from the narration of 'Umar, and it has preceded. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Worship God as if you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He surely sees you." The hadith "Worship God as if you see Him" has preceded. And God Almighty has said: "Is He who stands over every soul [to record] what it has earned...?" And He said: "Does he not know that God sees?" And God Almighty said: "Indeed, God is ever, over you, an Observer." And He said: "And those who are to their trusts and their promises attentive, and those who are to their testimonies upright." Ibn al-Mubarak said to a man, "Be vigilant of God Almighty," and he asked him about its interpretation. He said: "Be always as if you see God, Mighty and Majestic is He." And 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: "If my Master is vigilant over me, I care not for any other." And Abu 'Uthman al-Maghribi said: "The best thing a person can oblige his soul with in this path is self-accounting and vigilance, and governing his actions with knowledge." And Ibn 'Ata' said: "The best of acts of obedience is vigilance of the Truth throughout all times." And al-Jurayri said: "Our matter is built upon two foundations: that you oblige your soul with vigilance for God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and that knowledge stands manifest upon your outward state." And Abu 'Uthman said: "Abu Hafs said to me: 'When you sit with people, be a preacher to your own soul and heart, and let not their gathering around you deceive you, for they observe your outward, while God is vigilant over your inward.'"

It is related that one of the shaykhs of this group had a young disciple whom he honored and favored. Some of his companions said to him, "How do you honor this one when he is young and we are elders?" He called for several birds and gave each of them a bird and a knife, saying, "Let each of you slaughter his bird in a place where no one sees him," and he gave the young man the same, saying to him as he said to them. Each one returned with his bird slaughtered, but the young man returned with the bird alive in his hand. He said, "What is the matter with you? Why did you not slaughter as your companions slaughtered?" He said, "I did not find a place where no one would see me, for God is aware of me in every place." They admired this vigilance in him and said, "You deserve to be honored."

It is related that when Zulaykha desired Yusuf, peace be upon him, she rose and covered the face of an idol she had. Yusuf said, "What is the matter with you? Are you ashamed of the vigilance of an inanimate object, yet I am not ashamed of the vigilance of the All-Compelling Sovereign?"

It is related from a youth that he tried to seduce a slave-girl. She said to him, "Do you not feel shame?" He said, "From whom should I feel shame? Only the stars see us." She said, "Then where is their Creator?" A man said to al-Junayd, "With what shall I seek help in lowering my gaze?" He said, "With your knowledge that the gaze of the One looking at you is swifter than your gaze to that which you look upon." And al-Junayd said, "Only he who fears missing his portion from his Lord, Mighty and Majestic is He, truly realizes vigilance."

From Malik ibn Dinar, it is said: "The Gardens of Eden are from the Gardens of Paradise, and in them are houris created from the roses of Paradise." It was said to him, "And who dwells in them?" He said, "God Almighty says: 'And only those dwell in the Gardens of Eden who, when they intend to commit sins, remember My greatness and are vigilant of Me, and whose backs bend from fear of Me, and My might and majesty. Verily, I intend to punish the people of the earth, but when I look upon those who hunger and thirst from fear of Me, I divert the punishment from them.'"

Al-Muhasibi was asked about vigilance. He said: "Its beginning is the heart's knowledge of the nearness of God Almighty." And al-Murt'ish said: "Vigilance is the observance of the secret by heeding the Unseen with every moment and utterance." And it is related that God Almighty said to His angels: "You are entrusted with the outward, and I am the Observer of the inward." And Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-Tirmidhi said: "Make your vigilance for the One from whose sight you are not hidden, and make your gratitude for the One whose blessings over you do not cease, and make your obedience for the One without whom you cannot do, and make your humility for the One from whose dominion and authority you cannot escape." And Sahl said: "The heart is not adorned by anything better or more noble than the servant's knowledge that God is witnessing him wherever he may be." And one of them was asked about His saying, Almighty: "God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is for..."

He who fears his Lord—meaning this applies to one who watches over his Lord, the Almighty, holds himself to account, and provisions for his Hereafter. Dhū al-Nūn was asked, “By what does a servant attain Paradise?” He replied, “By five things: steadfastness without deviation, diligence without heedlessness, vigilance toward God—exalted is He—in secret and in public, awaiting death by preparing for it, and holding yourself to account before you are held to account.” It has been said: “If you are alone for a day in time, do not say, ‘I am alone,’ but say, ‘I have a Watcher,’ and never think that God is heedless for an instant, nor that what you conceal from Him is hidden. Do you not see that today is swiftly departing, and that tomorrow is near for those who look?” And Ḥumayd al-Ṭawīl said to Sulaymān ibn ʿAlī, “Admonish me.” He replied, “If, when you disobey God in private, you think He sees you, then you have dared against something tremendous; and if you think He does not see you, then you have disbelieved.” Sufyān al-Thawrī said, “Be vigilant before One from whom no secret is hidden, place your hope in One who possesses the power to fulfill, and be wary of One who holds punishment.” Farqad al-Sinjī said, “The hypocrite looks around, and if he sees no one, he enters into wrongdoing; he only watches people, not God—exalted is He.” ʿAbd Allāh ibn Dīnār said, “I journeyed with ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb—may God be pleased with him—to Mecca, and we halted one night along the way. A shepherd descended from the mountain toward him, and ʿUmar said, ‘O shepherd, sell me a sheep from this flock.’ He replied, ‘I am a slave.’ ʿUmar said, ‘Tell your master a wolf ate it.’ The shepherd said, ‘Then where is God?’ ʿUmar wept—may God be pleased with him—then went at dawn to the slave, purchased him from his master, and freed him, saying, ‘I have freed you in this world on account of this statement, and I hope it will free you in the Hereafter.’”

**Explanation of the Reality of Vigilance and Its Degrees**

Know that the reality of vigilance is the awareness of the Watcher and the turning of one’s concern toward Him. Whoever guards against something because of another is said to be vigilant of that person, mindful of their side. This vigilance refers to a state of the heart produced by a kind of knowledge, and that state yields actions in the limbs and in the heart. As for the state, it is the heart’s attentiveness to the Watcher, its preoccupation with Him, its turning toward Him, its awareness of Him, and its devotion to Him. As for the knowledge that produces this state, it is the certainty that God is aware of innermost thoughts, knows secrets, watches over the deeds of servants, and oversees every soul for what it has earned—that the secret of the heart is laid bare to Him just as the outward appearance is exposed to creation, nay, even more so. When this knowledge becomes certainty—meaning free from doubt—and then dominates the heart, overpowering it (for there is knowledge without doubt that does not overpower the heart, like the knowledge of death), it draws the heart to mindfulness of the Watcher and directs its concern to Him. Those firmly convinced of this knowledge are the ones brought near, and they are divided into the truthful and the companions of the right hand. Their vigilance is of two degrees.

The first degree is the vigilance of those brought near among the truthful—the vigilance of reverence and majesty. It is when the heart becomes absorbed in observing that Majesty and humbled under awe, leaving no room to turn to anything else at all. This vigilance does not require lengthy examination of its detailed actions, for it is confined to the heart. As for the limbs, they become restrained from turning toward permissible matters, let alone forbidden ones, and if they move in obedience, they do so as if used by it, needing no management or effort to keep them on the path of correctness. Rather, the subjects are guided by the mastery of the shepherd, and the heart is the shepherd. When it becomes absorbed in the Worshipped, the limbs are used, proceeding with correctness and uprightness without strain. This is the one whose concern becomes a single concern, so God suffices him for all other concerns. Whoever attains this degree may become heedless of creation to the extent that he does not see those present before him even with open eyes, nor hear what is said to him, though he is not deaf. He may pass by his son, for example, without speaking to him. Indeed, this happened to some of them, and when reproached, he said to the one who admonished him, “If you pass by me, shake me.” Do not find this strange, for you see its like in hearts that revere earthly kings—so much so that the servants of a king may not notice what befalls them in the king’s presence due to their intense absorption in him. Indeed, the heart may be preoccupied with some trivial worldly matter, and a man may plunge into thought about it while walking, so that he passes the place he intended or forgets the task he set out to do. It was said to ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Zayd, “Do you know in your time a man so absorbed in his state that he is oblivious to creation?” He replied, “I know none except a man who will enter upon you now.” It was not long before ʿUtbah the youth entered. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Zayd said to him, “Where have you come from, O ʿUtbah?” He said, “From such-and-such place,” though his path passed through the market. He asked, “Whom did you meet on the way?” He replied, “I saw no one.” And it is related from Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyā—peace be upon them both.

He passed by a woman and pushed her, causing her to fall on her face. When asked why he did this, he replied, "I thought she was nothing but a wall." It is narrated from one of them that he said: "I passed by a group who were throwing stones, with one man sitting apart from them. I approached him intending to speak, but he said, 'The remembrance of God Almighty is more desirable.' I said, 'Are you alone?' He replied, 'My Lord and my angels are with me.' I asked, 'Who among these has preceded?' He answered, 'The one whom God has forgiven.' I inquired, 'Where is the path?' He gestured toward the sky, then stood and walked away, saying, 'Most of Your creation distracts from You.' This is the speech of one utterly absorbed in witnessing God Almighty—he speaks only from Him and hears only in Him. Such a person has no need to monitor his tongue or limbs, for they move only according to his state."

Al-Shibli visited Abu al-Husayn al-Nawawi while he was in retreat and found him still, composed in gathering, not moving outwardly at all. He asked him, "From where did you acquire this vigilance and stillness?" He replied, "From a cat we had. When it intended to hunt, it would fix its head on the stone without a hair moving." Abu 'Abdullah ibn Khafif said: "I left Egypt heading to Ramla to meet Abu 'Ali al-Rudhbari. 'Isa ibn Yunus al-Masri, known as the ascetic, told me, 'In Tyre there is a youth and an elder who have united in the state of vigilance. Perhaps if you look upon them, you may benefit.' I entered Tyre hungry, thirsty, with a rag around my waist and nothing on my shoulders. I entered the mosque and saw two persons sitting facing the qibla. I greeted them, but they did not respond. I greeted a second and third time, but heard no reply. I said, 'I adjure you by God to return the greeting.' The youth raised his head from his patched garment, looked at me, and said, 'O Ibn Khafif, the world is little, and what remains of the little is but little. Take from the little much. O Ibn Khafif, how little occupies you that you free yourself to meet us?' Then he took hold of my collar, bowed his head, and I remained with them until we prayed Zuhr and 'Asr. My hunger, thirst, and weariness vanished. At the time of 'Asr, I said, 'Advise me.' He raised his head to me and said, 'O Ibn Khafif, we are companions of afflictions; we have no tongue for admonition.' I stayed with them three days without eating, drinking, or sleeping, nor did I see them eat or drink anything. On the third day, I said to myself, 'I will make them swear to advise me, hoping to benefit.' The youth raised his head and said to me, 'O Ibn Khafif, keep company with one whose sight reminds you of God and whose awe falls upon your heart—who admonishes you with the tongue of his action, not with the tongue of his speech. And peace—rise from us.'"

This is the rank of the vigilant ones whose hearts are overwhelmed with reverence and veneration, leaving no room for anything else. The second degree is the vigilance of the pious among the companions of the right hand. They are a people certain of God's awareness of their outward and inward states and their hearts, yet the observation of Majesty does not stupefy them. Rather, their hearts remain balanced, with room to attend to states and deeds. Even while engaged in works, they are not devoid of vigilance. Indeed, shame before God overcomes them, so they neither advance nor hold back except after careful consideration, and they refrain from all that would disgrace them on the Day of Resurrection. For they see God in this world as aware of them, needing not await the Resurrection. The difference between the two degrees is known through experiences: in your solitude, you may engage in acts, then a child or woman appears, and you know they observe you, so you feel shame before them and improve your sitting and guard your state—not from reverence and veneration, but from shame. For though witnessing them may not stupefy or absorb you, it stirs shame within you. Or a king or great person may enter upon you, and veneration so absorbs you that you abandon all you were doing, occupied with him—not out of shame from him. Thus differ the ranks of worshippers in vigilance toward God Almighty.

Whoever is in this degree needs to monitor all his movements, stillness, thoughts, glances—in short, all his choices. He has two considerations regarding them: one before the act and one during the act. Before the act, he should consider whether what has appeared to him and what his impulse moves him to do is purely for God or is in the whim of the soul and following Satan. He should pause and verify until it becomes clear to him through the light of truth. If it is for God Almighty, he proceeds; if for other than God, he feels shame before God and refrains, then reproaches his soul for its desire, concern, and inclination toward it, making it aware of its evil action and its striving toward its own disgrace—that it is an enemy to itself unless God protects it with His preservation. This pause at the beginning of matters, to the point of clarity, is an obligatory duty from which none can escape. For in the report, it is said that for every movement of a servant, however small, three registers are opened: the first register is 'why?', the second 'how?', and the third 'for whom?'

For every movement a servant makes, even if small, three registers are opened. The first: "Why?" The second: "How?" The third: "For whom?"

If he is safe from the first—meaning he did not act without a reason, but rather because it was an obligation upon him for his Master or he turned to it with his desire and inclination—then he is questioned about the second register. It is said to him: "How did you do this?" For in every act, God has a condition and a ruling whose measure, timing, and manner are only grasped through knowledge. So it is said to him: "How did you do it? With verified knowledge or with ignorance and conjecture?" If he is safe from this, the third register is opened, which is the demand for sincerity. It is said to him: "For whom did you act? For the Face of God purely, in fulfillment of your saying 'There is no god but God,' so your reward is with God? Or for the show of creatures like you, so take your reward from them? Or did you act it to attain your immediate worldly portion? Then We have given you your share of the world. Or did you act it in heedlessness and negligence? Then your reward has fallen, your deed is invalidated, and your effort is wasted. And if you acted for other than Me, you have deserved My wrath and punishment, for you are a servant of Mine, you eat My provision and enjoy My blessings, then you work for other than Me. Have you not heard Me say: 'Those whom you invoke besides God are servants like yourselves'? 'Those whom you worship besides God possess no provision for you. So seek provision from God and worship Him.' Woe to you! Have you not heard Me say: 'Indeed, sincere religion is for God'?"

When the servant knows he is facing these demands and rebukes, he should question himself before being questioned, and prepare an answer for the questioning. Let the answer be correct, so he does not begin nor repeat except after verification, and does not move an eyelid or a fingertip except after contemplation. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Mu'adh: "Indeed, a man will be questioned about the kohl of his eyes, about the mud he presses with his fingers, and about touching his brother's garment." Al-Hasan said: "When one of them intended to give charity, he would look and verify; if it was for God, he proceeded." Al-Hasan—may God have mercy on him—said: "May God have mercy on a servant who pauses at his intention; if it is for God, he proceeds; if it is for other than Him, he holds back." And in the hadith of Sa'd when Salman advised him: "Fear God at your intention when you intend." This was reported by Ahmad and Al-Hakim who graded it sound, and this portion of it is *mawquf* (attributed to a companion) and its beginning is *marfu'* (attributed to the Prophet), as previously mentioned. Muhammad ibn 'Ali said: "The believer is one who pauses, deliberate; he pauses at his intention, not like a wood-gatherer in the night." This is the first consideration in this self-inspection (*muraqabah*), and one is only saved from it by firm knowledge and true recognition of the secrets of deeds, the depths of the soul, and the snares of Satan. For if he does not know himself, his Lord, and his enemy Iblis, and does not know what agrees with his inclination and cannot distinguish between it and what God loves and is pleased with in his intention, resolve, thought, stillness, and movement, then he will not be safe in this self-inspection. Rather, most people commit ignorance in what God dislikes while they think they are doing good. Do not think that the one who is ignorant of what he is capable of learning is excused. Far from it! Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim. For this reason, two units of prayer by a scholar are better than a thousand units by a non-scholar, because he knows the defects of the souls, the snares of Satan, and the places of delusion, so he avoids them, while the ignorant does not know them, so how can he beware? Thus, the ignorant remains in toil, and Satan is in joy and gloating over him. So we seek refuge in God from ignorance and negligence, for it is the head of every misery and the foundation of every loss.

God has decreed for every servant that he must inspect himself at his intention for action and his striving with his limbs, so he refrains from the intention and from the striving until it becomes clear to him by the light of knowledge that it is for God, so he proceeds, or that it is for the soul's desire, so he avoids it and restrains the heart from thinking about it and intending it. For the first step towards falsehood, if not repelled, begets longing; longing begets intention; intention begets firm resolve; resolve begets action; and action begets ruin and wrath. Therefore, the source of evil should be cut off from its first spring, which is the passing thought, for all that follows it follows it. Whenever this is ambiguous for the servant and the matter becomes dark for him and is not clarified, he should reflect upon it by the light of knowledge and seek refuge in God from the guile of Satan through the medium of desire. If he is incapable of striving and reflection by himself, he should seek illumination by the light of the scholars of religion, and let him flee from the misleading scholars who are devoted to the world as he flees from Satan—indeed, more severely. For God revealed to David, peace be upon him: "Do not ask about Me from a scholar whom love of the world has intoxicated, for he will cut you off from My love. Those are the highway robbers upon My servants." Hearts darkened by love of the world, intense greed, and scrambling for it are veiled from the light of God. For if the lights of hearts are illuminated by the presence of Lordship, how can one seek illumination from one who has turned his back on it, turned to its enemy, and fallen in love with its hated and detested things—which are the desires of the world? So let it be...

The primary concern of the seeker is firstly in the rulings of knowledge or in seeking a scholar who is detached from the world or has weak desire for it, if he cannot find one who is entirely devoid of desire for it. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Verily, God loves perceptive insight when doubts arise, and a sound intellect when passions assail." Abu Nu'aym narrated it in *al-Hilyah* from the hadith of 'Imran ibn Husayn, and in its chain is Hafs ibn 'Umar al-'Adani, whom the majority considered weak. The two matters are combined, and they are indeed inseparable. For whoever lacks an intellect that restrains from passions has no perceptive insight regarding doubts. Therefore, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever commits a sin, intellect departs from him, never to return." The hadith "Whoever commits a sin..." preceded, and I did not find it. So, what value has the weak intellect with which man was blessed, that he then proceeds to efface and destroy it by committing sins? And the knowledge of the defects of actions has become effaced in these times, for people have all abandoned these sciences and busied themselves with mediating between people in the raging disputes arising from following passions. They said, "This is jurisprudence," and they excluded this knowledge, which is the jurisprudence of religion, from the totality of the sciences, and devoted themselves solely to the jurisprudence of the world, which is only intended to remove distractions from the hearts so one may devote oneself to the jurisprudence of religion. Thus, the jurisprudence of the world became part of religion by means of this jurisprudence. In the report: "You are today in a time where the best of you is the swift one, and there will come upon you a time where the best of you is the cautious one." The hadith "You are today in a time..." preceded, and I did not find it. For this reason, a group of the Companions refrained from fighting with the people of Iraq and the people of Syria when the matter became ambiguous to them, such as Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, Usamah, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, and others. Whoever does not hesitate when in doubt is following his own desire, enamored with his opinion, and is among those whom the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, described when he said: "When you see miserliness obeyed, desire followed, and every person of opinion admiring his own view, then take care of your own soul." And everyone who delves into ambiguity without verification has opposed His saying, the Exalted: "And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge." The hadith "When you see miserliness obeyed..." preceded. And his saying, peace be upon him: "Beware of conjecture, for conjecture is the falsest of speech." The hadith "Beware of conjecture..." preceded. He meant by it conjecture without evidence, as some common folk consult their hearts regarding what is ambiguous to them and follow their conjecture. Due to the difficulty and gravity of this matter, the supplication of al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, was: "O God, show me truth as truth and grant me adherence to it, and show me falsehood as falsehood and grant me avoidance of it, and do not make it ambiguous to me so that I follow desire." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Matters are three: a matter whose right guidance is clear, so follow it; a matter whose misguidance is clear, so avoid it; and a matter that is ambiguous to you, so refer it to its knower." The hadith "Jesus said: Matters are three..." al-Tabarani narrated from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain. And among the supplications of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was: "O God, I seek refuge in You from speaking about religion without knowledge." The hadith "O God, I seek refuge in You..." I did not find. So the greatest blessing of God upon His servants is knowledge and the unveiling of truth. Faith is an expression of a kind of unveiling and knowledge. Therefore, God the Exalted said, as a favor to His servant: "And great is the grace of God upon you." He meant by it knowledge. And He said: "So ask the people of the reminder if you do not know." And He said: "Indeed, upon Us is guidance." And He said: "Then indeed, upon Us is its explanation." And He said: "And upon God is the direction of the path." And it is said, on the honor of God's countenance: "Desire is a partner to blindness." And among divine facilitation is hesitation at perplexity. How excellent a dispeller of anxiety is certainty! The consequence of falsehood is regret, and in truthfulness is safety. A distant Lord is closer than a near one, and a stranger is he who has no beloved. A true friend is one whose absence proves his sincerity. Let not a beloved cause you to lack through ill suspicion. How excellent a character is generosity! Modesty is a means to every good. The firmest bond is piety, and the surest means you take is a means between you and God, the Exalted. You have from your world only that by which you repair your abode. Provision is of two kinds: provision you seek, and provision that seeks you. If you do not go to it, it will come to you. If you are distressed over what you have lost of what is in your hands, then do not be distressed over what has not reached you. Infer what has not been from what has been, for matters are but alike. A man is pleased to attain what he would not have missed, and is displeased to miss what he would not have attained. Therefore, what reaches you from your world, do not rejoice in it excessively, and what eludes you from it, do not let your soul pursue it with regret. Let your joy be in what you have sent forth, and your regret be for what you have left behind. Let your occupation be with your Hereafter, and your concern be for what is after death. Our purpose in transmitting these words is his saying: "And among divine facilitation is hesitation at perplexity." Therefore, the initial consideration for the observer is his consideration of the concern and the movement: is it for God or for desire? And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said...

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There are three traits; whoever possesses them has perfected his faith: he who does not fear, for the sake of Allah, the blame of any blamer; he who does not perform any act for show; and when presented with two matters, one pertaining to this world and the other to the Hereafter, he prefers the Hereafter over this world." The hadith, "There are three traits; whoever possesses them has perfected his faith..." was narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from Abu Hurayrah, and it has been mentioned previously.

What is most often revealed to him in his actions is that they are permissible, but he does not concern himself with them and abandons them due to the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "Part of a person's good Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him." The hadith, "Part of a person's good Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him," has been mentioned previously.

The second aspect of vigilance (*muraqabah*) is at the commencement of an action. This is by examining the manner of the action so that the right of Allah therein is fulfilled, perfecting the intention for its completion, perfecting its form, and undertaking it in the most complete manner possible. This accompanies him in all his states, for he is never, in all his states, devoid of movement or stillness. If he observes vigilance of Allah, the Exalted, in all of that, he is able to worship Allah, the Exalted, therein through intention, good action, and observance of proper conduct (*adab*). For example, if he is sitting, he should sit facing the direction of prayer (*qiblah*), due to the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "The best of sittings is that which faces the *qiblah*." The hadith, "The best of sittings is that which faces the *qiblah*," was narrated by al-Hakim from Ibn 'Abbas, and it has been mentioned previously. He should not sit cross-legged, for one does not sit thus in the presence of kings, and the King of kings is watching over him. Ibrahim ibn Adham, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "I once sat cross-legged and I heard a caller say, 'Is this how you sit in the presence of kings?' I never sat cross-legged after that." If he sleeps, he sleeps on his right side, facing the *qiblah*, along with all the other etiquettes we have mentioned in their proper place. All of this falls within vigilance.

Indeed, even if he is relieving himself, his observance of its etiquettes is a fulfillment of vigilance. Therefore, the servant is never except in one of three states: in obedience, in sin, or in a permissible matter. His vigilance in obedience is through sincerity, perfection, observance of proper conduct, and guarding it from defects. If he is in sin, his vigilance is through repentance, regret, desisting, feeling shame, and occupying himself with reflection. If he is in a permissible matter, his vigilance is first by observing proper conduct, then by witnessing the Bestower within the blessing and by being grateful for it. The servant, in the totality of his states, is not free from a trial which he must bear with patience, nor from a blessing for which he must give thanks. All of this is part of vigilance.

Indeed, the servant in every state is inextricably linked to an obligation from Allah, the Exalted, incumbent upon him: either an action he is obliged to perform, a prohibition he is obliged to abandon, a recommended act he is encouraged to hasten towards for the forgiveness of Allah, the Exalted, and to race with it ahead of Allah's servants, or a permissible act in which lies the well-being of his body and heart and which is an aid for him in his obedience. For each of these there are limits that must be observed through constant vigilance. "And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself." Therefore, the servant should examine himself at all times within these three categories. If he is free from obligatory duties and capable of virtuous deeds, he should seek the best of actions to occupy himself with, for whoever misses an increase in profit while capable of attaining it is at a loss. Profits are attained through the merits of virtues. Thus does the servant take from his worldly life for his Hereafter, as Allah, the Exalted, said: "And do not forget your share of the world."

All of this is only possible through the patience of a single hour. For the hours are three: an hour that has passed, over which the servant has no toil however it passed, in hardship or ease; a future hour that has not yet come, which the servant does not know if he will live to see, nor does he know what Allah will decree therein; and a present hour in which he should strive against his soul and observe vigilance of his Lord. If the second hour does not come to him, he will not grieve over the loss of this hour. If the second hour does come to him, he fulfills his duty within it as he fulfilled it in the first. He should not extend his hope for fifty years, making his resolve for vigilance therein long, but rather he should be a child of his moment, as if he were in his final breaths—for perhaps they are his final breaths and he does not know. If it is possible that they are his final breaths, then he should be in a state such that he would not dislike death overtaking him in that condition.

All his states should be confined to what Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, reported from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "The believer is not a wayfarer except for three things: provision for the final journey, mending his livelihood, or a pleasure in nothing unlawful." The hadith of Abu Dharr, "The believer is not a wayfarer except for three: provision for the final journey..." was narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who authenticated it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said that it is in the scrolls of Moses, and it has been mentioned previously. Also narrated from him in its meaning is that the wise person should have four hours: an hour in which he confides in his Lord, an hour in which he holds himself to account, an hour in which he reflects upon the creation of Allah...

Exalted is He, and there is an hour in which conversation turns to food and drink. It behooves the wise person to have three hours: an hour in which he communes with his Lord—this is the remainder of the narration of Abu Dharr mentioned previously, for in this hour lies assistance for him in the remaining hours. Then, these hours in which his limbs are occupied with food and drink should not be devoid of the best of deeds, which are remembrance and reflection. For the food he consumes, for example, contains wonders such that if he were to reflect upon it and become aware of them, that would be better than many deeds of the limbs. People concerning this are of several categories: a category who look upon it with the eye of insight and contemplation, pondering the wonders of its creation, how the sustenance of animals is tied to it, how God has ordained its means, created the appetites that prompt toward it, and created the instruments subservient to that appetite within it—as we have detailed some of this in the Book of Gratitude. This is the station of those of understanding. A category look upon it with the eye of disdain and aversion, observing the aspect of necessity in it, wishing they could be independent of it, yet they see themselves compelled therein, subjugated to its appetites. This is the station of the ascetics. A group see in the creation the Creator, and they ascend from it to the attributes of the Maker, so witnessing that becomes a cause for doors of reflection to open upon them because of it. This is the highest of stations and is among the stations of the knowers and the signs of the lovers, for when the lover sees the handiwork of his Beloved, His writing and composition, he forgets the handiwork and his heart becomes occupied with the Maker. Everything in which the servant is engaged is the creation of God, Exalted is He, so there is for him in looking from it to the Maker a vast expanse, if the doors of the dominion are opened to him—and that is exceedingly precious. A fourth category look upon it with the eye of desire and greed, regretting what they have missed of it and rejoicing in what is present to them from its whole, and they blame from it what does not agree with their inclination, finding fault and blaming its maker, blaming the cooking and the cook, not knowing that the agent of the cooking and the cook, and of his capability and knowledge, is God, Exalted is He, and that whoever blames something of God’s creation without permission has indeed blamed God. For that reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Do not curse time, for God is time.” This narration, “Do not curse time, for God is time,” was reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. This is the second vigilance: constant and continuous watchfulness over deeds. Elaborating on this would be lengthy, and in what we have mentioned is an indication of the methodology for one who has firmly grasped the principles. The third vigilance is holding the soul to account after the deed. Let us mention the virtue of self-accounting, then its reality. As for the virtue, God, Exalted is He, has said, “O you who believe, fear God and let every soul look to what it has sent forth for tomorrow.” This is an allusion to self-accounting for what has passed of deeds. For that reason, ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, “Hold yourselves to account before you are held to account, and weigh yourselves before you are weighed.” In a report, a man came to him, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, “O Messenger of God, advise me.” He said, “Are you asking for advice?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “When you intend a matter, consider its outcome; if it is right, proceed, and if it is corrupt, desist.” And in a report, “It behooves the wise person to have four hours: an hour in which he holds himself to account.” And He, Exalted is He, said, “And turn to God all together, O believers, that you may succeed.” Repentance is looking at the action after finishing it with regret over it. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Indeed, I seek forgiveness from God and repent to Him one hundred times a day.” This narration, “Indeed, I seek forgiveness from God and repent to Him one hundred times a day,” has preceded more than once. And He, Exalted is He, said, “Indeed, those who fear God, when an impulse from Satan touches them, they remember and at once they have insight.” And from ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, that he would strike his feet with a whip when night fell and say to himself, “What have you done today?” And from Maymun ibn Mihran, he said, “The servant is not among the God-fearing until he holds himself to account more strictly than he accounts for his partner, and partners hold each other to account after the work.” And it is reported from ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, that Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said to her at the time of death, “No one among the people is more beloved to me than ‘Umar.” Then he said to her, “What did I say?” So she repeated to him what he said. He said, “No one is dearer to me than ‘Umar.” See how he reflected after finishing the statement, reconsidered it, and replaced it with another word. And the narration of Abu Talhah when the bird distracted him in his prayer, so he reflected on that and made his garden a charity for God, Exalted is He, out of regret and hope for compensation for what he missed—the narration of Abu Talhah: when the bird distracted him from his prayer, so he made his garden a charity, has preceded more than once. And in the narration of Ibn Salam, he carried a bundle of firewood, and it was said to him, “O Abu Yusuf, there were among your sons and servants those who could spare you this.” He said, “I wanted to test myself, whether it would object.” And al-Hasan said, “The believer is a custodian over his soul, holding it to account for God. And the accounting will be light only for a people...”

Hold yourselves accountable in this world, for the reckoning on the Day of Resurrection will only be severe for a people who took this matter without self-accounting. Then he explained accountability, saying: "The believer is suddenly struck by something that pleases him, and he says: 'By God, you do please me, and you are from my needs, but how far! A barrier is placed between me and you.' This is accounting before the action." Then he said: "And something escapes from him, so he returns to himself and says: 'What did you intend by this? By God, I will not excuse this. By God, I will never return to this, if God wills.'" And Anas ibn Malik said: "I heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, one day when he went out and I went out with him until he entered an orchard. I heard him say—with a wall between me and him while he was in the orchard—'Umar ibn al-Khattab, Commander of the Believers! Well done, well done! By God, you will either fear God or He will punish you.'" And al-Hasan said regarding His saying, exalted is He: "And I swear by the self-reproaching soul" (75:2): "The believer is not met except that he reproaches himself: 'What did you intend by your words? What did you intend by your eating? What did you intend by your drinking?' While the wicked person proceeds forward, not reproaching himself." And Malik ibn Dinar, may God have mercy on him, said: "May God have mercy on a servant who said to his soul: 'Are you not the companion of such-and-such? Are you not the companion of such-and-such?' Then he censured it, then bridled it, then bound it to the Book of God, so it became a leader for him." And this is from reproaching the soul, as will come in its place. And Maymun ibn Mihran said: "The pious one is more severe in accounting his soul than a treacherous ruler or a stingy partner." And Ibrahim al-Taymi said: "I pictured my soul in Paradise, eating from its fruits, drinking from its rivers, and embracing its maidens. Then I pictured my soul in the Fire, eating from its Zaqqum, drinking from its pus, and grappling with its chains and shackles. So I said to my soul: 'O soul, what do you desire?' It said: 'I desire to be returned to the world so I may work righteousness.' I said: 'You are in wishful thinking, so act!'" And Malik ibn Dinar said: "I heard al-Hajjaj delivering a sermon, and he was saying: 'May God have mercy on a man who holds his soul to account before the accounting passes to another. May God have mercy on a man who takes the reins of his action and looks at what he intends by it. May God have mercy on a man who looks into his measure. May God have mercy on a man who looks into his scale.' And he kept saying until he made me weep." And a companion of al-Ahnaf ibn Qays narrated: "I used to accompany him, and most of his prayer at night was supplication. He would come to the lamp and place his finger in it until he felt the fire, then say to his soul: 'O Hanif, what compelled you to do what you did on such-and-such day? What compelled you to do what you did on such-and-such day?'"

**Explanation of the Reality of Accountability After Action**

Know that the servant, just as he has a time at the beginning of the day in which he makes a covenant with his soul by way of enjoining the truth, should also have an hour at the end of the day in which he demands from the soul and holds it accountable for all its movements and stillness, just as the merchants of the world do with their partners at the end of every year, month, or day, out of their greed for the world and fear of missing from it what, if they missed it, would have been better for them to miss. And if that is their state with what, if they attained it, would only remain for a few days, then how can the intelligent person not hold his soul accountable for what pertains to the peril of everlasting misery and happiness? This negligence is only from heedlessness, abandonment, and lack of success—we seek refuge in God from that. And the meaning of accountability with a partner is to look into the capital, the profit, and the loss, so that increase and decrease become clear to him. If there is existing surplus, he collects it and is grateful; if there is loss, he demands its guarantee from him and obliges him to recover it in the future. Likewise, the capital of the servant in his religion is the obligatory duties, his profit is the supererogatory acts and virtues, and his loss is the sins. The season of this trade is the entirety of the day, and his dealing is with his soul that commands to evil. So he holds it accountable for the obligatory duties first. If he performed them properly, he thanks God for it and encourages it to do the like. If he missed them entirely, he demands their making up. If he performed them deficiently, he obliges it to compensate with supererogatory acts. And if he committed a sin, he busies himself with punishing it, chastising it, and reproaching it, so that he may exact from it what recovers what was neglected, just as the merchant does with his partner. And just as he scrutinizes the worldly account for the smallest grain and carat, preserving the avenues of increase and decrease so he is not cheated in any of it, then he should beware of being cheated by his soul and its deceit, for it is deceptive, deluding, and cunning. So let him first demand from it a correct answer for all that it spoke throughout his day, and let him undertake for his soul from the accounting what others will undertake for him on the plain of Resurrection. And likewise for his sight, indeed for his thoughts and reflections, his standing and sitting, his eating and drinking, and his sleep—even for his silence: why did he remain silent? And for his stillness: why did he remain still? So when he knows the totality of what is obligatory upon the soul and the extent of what he performed of the obligation becomes verified to him, then that extent is accounted for him, and the remainder upon his soul becomes apparent to him. So let him affirm it upon it and write it on the scroll of his heart, as is written.

The remaining debt upon one's soul lies heavy on the heart and is recorded in the scroll of his account. The soul is a creditor from whom debts can be collected. Some debts are settled through fines and compensation, some by restitution of the very thing taken, and some through punishment inflicted upon it for its transgressions. Yet, none of this is possible until after the account is settled and the remaining rightful due upon him is distinguished. Once that is attained, one then busies himself with demanding and collecting what is due.

Thereafter, one must hold his soul to account for the entirety of his life, day by day and hour by hour, concerning all his outward and inward faculties. As was narrated concerning Tawbah ibn al-Sammah, who was in al-Raqqah and was an accountant of his own soul: he reckoned for a day, and he was sixty years old. So he counted its days, and they were twenty-one thousand and five hundred days. He cried out, saying, "Woe to me! I shall meet the Angel with twenty-one thousand sins? How, when in every single day there are ten thousand sins?" Then he fell down unconscious, and he was dead. And they heard a voice saying, "O, what a leap to the Highest Paradise!"

Thus should one hold his soul to account for every breath and for every disobedience of the heart and limbs in every hour. If a servant were to cast a stone for every sin into his house, his house would be filled in a short period close to his lifetime. But he is negligent in keeping track of sins, while the two recording angels preserve that for him; God has enumerated it, but they have forgotten it.

The fourth station is in punishing the soul for its shortcomings. Whenever one holds his soul to account and it is not free from committing a sin or neglecting a duty owed to God Almighty, he must not ignore it. For if he ignores it, committing sins becomes easy for him, his soul becomes accustomed to them, and weaning himself from them becomes difficult, and that would be a cause of its destruction. Rather, he must punish it. If he eats a morsel of dubious food out of his soul's desire, he should punish his stomach with hunger. If he looks at something not unlawful, he should punish his eye by preventing it from looking. Likewise, he punishes every part of his body by preventing it from its desires. This was the practice of the travelers on the path of the Hereafter.

It is narrated from Mansur ibn Ibrahim that a man among the worshippers spoke to a woman, and he did not cease until he placed his hand on her thigh. Then he regretted it and placed his hand on the fire until it was scorched. And it is narrated that there was among the Children of Israel a man who worshipped in a hermitage, and he remained thus for a long time. One day he looked out and saw a woman, and he was infatuated with her and intended to approach her. He put out his leg to descend to her, but God overtook him with His prior grace. He said, "What is this that I intend to do?" His soul returned to him, and God Almighty protected him. He regretted it, and when he wanted to return his leg to the hermitage, he said, "Far be it, far be it! A leg that went out intending to disobey God returns to my hermitage? By God, that shall never be!" So he left it hanging in the hermitage, exposed to the rains, winds, snow, and sun, until it withered and fell off. God thanked him for that and mentioned him in some of His Books.

And it is related from al-Junayd, who said: I heard Ibn al-Kuraybi say: "I incurred a major ritual impurity one night and needed to perform the major ablution. It was a cold night, and I found in myself hesitation and slackness. My soul suggested to me to delay until morning, to heat the water or go to the bathhouse, and not to force myself." I said, "How strange! I deal with God throughout my long life, and a duty is incumbent upon me for His right, yet I do not find myself hastening; rather, I find myself pausing and delaying. I vow not to perform the ablution except in this very garment of mine, and I vow not to remove it, not to wring it out, and not to dry it in the sun."

And it is related that Ghazwan and Abu Musa were on one of their military expeditions, and a slave-girl became uncovered. Ghazwan looked at her, then raised his hand and struck his eye until he gouged it out, saying, "You are a gazer at what harms you." And one of them cast a single glance at a woman, so he imposed upon himself never to drink cold water for the rest of his life; he would drink hot water to make life bitter for himself.

And it is related that Hassan ibn Abi Sinan passed by a room and said, "When was this built?" Then he turned to his soul and said, "You ask about what does not concern you? I shall punish you by fasting for a year." So he fasted it. And Malik ibn Digham said: "Ribah al-Qaysi came asking for my father after the afternoon prayer. We said, 'He is sleeping.' He said, 'Sleeping at this hour? This is a time for sleep?' Then he turned to leave. We sent a messenger after him, saying, 'Shall we not wake him for you?' The messenger came and said, 'He is too preoccupied to understand anything from me. I found him entering the graveyards, rebuking himself and saying, "Did you say 'a time for sleep this hour'? Was it upon you that a man sleeps whenever he wishes? What do you know? Perhaps this is not a time for sleep? You speak of what you do not know. Indeed, I have made a covenant with God that I shall never break: I will not lay you down on the earth to sleep for a year, except for an intervening illness or a departing mind. Shame on you! Are you not ashamed? How often you are rebuked, yet you do not desist from your heedlessness!"' He said, 'And he began to weep, unaware of my presence.' When I saw that, I departed and left him."

And it is related concerning Tamim al-Dari that he slept one night and did not rise to pray the night vigil, so he remained for a year without sleeping as a punishment for what he had done. And from Talhah, may God be pleased with him, it is said: He went forth...

A man one day removed his garments and rolled in the hot sand, saying to his soul, "Taste this, for the fire of Hell is hotter." He was a corpse by night and idle by day. While he was in that state, he saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, in the shade of a tree. He went to him and said, "My soul has overcome me." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "Was there no alternative for you to what you did? Indeed, the gates of heaven have been opened for you, and indeed, God has boasted of you to the angels." Then he said to his companions, "Take provision from your brother." The man began to say to them, "O so-and-so, pray for me; O so-and-so, pray for me." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Include them all," and prayed, "O God, make piety their provision and unite their affair upon guidance." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, then began to say, "O God, keep him steadfast." The man said, "O God, make Paradise their return."

A narration from Talhah: A man went out one day, removed his garments, and rolled in the hot sand, saying to his soul, "And the fire of Hell is hotter..." The full hadith was related by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Reckoning of the Soul" from a narration of Layth ibn Abi Sulaym from him, and this chain is interrupted or mursal, and I do not know who this Talhah is.

And Hudhayfah ibn Qatadah said: A man was asked, "What do you do with your soul concerning its desires?" He replied, "There is no soul on the face of the earth more detestable to me than it, so how could I grant it its desires?"

And Ibn al-Sammak entered upon Dawud al-Ta'i when he had died and was in his house upon the earth. He said, "O Dawud, you imprisoned your soul before you were imprisoned, and you punished your soul before you were punished. Today you see the reward of the One for whom you used to work."

And from Wahb ibn Munabbih: A man worshipped for a long time, then a need to God Almighty appeared to him. He stood for seventy Sabbaths, eating in each Sabbath eleven dates. Then he asked for his need, but it was not granted to him. He returned to his soul and said, "From you it came. If there were any good in you, your need would have been granted." An angel descended to him and said, "O son of Adam, this hour of yours is better than your past worship, and God has decreed your need."

And Abdullah ibn Qais said: We were on one of our military expeditions when the enemy appeared. A cry went out to the people, and they rose to the battle line on a day of severe wind. There was a man in front of me addressing his soul, saying, "O my soul, did I not witness such-and-such a battle, and I said to you, 'Your family and children,' and you obeyed me and I returned? Did I not witness such-and-such a battle, and I said to you, 'Your family and children,' and you obeyed me and I returned? By God, I will present you to God today, whether He takes you or leaves you." I said, "I will observe him today," so I observed him. The people charged against their enemy, and he was among the foremost. Then the enemy charged against the people, and they retreated, but he remained in his place until they retreated several times, and he stood firm, fighting. By God, he continued in that manner until I saw him slain. I counted upon him and his mount sixty or more than sixty stab wounds.

And we have mentioned the narration of Abu Talhah when his heart became preoccupied during prayer with a bird in his garden, so he gave the garden in charity as an expiation for that.

And indeed, Umar used to strike his feet with a whip every night and say, "What have you done today?"

And from Mujammi': He raised his head to the roof, and his gaze fell upon a woman, so he imposed upon himself that he would not raise his head to the sky as long as he remained in the world.

And al-Ahnaf ibn Qais would not be without a lamp at night. He would place his finger upon it and say to his soul, "What compelled you to do such-and-such on such-and-such a day?"

And Wuhayb ibn al-Ward disapproved of something concerning himself, so he plucked hairs from his chest until the pain became severe. Then he began to say to his soul, "Woe to you, I only intend good for you."

And Muhammad ibn Bishr saw Dawud al-Ta'i when he was breaking his fast, eating bread without salt. He said to him, "If only you ate it with salt." He replied, "My soul has been calling me to salt for a year, and Dawud has not tasted salt as long as he remains in the world."

Thus was the discipline of the people of resolve toward their souls. And it is astonishing that you punish your servant, your slave, your family, and your child for what issues from them of bad character, negligence in a matter, and you fear that if you were to pardon them, their affair would slip from control and they would transgress against you. Yet you neglect your own soul, which is your greatest enemy and most rebellious against you, and the harm from its rebellion is greater than the harm from the rebellion of your family. For their utmost is that they disturb your worldly life. If you were to reason, you would know that true life is the life of the Hereafter, and in it is the everlasting bliss that has no end. And your soul is what spoils for you the life of the Hereafter; thus it is more deserving of discipline than others.

The Fifth Station: Striving (Mujahadah). It is that when he holds his soul to account and sees that it has committed a sin, he should punish it with the punishments that have preceded. And if he sees it being negligent, due to laziness, in something of the virtues or a portion of the litanies, he should discipline it by increasing the litanies upon it and obliging it with various kinds of duties, to compensate for what was missed and to make up for what was neglected. For thus did the workers for God Almighty act. Indeed, Umar ibn al-Khattab punished himself when he missed the Asr prayer in congregation by giving in charity a land he owned, its value being two hundred thousand dirhams. And Ibn Umar, if he missed a prayer in congregation...

He revived that night and delayed the Maghrib prayer until two stars appeared, then freed two slaves. Ibn Abi Rabi'ah missed the two rak'ahs of Fajr, so he freed a slave. Some of them would impose upon themselves fasting for a year, or performing Hajj on foot, or giving all their wealth in charity—all of this as a restraint upon the soul and a reckoning for it, wherein lies its salvation.

If you say, "My soul does not comply with me in striving and persisting in regular devotions, so what is the way to treat it?" I say: Your way in that is to let it hear what has been reported in the narrations concerning the merit of the diligent worshippers. The narrations concerning the diligent have been transmitted: Abu Dawud reported from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As: "Whoever stands (in prayer) with ten verses is not recorded among the heedless; whoever stands with a hundred verses is recorded among the devout; and whoever stands with a thousand verses is recorded among those granted immense reward." And for him, and for al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain: "May Allah have mercy on a man who rises at night, prays, and wakes his wife." And al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Bilal: "Upon you is the night prayer, for it was the practice of the righteous before you." The hadith is considered *gharib* and not established. What preceded in the section on regular devotions, along with other narrations on this, has already been mentioned.

Among the most beneficial means of treatment is that you seek the companionship of a servant from among Allah's servants who is diligent in worship, so that you observe his statements and follow his example. Some of them would say, "When slackness in worship overcame me, I would look at the state of Muhammad ibn Wasil and his diligence, and I would act upon that for a week." However, this treatment has become difficult, for in this time one who strives in worship with the diligence of the early generations has been lost. Therefore, one should shift from observation to listening, for nothing is more beneficial than hearing of their states, studying their reports, and the immense effort they were in. Their toil has ended, but their reward and bliss remain forever, unceasing. How great is their dominion, and how severe is the regret of one who does not follow them, indulging his soul for a few short days with troubled pleasures, then death comes to him and he is cut off from all he desires for all eternity. We seek refuge in Allah the Exalted from that.

We will relate from the descriptions and merits of the diligent worshippers what stirs the desire of the seeker to strive, following their example. For the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "May Allah have mercy on certain people whom the people consider sick, while they are not sick." The hadith, "May Allah have mercy on certain people whom you consider sick, while they are not sick"—I did not find a basis for it as a *marfu'* hadith, but Ahmad narrated it in *al-Zuhd* as a *mawquf* statement from him, in which he said, "The onlooker looks at them and says, 'They are sick,' but there is no sickness in the people." Al-Hasan said, "Worship has exhausted them." Allah the Exalted said, "And those who give what they give while their hearts are fearful" (23:60). Al-Hasan said, "They perform the righteous deeds they perform, yet they fear that it may not save them from Allah's punishment." And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Blessed is he whose life is long and his deeds are good." The hadith, "Blessed is he whose life is long and his deeds are good," was transmitted by al-Tabarani from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Bishr, and in its chain is Baqiyyah, who narrated it in the form 'from,' and he was a *mudallis*. And al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Bakrah: "The best of people is he whose life is long and his deeds are good," and he said it is *hasan sahih*. It has been mentioned previously.

It is narrated that Allah the Exalted says to His angels, "What is the matter with My servants striving so diligently?" They say, "Our God, You made them fear something, so they fear it, and You made them yearn for something, so they yearn for it." Then Allah, blessed and exalted, says, "How would it be if My servants were to see Me? They would be even more diligent." Al-Hasan said, "I met people and kept company with groups of them; they would not rejoice at anything of this world that came to them, nor grieve over anything of it that departed. It was more insignificant in their eyes than this dust you tread with your feet. One of them would live his entire life without folding a garment, nor ordering his family to prepare a meal, nor placing anything between himself and the ground. I found them working by the Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet. When night enveloped them, they stood on the tips of their feet, prostrating their faces, their tears flowing down their cheeks, supplicating to their Lord for the ransom of their necks. When they performed a good deed, they rejoiced in it and persisted in gratitude for it, asking Allah to accept it. When they committed an evil deed, it saddened them, and they asked Allah the Exalted to forgive them for it. By Allah, they remained like that and upon that, and by Allah, they were not safe from sins, nor were they saved except by forgiveness."

It is recounted that a group of people entered upon 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz to visit him during his illness, and among them was a young man with a frail body. 'Umar said to him, "O young man, what has brought you to the state I see?" He replied, "O Commander of the Faithful, illnesses and ailments." He said, "I ask you by Allah to tell me the truth." He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, I tasted the sweetness of the world and found it bitter. Its splendor and sweetness became insignificant to me, and its gold and stones became equal in my sight. It is as if I see the Throne of my Lord, and the people being driven to Paradise and the Fire. For that, I have thirsted by day and kept awake by night, and all of it is little and insignificant."

What we are in is trivial compared to God's reward and punishment. Abu Nu'aym said: Dawud al-Ta'i would drink crumbled bread but not eat bread. When asked about this, he said: "Between chewing bread and drinking crumbled bread, I can recite fifty verses." A man once entered upon him and said: "There is a broken beam in the roof of your house." He replied: "O my nephew, I have been in this house for twenty years and have never looked at the roof." They disliked superfluous looking just as they disliked superfluous speech. Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: "We sat with Ahmad ibn Razin from morning until afternoon, and he did not turn right or left." When asked about it, he said: "God Almighty created the two eyes so that the servant may look with them at the majesty of God. Whoever looks without reflection, a sin is recorded against him." A wife of Masruq said: "Masruq was never found but with his two legs swollen from prolonged prayer." She said: "By God, I would sit behind him and weep out of compassion for him." Abu al-Darda' said: "Were it not for three things, I would not desire to live a single day: thirst for God in the scorching heat, prostration to God in the depths of the night, and sitting with people who select the choicest speech as one selects the choicest fruit." Al-Aswad ibn Yazid would strive diligently in worship and fast in the heat until his body turned green and yellow. 'Alqamah ibn Qays said to him: "Why do you torment yourself?" He replied: "I seek its nobility." He would fast until his body turned green and pray until he collapsed. Anas ibn Malik and al-Hasan entered upon him and said: "God Almighty has not commanded you to do all this." He said: "I am but a possessed slave; I do not leave any act of humility without performing it." Some of the diligent worshippers would pray a thousand rak'ahs every day until his legs gave out, so he would pray a thousand rak'ahs sitting. When he prayed 'Asr, he would squat and say: "I wonder at creation, how it desired other than You as a substitute for You. I wonder at creation, how it found comfort in other than You. Nay, I wonder at creation, how its hearts were illuminated by the remembrance of other than You." Thabit al-Bunani had come to love prayer so much that he would say: "O God, if You have permitted anyone to pray to You in his grave, then permit me to pray in my grave." Al-Junayd said: "I have not seen anyone more devout than al-Sari. Ninety-eight years passed, and he was never seen lying down except in the illness of death." Al-Harith ibn Sa'd said: "A group passed by a monk and saw what he was doing to himself in severe diligence. They spoke to him about it. He said: 'And what is this compared to what is intended for creation in meeting terrors while they are heedless? They have secluded themselves for the interests of their selves and forgotten their greatest share from their Lord.' The people wept, every last one of them." From Abu Muhammad al-Maghazili: "Abu Muhammad al-Jurayri resided in Mecca for a year; he did not sleep, did not speak, did not lean against a pillar or a wall, and did not stretch out his legs. Abu Bakr al-Kattani passed by him, greeted him, and said: 'O Abu Muhammad, how were you able to sustain this seclusion?' He said: 'Sincere knowledge within me aided my outward state.' Al-Kattani bowed his head and walked away pondering." From one of them: "I entered upon Fath al-Mawsili and saw that he had extended his palms, weeping until I saw tears streaming from between his fingers. I drew near to him, and his tears were tinged with yellow. I said: 'Why, by God, O Fath, have you wept blood?' He said: 'Had you not adjured me by God, I would not have told you. Yes, I wept blood.' I said to him: 'For what did you weep tears?' He said: 'For my falling short of the obligatory right of God Almighty.' And I wept blood for the tears, lest the tears not be sincere for me." He said: "I saw him after his death in a dream and said: 'What has God done with you?' He said: 'He forgave me.' I said to him: 'Then what did He do with your tears?' He said: 'My Lord drew me near and said: "O Fath, the tears for what?" I said: "My Lord, for my falling short of Your obligatory right." He said: "And the blood for what?" I said: "For my tears, that they might not be sincere for me." He said to me: "O Fath, what did you intend with all this? By My might and majesty, your two recording angels have ascended for forty years with your scroll, and there is no sin in it."'" It is said that a group intended a journey but strayed from the path and ended up at a monk secluded from people. They called out to him, and he looked out at them from his cell. They said: "O monk, we have missed the path; how is the way?" He gestured with his head to the sky. The people understood what he intended. They said: "O monk, we ask you, will you answer us?" He said: "Ask, but do not be lengthy, for the day will not return, life does not come back, and the seeker is hasty." The people marveled at his words and said: "O monk, upon what will creation be judged tomorrow before their Sovereign?" He said: "Upon their intentions." They said: "Counsel us." He said: "Provision yourselves according to your journey, for the best provision is what reaches the goal." Then he guided them to the path and withdrew his head into his cell. 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: "I passed by the cell of a monk from the monks of China and called out: 'O monk!' He did not answer me. I called a second time, and he did not answer. I called a third time, and he looked out and said: 'O this one, I am not a monk. Truly, the monk is he who fears.'"

God is in His heaven, His majesty in His grandeur; He endures His afflictions and accepts His decree, praises Him for His blessings, and gives thanks for His favors. He humbles himself before His greatness, submits to His might, surrenders to His power, and bows before His awe. He reflects on His accounting and His punishment, so his days are spent fasting and his nights in prayer. The remembrance of the Fire and the questioning of the Almighty have kept him awake—that is the ascetic. As for me, I am a rabid dog; I secluded myself in this hermitage from people lest I bite them. I said, “O ascetic, what has severed creation from God Almighty after they knew Him?” He replied, “O my brother, nothing has severed creation from God Almighty except love of this world and its adornment, for it is the abode of sins and transgressions. The wise one is he who casts it from his heart, repents to God Almighty for his sin, and turns to what brings him nearer to his Lord.”

It was said to Dawud al-Ta’i, “If you let your beard grow long,” and he replied, “Then I would be idle.” And Uways al-Qarani would say, “This is the night of bowing,” and he would spend the whole night in one bowing; and when the next night came, he would say, “This is the night of prostration,” and he would spend the whole night in one prostration. It is said that when ‘Utbah the youth repented, he took no pleasure in food or drink. His mother said to him, “If you would be gentle with yourself,” and he replied, “Gentleness I seek; leave me to toil a little and enjoy long.” Masruq performed Hajj and never slept except in prostration. Sufyan al-Thawri would say, “At dawn, people praise the night journey; and at death, people praise piety.” ‘Abdullah ibn Dawud said, “When one of them reached forty years, he folded his bedding,” meaning he would not sleep the whole night.

Kahmas ibn al-Hasan would pray a thousand rak’ahs each day, then say to himself, “Arise, O refuge of every evil.” When he grew weak, he reduced it to five hundred, then would weep and say, “Half of my deeds have gone.” The daughter of Rabi’ ibn Khuthaym said to him, “O father, why do I see people sleeping while you do not sleep?” He replied, “O my daughter, your father fears the night.” When Umm Rabi’ saw what Rabi’ endured of weeping and sleeplessness, she called to him, “O my son, perhaps you have killed someone.” He said, “Yes, O mother.” She said, “Who is it, so that we may seek his family to pardon you? By God, if they knew what you are going through, they would have mercy on you and forgive you.” He said, “O mother, it is myself.”

From ‘Umar, the nephew of Bishr ibn al-Harith, who said: I heard my uncle Bishr ibn al-Harith say to my mother, “O my sister, my stomach and my sides are striking me.” My mother said to him, “O my brother, will you permit me to prepare for you a little broth with a handful of flour I have, that you may sip it to soothe your stomach?” He said to her, “Woe to you! I fear He will say, ‘Where did you get this flour?’ and I will not know what to say to Him.” My mother wept, and he wept with her, and I wept with them. ‘Umar said: My mother saw the severity of Bishr’s hunger, and he was breathing weakly. She said to him, “O my brother, would that my mother had not borne me, for by God my heart is torn by what I see of you.” I heard him say to her, “And I, would that my mother had not borne me; and if she bore me, that her breast had not nourished me.” ‘Umar said: My mother would weep for him night and day.

Rabi’ said: I came to Uways and found him sitting until he prayed Fajr, then he sat, and I sat, saying, “I will not distract him from glorification.” He remained in his place until he prayed Dhuhr, then stood for prayer until he prayed ‘Asr, then sat in his place until he prayed Maghrib, then remained in his place until he prayed ‘Isha, then remained until he prayed Subh, then sat and sleep overcame him. He said, “O God, I seek refuge in You from a sleepy eye and from a stomach that is never satisfied.” I said, “This is enough from him,” then I returned. A man looked at Uways and said, “O Abu ‘Abdillah, why do I see you as if you are ill?” He said, “And why should Uways not be ill? The ill are fed, and Uways does not eat; the ill sleep, and Uways does not sleep.”

Ahmad ibn Harb said, “How astonishing for one who knows that Paradise is adorned above him and that Hellfire is stoked beneath him, how he can sleep between them!” A man among the ascetics said: I came to Ibrahim ibn Adham and found him having prayed ‘Isha. I sat watching him; he wrapped himself in a cloak, then threw himself down and did not turn from side to side the whole night until dawn broke and the caller gave the call to prayer. He leapt to prayer without renewing his ablution. This troubled my heart, so I said to him, “May God have mercy on you, you slept the whole night lying down, then did not renew your ablution?” He said, “I was the whole night wandering in the gardens of Paradise at times and in the valleys of Hellfire at times—is there sleep in that?”

Thabit al-Banani said: I met men, one of whom would pray until he was unable to reach his bed except crawling. It is said that Abu Bakr ibn ‘Ayyash spent forty years without laying his side on a bed, and water descended in one of his eyes, and he remained twenty years without his family knowing of it. It is said that the daily routine of Sumnun was five hundred rak’ahs. From Abu Bakr al-Mutawwi’i, who said: My routine in my youth each day and night was to recite “Say: He is God, the One” thirty-one thousand times or forty thousand times—the narrator doubted. And Mansur ibn al-Mu’tamir, when you saw him, you would say, “A man struck by a calamity, broken.”

The one with downcast gaze and moist eyes, if he stirred, his eyes would bring forth four. His mother once said to him, "What is this you are doing to yourself? You weep through most of the night without ceasing. Perhaps, my son, you have wronged a soul; perhaps you have killed someone." He would reply, "O mother, I know best what I have done to myself." It was said to 'Amir ibn 'Abdullah, "How is your endurance for night vigils and the thirst of midday heat?" He said, "Is it not merely that I have transferred the food of the day to the night and the sleep of the night to the day? There is nothing momentous in that." And he used to say, "I have not seen the like of Paradise—one who seeks it sleeps? Nor the like of Hellfire—one who flees it sleeps?" When night came, he would say, "Begone, O sleep, heat of the Fire!" and he would not sleep until dawn. When day came, he would say, "Begone, O sleep, heat of the Fire!" and he would not sleep until evening. When night came, he would say, "Whoever fears [his Lord] journeys by night, and at dawn the people praise the night journey." Some said, "I accompanied 'Amir ibn 'Abd al-Qays for four months and I never saw him sleep by night or by day."

It is narrated from a man among the companions of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, that he said, "I prayed the dawn prayer behind 'Ali, may God be pleased with him. When he gave the salutation, he turned to his right with a look of sorrow. He remained until the sun rose, then he turned his hand and said, 'By God, I have seen the companions of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and I see nothing today resembling them. They would rise in the morning with dishevelled hair, covered in dust, pale, having spent the night for God in prostration and standing, reciting the Book of God, shifting between their feet and their foreheads. When they remembered God, they would sway as trees sway on a windy day, and their eyes would flow until their garments became wet, as if the people around them had spent the night heedless.'"

Abu Muslim al-Khawlani had hung a whip in the mosque of his house to frighten himself with it. He would say to himself, "Get up! By God, I will drag you along until exhaustion comes from you, not from me." When lethargy overcame him, he would take his whip and strike his leg with it, saying, "You are more deserving of a beating than my mount." And he would say, "Do the companions of Muhammad, peace be upon him, think they have exclusive claim to Him without us? No, by God! We will contend with them for it earnestly until they know they have left men behind them."

Safwan ibn Sulaym's legs became knotted from long standing, and he reached such striving that if he were told the Resurrection was tomorrow, he would find no way to increase it. When winter came, he would lie on the roof to be harmed by the cold, and when it was summer, he would lie inside the houses to feel the heat, so he would not sleep. He died while prostrating, and he used to say, "O God, I love meeting You, so love my meeting with You."

Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said, "I went out one morning—and when I went out, I would begin with 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, to greet her—so I went to her one day and she was praying the forenoon prayer, reciting, 'So God has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the scorching fire,' weeping, supplicating, and repeating the verse. I stood until I grew weary, and she remained as she was. When I saw that, I went to the market, saying, 'Let me finish my errand and then return.' I finished my errand and returned, and she was as she was, repeating the verse, weeping and supplicating."

Muhammad ibn Ishaq said, "When 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Aswad came to us as a pilgrim, one of his feet became sore, so he stood praying on one foot until he prayed the dawn prayer with the ablution of the night prayer." Some said, "I fear nothing from death except that it will come between me and standing in prayer at night."

'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God honor his face, said, "The marks of the righteous are pallor from night vigils, dimness of eyes from weeping, and dryness of lips from fasting. Upon them is the dust of the reverent." It was said to al-Hasan, "Why do those who pray at night have the most beautiful faces?" He said, "Because they were alone with the All-Merciful, so He clothed them in light from His light."

'Amir ibn 'Abd al-Qays used to say, "My God, You created me without consulting me, and You will cause me to die without informing me. You created an enemy with me and made him run in me like blood, and made him see me while I do not see him. Then You said to me, 'Hold fast.' My God, how can I hold fast if You do not make me hold fast? My God, in this world are sorrows and griefs, and in the Hereafter is punishment and reckoning. So where are rest and joy?"

Ja'far ibn Muhammad said, "'Utbah the youth would punctuate the night with three cries. When he prayed the night prayer, he would place his head between his knees, reflecting. When a third of the night had passed, he would cry out once. Then he would place his head between his knees, reflecting. When the second third had passed, he would cry out once. Then he would place his head between his knees, reflecting. When dawn approached, he would cry out once." Ja'far ibn Muhammad said, "I mentioned this to some people from Basra, and one said, 'Do not look at his crying out, but look at what he was engaged in between the cries until he cried out.'"

From al-Qasim ibn Rashid al-Shaybani, who said, "Zam'ah was staying with us at al-Muhassab. He had a family and daughters. He would stand and pray for a long time at night. When dawn approached, he would call out in a loud voice, 'O you caravan who have halted! Do you sleep through all this night? Will you not rise and journey on?' Then they would spring up, and from here would be heard a weeping one, and from there..."

Here a caller, here a reciter, and here one performing ablution. When dawn breaks, he calls out with his loudest voice at morning, the people praising the night journey. And some of the wise said: Verily, Allah has servants upon whom He bestowed favor, so they came to know Him, and He expanded their breasts, so they obeyed Him, and they placed their trust in Him, so they surrendered the creation and the command to Him. Thus their hearts became mines for the purity of certainty, houses for wisdom, coffins for majesty, and treasuries for power. They are among creation, coming and going, while their hearts roam in the dominion and take refuge with the Veiled One of the clouds, then return bearing companies of subtle benefits and what no describer can describe. In the inwardness of their affairs, they are like brocade in beauty, while outwardly they are towels offered to whoever desires them, in humility. This is a way not attained by affectation; it is but the grace of Allah, which He gives to whom He wills.

And one of the righteous said: While I was traveling in some of the mountains of Jerusalem, I descended into a valley there, and behold, I heard a voice that rose high, and those mountains were answering it with a lofty echo. I followed the voice until I came upon a meadow with dense trees, and behold, I saw a man standing there, repeating this verse: "On the Day when every soul will find what it did of good present..." up to His saying: "...and Allah warns you of Himself." He said: So I sat behind him, listening to his speech as he repeated this verse, when he cried out a cry and fell down unconscious. I said, "Alas, woe is me! This is for my wretchedness." Then I waited for him to regain consciousness. He recovered after an hour, and I heard him saying: "I seek refuge in You from the station of the liars. I seek refuge in You from the deeds of the idle. I seek refuge in You from the turning away of the heedless." Then he said: "To You the hearts of the fearful are humbled, and to You the hopes of the deficient take flight, and before Your greatness the hearts of the knowers are subdued." Then he shook his hand and said: "What have I to do with the world, and what has the world to do with me? O world, what claim have I upon you with your kindred and your thousands of delights for your lovers? Go, you and them, and deceive!" Then he said: "Where are the past generations and the people of bygone eras? In the dust they decay and by time they perish." I called to him, "O servant of Allah, from today I am behind you, waiting for your leisure." He said, "And how can one be at leisure who races against the moments and they race against him, fearing that death will outstrip him to his soul? Or how can one be at leisure whose days have gone while his sins remain?" Then he said, "You are for it and for every hardship I anticipate its descent." Then he turned from me for a moment and recited: "And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had not taken into account." Then he cried out another cry, stronger than the first, and fell down unconscious. I said, "His soul has departed." I drew near to him, and behold, he was convulsing. Then he regained consciousness, saying: "Who am I? What is my significance? Grant me my misdeeds from Your bounty, and clothe me in Your covering, and pardon my sins by the generosity of Your Countenance when I stand before You." I said to him, "By Him for whom you hope and in whom you trust, speak to me." He said, "Occupy yourself with the speech of one whose speech benefits you, and leave the speech of one whose sins have slain him. Verily, I have been in this place since Allah willed, striving against Satan and he strives against me. He found no helper against me to bring me out from what I am in except you. So from me to you, O deceived one! For you have rendered my tongue idle and inclined a portion of my heart to your talk. And I seek refuge in Allah from your evil, then I hope He will protect me from His wrath and bestow upon me with His mercy." He said: So I said, "This is a friend of Allah; I fear I might distract him and be punished in my place here." So I withdrew and left him.

And one of the righteous said: While I was on a journey of mine, I turned toward a tree to rest beneath it, and behold, I saw an elder who had drawn near to death. He said to me, "O this one, arise, for death has not died." Then he wandered off aimlessly. I followed him and heard him saying, "Every soul will taste death. O Allah, bless me in death." I said, "And in what is after death?" He said, "Whoever is certain of what is after death rolls up the hem of caution and has no abode in the world." Then he said, "O He before Whose Countenance all faces are humbled, whiten my face by gazing upon You, fill my heart with love for You, and deliver me from that reproach tomorrow with You, for the time has come for me to feel shame before You, and the time has come for me to turn back from turning away from You." He said, "Were it not for Your forbearance, my lifespan would not contain me, and were it not for Your pardon, my hope in what is with You would not expand." Then he went on and left me.

And they recited in this meaning: A body grown thin, a heart sorrowful, you see him on a peak or in the belly of a valley, lamenting over disgraceful sins whose heavy weight troubles the purity of sleep. If his fears stir and increase, he calls out, "Succor me, O my Support! For You are aware of what I encounter, abundant in pardoning the slips of servants." And it was also said: More delightful than delighting in maidens when they approach in beautiful garments is a penitent who flees from family and wealth, journeying from place to place to obscure his mention and live alone, manifesting in worship with aspirations. His delight is recitation, where is my protector? And remembrance with the heart and the tongue. And at death, a herald comes to him, giving glad tidings of deliverance from abasement, so he attains what he desired and what he wished of comforts in the chambers of Paradise.

And Karaz ibn Wabrah would complete the Qur'an three times every day and strive against his soul in acts of worship to the utmost degree of striving.

He said, "You have indeed exerted your soul." Then he asked, "How long is the lifespan of this world?" It was said, "Seven thousand years." He asked, "What is the measure of a day of Resurrection?" It was said, "Fifty thousand years." He said, "How can any of you be incapable of working for seven days to secure safety for that Day?" Meaning, if you lived the entire age of the world and strove for seven thousand years, and were saved from a single day whose measure is fifty thousand years, your gain would be immense, and you would be most deserving of aspiring to it. So how much more so when your lifespan is short and the Hereafter has no end? Thus was the way of the righteous predecessors in disciplining the soul and watching over it. Whenever your soul rebels against you and refuses to persist in worship, then study the states of these people, for the likes of them are now rare to find. If you could manage to witness someone who follows their example, it would be more effective for the heart and more motivating to emulate, for hearing is not like seeing. If you are incapable of this, then do not neglect listening to accounts of their states, for if you cannot have camels, then goats are still good. Present your soul with the choice between following them and being in their company and multitude—they are the wise, the discerning, and those of insight in religion—and between following the ignorant and heedless among the people of your time. Do not be content for it to be enlisted among the foolish, satisfied with resembling the dull-witted, and preferring to oppose the wise. If your soul suggests to you that these are mighty men whose example cannot be matched, then study the states of striving women and say to it, 'O soul, do not disdain to be less than a woman. How base is a man who falls short of a woman in the matter of her religion and her worldly life!' Let us now mention a selection from the accounts of the striving women.

It is narrated from Habiba al-'Adawiyya that when she prayed the night prayer, she would stand on her roof, tighten her garment and headscarf upon herself, and then say, 'My God, the stars have set, eyes are asleep, kings have locked their doors, and every lover is alone with their beloved. This is my station before You.' Then she would turn to her prayer. When dawn appeared, she would say, 'My God, this night has departed and this day has dawned. Would that I knew: have You accepted my night so that I may rejoice, or have You turned it back so that I may grieve? By Your might, this is my constant practice and Your constant practice as long as You keep me alive. By Your might, even if You drove me away from Your door, I would not leave because of what has settled in my soul of Your generosity and bounty.'

And it is narrated from 'Ajaza that she used to spend the night in worship, and she was blind. When the last third of the night came, she would call out with a sorrowful voice, 'To You the worshippers have cut through the darkness of the nights, racing to Your mercy and the bounty of Your forgiveness. By You, my God, I ask—not by other than You—that You place me in the foremost group of the foremost, and that You raise me with You to the highest heights, in the station of those brought near, and that You join me with Your righteous servants. For You are the Most Merciful of the merciful, the Greatest of the great, the Most Generous of the generous, O Generous One!' Then she would fall down prostrate, and a thud would be heard from her. Then she would not cease supplicating and weeping until dawn.

And Yahya ibn Bistam said, "I used to attend the gathering of Shu'wana, and I would see what she did of wailing and weeping. I said to a companion of mine, 'If we went to her when she is alone and advised her to be gentle with herself?' He said, 'You and that?' So we went, and I said to her, 'If only you would be gentle with yourself and reduce this weeping somewhat, you would be stronger for what you desire.' She wept and then said, 'By God, I wish I could weep until my tears are exhausted, then weep blood until not a drop of blood remains in any limb of my limbs. And how can I weep? How can I weep?' She kept repeating, 'How can I weep?' until she fainted."

And Muhammad ibn Mu'adh said, "A woman from among the worshippers narrated to me, saying, 'I saw in my dream as if I entered Paradise, and the people of Paradise were standing at their doors. I said, "Why are the people of Paradise standing?" Someone said to me, "They have come out to look at this woman for whom the gardens have been adorned in anticipation of her arrival." I said, "Who is this woman?" It was said, "A black slave woman from the people of Aykah, named Shu'wana." I said, "By God, she is my sister." While I was like that, she approached on a she-camel flying with her through the air. When I saw her, I called out, 'O my sister, do you not see my place compared to yours? If only you would call upon your Master to join me to you!' She smiled at me and said, 'Your arrival time has not yet come. But remember two things from me: keep sadness constant in your heart, and prefer the love of God over your own desire. It will not harm you when you die.'"

And 'Abdullah ibn al-Hasan said, "I had a Roman slave girl, and I was infatuated with her. One night she was sleeping beside me, and I woke up and sought her but did not find her. I got up looking for her, and there she was prostrating, saying, 'By Your love for me, unless You forgive my sins.' I said to her, 'Do not say "by Your love for me," but say "by my love for You."' She said, 'O my master, by His love for me He brought me out of polytheism to Islam, and by His love for me He awakened my eye while many of His creation are asleep.'"

And Abu Hashim al-Qurashi said, "A woman from the people of Yemen named Sirriyya came to us and stayed in one of our houses. I would hear from her at night moaning and sighing. One day I said to a servant of mine, 'Look...'"

What shall be done with this woman?" He then looked upon her and saw her doing nothing except that she did not turn her gaze away from the sky, facing the Qibla, saying: "You created me in secret, then You nurtured me with Your blessings from one state to another, and all Your states are beautiful for her, and all Your trials are lovely in her sight, yet despite that, she exposes herself to Your wrath by leaping into disobedience, slip after slip. Does she think that You do not see her actions, while You are All-Knowing, All-Aware, and You have power over all things?"

And Dhul-Nun al-Misri said: "I went out one night from the valley of Canaan, and when I ascended the valley, there was a dark figure approaching, saying: 'And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had not anticipated,' and weeping. When the dark figure drew near to me, it was a woman wearing a woolen cloak, with a water-skin in her hand. She said to me: 'Who are you?' without being startled by me. I said: 'A stranger.' She said: 'O this one, is there any estrangement with Allah?' I wept at her words. She said: 'What has made you weep?' I said: 'The remedy has fallen upon a wound that has festered, hastening its healing.' She said: 'If you are truthful, then why did you weep?' I said: 'May Allah have mercy on you, the truthful one does not weep.' She said: 'No.' I said: 'Why is that?' She said: 'Because weeping is the relief of the heart.' I fell silent, amazed at her words."

And Ahmad ibn Ali said: "We sought permission to visit 'Afira, but she veiled herself from us, so we remained at the door. When she knew that, she rose to open the door for us, and I heard her saying: 'O Allah, I seek refuge in You from one who comes to distract me from Your remembrance.' Then she opened the door and we entered upon her. We said to her: 'O servant of Allah, pray for us.' She said: 'May Allah make your reading in my house forgiveness.' Then she said to us: 'Ata' al-Sulami remained for forty years without looking at the sky, then a glance occurred from him and he fell unconscious, and a rupture occurred in his belly. Oh, if only 'Afira, when she raises her head, would not disobey, and if only, when she disobeys, she would not return.'"

And some of the righteous said: "I went out one day to the market, and with me was an Abyssinian slave-girl. I detained her in a place at the edge of the market and went about some of my needs, saying: 'Do not move until I return to you.' He said: 'I returned and did not find her in the place, so I returned to my home, extremely angry with her. When she saw me, she recognized the anger on my face and said: 'O my master, do not hasten against me. You seated me in a place where I did not see anyone remembering Allah, the Exalted, and I feared that the place would be swallowed up.' I was amazed at her words and said to her: 'You are free.' She said: 'What have you done? I used to serve you, so I would have two rewards, but now one of them has gone from me.'"

And Ibn al-'Ala' al-Sa'di said: "I had a cousin called Burayra who devoted herself to worship and read much in the Mus'haf. Whenever she came upon a verse mentioning the Fire, she would weep, and she continued weeping until her eyes were lost from weeping. Her cousins said: 'Let us go to this woman to reproach her for her excessive weeping.' He said: 'We entered upon her and said: 'O Burayra, how are you this morning?' She said: 'We have become as guests, alighting in a land of estrangement, waiting for when we are called to answer.' We said to her: 'What is this weeping? Your eyes have been lost from it.' She said: 'If there is good for my eyes with Allah, then what harm is it that has gone from them in this world? And if there is evil for them with Allah, then weeping will increase it longer than this.' Then she turned away." He said: "The people said: 'Let us rise, for by Allah, she is in something other than what we are in.'"

And Mu'adhah al-'Adawiyyah, when the day came, would say: "This is my day on which I will die," and she would not eat until evening. And when the night came, she would say: "This is the night on which I will die," and she would pray until dawn.

And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "I spent a night at Rabi'ah's. She stood at her prayer niche, and I stood in a corner of the house. She remained standing until dawn. When dawn came, I said: 'What is the reward for one who assists us in standing this night?' She said: 'His reward is that he fasts for Him tomorrow.'"

And Shu'wanah would say in her supplication: "My God, how You make me yearn for meeting You, and how great is my hope for Your reward, and You are the Generous One who does not disappoint the hope of the hopeful, nor invalidate the longing of the longing at Your presence. My God, if my term has drawn near and no deed has brought me closer to You, then I have made the confession of sin the means of my ailments. If You pardon, then who is more worthy of that than You? And if You punish, then who is more just than You there? My God, I have judged against myself in looking after it, and there remains for it Your beautiful gaze. So woe to it if You do not make it happy. My God, You have not ceased to be gracious to me during the days of my life, so do not cut off Your grace from me after my death. And I have hoped from the One who has taken charge of me in my life with His benevolence that He will assist me at my death with His forgiveness. My God, how can I despair of Your beautiful gaze after my death, when You have only bestowed beauty upon me in my life? My God, if my sins have frightened me, then my love for You has given me refuge. So take charge of my affair as You are worthy, and be gracious with Your favor to one deceived by his ignorance. My God, if You had intended to disgrace me, You would not have guided me, and if You had intended to expose me, You would not have concealed me. So let me enjoy that to which You have guided me, and perpetuate for me that with which You have concealed me. My God, I do not think You will turn me away in a need."

My Lord, I have spent my lifetime therein. Were it not for the sins I have committed, I would not fear Your punishment; and were it not for the generosity I know of You, I would not hope for Your reward. The elect have related: We visited the female worshipper on a journey. She had fasted until she turned dark, wept until she went blind, and prayed until she became seated (unable to stand), and she would pray while sitting. We greeted her, then mentioned to her something about forgiveness to ease her burden. She then gasped and said, "My knowledge of my own soul has wounded my heart and pained my liver. By God, I wish God had not created me and that I had not been a thing remembered." Then she turned back to her prayer.

Therefore, if you are among those who guard and watch over their souls, you must study the states of striving men and women, so that your zeal may be stirred and your earnestness increased. Beware of looking to the people of your own age, for if you obey most of those on earth, they will lead you astray from the path of God. The accounts of the strivers are not limited, and what we have mentioned is sufficient for the one who takes heed. If you desire more, then you must persist in studying the book *Hilyat al-Awliya'*, for it contains an exposition of the states of the Companions, the Successors, and those after them. By contemplating it, the distance between you and the people of your age from the people of religion will become clear to you. If your soul suggests to you to look to the people of your time, saying, "Good was facilitated in that era due to the abundance of helpers, but now, if you oppose the people of your time, they will see you as mad and mock you," then agree with them in what they are upon and engaged in, so that nothing befalls you except what befalls them. For when a calamity becomes widespread, it is deemed agreeable. Beware of descending by the rope of its deception and being duped by its falsification. Say to it, "Tell me, if a torrential flood were to suddenly rush upon the town, drowning its people, and they remained in their places, not taking caution due to their ignorance of the true situation, while you were able to leave them and board a ship by which you would be saved from drowning—would it then occur to you that 'when a calamity becomes widespread, it is agreeable'? Or would you abandon following them, deem their action foolish, and take caution against what has befallen you? If you would abandon following them out of fear of drowning and the torment of drowning, which lasts but an hour, then how can you not flee from the torment of eternity, to which you are exposed in every state? And from where does a calamity become agreeable when it is widespread? The people of the Fire will have an all-engrossing occupation, preventing them from considering generality and particularity. The disbelievers were only destroyed by following the people of their time, as they said, 'Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and indeed, we are followers in their footsteps.'"

Therefore, when you occupy yourself with rebuking your soul and compelling it to strive, and it becomes obstinate, do not cease rebuking, reproaching, and making it aware of its poor regard for itself, so that perhaps it may desist from its rebellion.

**The Sixth Station: In Reproaching and Rebuking the Soul**

Know that your most hostile enemy is your soul that lies between your two sides. It was created commanding to evil, inclined to wickedness, fleeing from good. You have been commanded to purify it, rectify it, and drive it with the chains of subjugation to the worship of its Lord and Creator, restraining it from its desires and weaning it from its pleasures. If you neglect it, it becomes unruly and wild, and you will not attain it thereafter. But if you persistently reproach, rebuke, censure, and blame it, your soul will become the self-reproaching soul by which God swore, and you may hope for it to become the tranquil soul, called to enter among the servants of God, well-pleased and pleasing to Him.

Do not be heedless for a moment of reminding and rebuking it, and do not occupy yourself with admonishing others before you first occupy yourself with admonishing your own soul. God Almighty revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him, "O son of Mary, admonish yourself; if you heed the admonition, then admonish people; otherwise, feel ashamed before Me." And He, exalted is He, said, "And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers."

Your way is to turn to it and establish before it its ignorance and stupidity, for it always seeks excuse with its cleverness and guidance, and its pride and aversion intensify when it is attributed to folly. Say to it, "O soul, how great is your ignorance! You claim wisdom, intelligence, and acumen, while you are the most foolish and witless of people. Do you not know what lies before you of Paradise and Hell, and that you are bound for one of them in the near future? So why are you joyful, laughing, and occupied with diversion while you are sought for this grave matter? Perhaps today or tomorrow you will be snatched away. I see you regarding death as distant, while God sees it as near. Do you not know that everything which is to come is near, and the distant is that which is not to come? Do you not know that death comes suddenly, without sending a messenger ahead, without appointment or agreement? It does not come in one thing rather than another, nor in winter rather than summer, nor in summer rather than winter, nor in day rather than night, nor in night rather than day. It does not come in childhood rather than youth, nor in youth rather than childhood. Rather, every breath is a moment in which death could come suddenly. If death does not come suddenly, then sickness may come suddenly, then lead to death. So why do you not prepare for death, when it is closer to you than every close thing? Do you not ponder His saying, exalted is He, 'The reckoning for the people has drawn near, while they are...'"

They are heedless and turn away. No new reminder from their Lord comes to them but they listen to it while they are at play, their hearts distracted. Woe to you, O soul! If your audacity in disobeying God stems from your belief that God does not see you, how great is your disbelief! And if it is despite your knowledge that He observes you, how severe is your insolence and how scant your shame! Woe to you, O soul! If a servant from among your servants, or even a brother from your brothers, confronted you with something you dislike, how great would be your anger toward him and your loathing of him! With what boldness, then, do you expose yourself to the loathing, anger, and severe punishment of God? Do you imagine that you can endure His punishment? Far, far is that from the truth! Test yourself, if heedlessness due to arrogance distracts you from His painful punishment: restrain yourself for an hour in the sun, or in a bathhouse, or bring your finger near the fire, so that the extent of your capacity may become clear. Are you deluded by God’s generosity and bounty, and by His independence from your obedience and worship? Why do you not rely on the generosity of God Almighty in the concerns of your worldly life? When an enemy intends you harm, do you not devise stratagems to repel him, and not entrust him to the generosity of God Almighty? And when a need presses upon you for a desire from the desires of this world, which is only fulfilled by dinar and dirham, why do you exert your very soul in seeking and acquiring it through various means, and not rely on the generosity of God Almighty until He causes you to stumble upon a treasure or subjugates a servant from among His servants to bring your need to you without any effort or request on your part? Do you suppose that God is generous in the Hereafter but not in this world, when you know that God’s way does not change, that the Lord of the Hereafter and this world is one, and that for man there is only what he strives for? Woe to you, O soul! How astonishing is your hypocrisy and your false motives! You claim faith with your tongue, yet the mark of hypocrisy is apparent upon you. Did not your Master and Lord say to you, “There is no creature on earth but that its provision is upon God”? And concerning the Hereafter He said, “And that for man there is only what he strives for.” Thus, He has guaranteed your worldly affairs specifically and diverted you from striving in them, yet you have belied Him by your actions and have become avidly engrossed in seeking them like one stunned and reckless. And you have entrusted the affair of the Hereafter to your own striving, yet you have turned away from it like one deluded and contemptuous. Is this from the signs of faith? If faith were by the tongue alone, why would the hypocrites be in the lowest depth of the Fire? Woe to you, O soul! It is as if you do not believe in the Day of Reckoning and imagine that when you die you will escape and be free. Far from it! Do you think you will be left neglected? Were you not a drop of emitted semen, then a clinging clot, then He created and proportioned you? Is not He who did that able to revive the dead? If this is from your hidden thoughts, how great is your disbelief and ignorance! Do you not reflect that He created you from a drop, then determined your fate, then made the way easy for you, then caused you to die and buried you? Do you then deny Him when He says, “Then when He wills, He will resurrect you”? If you are not a denier, why do you not take precaution? If a Jew informed you regarding your most delicious food that it would harm you in your illness, you would abstain from it, leave it, and struggle against yourself concerning it. Were the words of the prophets, supported by miracles, and the words of God Almighty in His revealed books, of less effect upon you than the words of a Jew who informs you based on conjecture, guesswork, and supposition, with deficient intellect and limited knowledge? How strange! If a child informed you that there was a scorpion in your garment, you would cast off your garment immediately without demanding proof or evidence from him. Were the words of the prophets, scholars, sages, and all the saints of less weight to you than the words of a child from among the foolish? Or has the Fire of Hell, its shackles, chains, Zaqqum, cudgels, pus, poisonous winds, its serpents and scorpions become more trivial to you than a scorpion whose sting you would feel for only a day or less? These are not the actions of the rational. Indeed, if the beasts were to uncover your state, they would laugh at you and mock your intellect. If, O soul, you have come to know all this and believe in it, why do you procrastinate in action, when death lies in wait for you and may snatch you without warning? By what means have you felt secure from the hastening of the appointed term? Suppose you were promised a reprieve of a hundred years—do you think that one who feeds his mount at the base of a steep pass will succeed and be able to traverse the pass with it? If you think so, how great is your ignorance! Consider if a man traveled abroad to seek knowledge, yet remained there for years idle and inactive, promising himself to seek knowledge in the final year upon his return to his homeland—would you not laugh at his intellect and his supposition that instructing the soul is something to be hoped for in a short period, or his assumption that the stations of the learned are attained without study, relying on the generosity of God, glorified and exalted? Then suppose that effort at the end of life is beneficial and leads to the highest degrees—perhaps today is the last day of your life, so why are you not occupied with that? If it is suggested to you that there is a reprieve, what prevents you from hastening, and what incites you to procrastination? Does it have any cause except your inability to oppose your desires due to the toil and hardship therein? Do you await a day that will come to you in which opposing desires is not difficult? That day has not been created.

God never creates anything without it being surrounded by hardships, nor are hardships ever light upon the souls, and this is impossible to exist. Do you not reflect on how long you have been postponing yourself, saying "tomorrow, tomorrow"? Tomorrow has come and become today, so how have you found it? Do you not know that the tomorrow which came and became today had the same ruling as yesterday? Nay, what you are incapable of today, you will be even more incapable of tomorrow, because desire is like a firmly rooted tree that enslaves the servant by uprooting it. If the servant is unable to uproot it due to weakness and delays it, he is like one who, while young and strong, is unable to uproot a tree and postpones it for another year, knowing that the passage of time increases the tree's strength and firmness, and increases the uprooter's weakness and frailty. What one is incapable of in youth, one is never capable of in old age. Rather, disciplining the aged is from the utmost hardship, and taming the wolf is from torment. A fresh branch accepts bending, but when it dries and time passes over it, it no longer accepts that. If you, O soul, do not understand these clear matters and lean towards procrastination, then why do you claim wisdom? And what foolishness exceeds this foolishness? Perhaps you say: "Nothing prevents me from uprightness except my craving for the pleasures of desires and my lack of patience for pains and hardships." How severe is your ignorance and how ugly your excuse! If you are truthful in that, then seek enjoyment in desires pure from perpetual impurities, lasting for all eternity, and there is no hope for that except in Paradise. If you are looking to your desire, then looking to it in opposing it is like a single bite that prevents many bites. And what do you say about a sick intellect, when the doctor advises it to leave cold water for three days to become healthy and enjoy a drink for its entire life, and informs it that if it drinks that, it will fall into a chronic illness and be deprived of drinking for its entire life? What does reason dictate regarding fulfilling the right of desire? Should it be patient for three days to enjoy for a lifetime, or fulfill its desire immediately, fearing the pain of opposition for three days, until the pain of opposition becomes obligatory for three hundred days, three thousand days, and all your life? Compared to eternity, which is the duration of the bliss of the people of Paradise and the punishment of the people of Hell, it is less than three days compared to an entire lifetime, even if its duration is long. I wonder, is the pain of abstaining from desires greater in intensity and longer in duration, or the pain of the Fire in the depths of Hell? He who cannot bear the pain of struggle, how can he bear the pain of God's punishment? I see you only neglect to look to yourself due to hidden disbelief or evident folly. As for hidden disbelief, it is the weakness of your faith in the Day of Reckoning and your lack of knowledge of the greatness of the magnitude of reward and punishment. As for evident folly, it is your reliance on the generosity of God Almighty and His pardon without paying attention to His severity, His enticement, and His independence from your worship, while you do not rely on His generosity for a morsel of bread, a grain of wealth, or a single word you hear from creation. Rather, you strive for your goal in that with all schemes, and with this ignorance you deserve the title of foolishness from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, when he said: "The intelligent one is he who holds himself accountable and works for what is after death, and the foolish one is he who follows his soul its desires and wishes upon God wishes." Woe to you, O soul! It is not fitting that the worldly life deceive you, nor that deception by God deceive you. So look to yourself, for you are not commanded with an important matter for others, and do not waste your times, for breaths are counted. So when a breath passes from you, a part of you has gone. So seize health before illness, leisure before occupation, wealth before poverty, youth before old age, and life before death, and prepare for the Hereafter according to the extent of your stay in it, O soul. Do you not prepare for winter according to the length of its duration, gathering for it provision, clothing, firewood, and all means, and you do not rely in that on the grace of God and His generosity to repel the cold from you without a cloak, felt, firewood, and the like, for He is capable of that? Do you think, O soul, that the intense cold of Hell is lighter in cold and shorter in duration than the cold of winter? Or do you think that is less than this? No, it is not so, nor is there any similarity between them in intensity and coldness. Do you think that the servant is saved from it without striving? Far be it! Just as the cold of winter is not repelled except by a cloak, fire, and all means, so the heat of the Fire and its cold are not repelled except by the fortress of monotheism and the trench of obedience. The generosity of God Almighty lies in that He made known to you the way of fortification and facilitated for you its means, not in that He repels punishment from you without its fortress. Just as the generosity of God Almighty in repelling the cold of winter is that He created fire and guided you to the way of extracting it from between iron and stone so that you may repel with it the cold of winter from yourself, and just as purchasing firewood and a cloak is something your Creator and Master is independent of, and you only purchase it for yourself.

For He created it as a means for your rest, yet your acts of obedience and striving are also something He has no need of; they are but your path to salvation. So whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it bears the burden. And Allah is free of need from all the worlds. Woe to you, O soul! Cast off your ignorance and measure your Hereafter by your worldly life. He did not create you nor resurrect you except as a single soul. "And as We began the first creation, We will repeat it." And "As He originated you, so you will return." And the established way of Allah, you will find no change for it, nor any alteration. Woe to you, O soul! I see you have become accustomed to the world and found comfort in it, so parting from it is difficult for you, while you are advancing toward meeting it, and you confirm in your soul affection for it. Know well that you are heedless of Allah's punishment and reward, and of the terrors of the Resurrection and its states. Are you not a believer in death, which separates you from your delights? Do you think that one who enters the abode of a king to exit from the other side, yet casts his gaze upon a beautiful face knowing it will consume his heart, then is compelled inevitably to part from it—is he counted among the wise or the foolish? Do you not know that the world is the abode of the King of kings, and you have therein only passage? Everything in it does not accompany the passers-by after death. Therefore, the Master of Mankind, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: Love whom you love, for you shall part from him; and do what you will, for you shall be recompensed for it; and live as you wish, for you shall die." The hadith "Indeed, the Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: Love whom you love, for you shall part from him" precedes in knowledge and other matters. Woe to you, O soul! Do you not know that everyone who turns to the pleasures of the world and finds comfort in it, while death is behind him, only increases in regret at the parting, and only takes provision of the deadly poison, unknowingly? Or do you not look at those who have passed—how they built and rose high, then departed and were left behind, and how Allah made their lands and homes an inheritance for their enemies? Do you not see how they gather what they do not eat, build what they do not inhabit, and hope for what they do not attain? Each one builds a palace raised toward the sky, while his abode is a grave dug under the earth. Is there in the world any folly and reversal greater than this? One cultivates his worldly life while he is departing from it with certainty, and ruins his Hereafter while he is bound for it without doubt. Are you not ashamed, O soul, of assisting these fools in their folly? Consider that you are not possessed of insight to be guided to these matters; rather, you are inclined by nature to imitation and following. So measure the intellect of the prophets, the scholars, and the wise against the intellect of those bent upon the world, and follow from the two groups the one who is wiser in your sight, if you believe in your soul's intellect and intelligence. O soul, how astonishing is your affair, how severe your ignorance, how manifest your rebellion! I am amazed at you—how are you blind to these clear, momentous matters? Perhaps, O soul, the love of status has intoxicated you and distracted you from understanding them. Or do you not reflect that status has no meaning except the inclination of hearts from some people toward you? Consider that if everyone on the face of the earth prostrated to you and obeyed you, do you not know that after fifty years, neither you nor anyone on the face of the earth who worshipped you and prostrated to you will remain? And a time will come when neither your mention nor the mention of those who mentioned you will remain, just as it came upon the kings who were before you. "Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a whisper?" So how do you sell, O soul, what remains for all eternity for what does not remain more than fifty years—if that much—if you were a king of the earth and the east and west submitted to you, until necks yielded to you and means were arranged for you? How, when your turning away and wretchedness refuse to let the affair of your own dwelling, let alone your locality, be secure for you? If you, O soul, do not abandon the world out of desire for the Hereafter due to your ignorance and blindness of insight, then why do you not abandon it out of loftiness above the baseness of its associates, and purity from the abundance of its toil, and caution from the swiftness of its perishing? Or why do you not show asceticism toward its little when much of it has shown asceticism toward you? And why do you rejoice in a world that, if it assists you, your land is not devoid of a group of Jews and Magians who precede you in it and surpass you in its bliss and adornment? Fie upon a world in which these lowly ones precede you! How ignorant you are, how base your aspiration, how worthless your opinion, that you desired to be in the ranks of the close ones among the prophets and the truthful, in the proximity of the Lord of the worlds for all eternity, but instead chose to be in the row of the sandals among the fools and the ignorant for a few days? What regret upon you if you lose both the world and the religion! Hasten, woe to you, O soul, for you have approached destruction, death has drawn near, and the warner has arrived. Who will pray for you after death? Who will fast for you after death? Who will seek to please your Lord for you after death? Woe to you, O soul! You have nothing but numbered days; they are your merchandise if you trade with them, yet you have wasted most of them. If you were to weep for the remainder of your life over what you have wasted of them, you would still be falling short in the right of your own soul—how then?

You have squandered what remains and persisted in your habits. Do you not know, O soul, that death is your appointment, the grave your home, dust your bed, and worms your companion, with the Great Terror before you? Do you not know, O soul, that the army of the dead is at your city's gate, awaiting you? They have all sworn solemn oaths not to depart from their place until they take you with them. Do you not know, O soul, that they wish to return to this world for a single day to make up for what they neglected, while you are in the midst of your security? A single day of your life, if sold to them for the entire world in all its fullness, they would purchase it if they could—yet you waste your days in heedlessness and idleness.

Woe to you, O soul! Are you not ashamed? You adorn your outward appearance for creation, yet you openly defy God in secret with grave sins. Do you feel shame before creation but not before the Creator? Woe to you! Is He the least significant of observers to you? Do you command people to good while you are stained with vices? You call to God while fleeing from Him, and remind others of God while you are forgetful of Him. Do you not know, O soul, that the sinner is more foul than filth, and filth cannot purify another? So how do you aspire to purify others when you are not pure yourself?

Woe to you, O soul! If you truly knew yourself, you would think that people are afflicted with calamity only because of your ill omen. Woe to you, O soul! You have made yourself a donkey for Satan, who leads you wherever he wishes and makes sport of you—and with all this, you marvel at your deeds, though they contain such faults that if you escaped from them head for head, profit would be in your hands. How can you marvel at your deeds amidst the multitude of your sins and slips, when God cursed Satan for a single sin after he had worshipped Him for two hundred thousand years, and expelled Adam from Paradise for a single sin despite him being His prophet and chosen one?

Woe to you, O soul! How treacherous you are! Woe to you, O soul! How brazen you are! Woe to you, O soul! How ignorant you are, and how bold in disobedience! Woe to you! How many pledges do you make only to break them? How many covenants do you undertake only to betray them? Woe to you, O soul! Do you busy yourself with these sins while building your worldly life as if you will never depart from it? Do you not look at the people of the graves—how they amassed much, built lofty structures, and hoped for distant goals? Then their amassing became ruin, their buildings became graves, and their hopes became delusion.

Woe to you, O soul! Do you not take a lesson from them? Do you not cast a glance toward them? Do you suppose they were called to the Hereafter while you are among the eternal dwellers? Far, far from it! Evil is what you imagine. You are only in the process of demolishing your life since you fell from your mother's womb. So build your palace upon the face of the earth, for her belly will soon be your grave.

Do you not fear that when the soul reaches the collarbones, the messengers of your Lord will descend upon you with blackened faces and grim countenances, bearing tidings of torment? Will remorse benefit you then, or will sorrow be accepted from you, or will weeping earn you mercy? The utmost wonder is from you, O soul, that despite this you claim insight and acumen. Among your acuities is that you rejoice every day at the increase of your wealth but do not grieve at the decrease of your life. What benefit is wealth that increases while life decreases?

Woe to you, O soul! You turn away from the Hereafter while it advances toward you, and you turn toward this world while it turns away from you. How many receive a day they do not complete, and how many hope for a morrow they do not attain? You witness this among your brothers, relatives, and neighbors—you see their regret at death, yet you do not turn back from your ignorance. So beware, O wretched soul, of a day when God has sworn by Himself not to leave a servant whom He commanded and forbade in this world without questioning him about his deeds, minute and major, secret and public. Consider, O soul, with what body you will stand before God, and with what tongue you will answer. Prepare an answer for the questioning, and correctness for the answer.

Work the remainder of your life in short days for long days, in an abode of vanishing for an abode of permanence, in an abode of sorrow and toil for an abode of bliss and eternity. Work before you can work no more. Depart from the world by choice, as the free depart, before you are forced to depart from it. Do not rejoice in what assists you of the world's fleeting blossoms, for many a joyous one is cheated, and many a cheated one is unaware. Woe to him for whom woe is destined, yet he does not perceive—he laughs, rejoices, plays, sports, eats, and drinks, while it has been decreed for him in the Book of God that he is fuel for the Fire.

So let your view of the world, O soul, be for reflection, your striving for it out of necessity, your rejection of it by choice, and your pursuit of the Hereafter with haste. Do not be among those who are incapable of gratitude for what they have been given, yet seek increase in what remains, who forbid people yet do not desist themselves.

Know, O soul, that there is no substitute for religion, no replacement for faith, and no successor for the body. Whoever's mount is night and day, he is being carried along whether he travels or not. So take admonition, O soul, from this exhortation, and accept this counsel, for whoever turns away from admonition has accepted the Fire—and I do not see you content with it, nor receptive to this exhortation. If hardness prevents you from accepting admonition...

So seek My aid against it through persistent night prayers and standing in devotion. If it does not cease, then through continual fasting. If it still does not cease, then through minimizing social interaction and speech. If it persists, then through maintaining family ties and showing kindness to orphans. If it remains, then know that God has sealed your heart and locked it, and that the darkness of sins has accumulated over its exterior and interior. So reconcile yourself to the Fire, for God has created Paradise and created its people, and He has created Hellfire and created its people. Each is facilitated for what he was created for. If there remains in you no room for admonition, then despair of yourself—and despair is a grave among the gravest sins; we seek refuge in God from that. You have no path to despair, nor do you have a path to hope while the ways of goodness are blocked to you, for that is delusion, not hope.

Now consider: does grief seize you over this calamity with which you have been tested? Does your eye permit a tear of mercy from you for yourself? If it permits, then the source of tears is from the ocean of mercy—there remains in you a place for hope. So persist in lamentation and weeping, and seek help from the Most Merciful of the merciful, and complain to the Most Generous of the generous, and be constant in seeking succor. Do not grow weary of prolonged complaint, perhaps He will have mercy on your weakness and come to your aid. For your calamity has grown great, your affliction has intensified, your persistence has lengthened, and stratagems have been cut off from you, and excuses have departed from you. There is no course, no pursuit, no one to beseech for aid, no escape, no refuge, and no salvation except to your Master. So flee to Him with humble supplication, and be submissive in your supplication to the extent of the greatness of your ignorance and the multitude of your sins, for He has mercy on the humble supplicant, aids the desperate seeker, and answers the call of the distressed. Today you have become to Him distressed and in need of His mercy. The ways have narrowed for you, the paths have been blocked against you, stratagems have been cut off from you, admonitions have not succeeded with you, and reproach has not broken you. The One sought is Noble, the One asked is Generous, the One beseeched for aid is Kind and Compassionate. Mercy is vast, generosity overflowing, and forgiveness all-encompassing.

And I say: O Most Merciful of the merciful, O Compassionate, O Merciful, O Forbearing, O Magnificent, O Generous! I am the sinful, the persistent. I am the bold who does not desist. I am the one who persists without shame. This is the station of the poor, humble supplicant, the wretched and needy, the weak and lowly, the perishing and drowning. Hasten my relief and my deliverance, show me the traces of Your mercy, let me taste the coolness of Your pardon and forgiveness, and grant me the strength of Your majesty, O Most Merciful of the merciful.

Following the example of your father Adam, peace be upon him—Wahb ibn Munabbih said: When God sent Adam down from Paradise to the earth, he remained with unceasing tears. On the seventh day, God the Exalted looked upon him while he was sorrowful, grieved, and anguished, his head lowered. God Almighty revealed to him: "O Adam, what is this hardship I see upon you?" He said: "O Lord, my calamity is great, my sin has encompassed me, and I have been expelled from the dominion of my Lord. So I am now in the abode of humiliation after honor, in the abode of misery after happiness, in the abode of toil after rest, in the abode of trial after well-being, in the abode of transience after permanence, and in the abode of death and annihilation after immortality and permanence. How can I not weep over my sin?" Then God Almighty revealed to him: "O Adam, did I not choose you for Myself, settle you in My abode, and single you out with My honor? Did I not warn you of My displeasure? Did I not create you with My hand, breathe into you of My spirit, and command My angels to prostrate to you? Yet you disobeyed My command, forgot My covenant, and exposed yourself to My wrath. By My might and majesty, if I filled the earth with men all like you, worshipping Me and glorifying Me, then they disobeyed Me, I would bring them down to the abode of the disobedient." At that, Adam, peace be upon him, wept for three hundred years.

And 'Ubaydullah al-Bajali, who wept much, would say in his weeping throughout his long nights: "My God, I am the one whose sins increase as my life lengthens. I am the one who, whenever I intend to abandon a sin, another desire presents itself. O 'Ubaydullah, a sin has not yet worn out, and its companion is seeking another. O 'Ubaydullah, if Hellfire is your resting place and refuge... O 'Ubaydullah, if the maces are prepared for your head... O 'Ubaydullah, You have fulfilled the needs of the seekers, yet perhaps your own need will not be fulfilled."

And Mansur ibn 'Ammar said: I heard in one of the nights in Kufa a worshipper confiding to his Lord, saying: "O Lord, by Your might, I did not intend by disobeying You to oppose You, nor did I disobey You while I was ignorant of Your place, nor exposing myself to Your punishment, nor taking Your gaze lightly. But my soul made it seem fair to me, and my wretchedness aided me in that, and Your extended veil of protection deceived me. So I disobeyed You out of ignorance and opposed You by my action. So from Your punishment now, who will rescue me? Or by whose rope shall I hold fast if You cut Your rope from me? Woe to me from standing before You tomorrow when it is said to the light ones: 'Pass,' and to the heavy-laden: 'Be cast down.' Shall I pass with the light ones, or be cast down with the heavy-laden? Woe to me, as my age increases, my sins multiply. Woe to me, as my life lengthens, my transgressions increase. Until when shall I repent? Until when shall I return? Is it not time for me to feel shame before my Lord?"

These are the ways of the people in confiding to their Master.

Admonishing their souls, yet their aim in intimate discourse is to seek contentment, and their purpose in admonition is to awaken and alert. Whoever neglects admonition and intimate discourse fails to watch over his own soul, and it is likely that God, exalted be He, will not be pleased with him. Peace. Then the book of self-reckoning and vigilance will be followed by the book of reflection, if God, exalted be He, wills. Praise be to God alone, and His blessings upon our master Muhammad, his family, and his companions, and His peace.
