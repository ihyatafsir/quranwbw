The Book of Invocations and Supplications
Being the Ninth Book of the Quarter of Worship
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, whose compassion is all-encompassing and whose mercy is universal, who rewards His servants for their remembrance of Him with His remembrance of them, as He, the Exalted, has said: "So remember Me; I will remember you." And He has encouraged them to ask and supplicate by His command, saying: "Call upon Me; I will respond to you." Thus, He has given hope to the obedient and the disobedient, the near and the far, to turn expansively towards the presence of His Majesty by raising their needs and aspirations, through His words: "For indeed, I am near. I respond to the call of the caller when he calls upon Me." And blessings be upon Muhammad, the master of His prophets, and upon his family and his companions, the choicest of His chosen ones, with abundant peace.

[Now then,] After the recitation of the Book of God, the Mighty and Majestic, there is no act of worship performed by the tongue more excellent than the remembrance of God, the Exalted, and the raising of needs through supplications sincerely directed to God, the Exalted. It is therefore necessary to explain the virtue of remembrance in general, then in detail regarding specific invocations, and to explain the virtue of supplication, its conditions, its etiquettes, and to transmit the narrated comprehensive supplications for the objectives of religion and worldly life, and the specific supplications for seeking forgiveness, seeking refuge, and others. The intended purpose of this will be clarified by mentioning five chapters.
Chapter One: On the virtue and benefit of remembrance, in general and in detail.
Chapter Two: On the virtue of supplication, its etiquettes, and the virtue of seeking forgiveness and sending blessings upon the Messenger of God.
Chapter Three: On narrated supplications attributed to their sources and their occasions.
Chapter Four: On selected supplications, with their chains of transmission omitted, from the narrated supplications.
Chapter Five: On the narrated supplications for when events occur.

(Chapter One: On the virtue and benefit of remembrance in general and in detail, from verses, reports, and traditions.)

Indicating the general virtue of remembrance from the verses is the saying of He, the Glorified and Exalted: "So remember Me; I will remember you." Thabit al-Bunani, may God have mercy on him, said: "I know when my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, will remember me." They were alarmed by this and said, "How do you know that?" He replied, "When I remember Him, He remembers me." And He, the Exalted, said: "And remember God with much remembrance." And He, the Exalted, said: "And when you depart from 'Arafat, remember God at the sacred monument and remember Him as He has guided you." And He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: "And when you have completed your rites, remember God like your remembrance of your fathers or with greater remembrance." And He, the Exalted, said: "Those who remember God while standing or sitting or on their sides." And He, the Exalted, said: "And when you have completed the prayer, remember God standing or sitting or on your sides." Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Meaning by night and day, on land and sea, while traveling and resident, in wealth and poverty, in sickness and health, in secret and openly." And He, the Exalted, said in censure of the hypocrites: "And they do not remember God except a little." And He, the Mighty and Majestic, said: "And remember your Lord within yourself in humility and in fear and without loudness in words in the morning and the evening. And do not be among the heedless." And He, the Exalted, said: "And the remembrance of God is greater." Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "It has two aspects: one is that God's remembrance of you is greater than your remembrance of Him; the other is that the remembrance of God is greater than every other act of worship besides it," and other such verses.

As for the reports: The Messenger of God said: "One who remembers God among the heedless is like a tree in the midst of dry tinder." And he said: "One who remembers God among the heedless is like a fighter among those who flee." And he said: "God, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'I am with My servant as long as he remembers Me and his lips move with My mention.'" And he said: "No deed performed by a son of Adam is more saving for him from the punishment of God than the remembrance of God, the Mighty and Majestic." They said, "O Messenger of God, not even jihad in the cause of God?" He said, "Not even jihad in the cause of God, unless you strike with your sword until it breaks, then you strike with it until it breaks, then you strike with it until it breaks." Then he said: "Whoever loves to graze in the meadows of Paradise, let him increase in the remembrance of God, the Mighty and Majestic." The Messenger of God was asked, "Which deeds are best?" He said: "That you die while your tongue is moist with the remembrance of God, the Mighty and Majestic." And he said: "Begin the morning and end the evening with your tongue moist from the remembrance of God, and you will begin and end with no sin upon you." And he said: "The remembrance of God, the Mighty and Majestic, in the morning and the evening is better than shattering swords in the cause of God and than giving wealth profusely." And he said: "God, Blessed and Exalted, says: 'When My servant remembers Me within himself, I remember him within Myself. When he remembers Me in an assembly, I remember him in an assembly better than his. When he draws near to Me by a handspan, I draw near to him by an arm's length. When he draws near to Me by an arm's length, I draw near to him by a fathom. When he comes to Me walking, I come to him rushing.'" Meaning by rushing.

The swiftness of response. And He ﷺ said: "Seven whom Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will shade in His shade on a day when there is no shade except His shade: among them is a man who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes overflow out of awe of Allah." And Abu al-Darda' said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Shall I not inform you of the best of your deeds, the purest in the sight of your Sovereign, the highest in your ranks, better for you than giving gold and silver, and better for you than meeting your enemy and striking their necks and they strike your necks?" They said: "And what is that, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "The constant remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic." And He ﷺ said: "Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: 'Whoever is occupied by My remembrance from asking of Me, I will give him the best of what I give to those who ask.'"

As for the narrations: Al-Fudayl said: It reached us that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: "My servant, remember Me for an hour after the dawn and for an hour after the afternoon, and I will suffice you for what is between them." And some of the scholars said: "Indeed Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'Whichever servant I look upon his heart and see that predominant in it is holding fast to My remembrance, I take charge of his management, and I become his companion, his interlocutor, and his intimate friend.'" And al-Hasan said: "Remembrance is of two kinds: the remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, between yourself and Allah—how excellent it is and how great its reward!—and better than that is the remembrance of Allah, Glorified is He, regarding what Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden." And it is narrated that every soul that leaves the world is thirsty except the one who remembers Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. And Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The people of Paradise will not regret anything except an hour that passed them by in which they did not remember Allah, Glorified is He." And Allah, the Exalted, knows best.

(The Virtue of Gatherings of Remembrance)
The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "No people sit in a gathering remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, except that the angels surround them, mercy envelops them, and Allah, the Exalted, mentions them among those with Him." And He ﷺ said: "There is no group of people who gather remembering Allah, the Exalted, desiring nothing by it except His Face, except that a caller calls out to them from the heavens: 'Rise, forgiven! Your bad deeds have been exchanged for good deeds.'" And He also ﷺ said: "No people sit in a sitting in which they do not remember Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, and do not send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ, except that it will be a regret for them on the Day of Resurrection." And Dawud ﷺ said: "My God, if You see me passing by the gatherings of those who remember to the gatherings of the heedless, then break my leg before reaching them, for it is a blessing You have bestowed upon me." And He ﷺ said: "A righteous gathering atones for the believer two thousand gatherings of evil." And Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Indeed the people of the heaven see the houses of the people of the earth in which the name of Allah, the Exalted, is mentioned as the stars are seen." And Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "When a group gathers remembering Allah, the Exalted, Satan and the world withdraw. Satan says to the world: 'Do you not see what they are doing?' The world says: 'Leave them, for when they disperse, I will take them by their necks to you.'" And from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that when he entered the market and said: "I see you here, while the inheritance of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is being distributed in the mosque." So the people went to the mosque and left the market, but they did not see any inheritance being distributed. They said: "O Abu Hurayrah, we did not see any inheritance being distributed in the mosque." He said: "Then what did you see?" They said: "We saw people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, and reciting the Qur'an." He said: "That is the inheritance of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ." And al-A'mash narrated from Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, from him ﷺ, that he said: "Indeed Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has angels who roam the earth apart from the scribes of the people. When they find a people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out: 'Come to what you seek!' So they come and surround them up to the heaven. Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, says: 'What have you left My servants doing?' They say: 'We left them praising You, glorifying You, and declaring Your perfection.' Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, says: 'Have they seen Me?' They say: 'No.' He, Majestic is His Majesty, says: 'How would it be if they saw Me?' They say: 'If they saw You, they would be more intense in declaring Your perfection, praising You, and glorifying You.' He says to them: 'From what do they seek refuge?' They say: 'From the Fire.' He, the Exalted, says: 'Have they seen it?' They say: 'No.' Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'How would it be if they saw it?' They say: 'If they saw it, they would flee from it more intensely and recoil from it more intensely.' Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'And what do they seek?' They say: 'Paradise.' He, the Exalted, says: 'Have they seen it?' They say: 'No.' He, the Exalted, says: 'How would it be if they saw it?' They say: 'If they saw it, they would be more eager for it.' He, Majestic is His Majesty, says: 'I call you to witness that I have forgiven them.' They say: 'Among them was so-and-so; he did not intend them, he only came for a need.' Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'They are the people whose companion is not wretched.'"

(The Virtue of Saying 'La ilaha illa Allah')
He ﷺ said: "The best thing that I and the prophets before me have said is: 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner.'" And He ﷺ said: "Whoever says: 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise..."

He is over all things competent. Whoever says it one hundred times each day, it will be for him equal to freeing ten slaves, and one hundred good deeds will be recorded for him, and one hundred bad deeds will be erased from him, and it will be a protection for him from Satan that day until evening. And no one comes with anything better than what he came with except one who does more than that. And He (peace be upon him) said: "There is no servant who performs ablution and perfects it, then raises his gaze to the sky and says, 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger,' except that the gates of Paradise are opened for him, and he may enter through whichever he wishes." And He (peace be upon him) said: "The people of 'There is no god but Allah' will have no loneliness in their graves nor at their resurrection. It is as if I see them at the blast shaking the dust from their heads, saying, 'Praise be to Allah who has removed sorrow from us; indeed, our Lord is Forgiving, Appreciative.'" And He (peace be upon him) also said to Abu Hurairah: "O Abu Hurairah, every good deed you do will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection except the testimony that there is no god but Allah, for it is not placed on a scale. If it were placed on a scale for one who says it sincerely, and the seven heavens and the seven earths and all within them were placed, 'There is no god but Allah' would outweigh it." And He (peace be upon him) said: "If one were to come saying 'There is no god but Allah' sincerely, with sins filling the earth, Allah would forgive him that." And He (peace be upon him) said: "O Abu Hurairah, prompt the dying with the testimony that there is no god but Allah, for it demolishes sins utterly." I said: "O Messenger of Allah, this is for the dying, so what about the living?" He (peace be upon him) said: "It is even more demolishing, even more demolishing." And He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' sincerely will enter Paradise." And He (peace be upon him) said: "You will all enter Paradise except whoever refuses and strays from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, as a camel strays from its owner." It was said: "O Messenger of Allah, who is it that refuses and strays from Allah?" He said: "Whoever does not say 'There is no god but Allah.'" So increase in saying 'There is no god but Allah' before you are prevented from it, for it is the word of monotheism, the word of sincerity, the word of piety, the good word, the call of truth, the firmest handhold, and the price of Paradise. And Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: "Is the reward for good [anything] but good?" It was said that the good in this world is saying 'There is no god but Allah' and in the Hereafter, Paradise. Likewise is His saying, the Exalted: "For those who do good is the best [reward] and extra." And Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib reported that He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent' ten times, it will be for him equal to freeing a slave, or he said, a soul." And 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb reported from his father, from his grandfather, that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says in a day two hundred times, 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent,' no one before him will have preceded him, and no one after him will catch up to him, except one who does a deed better than his deed." And He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says in a marketplace, 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent,' Allah will record for him a million good deeds and erase from him a million bad deeds and build for him a house in Paradise." And it is reported: "Indeed, when a servant says 'There is no god but Allah,' it comes to his record and does not pass by a sin except it erases it until it finds a good deed like it and sits beside it." And in the Sahih, from Ayyub, from the Prophet (peace be upon him), that he said: "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent' ten times, it is as if he freed four persons from the descendants of Ishmael (peace be upon him)." And also in the Sahih, from 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, from the Prophet (peace be upon him), that he said: "Whoever wakes at night and says, 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent; glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great,' then says, 'O Allah, forgive me,' he will be forgiven, or if he supplicates, it will be answered for him; then if he performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted."

(The Virtue of Glorification, Praise, and the Remaining Remembrances)
He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever glorifies Allah after every prayer thirty-three times, praises Him thirty-three times, and magnifies Him thirty-three times, and completes the hundred with 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, to Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent,' his sins will be forgiven even if they were like the foam of the sea." And He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says 'Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him' one hundred times in a day, his sins will be removed even if they were like the foam of the sea." And it is reported: "A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and said: 'The world has turned away from me and my means have become few.' So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 'Where are you from the prayer of the angels and the glorification of the creation, and by it they are provided?' I said: 'And what is it, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'Say: Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him, glory be to Allah the Most Great, I seek forgiveness from Allah.'"

Reciting one hundred times between the dawn's emergence and the Fajr prayer, the world will come to you subdued and humbled, and Allah the Exalted will create from each word an angel who glorifies Allah until the Day of Resurrection, its reward being for you. And He said: When a servant says 'Alhamdulillah' (All praise is for Allah), it fills what is between the heaven and the earth. When he says 'Alhamdulillah' a second time, it fills what is between the seventh heaven and the lowest earth. When he says 'Alhamdulillah' a third time, Allah the Exalted says: Ask, and you shall be given. And Rifa'ah al-Zarqi said: We were praying behind the Messenger of Allah one day, and when he raised his head from the bowing and said 'Sami' Allahu liman hamidah' (Allah hears the one who praises Him), a man behind the Messenger of Allah said: 'Rabbana lakal-hamd, hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fih' (Our Lord, to You is all praise, abundant, pure, and blessed praise). When the Messenger of Allah concluded his prayer, he said: Who was the speaker just now? The man said: I, O Messenger of Allah. He said: I saw more than thirty angels rushing to be the first to record it. And the Messenger of Allah said: The enduring righteous deeds are: 'La ilaha illa Allah' (There is no god but Allah), 'Subhan Allah' (Glory be to Allah), 'Alhamdulillah' (All praise is for Allah), 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is the Greatest), and 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' (There is no power nor strength except with Allah). And He said: There is no man on earth who says 'La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu Akbar, Subhan Allah, Alhamdulillah, La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' except that his sins are forgiven, even if they were like the foam of the sea. Narrated by Ibn 'Umar. And Nu'man ibn Bashir narrated from him that he said: Those who mention the majesty of Allah, glorify Him, declare His greatness, and praise Him, they encircle the Throne with a humming like the humming of bees, mentioning their companion. Does not one of you love to have with Allah something by which he is remembered? And Abu Hurairah narrated that he said: For me to say 'Subhan Allah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu Akbar' is dearer to me than all that the sun rises upon. In another narration, he added 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' and said it is better than the world and all it contains. And He said: The speech most beloved to Allah the Exalted are four: 'Subhan Allah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu Akbar.' It will not harm you with which of them you begin. Narrated by Samurah ibn Jundub. And Abu Malik al-Ash'ari narrated that the Messenger of Allah used to say: Purity is half of faith, and 'Alhamdulillah' fills the Scale, and 'Subhan Allah' and 'Allahu Akbar' fill what is between the heaven and the earth. And prayer is light, charity is proof, patience is illumination, and the Qur'an is an argument for you or against you. Every person goes forth, either selling his soul, thus destroying it, or purchasing it, thus setting it free. And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of Allah said: Two phrases are light on the tongue, heavy on the Scale, and beloved to the Most Merciful: 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdih, Subhan Allahil-'Adheem' (Glory be to Allah and with His praise, Glory be to Allah the Almighty). And Abu Dharr said: I said to the Messenger of Allah: Which speech is most beloved to Allah the Exalted? He said: What Allah has chosen for His angels: 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdih, Subhan Allahil-'Adheem.' And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of Allah said: Indeed, Allah the Exalted has chosen from speech: 'Subhan Allah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu Akbar.' So when a servant says 'Subhan Allah,' twenty good deeds are recorded for him and twenty bad deeds are removed. And when he says 'Allahu Akbar,' it is likewise. And he mentioned the rest of the phrases. And Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah said: Whoever says 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdih,' a palm tree is planted for him in Paradise. And from Abu Dharr, he said: The poor said to the Messenger of Allah: The wealthy have taken the rewards; they pray as we pray, fast as we fast, and give charity from their surplus wealth. He said: Has He not given you something to give in charity? Indeed, every glorification is charity, every praise is charity, every declaration of His Oneness is charity, every declaration of His greatness is charity, enjoining good is charity, forbidding evil is charity, and one of you placing a morsel in the mouth of his family is charity for him, and in one's intimate relations is charity. They said: O Messenger of Allah, does one of us fulfill his desire and have a reward for it? He said: What do you think if he placed it in something forbidden, would he bear a sin for it? They said: Yes. He said: Likewise, if he places it in what is lawful, he has a reward for it. And Abu Dharr said: I said to the Messenger of Allah: The people of wealth have surpassed us in reward; they say as we say and spend, but we do not spend. The Messenger of Allah said: Shall I not guide you to a deed by which, if you do it, you will catch up with those before you and surpass those after you, except one who says as you say? Glorify Allah after every prayer thirty-three times, praise Him thirty-three times, and declare His greatness thirty-four times. And Busrah narrated from the Prophet that he said: Upon you is glorification, declaration of His Oneness, and sanctification; do not be heedless, and count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak. Meaning, with the testimony on the Day of Resurrection. And Ibn 'Umar said: I saw him counting the glorification. And he said in what Abu...

Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: When a servant says, 'There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest,' Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says, 'My servant has spoken the truth; there is no god but Me, and I am the Greatest.' And when the servant says, 'There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner,' the Exalted says, 'My servant has spoken the truth; there is no god but Me alone, with no partner.' And when he says, 'There is no god but Allah, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah,' Allah, Glorified is He, says, 'My servant has spoken the truth; there is no power nor strength except with Me.' And whoever says these at the time of death, the Fire will not touch him.

Mus'ab ibn Sa'd reported from his father that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Is any one of you incapable of earning a thousand good deeds each day?" It was said, "How is that, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Let him glorify Allah a hundred times, and a thousand good deeds will be recorded for him, and a thousand sins will be erased from him."

And he said, "O 'Abdullah ibn Qis, or O Abu Musa, shall I not guide you to a treasure from the treasures of Paradise?" He said, "Certainly." He said, "Say: There is no power nor strength except with Allah." In another narration: "Shall I not teach you a word from a treasure beneath the Throne: There is no power nor strength except with Allah."

Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Shall I not guide you to a deed from the treasures of Paradise beneath the Throne? Say: There is no power nor strength except with Allah. Allah, the Exalted, says, 'My servant has submitted and surrendered.'"

And he said, "Whoever says upon waking, 'I am pleased with Allah as my Lord, with Islam as my religion, with the Qur'an as my guide, and with Muhammad, peace be upon him, as my Prophet and Messenger,' it is a right upon Allah to please him on the Day of Resurrection." In another narration: Whoever says that, Allah is pleased with him.

Mujahid said: When a man leaves his house and says, 'In the name of Allah,' the angel says, 'You are guided.' And when he says, 'I place my trust in Allah,' the angel says, 'You are sufficed.' And when he says, 'There is no power nor strength except with Allah,' the angel says, 'You are protected.' Then the devils disperse from him, saying, 'What do you want with a man who has been guided, sufficed, and protected? You have no way to him.'

If you ask: Why is the remembrance of Allah, Glorified is He, despite its lightness on the tongue and the little exertion in it, superior and more beneficial than the totality of acts of worship with their many hardships? Know that the realization of this is only fitting for the knowledge of unveiling. The amount that can be mentioned in the science of spiritual conduct is that what is effective and beneficial is constant remembrance with the presence of the heart. As for remembrance with the tongue while the heart is heedless, it is of little benefit, and there are reports that indicate this as well. The presence of the heart for a moment in remembrance, and heedlessness of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, while being occupied with the world, is also of little benefit. Rather, the constant presence of the heart with Allah, the Exalted, or in most times, is what is given precedence over acts of worship. Indeed, through it, all other acts of worship are ennobled, and it is the ultimate fruit of practical worship.

Remembrance has a beginning and an end. Its beginning necessitates intimacy and love for Allah, and its end produces intimacy and love, and from it issues forth that intimacy and love, which is the objective. For the spiritual seeker at the beginning of his affair may be forcing himself to turn his heart and tongue from whisperings to the remembrance of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. If he is granted success in perseverance, he finds intimacy in it, and love for the One Remembered becomes implanted in his heart. One should not be astonished at this, for it is observable in customary affairs that mentioning an absent person not present before someone, and repeating the mention of his qualities to him, causes him to love him, and he may even fall in love through description and frequent mention. Then, if he falls in love through frequent, initially forced remembrance, he becomes compelled to frequent remembrance later, to the point that he cannot bear to be without it. For whoever loves something mentions it often, and whoever mentions something often, even if forced at first, comes to love it. Thus, the beginning of remembrance is forced until it yields intimacy with the One Remembered and love for Him. Then, later, patience from it becomes impossible, so the cause becomes the cause and the fruit yields fruit. This is the meaning of the saying of some: "I struggled with the Qur'an for twenty years, then I enjoyed it for twenty years." Enjoyment only issues from intimacy and love, and intimacy only issues from perseverance in struggle and forcing oneself for a long period until the forced becomes natural. How can this be considered far-fetched when a person may force himself to consume a food he initially finds repulsive, struggle to eat it, and persist in it until it becomes agreeable to his nature, to the point that he cannot bear to be without it? The soul is accustomed and capable of what it is forced to do. *The soul is what you habituate it to, it becomes accustomed.* That is, what you impose on it at first becomes its nature later.

Then, when intimacy with the remembrance of Allah, Glorified is He, is attained, one is cut off from other than the remembrance of Allah. And other than Allah, Mighty and Majestic, is what leaves him at death, so there remains with him in the grave no family, wealth, children, nor authority. Nothing remains except the remembrance of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. If he had found intimacy with it, he enjoys it and delights in the removal of the obstacles that diverted him from it, for the necessities of needs in worldly life distract from the remembrance of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. After death, no obstacle remains, so it is as if he is left alone with his Beloved. Thus, his bliss is immense, and he is freed from the prison in which he was prevented from that in which he found his intimacy. For this reason, he, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the Spirit of Holiness..."

It was whispered into my heart: "Love whom you will, for you shall part from them." This refers to all that pertains to the worldly life, for it perishes in relation to a person through death, as "All that is on it will perish, and there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor." The world perishes through death in relation to the individual until it perishes in its very essence when the Book's appointed term is reached. This intimacy is what the servant delights in after his death until he descends into the neighborhood of God, exalted and majestic, and ascends from remembrance to the encounter. This is after what is in the graves is scattered and what is in the breasts is laid bare. One should not deny the permanence of the remembrance of God, exalted and majestic, with him after death by saying, "He has been annihilated, so how can the remembrance of God remain with him?" For he has not been annihilated with an annihilation that prevents remembrance, but rather with an annihilation from the world and the realm of sovereignty and witnessing, not from the realm of the dominion. To what we have mentioned points the saying, "The grave is either a pit from the pits of Hellfire or a garden from the gardens of Paradise," and His saying, "The spirits of the martyrs are in the crops of green birds," and His saying regarding the slain polytheists of Badr, "O so-and-so, O so-and-so"—and the Prophet named them—"Have you found what your Lord promised to be true? For I have found what my Lord promised me to be true." 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, heard his saying and said, "O Messenger of God, how can they hear and how can they reply when they have become carrion?" He said, "By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you are not more hearing of my speech than they are, but they are not able to reply." The hadith is in the Sahih. This is his saying regarding the polytheists. As for the believers and the martyrs, he said, "Their spirits are in the crops of green birds, suspended beneath the Throne." This state and what is indicated by these expressions does not contradict the remembrance of God, exalted and majestic. And the Almighty has said, "And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of God as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision, rejoicing in what God has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those who have not yet joined them from behind them." Due to the nobility of the remembrance of God, exalted and majestic, the rank of martyrdom is magnified, for what is sought is the ending—and by the ending we mean bidding farewell to the world and arriving before God with a heart absorbed in God, exalted and majestic, severed from attachments to anything else. If a servant is able to make his concern wholly absorbed in God, exalted and majestic, he cannot die in that state except in the ranks of combat, for he has severed hope from his soul, his family, his wealth, and his children—indeed, from the entire world. For he desires it for his life, yet his heart has made light of his life for the love of God, exalted and majestic, and the pursuit of His pleasure. There is no greater devotion to God than that, and for this reason the matter of martyrdom is magnified, and therein have come virtues beyond enumeration. Among them is that when 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr al-Ansari was martyred on the day of Uhud, the Messenger of God said to Jabir, "Shall I not give you glad tidings, O Jabir?" He said, "Yes, may God give you glad tidings of good." He said, "God, exalted and majestic, revived your father and seated him before Him with no veil between them. The Almighty said, 'Ask of Me, O My servant, whatever you wish, I will grant it to you.' He said, 'O Lord, to return me to the world so that I may be killed for You and for Your Prophet once more.' The Almighty said, 'The decree has preceded from Me that they shall not return to it.'" Then, being killed is the cause of an ending upon such a state, for if he were not killed and remained for a period, perhaps the desires of the world would return to him and overcome what had taken possession of his heart from the remembrance of God, exalted and majestic. For this reason, the fear of the people of deep knowledge regarding the ending is great. For the heart, even if it is committed to the remembrance of God, exalted and majestic, is changeable; it is not free from turning to the desires of the world, nor is it free from a lapse that befalls it. If at the final moment something from the world is represented in his heart and takes possession of it, and he departs from the world in this state, it is likely that its possession of him will remain, so he will yearn for it after death and wish to return to the world. This is due to his scant portion in the Hereafter, for a person dies upon what he lived upon and is resurrected upon what he died upon. The safest state from this peril is the ending of martyrdom, for the martyr's intent was not to attain wealth or to be called brave or the like, as the report has come, but rather the love of God, exalted and majestic, and the elevation of His word. This is the state expressed by, "Indeed, God has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for Paradise." Such a person is the seller of the world for the Hereafter, and the state of the martyr corresponds to the meaning of your saying, "There is no god but God," for he has no object of pursuit other than God, exalted and majestic. Every object of pursuit is an object of worship, and every object of worship is a god. Thus, this martyr is saying by the state of his condition, "There is no god but God," for he has no object of pursuit other than Him. As for one who says that with his tongue but his condition does not support it, his affair is subject to the will of God, exalted and majestic, and peril is not averted in his case. For this reason, the Messenger of God favored the saying of "There is no god but God" over all other remembrances, and mentioned that absolutely in contexts of encouragement. Then he mentioned in some contexts of encouragement...

Then he mentioned in some places sincerity and devotion, saying at one point: Whoever says "There is no god but God" with devotion—and the meaning of devotion is the state supporting the statement. So we ask God Almighty to make us at the end among the people of "There is no god but God" in state and statement, outwardly and inwardly, until we bid farewell to the world not turning toward it but rather weary of it and loving the meeting with God. For whoever loves meeting God Almighty, God loves meeting him, and whoever dislikes meeting God, God dislikes meeting him. These are indications to the meanings of remembrance that cannot be surpassed in the science of spiritual conduct.

(The Second Chapter: On the Etiquettes of Supplication, Its Merit, and the Merit of Some Transmitted Supplications, and the Excellence of Seeking Forgiveness and Sending Blessings on the Messenger of God ﷺ)

(The Excellence of Supplication)

God Almighty said: "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me." (Quran 2:186) And He said: "Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. Indeed, He does not like transgressors." (Quran 7:55) And He said: "And your Lord says, 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you. Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell in humiliation.'" (Quran 40:60) And He, the Exalted, said: "Say, 'Call upon God or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call—to Him belong the best names.'" (Quran 17:110) And Nu'man ibn Bashir reported from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: "Supplication is worship," then he recited: "Call upon Me; I will respond to you." (Quran 40:60) And he ﷺ said: "Supplication is the essence of worship." And Abu Huraira reported that he ﷺ said: "Nothing is more honorable to God Almighty than supplication." And he ﷺ said: "The servant is not deprived of one of three things from supplication: either a sin forgiven, or good hastened, or good stored for him." And Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, said: "Enough for supplication with righteousness is what salt is to food." And he ﷺ said: "Ask God Almighty from His bounty, for God Almighty loves to be asked, and the best worship is awaiting relief."

(The Etiquettes of Supplication)

They are ten:

First: To watch for noble times for his supplication, such as the Day of Arafah in the year, Ramadan among the months, Friday in the week, and the pre-dawn hours of the night. God said: "And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness." (Quran 51:18) And the Prophet ﷺ said: "God Almighty descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains, saying: 'Who calls upon Me that I may answer him? Who asks of Me that I may give him? Who seeks My forgiveness that I may forgive him?'" And it is said that Jacob ﷺ said, "I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord," intending to supplicate at the pre-dawn time. It is said that he stood at the pre-dawn time supplicating while his sons affirmed behind him, and God Almighty revealed: "I have forgiven them and made them prophets." Second: To seize noble states. Abu Huraira, may God be pleased with him, said: "The gates of heaven are opened when ranks advance in the cause of God Almighty, when rain descends, and when the prescribed prayers are established, so seize supplication in them." And Mujahid said: "Prayer is set in the best of hours, so upon you is supplication after prayers." And the Prophet ﷺ said: "Supplication between the call to prayer and its establishment is not rejected." And he ﷺ also said: "The supplication of the fasting person is not rejected." And in truth, the nobility of times returns to the nobility of states as well, for the pre-dawn time is a time of clarity and sincerity of heart and freedom from distractions, and the Day of Arafah and Friday are times of gathering of intentions and cooperation of hearts in drawing forth the mercy of God Almighty. This is one reason for the nobility of times, aside from the secrets within them that humans are not privy to. And the state of prostration is also most deserving of response. Abu Huraira, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: "The closest a servant is to his Lord Almighty is when he is prostrating, so increase supplication in it." And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them, reported from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: "I have been forbidden from reciting the Quran while bowing or prostrating. As for bowing, magnify the Lord Almighty in it, and as for prostration, strive in supplication, for it is fitting that you be answered." Third: To supplicate facing the qiblah and raise his hands so that the whiteness of his armpits is seen. Jabir ibn Abdullah reported: "The Messenger of God ﷺ came to the standing at Arafah and faced the qiblah and continued supplicating until the sun set." And Salman said: The Messenger of God ﷺ said: "Indeed, your Lord is modest and generous, feeling shy from His servants when they raise their hands to Him to return them empty." And Anas reported: "He ﷺ would raise his hands until the whiteness of his armpits was seen in supplication, and he would not point with his fingers." And Abu Huraira, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet ﷺ passed by a person supplicating and pointing with his two index fingers, and he ﷺ said: 'One, one,' meaning limit to one." And Abu al-Darda, may God be pleased with him, said: "Raise these hands before

that he be bound with shackles, then it is fitting that he wipe his face with them at the end of the supplication. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when he stretched out his hands in supplication, would not withdraw them until he had wiped his face with them." And Ibn 'Abbas said: "He, peace be upon him, when he supplicated, would bring his palms together, placing their inner surfaces facing his face." These are the postures of the hands. And one should not raise his gaze to the sky. He, peace be upon him, said: "Let people cease raising their gazes to the sky during supplication, or their eyesight will surely be snatched away." Fourth: lowering the voice between a whisper and a loud call, due to what was narrated that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said: "We arrived with the Messenger of Allah, and when we drew near to Medina, he said 'Allahu Akbar' and the people said 'Allahu Akbar' and raised their voices. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'O people, verily the One you are calling is not deaf nor absent. Verily, the One you are calling is closer to you than the necks of your mounts.'" And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said regarding the saying of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic: "And do not recite your prayer aloud, nor whisper it" meaning: your supplication. And Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, praised His prophet Zakariya, peace be upon him, when He said: "When he called upon his Lord with a secret call." And the Mighty and Majestic said: "Call upon your Lord in humility and secretly." Fifth: that one not affect rhymed prose in supplication, for the state of the supplicant should be one of humility, and affectation is not befitting for it. He, peace be upon him, said: "There will be a people who are excessive in supplication." And the Mighty and Majestic has said: "Call upon your Lord in humility and secretly. Indeed, He does not like the transgressors." It is said its meaning is affectation for rhymes. It is preferable not to go beyond the transmitted supplications, for one may transgress in his supplication by asking for what his best interest does not require, for not everyone is adept at supplication. For this reason, it is narrated from Mu'adh, may Allah be pleased with him: "The scholars will be needed in Paradise, for it will be said to the people of Paradise: 'Make your wishes,' and they will not know how to wish until they learn from the scholars." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Beware of rhymed prose in supplication. It is sufficient for one of you to say: 'O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and that which brings near to it of speech and action, and I seek refuge in You from the Fire and that which brings near to it of speech and action.'" And in the report: "There will come a people who are excessive in supplication and purification." One of the predecessors passed by a storyteller supplicating with rhymed prose and said to him: "May Allah elevate your exaggeration! I bear witness that I saw Habib al-'Ajami supplicating, and he would not exceed saying: 'O Allah, make us good. O Allah, do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. O Allah, grant us success in good,' while people behind him were supplicating from every direction, and he was known for the blessing of his supplication." And some of them said: "Supplicate with the tongue of lowliness and need, not with the tongue of eloquence and fluency." And it is said that the scholars, the substitutes, do not exceed seven words or less in supplication, and the end of Surah al-Baqarah testifies to this, for Allah, the Exalted, did not inform of a place from the supplications of His worship more than that. Know that what is intended by rhymed prose is the affected speech, for that does not suit humility and lowliness. Otherwise, in the supplications transmitted from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, there are balanced phrases, but they are not affected, like his saying, peace be upon him: "I ask You for safety from the Day of Threat, and Paradise on the Day of Eternity, with those brought near, the witnesses, those who bow and prostrate, who fulfill their covenants. Indeed, You are Merciful, Loving, and You do what You will," and the like. So let him confine himself to the transmitted supplications, or seek with the tongue of humility and reverence without rhymed prose and affectation, for humility is what is beloved to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. Sixth: humility, reverence, hope, and fear. Allah, the Exalted, said: "Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear." And the Mighty and Majestic said: "Call upon your Lord in humility and secretly." And he, peace be upon him, said: "When Allah loves a servant, He tests him until He hears his humble supplication." Seventh: that he be resolute in supplication and certain of the answer, and truthful in his hope in it. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Let not one of you say when he supplicates: 'O Allah, forgive me if You will. O Allah, have mercy on me if You will.' Rather, let him be decisive in his request, for there is none to compel Him." And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "When one of you supplicates, let him be great in his desire, for nothing is too great for Allah." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Supplicate to Allah while you are certain of the answer, and know that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not answer the supplication from a heedless heart." And Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah said: "Let not what one knows of himself prevent him from supplication, for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, answered the supplication of the worst of creation, Iblis, may Allah curse him, when he said: 'My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.' He said: 'Indeed, you are of those reprieved.'" Eighth: that he be persistent in supplication and repeat it three times. Ibn Mas'ud said: "He, peace be upon him, when he supplicated, would supplicate three times, and when he asked, he would ask three times." And one should not consider the answer slow due to his saying, peace be upon him: "The supplication of one of you is answered as long as he does not become hasty, saying: 'I have supplicated, but I have not been answered.' So when you supplicate, ask Allah abundantly, for you are asking the Most Generous." And some of them said: "I ask Allah..."

For twenty years I have asked God Almighty for a need and He has not answered me, yet I still hope for an answer. I asked God the Exalted to grant me success in abandoning what does not concern me, and He said ﷺ: "When one of you asks his Lord for something, and he recognizes the answer, let him say: 'Praise be to God, by whose grace good deeds are perfected.' And if it is delayed for him, let him say: 'Praise be to God in every circumstance.'" The ninth [manner] is to begin the supplication by mentioning God, Mighty and Majestic, and not to commence with the request. Salamah ibn al-Akwa‘ said: "I never heard the Messenger of God ﷺ open a supplication except that he opened it by saying: 'Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Bestower.'" And Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, said: "Whoever wishes to ask God for a need, let him begin by sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ, then ask for his need, then conclude by sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ, for God, Mighty and Majestic, accepts the two blessings, and He is too Generous to leave what is between them." And it is narrated in a report from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: "When you ask God, Mighty and Majestic, for a need, begin by sending blessings upon me, for God the Exalted is too Generous to be asked for two things and grant one while rejecting the other." Narrated by Abu Talib al-Makki. The tenth [manner] is the inner etiquette, which is the foundation for the answer: repentance, restoring wrongfully taken rights, and turning to God, Mighty and Majestic, with the utmost sincerity of purpose. That is the proximate cause for the answer. It is narrated from Ka‘b al-Ahbar that he said: "A severe drought afflicted the people during the time of Moses, the Messenger of God ﷺ. Moses went out with the Children of Israel to pray for rain with them, but they were not given rain until he went out three times and they were still not given rain. So God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: 'I will not answer you nor those with you, for among you is a slanderer.' Moses said: 'O Lord, who is it so that we may expel him from among us?' God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to him: 'O Moses, I forbid you from slander, and I would be a slanderer!' So Moses said to the Children of Israel: 'Repent to your Lord, all of you, from slander.' They repented, and God the Exalted sent down rain upon them." And Sa‘id ibn Jubayr said: "The people suffered a drought during the time of a king from the kings of the Children of Israel, and they prayed for rain. The king said to the Children of Israel: 'God the Exalted will surely send rain upon us, or we will harm Him.' It was said to him: 'How can you harm Him when He is in the heaven?' He said: 'I will kill His allies and those who obey Him, and that will be a harm to Him.' So God the Exalted sent rain upon them." And Sufyan al-Thawri said: "It reached me that the Children of Israel suffered drought for seven years until they ate carrion from garbage heaps and ate children, and they were like that, going out to the mountains weeping and supplicating. So God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to their prophets, peace be upon them: 'If you walked to Me on your feet until your knees were worn bare and your hands reached the canopy of the heaven and your tongues grew weary from supplication, I would not answer a single supplicant for you nor have mercy on a single weeper for you until you restore wrongfully taken rights to their owners.' They did so, and they were given rain that very day." And Malik ibn Dinar said: "A drought afflicted the people among the Children of Israel, and they went out many times. So God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to their prophet: 'Inform them that you come out to Me with impure bodies and raise to Me hands with which you have shed blood and filled your bellies with the unlawful. Now My wrath against you has intensified, and you will only increase in distance from Me.'" And Abu al-Siddiq al-Naji said: "Solomon, peace be upon him, went out to pray for rain and passed by an ant lying on its back, raising its legs to the heaven, saying: 'O God, we are a creation from Your creations, and we have no independence from Your provision, so do not destroy us for the sins of others.' Solomon, peace be upon him, said: 'Return, for you have been given rain by the supplication of other than you.'" And al-Awza‘i said: "The people went out to pray for rain, and Bilal ibn Sa‘d stood among them, praised God, and extolled Him. Then he said: 'O gathering of those present, do you not acknowledge your misdeeds?' They said: 'O God, yes.' He said: 'O God, we have heard You say: "There is no way against the doers of good," and we have acknowledged our misdeeds. Could Your forgiveness be except for the likes of us? O God, forgive us, have mercy on us, and give us rain.' He raised his hands, and they raised their hands, and they were given rain." And it was said to Malik ibn Dinar: "Supplicate to your Lord for us." He said: "You find the rain slow in coming, and I find the stones slow in coming." And it is narrated that Jesus, prayers and peace of God be upon him, went out to pray for rain. When they became distressed, Jesus, peace be upon him, said to them: "Whoever among you has committed a sin, let him return." They all returned, and none remained with him in the desert except one man. Jesus, peace be upon them, said to him: "Do you not have any sin?" He said: "By God, I know of nothing except that one day I was praying and a woman passed by me, and I looked at her with this eye of mine. When she passed me, I put my finger in my eye and plucked it out and followed the woman with it." Jesus, peace be upon him, said to him: "Then supplicate to God so that I may affirm your supplication." He supplicated, and the heaven became overcast with clouds, then it poured, and they were given rain." And Yahya al-Ghassani said: "A drought afflicted the people during the time of

David, peace be upon him, so they chose three from their scholars. They went out so that rain might be sought through them. One of them said: "O Allah, You revealed in Your Torah that we should forgive those who wrong us. O Allah, we have wronged ourselves, so forgive us." The second said: "O Allah, You revealed in Your Torah that we should free our slaves. O Allah, we are Your slaves, so free us." The third said: "O Allah, You revealed in Your Torah that we should not turn away the poor when they stand at our doors. O Allah, we are Your poor, standing at Your door, so do not turn away our supplication." And rain fell.

And 'Ata' al-Sulami said: "Rain was withheld from us, so we went out to seek rain. Then we found Sa'dun the Madman in the graveyards. He looked at me and said: 'O 'Ata', is this the Day of Resurrection? Or the scattering of what is in the graves?' I said: 'No, but rain has been withheld from us, so we went out to seek rain.' He said: 'O 'Ata', with earthly hearts or with heavenly hearts?' I said: 'Rather, with heavenly hearts.' He said: 'Far be it, O 'Ata'! Tell the ostentatious: Do not be ostentatious, for the Critic is All-Seeing.' Then he glanced at the sky with his eye and said: 'My God, my Master, and my Lord, do not destroy Your lands due to the sins of Your servants. But by the hidden secret of Your names and what the veils have concealed of Your bounties, give us to drink of abundant, sweet water, by which You revive the servants and water the lands, O You who has power over all things.'" 'Ata' said: "He had not finished speaking before the sky thundered and flashed lightning and poured forth rain like the mouths of waterskins." And he turned away saying:
      The ascetics and worshippers have succeeded,
      For they starved their bellies for their Master.
      They kept their ailing eyes awake out of love,
      So their night passed while they were wakeful.
      The worship of Allah preoccupied them so much
      That people thought madness was in them.

And Ibn al-Mubarak said: "I came to Medina in a year of severe drought. The people went out to seek rain, and I went out with them. Then a black youth approached, wearing two pieces of coarse cloth; he had girded himself with one and thrown the other over his shoulder. He sat next to me, and I heard him say: 'My God, have the faces become abased before You due to the multitude of sins and the ugliness of deeds? And You have withheld from us the rain of the sky to discipline Your servants thereby. I ask You, O Forbearing, Possessor of forbearance, O You from whom Your servants know nothing but beauty, that You give them to drink now, now.' He did not cease saying 'now, now' until the sky became clothed with clouds and rain approached from every side." Ibn al-Mubarak said: "I came to al-Fudayl, and he said: 'Why do I see you sorrowful?' I said: 'A matter in which others have preceded us, and they undertook it instead of us.' And I narrated the story to him. Al-Fudayl cried out and fell down unconscious."

And it is narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, sought rain through al-'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. When 'Umar finished his supplication, al-'Abbas said: "O Allah, no calamity descends from the sky except due to a sin, and it is not lifted except by repentance. The people have turned to You through me due to my position from Your Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. And these are our hands extended to You with sins, and our forelocks with repentance. And You are the Shepherd who does not neglect the lost one, nor leave the elder in a place of ruin. The young have humbled themselves, and the elder has become tender, and the voices have risen with complaint, and You know the secret and what is more hidden. O Allah, so succor them with Your succor before they despair and perish, for none despairs of the mercy of Allah except the disbelieving people." He said: "He had not finished speaking before the sky rose up like mountains."

(The Virtue of Prayers upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and His Virtue, peace and blessings be upon him)

Allah the Exalted said: "Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace." And it is narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, came one day with glad tidings visible on his face, and he said: "Indeed, Jibril, peace be upon him, came to me and said: 'Are you not pleased, O Muhammad, that no one from your community sends one prayer upon you except that I send ten upon him, and no one from your community sends peace upon you except that I send ten upon him?'" And he said: "Whoever sends prayers upon me, the angels send prayers upon him as long as he sends prayers upon me. So let him do little of that or much." And he said: "The people most deserving of me are those who send the most prayers upon me." And he said: "It is enough miserliness for a believer that I am mentioned near him and he does not send prayers upon me." And he said: "Increase in sending prayers upon me on Friday." And he said: "Whoever from my community sends one prayer upon me, ten good deeds are written for him, and ten evil deeds are erased from him." And he said: "Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer and the iqamah: 'O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the established prayer, send prayers upon Muhammad, Your servant and Messenger, and grant him the intercession, the excellence, the elevated rank, and the intercession on the Day of Resurrection,' my intercession becomes due for him." And the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever sends prayers upon me in a book, the angels do not cease seeking forgiveness for him as long as my name is in that book." And he said: "There are in the earth angels who travel about, conveying to me the greetings of peace from my community." And he said: "There is no one who sends peace upon me except that Allah returns my spirit to me so that I may return the greeting to him." And it was said to him: "O Messenger of Allah, how should we send prayers upon you?" He said: "Say: O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad..."

O Allah, bless Muhammad, Your servant, and his family and his wives and his progeny, as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. And bestow blessings upon Muhammad and his wives and his progeny, as You bestowed blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Indeed, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. (106) It is narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, heard after the death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ someone weeping and saying: "My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! There was a palm-trunk upon which you would address the people. When the people became numerous, you had a pulpit made so they could hear you. The trunk yearned for your absence until you placed your hand upon it and it became still. Your community was more deserving of yearning for you when you left them. My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Your excellence with Him reached such a degree that He made obedience to you obedience to Him, for Almighty Allah said: 'Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah.' My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Your excellence with Him reached such a degree that He informed you of forgiveness before informing you of the fault, for He, Exalted is He, said: 'May Allah pardon you. Why did you give them permission?' My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Your excellence with Him reached such a degree that He sent you as the last of the prophets yet mentioned you among the first of them, for Almighty Allah said: 'And [remember] when We took from the prophets their covenant, and from you and from Noah and Abraham.' My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Your excellence with Him reached such a degree that the people of the Fire will wish they had obeyed you while they are between its layers, being punished, saying: 'If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger.' My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! If Musa, son of ‘Imran, was given by Allah a stone from which rivers gushed forth, then what is more wondrous than your fingers when water gushed from them? May Allah bless you. My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! If Sulayman, son of Dawud, was given by Allah the wind, its morning course a month and its evening course a month, then what is more wondrous than al-Buraq when you traveled upon it to the seventh heaven, then prayed the dawn prayer of your night at al-Abtah? May Allah bless you. My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! If ‘Isa, son of Maryam, was given by Allah the reviving of the dead, then what is more wondrous than the poisoned sheep when it spoke to you while roasted, and its foreleg said to you: 'Do not eat me, for I am poisoned'? My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Noah invoked against his people, saying: 'My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers a single dweller.' Had you invoked similarly against us, we would have perished. For indeed, your back was trodden upon, your face was made to bleed, and your incisor was broken, yet you refused to say anything but good, saying: 'O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know.' My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Those who followed you in your few years and short life were more than those who followed Noah in his many years and long life. Many believed in you, yet with him only a few believed. My father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah! Had you only kept company with your equal, you would not have kept company with us. Had you only married your equal, you would not have married among us. Had you only eaten with your equal, you would not have eaten with us. By Allah, you kept company with us, married among us, ate with us, wore wool, rode a donkey, had someone ride behind you, placed your food on the ground, and licked your fingers out of humility." (107) And one of them said: "I used to write the Hadith and send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ therein, but not the salutation of peace. Then I saw the Prophet ﷺ in a dream, and he said to me: 'Do you not complete the prayer upon me in your writing?' So after that, I never wrote except that I sent blessings and peace upon him." And it is narrated from al-Hasan that he said: "I saw the Prophet ﷺ in a dream, so I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, how was al-Shafi‘i rewarded on your behalf when he says in his book *al-Risalah*: "And may Allah bless Muhammad whenever the mindful remember him and the heedless are heedless of his remembrance"?' He ﷺ said: 'He was rewarded on my behalf that he will not be detained for reckoning.'"

(The Excellence of Seeking Forgiveness)
Almighty Allah said: "And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins." And ‘Alqamah and al-Aswad said: ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud, may Allah be pleased with them, said concerning the Book of Allah Almighty: "There are two verses; no servant commits a sin, then recites them and seeks forgiveness from Allah Almighty, except that Allah, Exalted is He, forgives him: 'And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves...' and His saying, Almighty is He: 'And whoever does evil or wrongs himself then seeks forgiveness of Allah will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful.'" And Almighty Allah said: "So exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and ask His forgiveness. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance." And He, Exalted is He, said: "And those who seek forgiveness before dawn." And he ﷺ would frequently say: "Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. O Allah, forgive me. Indeed, You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful." (108) And he ﷺ said: "Whoever increases in seeking forgiveness, Allah Almighty will make for him from every anxiety a relief, and from every constraint a way out, and will provide for him from where he does not expect." (109) And he ﷺ said: "Indeed, I seek forgiveness from Allah, Exalted is He, and repent to Him seventy times a day." (110) This, despite the fact that he ﷺ was forgiven his past and future sins. And he ﷺ said: "Indeed, a covering comes over my heart, so much so that I..."

I seek forgiveness from God Almighty one hundred times each day. And He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever says when he retires to his bed: 'I seek forgiveness from God, the Magnificent, besides whom there is no deity, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I repent to Him' three times, God will forgive him his sins, even if they were like the foam of the sea, or the number of sand grains in the desert, or the number of leaves on the trees, or the number of days of the world." And He, peace be upon him, said in another narration: "Whoever says that, his sins will be forgiven, even if he had fled from the battlefield." And Hudhayfah said: I was sharp-tongued with my family, so I said: O Messenger of God, I fear my tongue will enter me into the Fire. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Then where are you from seeking forgiveness? For I seek forgiveness from God one hundred times a day." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to me: "If you have committed a sin, then seek forgiveness from God and repent to Him, for repentance from sin is remorse and seeking forgiveness." And He, peace be upon him, would say in seeking forgiveness: "O God, forgive me my misstep, my ignorance, and my excess in my affairs, and what You know better than me. O God, forgive me my jest and my earnestness, my error and my intent, and all of that is with me. O God, forgive me what I have sent forth and what I have delayed, what I have concealed and what I have made public, and what You know better than me. You are the Advancer and You are the Delayer, and You have power over all things." And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: I was a man who, when I heard a narration from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, God, Mighty and Majestic, benefited me by what He willed to benefit me from it. And when one of his companions narrated to me, I would ask him to swear, and if he swore, I would believe him. He said: And Abu Bakr narrated to me—and Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, spoke truthfully—he said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "There is no servant who commits a sin, then performs purification well, then stands and prays two units of prayer, then seeks forgiveness from God, Mighty and Majestic, except that He forgives him." Then he recited His saying, Mighty and Majestic: "And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves..." the verse. And Abu Hurayrah reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "Verily, when a believer commits a sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents, desists, and seeks forgiveness, his heart is polished from it. But if he increases, it increases until it covers his heart." That is the stain which God, Mighty and Majestic, mentioned in His Book: "No! Rather, a stain has covered their hearts from what they have been earning." And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that He, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, God, Glorified is He, raises a degree for a servant in Paradise, and he says: O Lord, how did I attain this? He, Mighty and Majestic, says: By your child's seeking forgiveness for you." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, reported that He, peace be upon him, said: "O God, make me among those who, when they do good, rejoice, and when they do wrong, seek forgiveness." And He, peace be upon him, said: "When a servant commits a sin and says: O God, forgive me, God, Mighty and Majestic, says: My servant has committed a sin and knows that he has a Lord who takes to account for sin and forgives sin. My servant, do as you wish, for I have forgiven you." And He, peace be upon him, said: "He is not persistent who seeks forgiveness, even if he repeats it seventy times a day." And He, peace be upon him, said: "A man who had never done any good looked at the sky and said: Verily, I have a Lord. O Lord, forgive me. God, Mighty and Majestic, said: I have forgiven you." And He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever commits a sin and knows that God has observed it, He forgives him, even if he does not seek forgiveness." And He, peace be upon him, said: God Almighty says: "O My servants, all of you are sinners except whom I have granted immunity. So seek forgiveness from Me, I will forgive you. And whoever knows that I possess the power to forgive him, I forgive him, and I do not mind." And He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever says: 'Glory be to You, I have wronged myself and done evil, so forgive me, for none forgives sins except You,' He forgives his sins, even if they were like ant trails." And it is reported: "Verily, the best seeking forgiveness is: O God, You are my Lord and I am Your servant. You created me and I am upon Your covenant and promise as best I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge Your favor upon me and I acknowledge my sin against myself. I have wronged myself and confessed my sin, so forgive me my sins, what I have sent forth of them and what I have delayed, for none forgives all sins except You." And the narrations: Khalid ibn Ma'dan said: God, Mighty and Majestic, says: "The most beloved of My servants to Me are those who love one another for My sake, whose hearts are attached to the mosques, and those who seek forgiveness in the last hours of the night. Those are the ones whom, when I intend to punish the people of the earth, I remember them and leave them, and divert the punishment from them." And Qatadah, may God have mercy on him, said: "The Qur'an points out to you your ailment and your cure. As for your ailment, it is sins. As for your cure, it is seeking forgiveness." And 'Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: "It is astonishing how one perishes while salvation is with him." It was said: And what is it? He said: "Seeking forgiveness." And he used to say: "God, Glorified is He, does not inspire a servant to seek forgiveness while intending to punish him." And al-Fudayl said: "The servant's statement 'I seek forgiveness from God' means: Cover me." And some scholars said: "The servant is between a sin and a blessing; nothing sets them right except praise and seeking forgiveness." And al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym, may God have mercy on him, said: "Let none of you say 'I seek forgiveness from God and repent to Him,' for it would be a sin and a lie if he does not do it."

But let him say: O Allah, forgive me and accept my repentance. Al-Fudayl, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Seeking forgiveness without desisting is the repentance of liars. And Rabi‘ah al-‘Adawiyyah, may Allah have mercy on her, said: Our seeking forgiveness itself needs to be forgiven. Some of the wise said: Whoever puts seeking forgiveness ahead of remorse is mocking Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, without realizing it. And a Bedouin was heard, clinging to the curtains of the Ka‘bah, saying: O Allah, my seeking forgiveness while persisting in sin is base, and my abandoning to seek Your forgiveness despite knowing the vastness of Your pardon is incapacity. How often You show me affection through blessings despite Your independence from me, and how often I make myself hateful to You through disobedience despite my need of You. O You who when You promise, fulfill, and when You threaten, pardon—admit my great offense into Your great pardon, O Most Merciful of the merciful. And Abu ‘Abdullah al-Warraq said: If you had sins like the number of raindrops and the foam of the sea, they would be erased from you if you supplicated to your Lord with this supplication sincerely, if Allah wills: O Allah, I seek Your forgiveness for every sin I repented to You from, then returned to; and I seek Your forgiveness for everything I promised You from myself but did not fulfill for You; and I seek Your forgiveness for every deed I intended for Your Face, but something other than You became mixed with it; and I seek Your forgiveness for every blessing You bestowed upon me, which I then used to aid me in disobeying You; and I seek Your forgiveness, O Knower of the unseen and the seen, for every sin I committed in the brightness of day and the darkness of night, in public or private, secretly or openly, O Forbearing One. And it is said that this is the seeking forgiveness of Adam, peace be upon him, and it is said [it is] of al-Khidr, peace be upon him.

(Chapter Three: On transmitted supplications and those attributed to their occasions and their people, which it is recommended for a person to supplicate with morning and evening and after every prayer)

Among them: The supplication of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, after the two rak‘ahs of Fajr. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: Al-‘Abbas sent me to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and I came to him in the evening while he was in the house of my aunt Maymunah. He stood to pray at night, and when he prayed the two rak‘ahs of Fajr before the morning prayer, he said: O Allah, I ask You for mercy from Yourself, by which You guide my heart, gather my affairs, mend my fragmentation, repel tribulations from me, rectify my religion, safeguard my absence, elevate my presence, purify my deeds, brighten my face, inspire me to right guidance, and protect me from all evil. O Allah, grant me sincere faith and certainty beyond which there is no disbelief, and mercy by which I attain the honor of Your nobility in this world and the Hereafter. O Allah, I ask You for success at the Judgment, the abodes of the martyrs, the life of the felicitous, victory over enemies, and companionship of the prophets. O Allah, I lay before You my need, for my opinion is weak, my means are few, my action is deficient, and I am in need of Your mercy. So I ask You, O Sufficer of affairs and O Healer of hearts, as You separate between the seas, that You separate me from the punishment of the Blazing Fire, from the call of perdition, and from the trial of the graves. O Allah, whatever good my opinion fell short of, my action was too weak for, and my intention and wish did not attain—of the good You have promised to any of Your servants or the good You give to any of Your creation—I am eager for it from You and I ask You for it, O Lord of the worlds. O Allah, make us guides, rightly guided, not astray nor leading astray, hostile to Your enemies and at peace with Your allies. We love, by Your love, those of Your creation who obey You, and we show enmity, by Your enmity, to those of Your creation who oppose You. O Allah, this is the supplication, and upon You is the response; this is the effort, and upon You is reliance. Verily to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return. There is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Magnificent, Possessor of the strong cord and the sound command. I ask You for safety on the Day of Threat and for Paradise on the Day of Eternity, with those brought near, the witnesses, those who bow and prostrate, who fulfill their covenants. Indeed, You are Merciful, Loving, and You do what You will. Glory be to Him who wears Majesty and claims it. Glory be to Him who wraps Himself in Glory and honors Himself with it. Glory be to Him for whom alone praise is fitting. Glory be to the Possessor of bounty and blessings. Glory be to the Possessor of might and generosity. Glory be to Him who has enumerated all things in His knowledge. O Allah, place for me light in my heart, light in my grave, light in my hearing, light in my sight, light in my hair, light in my skin, light in my flesh, light in my blood, light in my bones, light before me, light behind me, light to my right, light to my left, light above me, and light below me. O Allah, increase me in light, grant me light, and make for me light.

(The supplication of ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her)

The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her: You should use the comprehensive, complete [supplications]. Say: O Allah, I ask You for all good, its immediate and its deferred, what I know of it and what I do not know; and I seek refuge in You from all evil, its immediate and its deferred, what I know and what I do not know. And I ask You for Paradise and for whatever brings near to it of word and deed; and I seek refuge in You from the Fire and from whatever brings near to it of word and deed. And I ask You for the good that Your servant and Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, asked You for; and I seek refuge in You from what Your servant and Messenger Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, sought refuge from. And I ask You for what You have decreed for me...

O You who ordain that my end be upright—by Your mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful. (The supplication of Fāṭimah, may God be pleased with her)

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “O Fāṭimah, what prevents you from hearing what I counsel you to say? Say: O Ever-Living, O Self-Subsisting, by Your mercy I seek aid. Entrust me not to myself for the blink of an eye, and set right all my affairs.” (The supplication of Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, may God be pleased with him)

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, taught Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, may God be pleased with him, to say: “O God, I ask You by Muḥammad Your Prophet, and by Abraham Your intimate friend, and by Moses Your confidant, and by Jesus Your Word and Spirit, and by the Torah of Moses, and the Gospel of Jesus, and the Psalms of David, and the Criterion of Muḥammad, peace and blessings be upon them all, and by every revelation You have sent down, every decree You have ordained, every asker You have granted, every rich one You have impoverished, every poor one You have enriched, every stray You have guided. And I ask You by Your name which You sent down upon Moses, peace and blessings be upon him, and I ask You by Your name through which You spread the provisions of Your servants, and I ask You by Your name which You placed upon the earth so it became firm, and I ask You by Your name which You placed upon the heavens so they were raised, and I ask You by Your name which You placed upon the mountains so they stood fixed, and I ask You by Your name by which Your Throne is upheld, and I ask You by Your name, the Pure, the Purifying, the One, the Eternal Refuge, the Unique, sent down in Your Book from Your presence, from the Manifest Light. And I ask You by Your name which You placed upon the day so it became luminous and upon the night so it became dark, and by Your majesty and Your grandeur, and by the light of Your noble Countenance, that You provide me with the Qur’ān and knowledge of it, and blend it with my flesh and blood, my hearing and my sight, and employ my body through it by Your power and strength, for there is no power and no strength except by You, O Most Merciful of the merciful.” (The supplication of Buraydah al-Aslamī, may God be pleased with him)

And it is related that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: “O Buraydah, shall I not teach you words for whomsoever God desires good, He teaches them to him, and then never lets him forget them?” He said: I replied, “Yes, O Messenger of God.” He said: “Say: O God, I am weak, so strengthen me in what pleases You, and take me by the forelock to good, and make Islam the utmost limit of my contentment. O God, I am weak, so strengthen me; I am lowly, so ennoble me; I am poor, so enrich me, O Most Merciful of the merciful.” (The supplication of Qabīṣah ibn al-Mukhāriq)

When he said to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him: “Teach me words by which God, Mighty and Majestic, may benefit me, for my age has advanced and I have become incapable of many things I used to do.” He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “As for your worldly life, when you pray the morning prayer, say three times: ‘Glory be to God and by His praise; glory be to God the Almighty; there is no power and no strength except by God, the Most High, the Almighty.’ For if you say them, you will be secure from grief, leprosy, vitiligo, and paralysis. And as for your Hereafter, say: ‘O God, guide me from Your presence, pour upon me from Your bounty, spread over me from Your mercy, and send down upon me from Your blessings.’” Then he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Indeed, when a servant arrives with these on the Day of Resurrection, not abandoning them, four gates of Paradise will be opened for him, and he may enter by whichever he wishes.” (The supplication of Abū al-Dardā’, may God be pleased with him)

It was said to Abū al-Dardā’, may God be pleased with him: “Your house has burned down,” for a fire had broken out in his neighborhood. He said: “God would not do that.” This was said to him three times, and he kept replying, “God would not do that.” Then someone came to him and said: “O Abū al-Dardā’, when the fire drew near your house, it was extinguished.” He said: “I knew that.” He was then asked: “We do not know which of your two statements is more amazing.” He said: “I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: ‘Whoever says these words by night or by day, nothing will harm him.’ And I had said them, and they are: ‘O God, You are my Lord, there is no god but You; in You I trust, and You are the Lord of the Mighty Throne. There is no power and no strength except by God, the Most High, the Almighty. What God wills, is; and what He does not will, is not. I know that God has power over all things, and that God encompasses all things in knowledge, and has counted everything in number. O God, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul and from the evil of every creature whose forelock You hold. Truly, my Lord is on a straight path.’” (The supplication of the intimate friend Abraham, peace be upon him)

He used to say upon morning: “O God, this is a new creation, so open it for me with obedience to You, and seal it for me with Your forgiveness and pleasure. And provide me therein with a good deed that You accept from me, purify it, and multiply it for me. And whatever evil I have worked therein, forgive it for me, for You are Forgiving, Merciful, Loving, Generous.” He said: “Whoever supplicates with this supplication in the morning has rendered thanks for his day.” (The supplication of Jesus, peace be upon him)

He used to say: “O God, I have awakened unable to repel what I dislike, possessing no power to benefit what I hope for. The affair has passed into the hand of another, and I have become held hostage by my deeds. So there is no poor one poorer than I. O God, let not my enemy gloat over me, nor cause my friend grief through me. Place not my trial in my religion, nor make the world my greatest concern. Subject me not to one who will show me no mercy, O Ever-Living, O Self-Subsisting.”

(The Supplication of Khidr, peace be upon him)
It is said that Khidr and Ilyas, peace be upon them both, whenever they meet each season, do not part except with these words: In the name of God, what God wills; there is no power except with God; what God wills, every blessing is from God; what God wills, all good is in God's hand; what God wills, none can avert evil except God. Whoever says this three times in the morning will be safe, God willing, from burning, drowning, and theft.

(The Supplication of Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, may God be pleased with him)
Muhammad ibn Hassan said: Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, may God have mercy on him, said to me: "Shall I not teach you ten phrases, five for this world and five for the Hereafter? Whoever supplicates to God, Mighty and Majestic, with them will find God, Exalted is He, present with them." I said, "Write them for me." He said, "No, but I will repeat them to you as Bakr ibn Khunays, may God have mercy on him, repeated them to me: God is sufficient for my religion; God is sufficient for my worldly life; God, the Generous, is sufficient for what concerns me; God, the Forbearing, the Strong, is sufficient against whoever transgresses against me; God, the Severe, is sufficient against whoever plots evil against me; God, the Merciful, is sufficient at death; God, the Kind, is sufficient at the questioning in the grave; God, the Generous, is sufficient at the Reckoning; God, the Subtle, is sufficient at the Scales; God, the Omnipotent, is sufficient at the Bridge; God is sufficient for me, there is no god but He; in Him I trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne." It has been narrated from Abu al-Darda' that he said: "Whoever says seven times each day, 'God is sufficient for me, there is no god but He; in Him I trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne,' God, Mighty and Majestic, will suffice him in what concerns him of his Hereafter's affair, whether he is truthful or false."

(The Supplication of 'Utbah the Youth, and)
He was seen in a dream after his death and said: "I entered Paradise with these words: O God, O Guide of the misguided, O Merciful to the sinners, O Acceptor of the slips of the stumblers, have mercy upon Your servant of great peril and upon all the Muslims collectively, and place us with the righteous, the provisioned, those upon whom You have bestowed favor from among the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. Amen, O Lord of the worlds."

(The Supplication of Adam, peace and blessings be upon him)
'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: When God, Mighty and Majestic, willed to accept the repentance of Adam, peace be upon him, he circumambulated the House seven times—and it was then not a built structure but a red hillock—then he stood and prayed two units of prayer, then said: "O God, You know my secret and my public, so accept my excuse; You know my need, so grant me my request; You know what is within me, so forgive me my sins. O God, I ask You for faith that touches my heart and sincere certainty until I know that nothing will befall me except what You have decreed for me, and contentment with what You have apportioned for me, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor." Then God, Mighty and Majestic, revealed to him: "I have forgiven you, and none of your descendants comes to Me supplicating with the like of what you have supplicated Me with, except that I forgive him, dispel his griefs and sorrows, remove poverty from between his eyes, trade for him from behind every trader, and the world comes to him abased, even if he does not desire it."

(The Supplication of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him)
He narrated from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Indeed, God, Exalted is He, glorifies Himself every day and says: 'Verily, I am God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily, I am God, there is no god but I, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer. Verily, I am God, there is no god but I, the Most High, the Most Great. Verily, I am God, there is no god but I; I have not begotten, nor was I begotten. Verily, I am God, there is no god but I, the Pardoning, the Forgiving. Verily, I am God, there is no god but I; I originate everything and to Me it returns, the Almighty, the All-Wise, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment, Creator of good and evil, Creator of Paradise and Hellfire, the One, the Unique, the Eternal Absolute, who has taken neither a consort nor a son, the Single, the Odd, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of Peace, the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Supreme, the Creator, the Evolver, the Fashioner, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Subduer, the Forbearing, the Generous, Worthy of all praise and glory, Knower of the secret and what is more hidden, the All-Capable, the Provider, above the creation and the creatures.'" And before each phrase, "Verily, I am God, there is no god but I," as we have mentioned at the beginning. So whoever supplicates with these names, let him say, "You are God, there is no god but You," and so on. Whoever supplicates with them is recorded among the prostrating, humble ones who will be neighbors to Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, the prayers of God be upon them, in the Abode of Majesty, and for him is the reward of the worshippers in the heavens and the earths. And may God bless Muhammad and every chosen servant.

(The Supplication of Ibn al-Mu'tamir, who is Sulayman al-Taymi, and his glorifications, may God be pleased with him)
It is narrated that Yunus ibn 'Ubayd saw a man in a dream from among those killed as martyrs in the lands of the Romans and said: "What is the best of what you have seen of deeds?" He said: "I have seen the glorifications of Ibn al-Mu'tamir from God, Mighty and Majestic."

In a place and this is it: Glory be to God, and praise be to God, and there is no god but God, and God is the Greatest, and there is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Magnificent—a number equal to what He has created, and a number equal to what He will create; a weight equal to what He has created, and a weight equal to what He will create; a fullness equal to what He has created, and a fullness equal to what He will create; and the fullness of His heavens and the fullness of His earth, and the like of that, and multiples of that; and the number of His creation, and the weight of His Throne, and the extent of His mercy, and the ink of His words, and the measure of His pleasure until He is pleased, and when He is pleased; and a number equal to what His creation has mentioned Him with in all that has passed, and a number equal to what they will mention Him with in what remains, in every year, month, Friday, day, night, hour of the hours, breath and inhalation of breaths, and an eternity of eternities, from eternity to eternity, the eternity of this world and the eternity of the Hereafter, and more than that—its beginning does not cease, nor does its end expire.
                     (The supplication of Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God be pleased with him)
   Ibrahim ibn Bashar, his servant, narrated that he would say this supplication every Friday when morning came and when evening came: Welcome to the day of increase and the new dawn, and to the recorder and the witness. This day of ours is a day of celebration. Record for us in it what we say: In the name of God, the Praiseworthy, the Glorious, the Exalted, the Loving, the Doer in His creation of what He wills. I have become a believer in God, a confirmer of meeting Him, an acknowledger of His proof, a seeker of forgiveness for my sin, submissive to the Lordship of God, a denier of any god besides God, in need of God, reliant upon God, and turning in repentance to God. I call God to witness, and I call His angels, His prophets, His messengers, the bearers of His Throne, and His creation, and He who is its Creator, to witness that He is God, there is no god but He alone, without partner, and that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger, and that Paradise is true, and the Fire is true, and the Basin is true, and intercession is true, and Munkar and Nakir are true, and Your promise is true, and Your threat is true, and meeting You is true, and the Hour is coming, there is no doubt in it, and that God will resurrect those in the graves. Upon that I live, upon that I die, and upon that I shall be resurrected, God willing. O God, You are my Lord, there is no god but You. You created me and I am Your servant, and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as best I can. I seek refuge in You, O God, from the evil of what I have done and from the evil of every possessor of evil. O God, I have wronged myself, so forgive me my sins, for none forgives sins but You. And guide me to the best of character, for none guides to the best of it but You. And turn away from me the worst of it, for none turns away the worst of it but You. At Your service, and success is Yours, and all good is in Your hand. I am Yours and to You I turn, seeking Your forgiveness and repenting to You. I believe, O God, in what You have sent of a Messenger, and I believe, O God, in what You have revealed of a Book. And may God send blessings upon Muhammad, the unlettered Prophet, and upon his family, and grant them abundant peace—the seal and key of my speech—and upon all His prophets and messengers. Amen, O Lord of the worlds. O God, cause us to arrive at the Basin of Muhammad, and give us to drink from his cup a drink, plentiful, pleasant, delightful, after which we shall never thirst again. And gather us in his company, not disgraced, nor breaking the covenant, nor doubting, nor afflicted by trials, nor those upon whom is wrath, nor those who are astray. O God, protect me from the trials of this world, and grant me success in what You love and are pleased with, and rectify all my affairs for me, and make me firm with the firm word in the life of this world and in the Hereafter, and do not cause me to go astray, even if I am wrongdoer. Glory be to You, glory be to You, O Most High, O Magnificent, O Creator, O Merciful, O Mighty, O Compeller. Glory be to Him to whom the heavens glorify with their expanses, and glory be to Him to whom the seas glorify with their waves, and glory be to Him to whom the mountains glorify with their echoes, and glory be to Him to whom the fish glorify with their languages, and glory be to Him to whom the stars in the sky glorify with their constellations, and glory be to Him to whom the trees glorify with their roots and their fruits, and glory be to Him to whom the seven heavens and the seven earths glorify, and whoever is in them and upon them. Glory be to Him to whom everything from His creation glorifies. Blessed are You and Exalted. Glory be to You, glory be to You, O Living, O Self-Subsisting, O All-Knowing, O Forbearing. Glory be to You, there is no god but You alone, without partner. You give life and cause death, and You are Living and do not die. In Your hand is all good, and You have power over all things.
  (Chapter Four: On Supplications Narrated from the Prophet and from His Companions, may God be pleased with them, with chains of transmission omitted, selected from the compilations of Abu Talib al-Makki, Ibn Khuzaymah, and Ibn al-Mundhir, may God have mercy on them)
   It is recommended for the spiritual seeker, when morning comes, that the most beloved of his litanies be supplication, as will be mentioned in the Book of Litanies. So if you are among the seekers cultivating for the Hereafter, following the example of the Messenger of God in what he supplicated with, then say at the opening of your supplications, after your prayers: Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, the Bestower. There is no god but God alone, without partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He has power over all things. And say: I am pleased with God as Lord, with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad as Prophet—three times. And say: O God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, Lord of everything and its Sovereign. I bear witness that there is no god but You.

I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul, the evil of Satan, and his partnership. And say: O Allah, I ask You for pardon and well-being in my religion, my worldly life, my family, and my wealth. O Allah, cover my faults, grant me security from my fears, and remove my stumblings. Guard me from before me and from behind me, from my right and from my left, and from above me. I seek refuge in You lest I be taken from beneath me. O Allah, do not make me feel secure from Your plan, do not entrust me to other than You, do not strip from me Your covering, do not make me forget Your remembrance, and do not place me among the heedless. And say: O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no god but You. You created me and I am Your servant, and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as best I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge Your favor upon me and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for none forgives sins but You. Three times. And say: O Allah, grant me well-being in my body, grant me well-being in my hearing, grant me well-being in my sight. There is no god but You. Three times. And say: O Allah, I ask You for contentment after the decree, a coolness of life after death, the delight of gazing upon Your Noble Countenance, and a yearning to meet You without harmful affliction or misleading trial. I seek refuge in You from oppressing or being oppressed, from transgressing or being transgressed upon, or from earning a sin or misdeed that You do not forgive. O Allah, I ask You for steadfastness in the matter and resolve in right guidance. I ask You for gratitude for Your blessings and excellence in Your worship. I ask You for a humble, sound heart, an upright character, a truthful tongue, and accepted deeds. I ask You for the good that You know, and I seek refuge in You from the evil that You know. I seek Your forgiveness for what You know, for You know and I know not, and You are the Knower of the unseen. O Allah, forgive me what I have sent forth and what I have left behind, what I have concealed and what I have made public, and what You know better than I. For You are the Advancer and the Delayer, and You have power over all things and are Witness over every unseen thing. O Allah, I ask You for faith that does not recede, bliss that does not end, the coolness of the eye forever, and the companionship of Your Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, in the highest Garden of Eternity. O Allah, I ask You for good things, the performance of good deeds, the abandonment of evil deeds, and love for the needy. I ask You for Your love, the love of those who love You, and love for every deed that brings me nearer to Your love. And that You grant me repentance, forgive me, and have mercy on me. And if You intend a trial for a people, then take me to You without being afflicted by trial. O Allah, by Your knowledge of the unseen and Your power over creation, grant me life as long as life is good for me, and take me in death when death is good for me. I ask You for awe of You in the unseen and the seen, the word of justice in pleasure and anger, moderation in wealth and poverty, the delight of gazing upon Your Countenance, and yearning to meet You. I seek refuge in You from harmful affliction and misleading trial. O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us guides, rightly guided. O Allah, apportion for us from awe of You what prevents us from disobeying You, from obedience to You what brings us to Your Paradise, and from certainty what makes the calamities of this world and the Hereafter light upon us. O Allah, fill our faces with shame before You, our hearts with awe of You, and settle in our souls from Your majesty what humbles our limbs in Your service. And make You, O Allah, more beloved to us than any other, and make us more in awe of You than of any other. O Allah, make the beginning of this day of ours righteousness, its middle success, and its end prosperity. O Allah, make its beginning mercy, its middle blessing, and its end honor and forgiveness. All praise is to Allah, before Whose greatness everything is humble, before Whose might everything is subdued, before Whose dominion everything yields, and before Whose power everything submits. All praise is to Allah, before Whose awe everything is still, by Whose wisdom everything is manifest, and before Whose majesty everything is diminished. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, the wives of Muhammad, and his progeny. And bless Muhammad and his family, his wives, and his progeny as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim in the worlds. Indeed, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant, Your Prophet, and Your Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, Your trustworthy Messenger, and grant him the Praiseworthy Station that You promised him on the Day of Recompense. O Allah, make us among Your allies who are God-fearing, Your party who are successful, and Your righteous servants. Employ us for Your pleasure concerning us, grant us success in what pleases You from us, and turn us by Your good choice for us. We ask You for the comprehensive good, its beginnings and its ends, and we seek refuge in You from the comprehensive evil, its beginnings and its ends. O Allah, by Your power over me, accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful. By Your forbearance toward me, pardon me, for You are the Forgiving, the Forbearing. By Your knowledge of me, be gentle with me, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. By Your dominion over me, grant me mastery over myself and do not let it gain mastery over me, for You are the Sovereign, the Compeller. Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. There is no god but You. I have done wrong and wronged myself, so forgive my sin, for You are my Lord, and none forgives sins but You. O Allah, inspire me with my right guidance and protect me from the evil of my soul. O Allah, provide me with lawful provision for which You will not punish me, make me content with what You have provided me, and employ me in it righteously, accepting it from me. O Allah, I ask You for pardon, well-being, and goodness.

Certainty and well-being in this world and the next. O You whom sins do not harm and forgiveness does not diminish, grant me what does not harm You and give me what does not diminish You. Our Lord, pour upon us patience and cause us to die in submission. You are my Guardian in this world and the next; cause me to die in submission and join me with the righteous. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of forgivers. And decree for us good in this world and in the Hereafter. Indeed, we have turned to You. Our Lord, in You we trust, and to You we turn, and to You is the destination. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for the wrongdoing people. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve, and forgive us. Our Lord, indeed You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise. Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affairs, and make firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving people. Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith, and do not place in our hearts any resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful. Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance. Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire. Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith... to His saying, the Mighty and Majestic: "Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise." Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred... to the end of the Surah. My Lord, forgive me and my parents and have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small. And forgive the believing men and believing women, and the Muslim men and Muslim women, the living among them and the dead. My Lord, forgive and have mercy and overlook what You know, for You are the Most Exalted, the Most Noble, and You are the best of the merciful, and You are the best of forgivers. Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we will return. There is no power nor strength except by Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. And sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the best Disposer of affairs. And may Allah send blessings upon Muhammad, the seal of the prophets, and upon his family and companions, and grant them abundant peace.

The types of supplications for refuge transmitted from the Prophet, peace be upon him: O Allah, I seek refuge in You from miserliness, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice, and I seek refuge in You from being returned to the most abject age, and I seek refuge in You from the trial of this world, and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a disposition that leads to greed, and from greed for what is unattainable, and from greed where there is nothing to be gained. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from knowledge that does not benefit, a heart that does not humble itself, a supplication that is not heard, and a soul that is never satisfied. And I seek refuge in You from hunger, for it is an evil bedfellow, and from treachery, for it is an evil inner garment, and from laziness, miserliness, cowardice, and old age, and from being returned to the most abject age, and from the trial of the False Messiah and the punishment of the grave, and from the trials of life and death. O Allah, we ask You for hearts that are compassionate, humble, and penitent in Your cause. O Allah, I ask You for the firm resolve of Your forgiveness, the causes of Your mercy, safety from every sin, the gain of every good, attainment of Paradise, and deliverance from the Fire. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from falling, and I seek refuge in You from grief, drowning, and collapse, and I seek refuge in You from dying while retreating in Your cause, and I seek refuge in You from dying while seeking this world. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I know and from the evil of what I do not know. O Allah, keep me away from reprehensible morals, deeds, ailments, and desires. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the severity of tribulation, the attainment of misery, an evil decree, and the gloating of enemies. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from disbelief, debt, and poverty, and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of Hellfire, and I seek refuge in You from the trial of the False Messiah. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing, my sight, my tongue, my heart, and the evil of my sexual organ. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from an evil neighbor in the permanent abode, for the neighbor in the desert can move away. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from hardness of heart, heedlessness, destitution, humiliation, and neediness, and I seek refuge in You from disbelief, poverty, immorality, discord, hypocrisy, evil morals, constricted provision, ostentation, and showing off, and I seek refuge in You from deafness, muteness, blindness, madness, leprosy, vitiligo, and evil diseases. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the removal of Your blessing, the changing of Your well-being, the suddenness of Your vengeance, and from all Your displeasure. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the Fire, the trial of the Fire, the punishment of the grave, the evil trial of wealth, the evil trial of poverty, the evil trial of the False Messiah, and I seek refuge in You from debt and sin. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a soul that is never satisfied, a heart that does not humble itself, a prayer that does not benefit, a supplication that is not answered, and I seek refuge in You from the evil of grief and the trial of the heart. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from being overwhelmed by debt, being overwhelmed by the enemy, and the gloating of enemies. And may Allah send blessings upon Muhammad and upon every chosen servant from among all the worlds. Amen.

(Chapter Five: On the transmitted supplications for every occurring event)
When you enter the morning and hear the call to prayer, it is recommended for you to respond to the caller, which we have mentioned, and we have mentioned the supplications...

Entering and exiting the lavatory and the supplications for ablution are in the Book of Purification. When you go out to the mosque, say: O Allah, place light in my heart, light on my tongue, light in my hearing, light in my sight, place light behind me, light before me, light above me. O Allah, grant me light. And also say: O Allah, I ask You by the right of those who ask of You, and by the right of my walking to You, for I have not gone out in arrogance, nor in vanity, nor for show, nor for reputation; I have gone out to avoid Your wrath and to seek Your pleasure. I ask You to save me from the Fire and to forgive me my sins, for none forgives sins but You. If you leave the house for a need, say: In the name of Allah, my Lord, I seek refuge in You from oppressing or being oppressed, or from acting ignorantly or having ignorance acted upon me. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. There is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. In the name of Allah, reliance is upon Allah. When you reach the mosque intending to enter, say: O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, and grant peace. O Allah, forgive me all my sins and open for me the doors of Your mercy. Enter with your right foot first. If you see in the mosque someone buying or selling, say: May Allah not grant profit to your trade. If you see someone announcing a lost item in the mosque, say: May Allah not return it to you. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, commanded this. When you have prayed the two rak'ahs of the dawn, say: In the name of Allah. O Allah, I ask You for a mercy from You by which You guide my heart... to the end, as we have reported it from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both, from the Prophet, peace be upon him. When you bow, say in your bowing: O Allah, to You I have bowed, to You I have submitted in humility, in You I have believed, to You I have submitted, and upon You I rely. You are my Lord. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bones, and my nerves have submitted in humility to Allah, Lord of the worlds. And if you wish, say: Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great, three times. Or: Most Glorious, Most Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit. When you raise your head from the bowing, say: Allah hears those who praise Him. Our Lord, to You is praise filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever You will thereafter. O Possessor of praise and glory, the truest thing a servant has said, and all of us are Your servants. None can withhold what You have given, and none can give what You have withheld. No possessor of fortune can avail himself against You. When you prostrate, say: O Allah, to You I have prostrated, in You I have believed, to You I have submitted. My face has prostrated to the One who created it, formed it, and gave it hearing and sight. So blessed is Allah, the Best of creators. O Allah, my darkness and my imagination have prostrated to You, and my heart has believed in You. I acknowledge Your blessings upon me, and I acknowledge my sin. This is what I have earned against myself, so forgive me, for none forgives sins but You. Or you may say: Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, three times. When you have finished the prayer, say: O Allah, You are Peace, and from You is peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor. And supplicate with all the supplications we have mentioned. When you rise from a gathering and wish for a supplication that expiates the idle talk of the gathering, say: Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. I bear witness that there is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You. I have done evil and wronged myself, so forgive me, for none forgives sins but You. When you enter the market, say: There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is Ever-Living and does not die. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things. In the name of Allah. O Allah, I ask You for the good of this market and the good that is in it. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil that is in it. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from making a false oath or a losing transaction therein. If you have a debt, say: O Allah, suffice me with what You have made lawful against what You have made unlawful, and enrich me by Your bounty from [relying on] anyone other than You. When you wear a new garment, say: O Allah, You have clothed me with this garment, so to You is all praise. I ask You for its good and the good for which it was made, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil for which it was made. If you see something of an ill omen that you dislike, say: O Allah, none brings good except You, and none removes evil except You. There is no power nor strength except with Allah. When you see the new moon, say: O Allah, let it rise upon us with security, faith, righteousness, safety, Islam, and success in what You love and are pleased with, and protection from whom You are displeased. My Lord and your Lord is Allah. And say: A crescent of guidance and good. I have believed in Your Creator. O Allah, I ask You for the good of this month and the good of the Decree, and I seek refuge in You from the evil of the Day of Assembly. And say Allahu Akbar three times before it. When the wind blows, say: O Allah, I ask You for the good of this wind, the good that is in it, and the good for which it was sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that is in it, and the evil for which it was sent. When news of someone's death reaches you, say: Indeed, to Allah we belong and indeed, to Him we will return. And indeed, to our Lord we are returning. O Allah, record him among the doers of good, place his record in 'Illiyyun, and grant him successors among those who remain. O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward, and do not test us after him, and forgive us and him.

When giving charity, say: "Our Lord, accept from us; indeed, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing." When facing loss, say: "Perhaps our Lord will give us better than this; indeed, we turn to our Lord in hope." At the beginning of matters, say: "Our Lord, grant us mercy from Yourself and facilitate for us right guidance in our affair." "My Lord, expand for me my breast and ease for me my task." When looking at the sky, say: "Our Lord, You did not create this in vain; glory be to You! So protect us from the punishment of the Fire." "Blessed is He who placed in the sky constellations and placed therein a radiant lamp and a luminous moon." If you hear the sound of thunder, say: "Glory be to Him whom thunder glorifies with His praise and the angels out of awe of Him." If you see lightning, say: "O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath, nor destroy us with Your punishment, and pardon us before that," as Ka'b said. When the sky rains, say: "O Allah, let it be a wholesome, beneficial downpour. O Allah, make it a downpour of mercy and not a downpour of punishment." When angered, say: "O Allah, forgive my sin, remove the anger from my heart, and protect me from the accursed Satan." When fearing a people, say: "O Allah, we place You before them, and we seek refuge in You from their evils." When going to battle, say: "O Allah, You are my support and my helper, and by You I fight." If your ear rings, send blessings upon Muhammad and say: "May Allah remember the one who remembers me with good." If you see your supplication answered, say: "Praise be to Allah by whose might and majesty good deeds are perfected." If it is delayed, say: "Praise be to Allah in every circumstance." When you hear the Maghrib call to prayer, say: "O Allah, this is the approach of Your night and the retreat of Your day, and the voices of Your callers and the presence of Your prayers; I ask You to forgive me." If grief befalls you, say: "O Allah, I am Your servant, son of Your servant, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is executed, Your decree concerning me is just. I ask You by every name that is Yours, with which You have named Yourself, or revealed in Your Book, or taught to any of Your creation, or kept with You in the knowledge of the unseen, that You make the Qur'an the spring of my heart, the light of my breast, the remover of my grief, and the dispeller of my sorrow and anxiety." The Prophet said: "No one is afflicted with grief and says this except that Allah will remove his grief and replace it with joy." It was said to him: "O Messenger of Allah, should we not learn it?" He said: "Yes, it is incumbent upon whoever hears it to learn it." If you find pain in your body or the body of another, treat it with the incantation of the Messenger of Allah: when a person was afflicted with a sore or wound, he would place his forefinger on the ground, then raise it and say: 'In the name of Allah, the dust of our land, with the saliva of some of us, our sick is healed by the permission of our Lord.'" If you find pain in your body, place your hand on the painful part and say: "In the name of Allah," three times, and say seven times: "I seek refuge in the might of Allah and His power from the evil of what I find and fear." If distress befalls you, say: "There is no deity but Allah, the Exalted, the Forbearing. There is no deity but Allah, Lord of the Magnificent Throne. There is no deity but Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Noble Throne." If you intend to sleep, perform ablution first, then lie on your right side facing the Qiblah, then glorify Allah thirty-four times, praise Him thirty-three times, and extol Him thirty-three times. Then say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your pardon from Your punishment. I seek refuge in You from You. O Allah, I cannot fully praise You even if I strive, but You are as You have praised Yourself. O Allah, by Your name I live and die. O Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth and Lord of all things and their Sovereign, Splitter of the seed and the grain, Revealer of the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an, I seek refuge in You from the evil of every evil thing, and from the evil of every creature You seize by its forelock. You are the First, so nothing is before You. You are the Last, so nothing is after You. You are the Manifest, so nothing is above You. You are the Hidden, so nothing is beneath You. Settle my debt and enrich me from poverty. O Allah, You created my soul and You take it; to You belongs its death and its life. O Allah, if You cause it to die, forgive it, and if You give it life, protect it. O Allah, I ask You for well-being in this world and the Hereafter. In Your name, my Lord, I lay down my side, so forgive me my sin. O Allah, protect me from Your punishment on the day You gather Your servants. O Allah, I submit myself to You, I turn my face to You, I entrust my affair to You, and I rely on my back to You, out of desire and fear of You. There is no refuge nor escape from You except to You. I believe in Your Book which You revealed and Your Prophet whom You sent." Let this be your final supplication, for the Messenger of Allah commanded that. And let him say before that: "O Allah, awaken me at the hour most beloved to You, and employ me in the deeds most beloved to You, drawing me near to You in closeness and distancing me from Your wrath far away. I ask You and You give me, I seek Your forgiveness and You forgive me, I call upon You and You answer me." When you awaken from sleep in the morning, say: "Praise be to Allah who gave us life after causing us to die, and to Him is the resurrection." We have entered the morning.

Sovereignty belongs to God, as does grandeur and dominion; might and power belong to God. We have awakened upon the natural disposition of Islam, the word of sincere devotion, and upon the religion of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the creed of our father Abraham, upright, and he was not of those who associate partners with God. O God, by You we have awakened, by You we enter the evening, by You we live, and by You we die, and to You is the ultimate return. O God, I ask You to send us forth on this day to every good, and we seek refuge in You from committing any evil therein or bringing it upon a Muslim, for You have said, "And He it is Who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day. Then He raises you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled."

O God, Splitter of the dawn, Maker of the night for rest, and the sun and moon for reckoning, I ask You for the good of this day and the good within it, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil within it. In the name of God, what God wills. There is no power except by God. What God wills. Every blessing is from God. What God wills. All good is in the hand of God. What God wills. None can avert evil except God. I am content with God as my Lord, with Islam as my religion, and with Muhammad (peace be upon him) as my Prophet. "Our Lord, in You we place our trust, and to You we turn, and to You is the final return."

And when he entered the evening, he would say the same, except he would say "we have entered the evening," and would add with that: I seek refuge in the perfect words of God and all His names from the evil of what He has created and brought forth, and from the evil of every possessor of evil, and from the evil of every creature whose forelock You take hold of. Indeed, my Lord is upon a straight path.

And when he looked in the mirror, he would say: Praise be to God who fashioned my creation and made it upright, honored the form of my face and made it beautiful, and made me among the Muslims.

And when you purchase a servant, a youth, or a beast, take hold of its forelock and say: O God, I ask You for its good and the good of its innate nature, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil of its innate nature.

And when you congratulate someone on marriage, say: May God bless you and bestow blessings upon you and unite you both in good.

And when you repay a debt, say to the one repaid: May God bless you in your family and your wealth, as he (peace be upon him) said: "The only recompense for a loan is praise and repayment."

These are supplications which the seeker cannot do without memorizing. As for other supplications for travel, prayer, and ablution, we have mentioned them in the Book of Pilgrimage, Prayer, and Purification.

If you were to say: What is the benefit of supplication when divine decree cannot be turned back? Know that part of divine decree is the repelling of affliction through supplication. Supplication is a means to repel affliction and attract mercy, just as a shield is a means to repel an arrow and water is a means for plants to emerge from the earth. So just as the shield pushes against the arrow and they contend, so too do supplication and affliction contend with one another. Acknowledging God's decree does not necessitate abandoning weapons, for God Almighty has said, "Take your precaution." Nor does it necessitate not watering the land after sowing seeds, saying, 'If decree has preceded with growth, the seed will grow, and if it has not preceded, it will not grow.' Rather, linking causes to their effects is the primordial decree, which is like the blink of an eye or closer. The detailed arrangement of effects according to their specific causes, through gradual stages and measure, is the determined destiny. He who decreed good decreed it with a cause, and He who decreed evil decreed a means to repel it. There is no contradiction in these matters for one whose inner sight has been opened.

Furthermore, in supplication there is the benefit we mentioned concerning remembrance, for it demands the presence of the heart with God, which is the ultimate aim of worship. Therefore, he (peace be upon him) said, "Supplication is the essence of worship." The predominant state of creation is that their hearts do not turn to the remembrance of God Almighty except when a need presses or a calamity overwhelms, for when evil touches man, he is full of extensive supplication. Need compels one to supplicate, and supplication returns the heart to God Almighty through humble entreaty and submission, thereby attaining remembrance, which is the most noble of worships. For this reason, affliction is entrusted particularly to the Prophets (peace be upon them), then the saints, then the most excellent among them, for it returns the heart, through neediness and entreaty, to God Almighty and prevents forgetfulness of Him. As for wealth, it is, in most cases, a cause for arrogance, for indeed man becomes transgressive when he sees himself self-sufficient.

This is what we intended to present from the collection of remembrances and supplications. God is the Granter of success for good. As for the remaining supplications for eating, travel, visiting the sick, and others, they will come in their proper places, God willing, and in God we place our trust.

Here ends the Book of Remembrances and Supplications in its entirety. It will be followed, God willing, by the Book of Regular Devotions. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, and may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and companions and grant them peace.

[3] A hadith: "No deed performed by a son of Adam is more saving for him from the punishment of Allah than the remembrance of Allah."

[14] A hadith: "No people sit in a sitting in which they do not remember Allah nor send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ, except that it will be a regret for them on the Day of Resurrection." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[15] A hadith: "A righteous gathering atones for the believer two million gatherings of evil gatherings." Mentioned by the author of al-Firdaws from the narration of Ibn Waddah, and it is *mursal*. His son did not report it, and likewise I did not find a chain for it.

[16] A hadith of Abu Hurayrah: He entered the marketplace and said, "I see you here, while the inheritance of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is being distributed in the mosque." So the people went to the mosque and left the marketplace. Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Mu'jam al-Saghir with a chain containing obscurity or discontinuity.

[17] A hadith: Al-A'mash from Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah or Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from him ﷺ, that he said: "Indeed Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has angels who roam the earth apart from the recorders of the people..." Al-Tirmidhi reported it from this avenue. The hadith is in the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah alone. It has preceded in the third chapter on Knowledge.

[18] The hadith "The best words I and the prophets before me have said are: 'There is no god but Allah'" has preceded in the second chapter of Hajj.

[19] The hadith "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs all sovereignty and all praise, and He is over all things competent' one hundred times" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[20] The hadith "There is no servant who performs ablution and perfects it, then raises his gaze to the sky and says, 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah...'" was reported from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir and has preceded in the chapter on purification.

[21] The hadith "The people of 'There is no god but Allah' will have no loneliness in their graves nor at the Resurrection" was reported by Abu Ya'la, al-Tabarani, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[22] The hadith "O Abu Hurayrah, every good deed you perform will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection except the testimony that there is no god but Allah, for it is not placed on a scale. If it were placed on a scale for one who says it sincerely, and the seven heavens and the seven earths and all within them were placed [on the other side], 'There is no god but Allah' would outweigh them." I [al-Ghazali] say: This testament of Abu Hurayrah is fabricated. The latter part of the hadith was narrated by al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat. "If 'There is no god but Allah' were placed [on one scale]..." is known from the narration of Abu Sa'id, attributed to the Prophet: "If the seven heavens and the seven earths were on one scale, they would be outweighed by 'There is no god but Allah'." Reported by al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who authenticated it.

[23] The hadith "If one came bearing 'There is no god but Allah' sincerely, with sins as much as the earth's fill, Allah would forgive him" is rare with this wording. Al-Tirmidhi has in a hadith from Anas: Allah says, "O son of Adam, if you were to come to Me with sins as much as the earth's fill, then meet Me associating nothing with Me, I would come to you with forgiveness as much as its fill." Abu al-Shaykh in al-Thawab from the narration of Anas: "O Lord, what is the reward for one who declares Your Oneness sincerely from his heart?" He said, "His reward is that he will be as on the day his mother bore him, free from sins." Its chain is broken.

[24] The hadith "O Abu Hurayrah, prompt the dying with the testimony that there is no god but Allah, for it demolishes sins" was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the path of Ibn al-Muqri from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. In it is Musa ibn Wardan, who is disputed. Abu Ya'la reported it from the narration of Anas with a weak chain. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in al-Muhtasirin from the narration of al-Hasan, as a mursal report.

[25] The hadith "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' sincerely will enter Paradise" was reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam with a weak chain.

[26] The hadith "You will all enter Paradise except whoever refuses and turns away from Allah as a camel turns away from its owner." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "All of my community will enter Paradise except whoever refuses." Al-Hakim added and authenticated: "and turns away from Allah as a camel turns away from its owner." Al-Bukhari said: They asked, "O Messenger of Allah, who would refuse?" He said, "Whoever obeys me enters Paradise, and whoever disobeys me has refused." Ibn 'Adi, Abu Ya'la, and al-Tabarani in al-Du'a' from his narration: "Increase in saying 'There is no god but Allah' before you are prevented from it." In it is also Ibn Wardan. Abu al-Shaykh in al-Thawab from the narration of al-Hakam ibn 'Umayr al-Thumali, mursal: "When you say 'There is no god but Allah,' which is the word of Tawhid..." Al-Hakam is weak. Abu Bakr ibn al-Dahhak in al-Shama'il from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud concerning responding to the caller to prayer: "O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the established prayer, grant Muhammad the means of nearness and excellence..." and "the call of truth and the word of sincerity." Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Ibn 'Umar concerning responding to the caller to prayer: "the call of truth." Al-Tabarani in al-Du'a' from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "The word of sincerity: 'There is no god but Allah'." Al-Tabarani from the narration of Salamah ibn al-Akwa': "And He has firmly established for them the word of piety" meaning 'There is no god but Allah'. Al-Tabarani in al-Du'a' from Ibn 'Abbas: "A good word" meaning the testimony that there is no god but Allah. And from him concerning His saying "the call of truth" meaning the testimony that there is no god but Allah. And from him: "He has grasped the most trustworthy handhold" meaning 'There is no god but Allah'. Ibn 'Adi and al-Mustaghfiri from the narration of Anas: "The price of Paradise is 'There is no god but Allah'." None of these are authentic.

[27] The hadith of al-Bara': "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner...'" was reported by al-Hakim who said its chain is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. It is in the Musnad of Ahmad without the phrase "ten times."

[28] Hadith of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever says one hundred times each day, 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner,'" the hadith was reported by Ahmad with the wording "one hundred," and similarly narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak, and its chain is good (jayyid). And thus it is in some copies of the Ihya'.

[29] Hadith: "Verily, when a servant says, 'There is no god but Allah,' it comes to his record and does not pass by any sin except that it erases it, until it finds a good deed like it and sits beside it." Reported by Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain.

[30] Hadith of Abu Ayyub: "Whoever says, 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent,' ten times, it is as if he has freed four persons from the descendants of Isma'il." Agreed upon.

[31] Hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: "Whoever wakes up at night and says, 'There is no god but Allah,'" the hadith. Narrated by al-Bukhari.

[32] Hadith: "Whoever glorifies (Allah) after every prayer thirty-three times," the hadith. Reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[33] Hadith: "Whoever says, 'Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him,' one hundred times, his sins are removed even if they were like the foam (zabd) of the sea." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[34] Hadith: "A man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, 'The world has turned away from me and my means have become few.' So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, 'Where are you concerning the prayer of the angels and the glorification of the creatures, and by it they are provided for?'" Reported by al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and he said it is strange (gharib) from the narration of Malik, and I do not know of any basis for it in the narration of Malik. And Ahmad has from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr that Nuh said to his son, "I command you with 'There is no god but Allah,'" the hadith, then he said, "and 'Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him,' for indeed it is the prayer of everything, and by it creation is provided for," and its chain is sound (sahih).

[35] Hadith: "When a servant says, 'All praise is due to Allah,' it fills what is between the heaven and the earth. And when he says, 'All praise is due to Allah,' a second time, it fills what is between the seventh heaven and the earth. And when he says, 'All praise is due to Allah,' a third time, Allah the Exalted says, 'Ask, you will be given.'" Strange (gharib) with this wording; I have not found it.

[36] Hadith of Rifa'ah al-Zarqi: "We were praying one day behind the Prophet (peace be upon him). When he raised his head from bowing and said, 'Allah hears those who praise Him,' a man behind him said, 'Our Lord, to You is all praise, abundant, good, and blessed praise.'" The hadith. Narrated by al-Bukhari.

[37] Hadith: "The enduring good deeds are: 'There is no god but Allah,' 'Glory be to Allah,' 'Allah is the Greatest,' 'All praise is due to Allah,' and 'There is no power nor strength except with Allah.'" Reported by al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id; and al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah without his saying, "and there is no power nor strength except with Allah."

[38] Hadith: "There is no man on earth who says, 'There is no god but Allah,' 'Allah is the Greatest,' 'Glory be to Allah,' 'All praise is due to Allah,' and 'There is no power nor strength except with Allah,' except that his sins are forgiven, even if they were like the foam (zabd) of the sea." Reported by al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and he said it is sound (sahih) according to the conditions of Muslim. It is also found in al-Tirmidhi who graded it good (hasan), and al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah in an abbreviated form without his saying, "Glory be to Allah and all praise is due to Allah."

[39] Hadith of al-Nu'man ibn Bashir: "Those who remember the majesty of Allah, glorify Him, magnify Him, declare His oneness, and praise Him, the Throne encircles them with a humming like the humming of bees, mentioning their companion." The hadith. Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who authenticated it according to the conditions of Muslim.

[40] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "For me to say, 'Glory be to Allah,' 'All praise is due to Allah,' 'There is no god but Allah,' and 'Allah is the Greatest' is more beloved to me than all that the sun rises upon." And in one narration it adds, "and 'There is no power nor strength except with Allah,'" and he said, "better than the world and all that is in it." Reported by Muslim with the first wording. And for al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat, from the narration of Malik ibn Dinar, that Abu Umamah said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "I said, 'Glory be to Allah,' 'All praise is due to Allah,' 'There is no god but Allah,' and 'Allah is the Greatest' is better than the world and all that is in it." He (the Prophet) said, "You are the most profitable of people." And it is a mursal hadith with a good chain (jayyid al-isnad).

[41] Hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub: "The speech most beloved to Allah is four," the hadith. Narrated by Muslim.

[42] The hadith of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari: Purity is half of faith, and "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to Allah) fills the scale. The hadith is narrated by Muslim and has preceded in the chapter on purification.

[43] The hadith of Abu Hurairah: Two phrases light on the tongue... The hadith is agreed upon.

[44] The hadith of Abu Dharr: "Which speech is most beloved to Allah?" He said: "That which Allah has chosen for His angels: 'Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, Subhanallahil-'Adheem' (Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him, Glory be to Allah the Almighty)." Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, and al-Nasa'i. His statement: "Glory be to Allah the Almighty."

[45] The hadith: "Allah has chosen from speech: 'Subhanallah, walhamdulillah' (Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah)..." Al-Nasa'i recorded it in "Al-Yawm wal-Laylah" and al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim and authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'id, except that they said regarding the reward of "Alhamdulillah": "Thirty good deeds are recorded for him and thirty bad deeds are removed from him."

[46] The hadith of Jabir: "Whoever says 'Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi' (Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him), a palm tree is planted for him in Paradise." Recorded by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *hasan* (good), and by al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wal-Laylah", Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim and authenticated it.

[47] The hadith of Abu Dharr: The poor said to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: "The wealthy have taken the rewards; they pray as we pray..." The hadith is narrated by Muslim.

[48] The hadith of Abu Dharr: I said to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: "Those with wealth have surpassed us in reward; they say as we say and they spend while we do not spend..." The hadith is narrated by Ibn Majah, except that he said: "Sufyan said: 'I do not know which of them is four.'" And in Ahmad's version of this hadith: "...and you praise thirty-four times," and its chain is *jayyid* (sound). And in Abu al-Shaykh's "Al-Thawab" from the hadith of Abu al-Darda': "...and you magnify thirty-four times," as mentioned by the author.

[49] The hadith of Basrah: "You must engage in glorification (tasbih), declaring His Oneness (tahlil), and sanctification (taqdis), and do not be heedless, and count with the fingertips, for they will be questioned." Recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim with a *jayyid* (sound) chain.

[50] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "I saw him, peace be upon him, counting the glorification..." I said: "It is actually 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As," as narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan* (good), and al-Hakim.

[51] The hadith of Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'id: "When a servant says 'La ilaha illallah, wallahu Akbar' (There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest), Allah says: 'My servant has spoken the truth...'" Recorded by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *hasan* (good), and by al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wal-Laylah", Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who authenticated it.

[52] The hadith of Mus'ab ibn Sa'd from his father: "Is any one of you incapable of earning a thousand good deeds every day?..." Recorded by Muslim, except that he said: "...or removed," as mentioned by the author, and he said it is *hasan sahih* (good and authentic).

[53] The hadith: "O 'Abdullah ibn Qays, or O Abu Musa, shall I not guide you to a treasure from the treasures of Paradise?" He said: "Certainly." He said: "Say: 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' (There is no power and no strength except with Allah)." Agreed upon.

[54] The hadith of Abu Hurairah: "A deed from the treasure of Paradise and from beneath the Throne is saying: 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' (There is no power and no strength except with Allah). Allah says: 'My servant has submitted and surrendered.'" Al-Nasa'i recorded it in "Al-Yawm wal-Laylah" and al-Hakim from: "Whoever says: 'Subhanallah, walhamdulillah, wa la ilaha illallah, wallahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah' (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is the Greatest, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah), He says: 'My servant has submitted and surrendered.'" And he said its chain is authentic.

[55] The hadith: "Whoever says when he reaches the morning: 'Radheetu billahi Rabban...' (I am pleased with Allah as my Lord...)" Recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wal-Laylah", and al-Hakim who said its chain is authentic from the hadith of the Prophet's servant, peace be upon him. And al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Thawban and graded it *hasan* (good), but there is an issue in it, for in it is Sa'd ibn al-Marzaban, who is very weak.

[56] The hadith indicating that remembrance from a heedless heart is of little benefit. Recorded by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *hasan* (good), and al-Hakim who said: "A hadith with a straightforward chain," from the hadith of Abu Hurairah: "And know that Allah does not accept supplication from a heedless heart."

[57] The hadith: "Indeed, the Holy Spirit (Ruh al-Qudus) inspired in my heart: 'Love whom you love, for you will part with him.'" This has preceded in the seventh book of knowledge.

[58] The hadith: "The grave is either a pit from the pits of Hellfire or a garden from the gardens of Paradise." Recorded by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with some transposition and he said it is *gharib* (rare). I say: In it is 'Ubaydullah ibn al-Walid al-Wasafi, who is weak.

[59] The hadith concerning the spirits of the martyrs being in the crops of green birds was reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, who was asked about this verse: "And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead..." He said, "We indeed asked about that, and he said, 'Their spirits are in the bellies of green birds,'" but he did not name the Prophet (peace be upon him) in it. In the narration of al-Tirmidhi: "We indeed asked about that, and he informed us..." The author of *Musnad al-Firdaws* mentioned that Ibn Mani' explicitly stated its attribution to the Prophet in his *Musnad*.

[60] The hadith concerning his call to the slain of Badr from among the polytheists, "O so-and-so, O so-and-so"—and he named them—"I have found what my Lord promised me to be true; have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?" was reported by Muslim from the narration of Anas.

[61] The hadith concerning the spirits of the believers being in the crops of green birds suspended beneath the Throne was reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Ka'b bin Malik: "The spirits of the believers are in the crops of green birds, hanging from the trees of Paradise." Al-Nasa'i reported with the wording, "Indeed, the soul of the believer is a bird." Al-Tirmidhi reported it with the wording, "The spirits of the martyrs," and said it is *hasan sahih*.

[62] The hadith, "Shall I not give you glad tidings, O Jabir?" He said, "Yes, may Allah give you glad tidings of good." He said, "Allah has revived your father and seated him before Him, with no veil between them." Then the Almighty said, "Ask of Me..." The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan*, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain from the narration of Jabir.

[63] The hadith concerning the man who fights to attain wealth, or to be called brave, or other than that, is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Musa: A man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "A man fights for fame, a man fights for spoils, and a man fights to show his position; so who is in the cause of Allah?" He said, "Whoever fights so that the word of Allah may be supreme, he is in the cause of Allah."

[64] The hadith concerning the superiority of "La ilaha illa Allah" over all other remembrances was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan*, and by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and Ibn Majah from the narration of Jabir.

[65] The hadith of al-Nu'man bin Bashir, "Supplication is worship," was reported by the authors of the *Sunan* and al-Hakim, who said its chain is *sahih*, and al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan sahih*.

[66] The hadith, "Supplication is the marrow of worship," was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Anas, and he said it is *gharib* from this angle; we do not know it except from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah.

[67] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah, "Nothing is more honorable to Allah than supplication," was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *gharib*, and by Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who said its chain is *sahih*.

[68] The hadith, "The servant is not deprived of his supplication without one of three things: either a sin is forgiven for him, or a good is hastened for him, or a good is stored for him," was reported by al-Daylami in *al-Firdaws* from the narration of Anas, and in it is Ruh... Ibn Musafir reported it from Aban bin 'Ayyash, and both are weak. Ahmad and al-Bukhari in *al-Adab* and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, reported from the narration of Abu Sa'id: "Either his supplication is hastened for him, or it is stored for him in the Hereafter, or an equivalent evil is averted from him."

[69] The hadith, "Ask Allah of His bounty, for Allah loves to be asked, and the best worship is awaiting relief," was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and he said Hammad bin Waqid is not a strong memorizer. I say: Ibn Ma'in and others weakened it.

[70] The hadith, "Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains..." is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[71] The hadith, "Supplication between the adhan and the iqamah is not rejected," was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, and al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as *hasan*, from the narration of Anas. Ibn 'Adi and Ibn al-Qattan weakened it. He reported it in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* with another good chain, and Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim authenticated it.

[72] The hadith, "The supplication of the fasting person is not rejected," was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan*, and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with an addition in it.

[73] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah, "The closest a servant is to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so increase supplication therein," was reported by Muslim.

[74] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, "I have been forbidden to recite the Quran while bowing or prostrating..." was also reported by Muslim.

[75] The hadith of Jabir: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was brought to the standing place at 'Arafah, and he faced the direction of prayer. He continued supplicating until the sun set. Muslim transmitted this hadith, though without the phrase "supplicating," stating instead "standing" in its place. Al-Nasa'i transmitted it from the hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd: "I was riding behind him at 'Arafat, and he raised his hands in supplication." Its narrators are trustworthy.

[76] The hadith of Salman: "Verily, your Lord is Modest and Generous; He is too modest to let His servant return his hands empty when he raises them to Him." Transmitted by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan* (good), Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who said its chain is sound according to their conditions.

[77] The hadith of Anas: "He would raise his hands until the whiteness of his armpits was seen in supplication, and he would not point with his finger." Muslim transmitted it without the phrase "and he would not point with his finger." The hadith is agreed upon, but it is specified as being for the prayer for rain (*istisqa'*).

[78] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: He passed by a man supplicating with his two index fingers. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Make it one, make it one." Transmitted by al-Nasa'i who said it is *hasan* (good), and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who said its chain is sound.

[79] The hadith of 'Umar: "When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stretched forth his hands in supplication, he would not withdraw them until he had wiped his face with them." Transmitted by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *gharib* (rare/unique), and by al-Hakim in *al-Mustadrak* who remained silent on it, and it is weak.

[80] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "When he, peace and blessings be upon him, supplicated, he would bring his palms together, placing their inner surfaces facing his face." Transmitted by al-Tabarani in *al-Kabir* with a weak chain.

[81] The hadith: "Let people desist from raising their sights to the sky during supplication, or their sights will surely be snatched away." Transmitted by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said "during supplication in the prayer."

[82] The hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: "O people, verily the One you call upon is not deaf nor absent." Agreed upon with variations; the wording mentioned by the author is from Abu Dawud.

[83] The hadith of 'A'ishah regarding His saying, the Exalted: "And do not be loud in your prayer, nor be silent in it" meaning: in your supplication. Agreed upon.

[84] The hadith: "There will be a people who transgress in supplication," and in a narration, "and in purification." Transmitted by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal.

[85] The hadith: "Beware of rhymed prose in supplication. It is sufficient for one of you to say: 'O God, I ask You for Paradise and that which brings near to it of word and deed, and I seek refuge in You from the Fire and that which brings near to it of word and deed.'" It is *gharib* (rare/unique) with this context. Al-Bukhari has from Ibn 'Abbas: "And look at rhymed prose in supplication and avoid it, for I witnessed the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, doing only that." Also by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim—the wording is his—who said its chain is sound, from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "You should use the complete supplications," and in it is "and I ask You for Paradise" to the end.

[86] The hadith: "I ask You for security on the Day of Threat, and for Paradise on the Day of Eternity, with those brought near, the witnesses, those who bow and prostrate, who fulfill their covenants. Verily, You are Merciful, Loving, and You do what You will." Transmitted by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say one night when he had finished his prayer..." then he mentioned a long hadith containing this phrase, and said: "A *gharib* (rare) hadith." It contains Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla, who had poor memory.

[87] The hadith: "When God loves a servant, He tests him until He hears his earnest plea." Transmitted by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of Anas: "When God loves a servant, He pours trials upon him..." and in it is: "Leave him, for I love to hear his voice." And by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Abu Umamah: "God says to the angels: 'Go to My servant and pour trials upon him...'" and in it is: "for I love to hear his voice." The chains of both are weak.

[88] The hadith: "Let none of you say, 'O God, forgive me if You will; O God, have mercy on me if You will.' Rather, let him be decisive in his request, for there is none who can compel Him." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[89] The hadith: "When one of you supplicates, let him be great in his desire, for nothing is too great for God." Transmitted by Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[90] The hadith: "Supplicate to God while being certain of the response, and know that God does not respond to a supplication from a heedless heart." Transmitted by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said it is *gharib* (rare), and by al-Hakim who said its chain is upright. It is uniquely narrated by Salih al-Murri, one of the ascetics of Basra. I say: However, he is weak in hadith.

[91] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "When he, peace and blessings be upon him, supplicated, he would supplicate three times, and when he asked, he would ask three times." Narrated by Muslim.

Its origin is agreed upon.
[92] A hadith: The supplication of any one of you is answered as long as he does not become hasty, saying, 'I supplicated but it was not answered for me.' Agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.
[93] A hadith: When any one of you asks for something and recognizes the response, let him say, 'Praise be to Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are perfected.' And if something of that is delayed for him, let him say, 'Praise be to Allah in every circumstance.' Al-Bayhaqi recorded it in *Al-Da'awat* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and Al-Hakim recorded something similar from the narration of 'A'ishah, abbreviated, with a weak chain.
[94] A hadith of Salamah ibn al-Akwa': I never heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, begin a supplication except that he began it by saying, 'Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Bestower.' Ahmad and Al-Hakim recorded it, and he said its chain is authentic. I say: In it is 'Umar ibn Rashid al-Yamani, whom the majority considered weak.
[95] A hadith: When you ask Allah for a need, begin by sending blessings upon me, for Allah the Exalted is more generous than that He is asked for two needs and grants one and rejects the other. I did not find it attributed to the Prophet; rather, it is a statement stopped at Abu al-Darda'.
[96] A hadith: That he, peace and blessings be upon him, came one day with glad tidings visible on his face and said, "Indeed, Jibril, upon him be peace, came to me and said, 'Are you not pleased, O Muhammad, that no one from your nation sends blessings upon you except that I send blessings upon him ten times, and no one from your nation greets you with peace except that I greet him with peace ten times?'" Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban recorded it from the narration of Abu Talhah with a good chain.
[97] A hadith: Whoever sends blessings upon me, the angels send blessings upon him as long as he sends blessings, so let a servant do a little or a lot of that. Ibn Majah recorded it from the narration of 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah with a weak chain, and Al-Tabarani in *Al-Awsat* with a good chain.
[98] A hadith: The most deserving of people of me are those who send the most blessings upon me. Al-Tirmidhi recorded it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud and said it is good and rare, and Ibn Hibban [recorded it].
[99] A hadith: It is sufficient as miserliness for a man that I am mentioned in his presence and he does not send blessings upon me. Qasim ibn Asbagh recorded it from the narration of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali like this, and Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban from the narration of his brother al-Husayn: The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned and he does not send blessings upon me. Al-Tirmidhi recorded it from the narration of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali from his father and said it is good and authentic.
[100] A hadith: Send abundant blessings upon me on the day of Friday. Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim recorded it, and he said it is authentic according to the condition of Al-Bukhari, from the narration of Aws ibn Aws. Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned it in *Al-'Ilal* and reported from his father that it is a rejected hadith.
[101] A hadith: Whoever from my nation sends blessings upon me, ten good deeds are recorded for him and ten evil deeds are erased from him. Al-Nasa'i recorded it in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of 'Amr ibn Dinar, adding in it: 'Sincerely from his heart, Allah sends blessings upon him with it ten times and raises him by it ten degrees.' And in *Al-Siyar* and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Anas is something similar, without his saying 'sincerely from his heart' and without mentioning the erasure of evil deeds, and Ibn Hibban also did not mention the raising of degrees.
[102] A hadith: Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer and the iqamah: 'O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the established prayer, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Messenger, and grant him the Wasilah and the Fadilah and intercession on the Day of Resurrection,' my intercession becomes due for him. Al-Bukhari recorded it from the narration of Jabir without mentioning the iqamah, intercession, and sending blessings upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said 'the call.' And Al-Mustaghfiri in *Al-Da'awat* [recorded it] 'when he hears the call to prayer.' Ibn Wahb added the mention of prayer and intercession in it with a weak chain. And Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Ma'mari in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Abu al-Darda' added the mention of prayer in it. And for him and for Al-Mustaghfiri in *Al-Da'awat* is a weak chain from the narration of Abu Rafi': The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when he heard the call to prayer... and he mentioned a hadith concerning it. And when he said 'the prayer has been established,' he said: 'O Allah, Lord of this perfect call...' the hadith, and he added: 'and accept his intercession for his nation.' And Muslim [recorded] from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: When you hear the mu'adhdhin, say as he says, then send blessings upon me, then ask Allah for me the Wasilah. And in it: So whoever asks for the Wasilah, intercession becomes due for him.

[103] Hadith: Whoever sends blessings upon me in a book, the angels do not cease to seek forgiveness for him as long as my name remains in that book. Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, Abu al-Shaykh in al-Thawab, and al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

[104] Hadith: Verily, on the earth are angels who roam, conveying to me the greetings of my community. Mentioned previously at the end of the chapter on Hajj.

[105] Hadith: There is no one who sends greetings of peace upon me except that Allah returns my spirit to me so that I may return the greeting to him. Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain.

[106] Hadith: It was said to him, "O Messenger of Allah, how should we send blessings upon you?" He said, "Say: O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon his family, his wives, and his progeny." The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hamid al-Sa'idi.

[107] Hadith of 'Umar concerning the yearning of the palm trunk, the gushing of water from between his fingers, his night journey on al-Buraq to the seventh heaven, then praying the dawn prayer that same night at al-Abtah, the speaking of the poisoned sheep, that his face was wounded and his incisor was broken, so he said, "O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know," and that he wore wool, rode a donkey with someone mounted behind him, placed his food on the ground, and licked his fingers. It is lengthy and singular in its full form from the narration of 'Umar, though it is known from other avenues. The hadith of the yearning of the palm trunk is agreed upon from the narration of Jabir and Ibn 'Umar. The hadith of the gushing of water from between his fingers is agreed upon from the narration of Anas and others. The hadith of the night journey is agreed upon from the narration of Anas, without mention of praying the dawn prayer at al-Abtah. The hadith of the speaking of the poisoned sheep is reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Jabir, but its chain is interrupted. The hadith that his face was wounded and his incisor was broken is agreed upon from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd concerning the Battle of Uhud. The hadith, "O Allah, forgive my people, for they do not know," is reported by al-Bayhaqi in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah, and the hadith in the Sahih from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud is that he ﷺ narrated it concerning a prophet among the prophets whose people struck him. The hadith of wearing wool is reported by al-Tayalisi from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd. The hadith of his riding a donkey with someone mounted behind him is agreed upon from the narration of Usamah ibn Zayd. The hadith of placing his food on the ground is reported by Ahmad in al-Zuhd from the narration of al-Hasan as a mursal report, and al-Bukhari has from the narration of Anas: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ never ate from a raised dining table." The hadith of licking his fingers is reported by Muslim from the narrations of Ka'b ibn Malik and Anas ibn Malik.

[108] Hadith: The Prophet ﷺ would frequently say, "Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. O Allah, forgive me, verily You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful." Reported by al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and he said it is sahih if Abu 'Ubaydah heard it from his father. The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah that he would frequently say that in his bowing and prostration, without the phrase, "verily You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful."

[109] Hadith: Whoever increases in seeking forgiveness, Allah will appoint for him a way out from every distress, and relief from every grief, and will provide for him from where he does not expect. Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sahih, from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, though Ibn Hibban considered it weak.

[110] Hadith: Verily, I seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to Him more than seventy times a day. Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, except that he said, "more than seventy." It is in al-Du'a' by al-Tabarani as mentioned by the author.

[111] Hadith: Verily, a covering comes over my heart, so much so that I seek forgiveness from Allah one hundred times a day. Reported by Muslim from the narration of al-Agharr.

[112] Hadith: Whoever says when he goes to his bed, "I seek forgiveness from Allah, the Magnificent, besides whom there is no deity, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I repent to Him," three times, Allah will forgive his sins even if they were like the foam of the sea. The hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id, and he said it is gharib; we do not know it except from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn al-Walid al-Wasafi. I say: Al-Wasafi, even if he is weak, he was corroborated by 'Issam ibn Qudamah, who is trustworthy. Al-Bukhari reported it in al-Tarikh without the phrase "when he goes to his bed" and without "three times."

[113] Hadith: Whoever says that, his sins will be forgiven even if he was fleeing from the battlefield. Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Zayd, the freed slave of the Prophet ﷺ, and he said it is gharib. I say: Its narrators are reliable. Ibn Mas'ud and al-Hakim reported it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, and he said it is sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[114] Hadith of Hudhayfah: "I used to be sharp-tongued with my family." The hadith includes: "Where are you in relation to seeking forgiveness?" Reported by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim who said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[115] Hadith of 'A'ishah: "If you have committed a sin, then seek forgiveness from Allah, for repentance from sin is remorse and seeking forgiveness." Agreed upon, without the phrase "for repentance..." He added: "Or repent to Him, for when a servant confesses his sin and then repents, Allah accepts his repentance." And in al-Tabarani's *al-Du'a'*: "When a servant sins and then seeks forgiveness from Allah, He forgives him."

[116] Hadith: He used to say: "O Allah, forgive me my misstep, my ignorance, my excess in my affairs, and that which You know better than I. O Allah, forgive me my seriousness and my jest." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa, and the wording is Muslim's.

[117] Hadith of 'Ali from Abu Bakr: "There is no servant who commits a sin, then performs ablution well, then stands and prays two rak'ahs, then seeks forgiveness from Allah, except that Allah forgives him." Reported by the authors of the *Sunan*, and al-Tirmidhi graded it as *hasan*.

[118] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When a believer commits a sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents, desists, and seeks forgiveness, his heart is polished..." The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi who authenticated it, al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim.

[119] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Allah will elevate a servant a degree in Paradise, and he will say, 'O Lord, how did I attain this?' He will say, 'Through your child seeking forgiveness for you.'" Reported by Ahmad with a *hasan* chain.

[120] Hadith of 'A'ishah: "O Allah, make me among those who, when they do good, rejoice, and when they do wrong, seek forgiveness." Reported by Ibn Majah. In its chain is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an, who is disputed.

[121] Hadith: "When a servant sins and then says, 'O Allah, forgive me,' Allah says, 'My servant has committed a sin and knows that he has a Lord who takes to account for sin and forgives sin...'" Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[122] Hadith: "He is not persistent (in sin) who seeks forgiveness, even if he repeats it seventy times a day." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Bakr, who said it is *gharib* and its chain is not strong.

[123] Hadith: "A man who had never done any good looked at the sky and said, 'I have a Lord. O Lord, forgive me.' Allah the Exalted said, 'I have forgiven you.'" I have not found a primary source for it.

[124] Hadith: "Whoever sins while knowing that Allah is aware of him, He forgives him even if he does not seek forgiveness." Reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.

[125] Hadith: Allah says: "O My servants, all of you are sinners except whom I have protected. So seek forgiveness from Me, I will forgive you. And whoever knows that I have the power to forgive him, I forgive him, and I do not mind." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Dharr. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan*, and its origin is in Muslim with different wording.

[126] Hadith: "Whoever says, 'Glory be to You, I have wronged myself and done evil, so forgive me, for none forgives sins except You,' his sins are forgiven, even if they were like the number of ants." Reported by al-Bayhaqi in *al-Da'awat* from the hadith of 'Ali: that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, "Shall I not teach you words which, if you say them, even if your sins were like the number of ants or like the number of tiny ants, Allah would forgive them for you?" He mentioned it with the addition of "There is no god but You" at the beginning. In its chain is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[127] Hadith: "The best supplication for forgiveness is: 'O Allah, You are my Lord and I am Your servant. I am upon Your covenant and promise as best I can...'" Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Shaddad ibn Aws, without the phrases: "and I have wronged myself," "and I have confessed my sin," and without: "my sins, those I have committed and those I have delayed," and without: "all of them."

[128] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "O Allah, I ask You for mercy from You by which You guide my heart, gather my affairs, and mend my disarray..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi who said it is *gharib*. He did not mention at its beginning the sending of al-'Abbas to his son 'Abdullah, nor his sleeping in the house of Maymunah. This addition is in al-Tabarani's *al-Du'a'*.

[129] Hadith: His saying to 'A'ishah: "You should use the comprehensive, complete supplications. Say: 'O Allah, I ask You for all good, its immediate and its deferred, that which I know of it and that which I do not know...'" Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim who authenticated it, from her hadith.

[130] Hadith: "O Fatimah, what prevents you from hearing what I advise you? That you say: 'O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining...'"

By Your mercy I seek aid; do not entrust me to myself for the blink of an eye, and rectify all my affairs. Narrated by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and by al-Hakim from the hadith of Anas, who said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[131] The hadith: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, taught Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, to say: O God, I ask You by Muhammad, Your Prophet, and by Abraham, Your intimate friend, and by Moses, Your confidant, and by Jesus, Your Word... The hadith concerning the supplication for preserving the Qur'an. Narrated by Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban in *Kitab al-Thawab* from the narration of 'Abd al-Malik ibn Harun ibn 'Abtharah from his father that Abu Bakr came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said: I am learning the Qur'an but it slips away from me... and he mentioned it. 'Abd al-Malik and his father are weak, and there is a break in the chain between Harun and Abu Bakr.

[132] The hadith: O Buraydah, shall I not teach you words which, if God desires good for someone, He teaches them to him?... The hadith. Narrated by al-Hakim from the hadith of Buraydah, who said its chain is authentic.

[133] The hadith: Indeed, Qabisah ibn al-Mukhariq said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: Teach me words by which God may benefit me, for my age has advanced and I have become weak... The hadith. Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and it is found in Ahmad in *al-Musnad* in an abbreviated form from the hadith of Qabisah himself, and in it is a man who is not named.

[138] The hadith: I am pleased with God as Lord... The hadith. Previously mentioned in the first chapter of the remembrances.

[139] The hadith: O God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, Lord and Sovereign of everything, I bear witness that there is no god but You. I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul, from the evil of Satan, and from his partnership. Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it authentic, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim who graded it authentic, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that Abu Bakr al-Siddiq said: O Messenger of God, instruct me with words to say when I enter the morning and when I enter the evening. He said: Say: O God... and he mentioned it.

[140] The hadith: O God, I ask You for well-being in my religion, my worldly life, my family, and my wealth. O God, cover my faults, calm my fears, forgive my stumbles, and protect me from before me and from behind me, from my right and from my left, and from above me, and I seek refuge in Your majesty from being taken from beneath me. Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, who said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, would not omit these words when he entered the evening and when he entered the morning.

Narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, without the phrase "and do not entrust me to other than You," and its chain is weak.

[142] The hadith: O God, You are my Lord, there is no god but You. You created me and I am Your servant, and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as best I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge Your favor upon me, and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for none forgives sins but You. Narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Shaddad ibn Aws, and it has been previously mentioned.

His saying, "And You are the Knower of the unseen," was reported by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the hadith of Shaddad ibn Aws. I say: Rather, it is interrupted and weak.

[146] The hadith, "O Allah, forgive me what I have sent forth and what I have left behind, what I have concealed and what I have made public..." up to his saying, "and a Witness over every unseen thing," is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa, excluding his saying, "and a Witness over every unseen thing." It has preceded in the second chapter of this book.

[147] The hadith, "O Allah, I ask You for faith that does not turn back, bliss that does not perish, and the coolness of the eye for eternity..." The hadith was reported by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and by al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, excluding his saying, "and the coolness of the eye for eternity," and he said its chain is sound. And al-Nasa'i from the hadith of 'Ammar ibn Yasir with a good chain: "and I ask You for bliss that does not vanish and a coolness of the eye that does not cease."

[148] The hadith, "O Allah, I ask You for good things and the doing of good deeds..." up to his saying, "without being put to trial," was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Mu'adh: "O Allah, I ask You for the doing of good deeds..." and he said it is *hasan sahih*. He did not mention "the good things," and it is in the supplication of al-Tabarani from the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'A'ish. Abu Hatim said: He did not have companionship [with the Prophet].

[149] The hadith, "O Allah, I ask You by Your knowledge of the unseen and Your power over creation, grant me life as long as life is good for me..." up to his saying, "and make us guides, rightly guided," was reported by al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, from the hadith of 'Ammar ibn Yasir.

[151] The hadith, "O Allah, fill our faces with shame before You, and our hearts with joy in You..." up to his saying, "and make us more in awe of You than of anyone else," I have not found a source for it.

[152] The hadith, "O Allah, make the beginning of this day of ours righteousness, its middle success, and its end prosperity. O Allah, make its beginning mercy, its middle blessing, and its end honor," was reported by 'Abd ibn Humayd in *al-Muntakhab* and al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn Awfa with only the first part up to his saying "prosperity," and its chain is weak.

[153] The hadith, "Praise be to Allah, before Whose greatness everything humbles itself, and before Whose might everything submits..." up to his saying, "and before Whose majesty everything is diminished," was reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain, excluding his saying, "and Praise be to Allah, before Whose awe everything is still" to its end. Likewise, he narrated it in *al-Du'a'* from the hadith of Umm Salamah, and its chain is also weak.

[154] The hadith, "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, his wives, and his progeny..." up to his saying, "the Praiseworthy, the Glorious," has preceded in the second chapter.

[155] The hadith, "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant, Your Prophet, and Your Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, the Messenger to the unlettered, and grant him the Praiseworthy Station on the Day of Judgment." I have not found it with this wording combined. Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Your Messenger." And Ibn Hibban, al-Daraqutni, al-Hakim, and al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, the unlettered Prophet." And al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Jabir: "and raise him to the Praiseworthy Station which You have promised him." And it is in al-Bukhari with the wording: "and raise him to a praiseworthy station." Al-Daraqutni said its chain is *hasan*. Al-Hakim said it is sound. Al-Bayhaqi said in *al-Ma'rifah* its chain is sound.

[156] The hadith, "O Allah, make us among Your pious allies and Your successful party..." up to his saying, "turn us by Your good choosing for us," I have not found a source for it.

[157] The hadith, "We ask You for the comprehensive aspects of good, its openings and its closings, and we seek refuge in You from the comprehensive aspects of evil, its openings and its closings," was reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Umm Salamah that he used to supplicate with these words. Among them he mentioned: "O Allah, I ask You for the openings of good and its closings, its beginning and its end, its outward and its inward, and the highest degrees of Paradise. Amen." In it is 'Asim ibn 'Ubayd; I do not know of anyone who narrated from him except Musa ibn 'Uqbah.

[158] The hadith, "O Allah, by Your power over me, accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful. And by Your forbearance toward me, pardon..."

Indeed, none forgives sins but You." Al-Bayhaqi reported it in *Al-Da'awat* from a narration of 'Ali, without the phrase "my sin, for You are my Lord." It has preceded in the second chapter.

[160] The hadith: "O Allah, inspire me with right guidance and protect me from the evil of my soul." Al-Tirmidhi reported it from a narration of 'Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet (ﷺ) taught it to Husayn, and he said it is *hasan gharib*. Al-Nasa'i reported it in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and Al-Hakim from a narration of Husayn, the father of 'Imran, and he said it is *sahih* according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[161] The hadith: "O Allah, provide for me with lawful provision that You will not punish me for, make me content with what You have provided me, and employ me in doing good with it that You accept from me." Al-Hakim reported it from a narration of Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (ﷺ) would supplicate: "O Allah, make me content with what You have provided me, bless me in it, and replace for me every absent thing with good." He said its chain is *sahih*, but the two (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not report it.

[162] The hadith: "O Allah, I ask You for pardon, well-being, safety, and goodly certainty in this world and the Hereafter." Al-Nasa'i reported it from a narration of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq with the wording: "Ask Allah for safety (*al-ma'afah*), for no one has been given anything after certainty better than safety." In a narration of Al-Bayhaqi: "Ask Allah for pardon, well-being, and certainty in the first and the last, for the servant is not given after certainty anything better than well-being." In a narration of Ahmad: "I ask Allah for pardon and well-being."

[163] The hadith: "O You whom sins do not harm and forgiveness does not diminish, grant me what does not harm You and give me what does not diminish You." Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from a narration of 'Ali with a weak chain.

[164] The hadith: "My Lord, forgive me and my parents, have mercy upon them as they raised me when I was small, and forgive the believing men and believing women, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the living among them and the dead." Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah reported it with a good chain from a narration of Abu Usayd al-Sa'idi. A man from Banu Salamah asked, "Is there anything left for me to do in being dutiful to my parents?" He said, "Yes, praying for them and seeking forgiveness for them..." The hadith. Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban in *Al-Thawab* and Al-Mustaghfiri in *Al-Da'awat* reported from a narration of Anas: "Whoever seeks forgiveness for the believing men and believing women, Allah will return to him (a reward) for every believer who has passed from the beginning of time or who will be until the Day of Resurrection." Its chain is weak. In the *Sahih* of Ibn Hibban from a narration of Abu Sa'id: "Any Muslim man who has no charity to give, let him say in his supplication: 'O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Messenger, and send blessings upon the believing men and believing women, the Muslim men and Muslim women,' for it is charity."

[165] The hadith: "My Lord, forgive, have mercy, and overlook what You know, for You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous, and You are the Best of the merciful and the Best of those who forgive." Ahmad reported it from a narration of Umm Salamah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: "My Lord, forgive, have mercy, and guide me to the straightest path." In it is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an, who is disputed. Al-Tabarani reported in *Al-Du'a'* from a narration of Ibn Mas'ud that he (ﷺ) used to say when walking in the bed of a valley: "O Allah, forgive and have mercy, for You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous." In it is Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, who is disputed. It is also reported as his statement (*mawquf*) with a sound chain.

[166] The hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from miserliness, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice, and I seek refuge in You from being returned to the most abject age, and I seek refuge in You from the trial of this world, and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave." Al-Bukhari reported it from a narration of Sa'id ibn Abi Waqqas.

[167] The hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a disposition that leads to covetousness, and from covetousness for what is unattainable, and from covetousness where there is nothing to covet." Ahmad and Al-Hakim reported it from a narration of Mu'adh, and he said its chain is sound (*mustaqim al-isnad*).

[168] The hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from knowledge that does not benefit, a heart that does not humble itself, a supplication that is not heard..." the hadith up to "...and salvation from the Fire." Al-Hakim reported it from a narration of Ibn Mas'ud and said its chain is *sahih*, but it is not as he said. However, it is reported separately in hadiths with good chains.

[169] The hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from destruction, and I seek refuge in You from grief..." the hadith up to "...and I seek refuge in You from dying while seeking this world." Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Al-Hakim reported it, and he authenticated its chain, from a narration of Abu al-Yusr, whose name is Ka'b ibn 'Umar, with an addition in it, without the phrase "and I seek refuge in You from dying while..."

One seeks worldly life, yet from al-Bukhari comes the supplication for refuge from the trial of this world.  
[170] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I know and from the evil of what I do not know." I said: This is recorded in some copies as "what I know," but it is actually "what I have done." And "what I have done" is recorded thus. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and Abu Bakr ibn al-Dahhak in "Al-Shama'il" in a mursal hadith concerning seeking refuge, wherein it states: "and from the evil of what I have not done and from the evil of what I do not know."  
[171] The supplication: "O Allah, keep me away from vile morals, deeds, ailments, and desires." Al-Tirmidhi reported it and graded it hasan, and al-Hakim authenticated it, with the wording being his, from the hadith of Qutbah ibn Malik: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the severity of calamity, the attainment of misery, the evil of decree, and the gloating of enemies."  
[172] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the severity of calamity, the attainment of misery, the evil of decree, and the gloating of enemies." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.  
[173] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from disbelief and debt and poverty, and I seek refuge in You from the punishment of Hellfire, and I seek refuge in You from the trial of the False Messiah." Al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim reported it, and he said its chain is sound, from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, that he used to say: "from disbelief and debt." In a narration of al-Nasa'i: "from disbelief and poverty." And Muslim reported from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he used to seek refuge from the punishment of the grave, the punishment of Hellfire, and the trial of the False Messiah. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'A'ishah, in a hadith he said: "and from the evil trial of the Messiah, the False Messiah."  
[174] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing, the evil of my sight, the evil of my tongue, my heart, and the evil of my semen." Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and al-Tirmidhi reported it, and al-Hakim graded it hasan and authenticated its chain from the hadith of Sahl ibn Hunayf.  
[175] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from an evil neighbor in the abode of permanence, for the desert neighbor can move away." Al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is sound according to the conditions of Muslim.  
[176] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from hardness of heart, heedlessness, destitution, humiliation, and poverty; and I seek refuge in You from poverty, disbelief, immorality, discord, hypocrisy, ostentation, and showing off; and I seek refuge in You from deafness, muteness, madness, leprosy, vitiligo, and evil diseases." Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported it, limiting it to the last four, and al-Hakim reported it in full from the hadith of Anas, and he said it is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.  
[177] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the removal of Your blessing, the transformation of Your well-being, the suddenness of Your wrath, and from all Your displeasure." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.  
[178] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the Fire and the trial of the Fire, and from the punishment of the grave and the trial of the grave, and from the evil trial of wealth and the evil trial of poverty, and from the evil trial of the Messiah, the False Messiah, and I seek refuge in You from sin and debt." Agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah.  
[179] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a soul that is never satisfied, a heart that is not humble, a prayer that is not beneficial, and a supplication that is not answered; and I seek refuge in You from the evil of lifespan and the trial of the heart." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam, within a longer hadith: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a heart that is not humble, a soul that is never satisfied, a deed that is not elevated, a supplication that is not answered for it, and a prayer that is not beneficial." Abu al-Mu'tamir doubted hearing it from Anas. And al-Nasa'i with a sound chain from the hadith of 'Umar, within a longer hadith: "and I seek refuge in You," and Abu Dawud from the hadith of Anas: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil of lifespan and I seek refuge in You from the trial of the heart."  
[180] The supplication: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from being overwhelmed by debt and being overwhelmed by the enemy, and from the gloating of enemies." Al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim reported it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and he said it is sound according to the conditions of Muslim.  
[181] The saying when going out to the mosque: "O Allah, place light in my heart and light on my tongue..." Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas.  
[182] The supplication: "O Allah, I ask You by the right of those who ask of You and by the right of my walking to You..." From the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with a hasan chain.  
[183] The saying when leaving the house for one's need: "In the name of Allah, my Lord, I seek refuge in You from oppressing or being oppressed, or from acting ignorantly or having ignorance acted upon me." The authors of the Sunan reported it from the hadith of Umm Salamah; al-Tirmidhi said...

[184] Hadith: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. There is no power nor strength except with Allah. Reliance is upon Allah." Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet, peace be upon him, when leaving his house would say, "In the name of Allah..." and mention it, except he did not say "the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." There is weakness in it.

[185] Hadith: The saying upon entering the mosque: "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad. O Allah, forgive me my sins and open for me the doors of Your mercy." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of Fatimah, daughter of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan*, but its chain is not continuous. Muslim has it from the hadith of Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd: "When one of you enters the mosque, let him say: 'O Allah, open for me the doors of Your mercy.'" Abu Dawud added at its beginning: "Then let him send peace upon the Prophet, peace be upon him."

[186] Hadith: The saying when seeing one who sells or buys in the mosque: "May Allah not profit your trade." Al-Tirmidhi reported it and said it is *hasan gharib*; al-Nasa'i in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[187] Hadith: The saying when seeing one who announces a lost item in the mosque: "May Allah not return it to you." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[188] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas regarding the saying after the two rak'ahs of Fajr: "O Allah, I ask You for a mercy from You by which You guide my heart..." It has preceded in the chapter on supplication.

[189] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas regarding the saying in the bowing: "O Allah, for You I bow and to You I submit..." Muslim reported it from the hadith of 'Ali.

[190] Hadith: The saying in it: "Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great" three times. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Bayhaqi reported it from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud. There is a break in its chain.

[191] Hadith: The saying in it: "Most Glorious, Most Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit." Muslim reported it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

[192] Hadith: The saying upon rising from the bowing: "Allah hears those who praise Him. Our Lord, to You is all praise..." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and Ibn 'Abbas, without his saying "Allah hears those who praise Him." It is in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* by al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Ma'mari. It is in Muslim from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa, and in al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[193] Hadith: The saying in prostration: "O Allah, to You I prostrate..." Muslim reported it from the hadith of 'Ali. "O Allah, to You my limbs and my shadow prostrate, and in You my heart believes. I acknowledge Your favor upon me and I acknowledge my sin. This is what I have earned against myself, so forgive me, for none forgives sins but You." Al-Hakim reported it from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud and said its chain is sound, but it is not as he said; rather, it is weak.

[194] Hadith: "Glory be to my Lord, the Most High" three times. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Bayhaqi reported it from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, and it is interrupted.

[195] Hadith: The saying upon finishing the prayer: "O Allah, You are Peace, and from You is peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Thawban.

[196] Hadith: The expiation for a gathering: "Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise. I bear witness that there is no god but You." Al-Nasa'i reported it in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the hadith of Rafi' ibn Khadij with a *hasan* chain.

[197] Hadith: The saying upon entering the market: "There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is Ever-Living and does not die. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things." From the hadith of 'Umar, and it was said to be *gharib*. Al-Hakim said it is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[198] Hadith: "In the name of Allah. O Allah, I ask You for the good of this market and the good that is in it. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil that is in it. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from making an oath of false gain or a losing transaction within it." Al-Hakim reported it from the hadith of Buraydah and said the closest to the conditions of this book is the hadith of Buraydah. I say: In it is Abu 'Umar, a neighbor of Shu'ayb ibn Harb, and perhaps it is Hafs ibn Sulayman al-Asadi, who is disputed.

[199] Hadith: Supplication regarding debt: "O Allah, suffice me with what You have made lawful against what You have made unlawful, and with Your bounty against [relying on] anyone other than You." Al-Tirmidhi reported it and said it is *hasan gharib*; al-Hakim said its chain is sound, from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib.

[200] The supplication when wearing a new garment: "O Allah, You have clothed me with this garment, to You is all praise. I ask You for its good and the good for which it was made, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil for which it was made." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan*; and by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Ibn al-Sunni reported it with the wording of the compiler.

[201] The saying when seeing something of an ill omen that one dislikes: "O Allah, none brings good things but You, and none averts evil things but You. There is no power and no strength except by Allah." Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Nu'aym in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Da'awat* from the narration of 'Urwah ibn 'Amir as *mursal*, and its narrators are trustworthy. In *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* of Ibn al-Sunni, from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, he made it *musnad*.

[202] The saying upon sighting the new moon: To say *Allahu Akbar* three times, then say: "O Allah, let it appear upon us with security, faith, safety, and Islam. My Lord and your Lord is Allah." Reported by al-Darimi from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, except that he mentioned saying *takbir* generally without specifying three times. Al-Tirmidhi reported it and graded it *hasan* from the narration of Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah without mentioning the *takbir*. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in *al-Da'awat* from the narration of Qatadah as *mursal*: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) would say *Allahu Akbar* three times when he saw the new moon."

[203] The saying: "New moon of goodness and guidance. I believe in your Creator." Reported by Abu Dawud as *mursal* from the narration of Qatadah: "It reached him that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would say when he saw the new moon: 'New moon of goodness and guidance, new moon of goodness and guidance. I believe in the One who created you' three times." Al-Daraqutni reported it with a chain in *al-Afrad* and al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Anas. Abu Dawud said: "There is no *musnad*, *sahih* hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding this."

[204] The supplication: "O Allah, I ask You for the good of this month and the good of the Decree (al-Qadr), and I seek refuge in You from the evil of the Day of Resurrection." Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah and Ahmad in their *Musnads* from the narration of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit. In its chain is an unnamed narrator, as the narrator from him said: "One whom I do not accuse narrated to me."

[205] The saying when the wind blows: "O Allah, I ask You for the good of this wind, the good within it, and the good for which it was sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil within it, and the evil for which it was sent." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan sahih*; and by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b.

[206] The saying upon hearing of someone's death: "Verily to Allah we belong and verily to Him we shall return. And verily to our Lord we are destined to return. O Allah, record him among the doers of good, place his record among the highest (in 'Illiyyin), and grant him successors among those he left behind. O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward, and do not test us after him, and forgive us and him." Reported by Ibn al-Sunni in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Umm Salamah: "When a calamity befalls one of you, let him say: 'Verily to Allah we belong and verily to Him we shall return.'" Muslim reported from her narration: "O Allah, forgive Abu Salamah, elevate his rank among the guided, grant him successors among those he left behind, forgive us and him, O Lord of the worlds, make his grave spacious, and illuminate it for him."

[207] The saying upon hearing the sound of thunder: "Glory be to Him whom the thunder glorifies with His praise, and the angels out of awe of Him." Reported by Malik in *al-Muwatta'* from 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr as *mawquf* (stopped at a Companion), and I did not find it *marfu'* (attributed to the Prophet).

[208] The saying at the occurrence of lightning: "O Allah, do not kill us with Your wrath, nor destroy us with Your punishment, and grant us well-being before that." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *gharib*; and by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Ibn 'Umar; and by Ibn al-Sunni with a *hasan* chain.

[209] The saying at the onset of rain: "O Allah, (make it) a beneficial, wholesome downpour." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of 'A'ishah: "When he saw rain, he would say: 'O Allah, make it a beneficial downpour.'" Ibn Majah reported it with 'sayban' (with a 'seen'), and al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* reported: "O Allah, make it a wholesome downpour." Their chains are *sahih*.

[210] The supplication: "O Allah, make it a downpour of mercy, and do not make it a downpour of punishment." Reported by al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib as *mursal*.

[211] The saying when angry: "O Allah, forgive my sin, remove the rage from my heart, and protect me from the accursed Satan." Reported by Ibn al-Sunni in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of 'A'ishah with a weak chain.

[212] The saying when fearing a people: "O Allah, I place You before their faces, and I seek refuge in You from their evils." Reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* from the narration of Abu Musa with a *sahih* chain.

[213] The supplication when going to battle: "O Allah, You are my support and my helper; through You I fight." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i from the narration of Anas. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan gharib.

[214] The supplication upon hearing a ringing in the ear: "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad. May Allah be mentioned with good when I am mentioned." Reported by al-Tabarani, Ibn 'Adi, and Ibn al-Sunni in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the narration of Abu Rafi' with a weak chain.

[215] The supplication upon seeing one's supplication answered: "All praise is for Allah, by Whose grace righteous deeds are perfected." Mentioned previously in the chapter on supplication.

[216] The supplication upon hearing the Maghrib call to prayer: "O Allah, this is the approach of Your night and the retreat of Your day, and the sounds of those calling upon You and the presence of Your prayers. I ask You to forgive me." Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud, who said it is gharib, and by al-Hakim from the narration of Umm Salamah, without the phrase "and the presence of Your prayers." That phrase is found in al-Khara'iti's "Makārim al-Akhlaq" and al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Ma'mari's "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah."

[217] The supplication when afflicted with distress: "O Allah, I am Your servant, the son of Your male servant, the son of Your female servant. My forelock is in Your hand..." Reported by Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, who said it is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, provided it is free from the interruption in 'Abd al-Rahman's narration from his father, for there is disagreement regarding his hearing it from his father.

[218] The incantation of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: "In the name of Allah, with the dust of our land and the saliva of some of us, may our sick be healed by the permission of our Lord." Agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[219] The practice of placing his hand on the part of his body that felt pain, saying "In the name of Allah" three times, and saying "I seek refuge in the might of Allah and His power from the evil of what I find and what I guard against" seven times. Reported by Muslim from the narration of 'Uthman ibn Abi al-'As.

[220] The supplication for distress: "There is no god but Allah, the Most High, the Forbearing..." Agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas.

[221] The practice of saying "Allahu Akbar" thirty-four times, "Subhan Allah" thirty-three times, and "Alhamdulillah" thirty-three times before sleeping. Agreed upon from the narration of 'Ali.

[222] The supplication when intending to sleep: "O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your pardon from Your punishment. I seek refuge in You from You. O Allah, I cannot fully praise You, even if I strove to do so, but You are as You have praised Yourself." Reported by al-Nasa'i in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the narration of 'Ali, but its chain is interrupted.

[223] The supplication: "O Allah, by Your name I live and die." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Hudhayfah and by Muslim from the narration of al-Bara'.

[224] The supplication: "O Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of everything and its Sovereign, Splitter of the seed and the date-stone..." up to "...and enrich us from poverty." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[225] The supplication: "O Allah, You created my soul and You will take it..." up to "...O Allah, I ask You for well-being." Reported by Muslim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[226] The supplication: "In Your name, my Lord, I lay my side down, so forgive me my sin." Reported by al-Nasa'i in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with a good chain. In the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "In Your name, my Lord, I lay my side down, and by You I raise it. If You take hold of my soul, then forgive it..." and al-Bukhari added: "...and have mercy on it. And if You release it, then protect it as You protect Your righteous servants."

[227] The supplication: "O Allah, protect me from Your punishment on the day You gather Your servants." Reported by al-Tirmidhi in "al-Shama'il" from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud. It is also found in Abu Dawud from the narration of Hafsa with the wording "when You resurrect." Al-Tirmidhi also reported it from the narration of Hudhayfah, declared it sahih from the narration of al-Bara', and declared it hasan.

[228] The supplication: "O Allah, I have submitted myself to You, and I have entrusted my affair to You..." Agreed upon from the narration of al-Bara'.

[229] The supplication: "O Allah, awaken me at the hour most beloved to You, and employ me in the deeds most beloved to You, drawing me nearer to You and distancing me far from Your wrath. I ask You and You give to me; I seek Your forgiveness and You forgive me; I call upon You and You answer me." Reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "O Allah, resurrect us at the hour most beloved to You, so that we may remember You and You remember us, and we ask You and You give to us, and we call upon You..."

So You respond to us, and we seek Your forgiveness, and You forgive us—its chain is weak, and it is known from the saying of Habib al-Ta'i, as narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Du'a."

[230] The saying upon waking from sleep: "Praise be to God who gave us life after causing us to die, and to Him is the resurrection." Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Hudhayfah and Muslim from the hadith of al-Bara'.

[231] The saying: "We have entered the morning, and dominion belongs to God, and grandeur and sovereignty belong to God, and might and power belong to God." Reported by al-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" from the hadith of A'ishah: "We have entered the morning, and dominion, praise, power, strength, capability, sovereignty, the heavens, the earth, and everything belong to God, Lord of the worlds." And in "Al-Du'a" from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa: "I have entered the morning, and dominion, majesty, grandeur, creation, night, day, and what dwells in them belong to God." Their chains are weak. And Muslim reported from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "We have entered the morning, and dominion belongs to God."

[232] The saying: "We have entered the morning upon the natural disposition of Islam, the word of sincerity, the religion of our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and the creed of our father Abraham, upright, and he was not of the polytheists." Reported by al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the hadith of Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza with a sound chain, and Ahmad reported it from the hadith of Ibn Abza from Ubayy ibn Ka'b, attributed to the Prophet.

[233] The saying: "O God, by You we enter the morning, by You we enter the evening, by You we live, by You we die, and to You is the return." Reported by the authors of the Sunan and Ibn Hibban, and al-Tirmidhi graded it as good, except they said "and to You is the resurrection." And Ibn al-Sunni has "and to You is the return."

[234] The saying: "O God, we ask You to send us forth on this day to every good, and we seek refuge in You from committing evil therein or bringing it upon a Muslim." I did not find its beginning. Al-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of Abu Bakr in a narration of his: "And I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul, the evil of Satan, and his partnership, and from committing evil against ourselves or bringing it upon a Muslim." Reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari with a good chain.

[235] The saying: "O God, Splitter of the dawn, Maker of the night for rest, and the sun and moon for reckoning, I ask You for the good of this day and the good within it, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil within it." I said it is composed of two hadiths. Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: The Messenger of God ﷺ would supplicate: "O God, Splitter of the dawn, Maker of the night for rest, and the sun and moon for reckoning, settle my debt, enrich me from poverty, and strengthen me for jihad in Your path." And al-Daraqutni in "Al-Afrad" from the hadith of al-Bara': "We ask You for the good of this day and the good after it, and we seek refuge in You from the evil of this day and the evil after it." And Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Malik al-Ash'ari: "O God, we ask You for the good of this day, its opening, victory, light, guidance, and blessing, and we seek refuge in You from the evil within it and the evil after it," and its chain is good. And al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Ma'mari in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "O God, I ask You for the good within this day and the good after it, and I seek refuge in You from the evil of this day and the evil after it." The hadith is in Muslim for the evening: "The good within this night..." then he said: "And when he entered the morning, he said that as well."

[236] The saying: "In the name of God, what God wills, there is no power except by God, what God wills, every blessing is from God, what God wills, all good is in God's hand, what God wills, none can avert evil except God." Counted in "Al-Kamil" from the hadith of Ibn Abbas, and I do not know it except as attributed to the Prophet ﷺ. He said: "Al-Khidr and Ilyas, peace be upon them, meet every year during the season at Mina, and each shaves the head of his companion, then they part with these words," and he mentioned it but did not say "all good is in God's hand." He said its place is: "None drives good except God." Ibn Abbas said: "Whoever says them when entering the morning and evening, God will protect him from drowning and burning," and I think he said: "and from Satan, the ruler, the snake, and the scorpion." He cited it in the biography of al-Husayn ibn Razin, saying: "It is not well-known, and with this chain it is rejected."

[237] The saying: "I am pleased with God as Lord, with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad as prophet." Previously mentioned in the first chapter.

[238] The saying in the evening is like that of the morning, except you say "we have entered the evening" and add with it: "I seek refuge in the perfect words of God and all His names from the evil of what He has created and brought forth, from the evil of every possessor of evil, and from the evil of every creature whose forelock You hold; indeed, my Lord is on a straight path." Reported by Abu al-Shaykh in "Kitab al-Thawab" from the hadith of Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf: "Whoever says when entering the morning: 'I seek refuge in the perfect words of God...'"

Seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of what He has created, brought forth, and originated, and from the evil of what descends from the heavens. Its chain of transmission is sound.
