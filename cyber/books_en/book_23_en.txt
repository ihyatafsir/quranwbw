The Book of Breaking the Two Desires

This is the third book of the quarter on the destructive matters.

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, the Singular in Majesty in His grandeur and exaltation, the One deserving of praise, sanctification, glorification, and transcendence. He who establishes justice in all He decrees and ordains, He who bestows favor through the grace He grants and confers. He who undertakes the protection of His servant in all his comings and goings, He who blesses him with what exceeds his essential needs, nay, with what fulfills his aspirations. It is He who guides him and leads him aright, and it is He who causes him to die and gives him life. And when he is ill, it is He who heals him; and when he is weak, it is He who strengthens him. It is He who grants him success in obedience and is pleased with him. It is He who feeds him and gives him drink, and guards him from ruin and protects him, shielding him with food and drink from what would destroy him and bring him to perdition. He enables him to be content with little sustenance and draws him near, until the pathways of the Satan who opposes him become constricted, and He breaks through him the appetite of the soul that is his adversary. Thus, he repels its evil and then worships his Lord and fears Him. This is after He has expanded for him what he delights in and desires, and multiplied for him what stirs his impulses and strengthens his motives—all of this He tests him with and tries him, to see how he prefers it over what he inclines to and chooses, and how he preserves His commands and refrains from His prohibitions, and perseveres in obeying Him and is deterred from disobeying Him. And blessings upon Muhammad, His discerning servant and His noble Messenger—blessings that draw him near and grant him favor, and elevate his station and raise him high—and upon the righteous among his family and kin, and the virtuous among his Companions and followers.

Now then: The greatest destroyer for the children of Adam is the appetite of the stomach, for by it Adam, peace be upon him, and Eve were expelled from the Abode of Permanence to the abode of humiliation and need; when they were forbidden the tree, their appetites overcame them until they ate from it and their shame became apparent to them. The stomach, in truth, is the fountainhead of appetites and the breeding ground of maladies and afflictions, for it is followed by the appetite of the private parts and intense craving for sexual relations; then the appetite for food and intercourse is followed by intense desire for status and wealth, which are the means to indulgence in sexual relations and foods; then the amassing of wealth and status is followed by various kinds of recklessness and types of rivalries and envies; then between them is generated the affliction of ostentation and the peril of boastfulness, competition in abundance, and arrogance; then that leads on to rancor, envy, enmity, and hatred; then that brings its possessor to plunge into transgression, evil deeds, and indecency. All of that is the fruit of neglecting the stomach and what is generated from it—the insolence of satiety and fullness. If the servant were to subdue his soul through hunger and constrict thereby the channels of Satan, it would submit to obedience to God, Mighty and Majestic, and would not tread the path of insolence and rebellion, nor would it be driven by that to immersion in the world and preferring the immediate over the hereafter, nor would it scramble so fiercely for this world. Since the affliction of the stomach's appetite has reached such magnitude, it is obligatory to explain its perils and harms as a warning against it, and obligatory to clarify the path of striving against it and to point out its virtue as an encouragement toward it. Likewise, the appetite of the private parts is to be explained, for it follows from it. We shall clarify that, by the help of God Almighty, in chapters that collectively explain the virtue of hunger, then its benefits, then the method of spiritual discipline in breaking the appetite of the stomach by reducing food and delaying it, then an explanation of the varying rulings and virtue of hunger according to the differing states of people, then an explanation of the discipline in abandoning appetite, then a discourse on the appetite of the private parts, then an explanation of what is incumbent upon the seeker regarding abstaining from marriage and undertaking it; then an explanation of the virtue of one who opposes the appetite of the stomach, the private parts, and the eye.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Hunger and the Condemnation of Satiety

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Strive against your souls with hunger and thirst, for the reward in that is like the reward of one who strives in the path of God, and there is no deed more beloved to God than hunger and thirst." And Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "He who fills his belly shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." And it was said: O Messenger of God, who are the best of people? He said: "He whose food is little, whose laughter is little, and who is content with what covers his nakedness." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The master of deeds is hunger and the humility of the soul; the garment of wool." And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Wear, eat, and drink by filling half the stomach, for that is part of prophethood." And al-Hasan said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Reflection is half of worship, and little food is worship." And al-Hasan also said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The highest of you in station with God on the Day of Resurrection will be those with the longest hunger and reflection upon God, glorified is He. And the most hateful of you to God, the Mighty and Majestic, on the Day of Resurrection is every gluttonous, voracious eater and drinker." And in the report: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, would hunger without need, meaning by choice for that. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, God, the Exalted, boasts to the angels of one whose food and drink in the world are little. God, the Exalted, says: 'Look at My servant whom I tested with food and drink in the world, and he was patient and abandoned them. Bear witness, O My angels, that for every morsel he forgoes, I shall replace it for him with degrees in Paradise.'" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Do not kill the hearts with much food and drink, for the heart is like a crop; it dies if too much water is upon it." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The son of Adam fills no vessel worse than his stomach. Sufficient for the son of Adam are a few morsels to straighten his back. If he must do more, then a third for his food, a third for his drink, and a third for his breath." And in the lengthy narration of Usamah ibn Zayd and the narration of Abu Hurayrah, the virtue of hunger is mentioned, for he said in it: "Verily, the closest of people to God, the Mighty and Majestic, on the Day of Resurrection are those whose hunger, thirst, and grief in the world were prolonged—the humble, the pious, who, if they are present, are not known, and if they are absent, are not missed. The tracts of the earth know them, and the angels of heaven attend to them. How excellent are they in the world, and how they delight in obeying God, the Mighty and Majestic! People spread out soft bedding, while they spread their foreheads and knees. People neglected the actions and character of the prophets, but they preserved them. The earth weeps when they are lost, and the Compeller is wrathful with any land in which there is not one of them. They did not scramble for the world as dogs scramble for carrion. They ate coarse food and wore patched garments, disheveled and dusty. People see them and think they are ill, though they are not ill. It is said they are confused and have lost their minds, but they have not lost their minds. Rather, the people looked with their hearts to the command of God, which removed the world from them. Thus, in the eyes of the people of the world, they walk without intellect, while they became wise when the intellects of people were lost. Theirs is honor in the Hereafter. O Usamah, if you see them in a land, know that they are a security for the people of that land, and God will not punish a people among whom they are. The earth rejoices because of them, and the Compeller is pleased with them. Take them as brothers for yourself, so that perhaps you may be saved through them. And if you can have death come to you while your stomach is hungry and your liver is thirsty, then do so. For you will attain by that the nobility of stations and dwell with the prophets. The angels will rejoice at the arrival of your spirit, and the Compeller will send blessings upon you."

Al-Hasan ibn Abi Hurayrah reported: The Prophet ﷺ said, "Wear wool, roll up your sleeves, and eat only half-full, so that you may enter the kingdom of heaven." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said, "O company of disciples, starve your livers and bare your bodies, perhaps then your hearts may see God, the Mighty and Majestic." This was also narrated from our Prophet ﷺ by Tawus. It is said to be written in the Torah: Indeed, God hates the fat scholar, for fatness indicates heedlessness and excessive eating, and that is ugly, especially for a scholar. For that reason, Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: Indeed, God the Exalted hates the fat reciter. And in a mursal report: "Indeed, Satan flows in the son of Adam like the flowing of blood, so constrict his passages with hunger and thirst." And in a report: "Eating on satiety causes leprosy." And the Prophet ﷺ said, "The believer eats with one intestine, and the hypocrite eats with seven intestines," meaning he eats seven times what the believer eats, or his appetite is seven times the appetite of the believer. Mentioning the intestine is a metaphor for appetite, because it is the appetite that accepts and takes food as the intestine does. It does not mean the hypocrite has more intestines than the believer. Al-Hasan reported from 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she said: I heard the Messenger of God ﷺ say, "Persist in knocking on the door of Paradise, and it will be opened for you." I said, "How do we persist in knocking on the door of Paradise?" He said, "Through hunger and thirst." And it is reported: "Abu Juhaifah belched in the gathering of the Messenger of God ﷺ, so he said to him, 'Shorten your belching, for the hungriest people on the Day of Resurrection are those who were most satiated in the world.'" And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, used to say: The Messenger of God ﷺ never filled his stomach with satiety. Sometimes I would weep in pity for what I saw of his hunger, and I would feel his stomach with my hand and say, "May I be your ransom! If only you would take from the world enough to strengthen you and protect you from hunger?" He would say, "O 'A'ishah, my brothers from the resolute messengers endured what is more severe than this. They passed on in their state and presented themselves to their Lord, so He honored their return and multiplied their reward. I find myself ashamed if I live in comfort that I would fall short of them tomorrow. So enduring a few days is dearer to me than having my portion diminished tomorrow in the Hereafter. And nothing is dearer to me than catching up with my companions and brothers." 'A'ishah said: By God, he did not complete a week after that before God took him to Himself. And from Anas, he said: Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, brought a piece of bread to the Messenger of God ﷺ. He said, "What is this piece?" She said, "A loaf I baked, and I was not content until I brought you this piece from it." The Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Indeed, this is the first food to enter your father's mouth in three days." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet ﷺ did not have wheat bread with his family for three consecutive days until he departed the world. And the Prophet ﷺ said, "Indeed, the people of hunger in this world are the people of satiety in the Hereafter. And the most hateful of people to God are the overstuffed, the satiated. And no servant abandons a morsel he desires except that there is a degree for him in Paradise."

As for the narrations: Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: Beware of satiety, for it is a burden in life and a stench in death. Shaqiq al-Balkhi said: Worship is a trade, its shop is seclusion and its tool is hunger. Luqman said to his son: O my son, when the stomach is full, thought sleeps, wisdom is silenced, and the limbs are hindered from worship. Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad would say to himself: What do you fear? Do you fear you will go hungry? Do not fear that: you are too insignificant to God for that; only Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his Companions were made to hunger. Kahmas would say: My God, You have made me hungry, You have left me naked, and You have seated me in the darkness of nights without a lamp; by what means have You brought me to what You have brought me? Fath al-Mawsili, when his illness and hunger intensified, would say: My God, You have tested me with illness and hunger, and thus You do with Your friends; by what deed can I repay thanks for what You have bestowed upon me? Malik ibn Dinar said: I said to Muhammad ibn Wasī‘, “O Abu ‘Abdillah, blessed is he who has a small provision that suffices him and makes him independent of people.” He said to me, “O Abu Yahya, blessed is he who ends the day and begins it hungry while being content with God.” Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad would say: My God, You have made me and my family hungry, and left me in the darkness of nights without a lamp, and You only do this to Your friends; by what station have I attained this from You? Yahya ibn Mu‘adh said: The hunger of the aspirants is an awakening, the hunger of the penitent is a trial, the hunger of the strivers is an honor, the hunger of the patient is a discipline, and the hunger of the ascetics is wisdom. In the Torah: Fear God, and when you are sated, remember the hungry. Abu Sulayman said: To leave a morsel from my supper is more beloved to me than standing in prayer the whole night until dawn. He also said: Hunger is with God in His treasuries; He gives it only to whom He loves. Sahl ibn ‘Abdullah al-Tustari would go without food for over twenty days, and a dirham sufficed him for food for a year. He held hunger in great esteem and emphasized it greatly, saying: No righteous deed will be brought forth on the Day of Resurrection better than abandoning excess food, following the example of the Prophet, peace be upon him, in his eating. He said: The wise have not seen anything more beneficial for religion and this world than hunger. He said: I know of nothing more harmful to seekers of the Hereafter than eating. He said: Wisdom and knowledge are placed in hunger, and disobedience and ignorance are placed in satiety. He said: God has not been worshipped by anything better than opposing one’s caprice in leaving what is lawful. It is related in the Hadith: “One-third for food; whoever increases upon that, he eats from his good deeds.” He was asked about the increase, and he said: One does not find the increase until leaving food becomes more beloved to him than eating, and when he is hungry for a night, he asks God to make it two nights; when that is the case, he finds the increase. He said: The Substitutes became substitutes only by emptying their bellies, keeping vigil, silence, and seclusion. He said: The head of every goodness that descends from heaven to earth is hunger, and the head of every wickedness between them is satiety. He said: Whoever makes his soul hungry, whisperings are cut off from him. He said: God’s turning to a servant is through hunger, sickness, and tribulation, except whom God wills. He said: Know that this is a time in which no one attains salvation except by slaughtering his soul and killing it with hunger, vigil, and exertion. He said: No one has walked the face of the earth who drank from this water until he was quenched and remained safe from sin—and if he thanks God Almighty—so how about satiety from food? A sage was asked: With what fetter shall I fetter my soul? He said: Fetter it with hunger and thirst, humble it by silencing remembrance and abandoning honor, belittle it by placing it under the feet of the children of the Hereafter, break it by abandoning the outward appearance of the reciters, escape its afflictions by constantly thinking ill of it, and accompany it by opposing its caprice. ‘Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid would swear by God Almighty that God Almighty has not purified anyone except through hunger, nor have they walked on water except by it, nor has the earth been folded for them except through hunger, nor has God Almighty taken them as friends except through hunger. Abu Talib al-Makki said: The stomach is like the *mizhar*—which is the hollow wood with strings—for its sound is beautiful due to its lightness and thinness because it is hollow and not full; likewise, the belly when empty is sweeter for recitation, more enduring for standing in prayer, and less prone to sleep. Abu Bakr ibn ‘Abdullah al-Muzani said: Three are loved by God Almighty: a man who sleeps little, eats little, and rests little. It is related that Jesus, peace be upon him, spent sixty mornings conversing intimately with his Lord without eating; then the thought of bread crossed his mind, and the intimate conversation was cut off, and there was a loaf placed before him. He sat weeping over the loss of the intimate conversation, and an old man shaded him. Jesus said to him: May God bless you, O friend of God; pray to God Almighty, for I was in a state, then the thought of bread crossed my mind and it was cut off from me. The old man said: O God, if You know that bread has crossed my mind since I knew You, then do not forgive me; rather, when something was present for me, I ate it without thought or fancy. It is related that when Moses, peace be upon him, was drawn near by God Almighty as a confidant, he had left food for forty days—thirty then ten—as is mentioned in the Quran; because he held back without premeditation for a day, ten were added for that reason.

An Exposition on the Benefits of Hunger and the Harms of Satiety

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Strive against your souls through hunger and thirst, for the reward lies therein." Perhaps you may say: "Where is this immense virtue in hunger, and what is its cause? It is nothing but the affliction of the stomach and the endurance of hardship! If that is so, then the reward should be great for everything by which a person suffers harm—such as striking himself, cutting his flesh, consuming repugnant things, and the like." Know that this resembles the statement of one who drank a medicine and benefited from it, yet thought its benefit lay in the medicine's distastefulness and bitterness, so he began to consume everything he found unpalatable and coarse. Rather, its benefit lies in a specific property within the medicine, not in its bitterness. Only physicians discern that specific property. Similarly, none discerns the reason for the benefit of hunger except the seasoned among the scholars. Whoever starves his soul, believing in what the Sacred Law has conveyed regarding the praise of hunger, benefits from it even if he does not know the cause of its benefit—just as one who drinks a medicine benefits from it even if he does not understand the reason for its efficacy.

But we shall explain to you, if you wish to ascend from the station of faith to the station of knowledge—as God Almighty has said, "God will raise in degrees those of you who believe and those who have been given knowledge"—we say: in hunger there are ten benefits.

The First Benefit: Clarity of heart, kindling of innate intelligence, and penetration of insight. For satiety begets dullness, blinds the heart, and multiplies vapors in the brain akin to intoxication, such that it seizes the faculties of thought, thus weighing down the heart and hindering its flow among ideas and swiftness of perception. Indeed, even a child, if he eats excessively, his memory fails, his mind becomes corrupt, and he grows slow in comprehension and perception. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: Hold fast to hunger, for it humbles the soul, softens the heart, and begets celestial knowledge. And it is said: "Revive your hearts with little laughter and little satiety, and purify them with hunger; they will become clear and tender." It is said: Hunger is like thunder, contentment like clouds, and wisdom like rain. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever makes his stomach hungry, his thought becomes great and his heart discerning." Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever is satiated and sleeps, his heart hardens." Then he said: "Everything has a purification, and the purification of the body is hunger." Al-Shibli said: I never hungered for God's sake for a day except that I saw in my heart an open door of wisdom and admonition the like of which I had never seen before. It is not hidden that the ultimate aim of acts of worship is thought that leads to knowledge and insight into the realities of the Truth. Satiety prevents this, and hunger opens its door. Knowledge is a gate among the gates of Paradise; thus, it is most fitting that persistent hunger be a knocking at the gate of Paradise. For this reason, Luqman said to his son: "O my son, when the stomach is full, thought sleeps, wisdom falls silent, and the limbs become idle from worship." Abu Yazid al-Bistami said: "Hunger is a cloud; when a servant hungers, his heart rains wisdom." The Prophet ﷺ said: "The light of wisdom is hunger, and distance from God, the Mighty and Majestic, is satiety. Nearness to God, the Mighty and Majestic, is love for the poor and drawing close to them. Do not be satiated, lest you extinguish the light of wisdom from your hearts. And whoever sleeps with lightness of food, the maidens of Paradise circle around him until morning."

The second benefit: the tenderness and clarity of the heart, through which one becomes prepared to perceive the delight of perseverance and to be affected by remembrance. For how much remembrance flows upon the tongue while the heart is present, yet the heart does not relish it nor is it moved, as if between it and the remembrance there is a veil from the heart's hardness. And it may soften in some states, so its being affected by remembrance and its delight in intimate communion become great. The emptiness of the stomach is the most apparent cause for this. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "Worship is sweetest to me when my back adheres to my belly." And al-Junayd said: "One of them places a feedbag of food between himself and his breast, yet he desires to find the sweetness of intimate communion." And Abu Sulayman said: "When the heart hungers and thirsts, it inclines and becomes tender; and when it is satiated, it becomes blind and errs." So when the heart is affected by the delight of intimate communion, it commands beyond the facilitation of thought and the seizing of knowledge—this is a second benefit.

The third benefit: brokenness and humility, and the removal of arrogance, frivolous joy, and insolence, which is the origin of transgression and heedlessness of God Almighty. For the soul is not broken and humbled by anything as it is humbled by hunger. At that point, it becomes tranquil before its Lord, submits to Him, and stands aware of its own incapacity and lowliness when its strength fails and its means are constricted by a morsel of food that has eluded it, and the world grows dark upon it for a sip of water that is delayed. Unless a person witnesses the lowliness and incapacity of his own soul, he does not see the might of his Master nor His overpowering dominion. His felicity lies only in being perpetually viewing his own soul through the lens of lowliness and incapacity, and his Master through the lens of might, power, and overpowering dominion. Therefore, let him be perpetually hungry, compelled toward his Master, witnessing the state of compulsion by direct experience. It is for this reason that when the world and its treasures were presented to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he said, "No, rather I will be hungry one day and full another. For when I am hungry, I am patient and supplicant, and when I am full, I am grateful." Or as he said, "The stomach and the private part are a gate from the gates of Hell, and its root is satiety. And brokenness and humility are a gate from the gates of Paradise, and its root is hunger. Whoever closes a gate from the gates of Hell has necessarily opened a gate from the gates of Paradise, for they are opposite each other like the east and the west. So, whoever draws near to one of them becomes distant from the other."

The Fourth Benefit: That one does not forget the affliction and punishment of God; nor does one forget the people of affliction. For the sated one forgets the hungry and forgets hunger itself. The prudent servant does not witness the affliction of another except that he is reminded of the punishment of the Hereafter. Thus, from his own thirst he remembers the thirst of creation on the plains of Resurrection, and from his own hunger, the hunger of the people of the Fire—to the extent that they hunger and are fed with *Dhari'* and *Zaqqum*, and are given to drink of *Ghassaq* and boiling water. Therefore, the punishment and pains of the Hereafter should not be absent from the servant's mind, for it is that which stirs up fear. For one who is not in a state of humiliation, sickness, poverty, or affliction, the foremost affliction and hunger he should endure contains numerous benefits besides the remembrance of the punishment of the Hereafter. This is one of the reasons that necessitated the particular association of affliction with the Prophets, the saints, and the most excellent among them. It was for this reason it was said to Joseph, peace be upon him: "Why do you go hungry when the treasures of the earth are in your hands?" He replied: "I fear that if I become sated, I will forget the hungry one." Remembering the hungry and the needy is one of the benefits of hunger, for it calls one to mercy, feeding others, and compassion for the creation of God, Mighty and Majestic. The sated one is heedless of the pain of the hungry.

The Fifth Benefit—and it is among the greatest benefits—is breaking all the appetites for sins and gaining mastery over the soul that commands to evil. For the origin of all sins is appetites and [base] faculties. The material of the faculties and appetites is inevitably food; reducing it weakens every appetite and faculty. All happiness lies in a man mastering his soul, and misery lies in his soul mastering him. Just as you cannot master a rebellious beast except through the weakness of hunger—for when it is sated it becomes strong, unruly, and refractory—so it is with the soul. As it was said to one of them: "How is it that despite your advanced age you do not attend to your body, which has become worn out?" He replied: "Because it is quick to rejoice, excessive in insolence, and I fear it will gather me [in its pursuits] and plunge me into ruin. Therefore, I prefer to drive it through hardships rather than have it drive me to abominations." And Dhul-Nun said: "I have never been sated except that I sinned or intended a sin." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The first innovation to occur after the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was satiety."

Verily, when people's bellies are satiated, their souls become unruly, driving them toward this world, and this is not a single benefit but rather treasuries of benefits. Thus it is said: Hunger is a treasury from the treasuries of God Almighty. At the very least, hunger repels the lust of the private parts and the lust for speech, for the hungry one is not stirred by the desire for superfluous talk, thereby being freed from the afflictions of the tongue such as backbiting, obscenity, lying, slander, and others. Hunger prevents all of that, and when one is full, he craves amusement and inevitably indulges in the faults of others. And people are cast into the Fire on their faces only due to the harvest of their tongues.

As for the lust of the private parts: its harm is not hidden, and hunger suffices to curb its evil. When a man is satiated, he cannot control his private parts; and if piety restrains him from that, he cannot control his eye, for the eye commits adultery just as the private parts commit adultery. If he masters his eye by lowering his gaze, he cannot control his thoughts, so that vile imaginings and the whisperings of the soul concerning the causes of lust arise within him, disturbing his intimate communion—and perhaps this befalls him even during prayer.

We have mentioned the affliction of the tongue and the private parts only as an example; otherwise, all the sins of the seven limbs stem from the strength gained through satiety. A sage said: Every seeker who endures discipline by enduring plain bread for a year—mixing nothing of desires with it—and eats only half his fill, God will lift from him the burden of women.

The Sixth Benefit: Warding off sleep and maintaining wakefulness, for whoever eats to satiety drinks much, and whoever drinks much sleeps much. For this reason, some of the spiritual masters would say when food was presented: "O assembly of seekers, do not eat much, lest you drink much, then sleep much, then lose much." The unanimous opinion of seventy righteous saints was that excessive sleep stems from excessive drinking. In excessive sleep lies the squandering of one's lifespan, the loss of night vigil, the dulling of one's nature, and the hardening of the heart. One's lifespan is the most precious of jewels; it is the capital with which the servant trades. Sleep is a form of death, so increasing it diminishes the lifespan. Furthermore, the virtue of night vigil is evident, and sleep causes its loss. Whenever sleep overcomes one, the sweetness of worship in the night vigil is lost. Moreover, the celibate who sleeps on a full stomach may experience nocturnal emission, which also prevents him from the night vigil and necessitates ritual purification—either with cold water, which may cause him discomfort, or by visiting the bathhouse, which he may be unable to do at night. Consequently, he may miss the Witr prayer if he had delayed it until the night vigil. He then incurs the expense of the bathhouse, and his eye may fall upon private parts upon entering, for therein lie dangers we have mentioned in the Book of Purification. All of this is an effect of satiety. Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "Nocturnal emission is a punishment." He said this because it prevents many acts of worship due to the difficulty of performing the ritual ablution in every circumstance. Thus, sleep is a source of calamities, and satiety invites it, while hunger severs it.

The Seventh Benefit: Facilitating consistent devotion, for eating prevents abundant worship as it requires time occupied with consumption, and perhaps necessitates time for purchasing food and cooking it, then requires washing the hands and using toothpicks, then increases one's frequent visits to the water closet due to much drinking. The times expended on this, if directed instead to remembrance, intimate communion, and other acts of worship, would greatly increase one's profit. Al-Sari said: I saw with Ali al-Jurjani some barley porridge from which he was sipping, so I asked: What compelled you to this? He replied: I have secured between chewing and sipping seventy glorifications, and I have not chewed bread for forty years. So observe how he was vigilant over his moment and did not waste it in chewing. And every breath of life is a precious jewel of inestimable value; thus, one should acquire from it an everlasting treasury in the Hereafter that has no end, and that is by directing it to the remembrance of God and obedience to Him.

Among the things made difficult by excessive eating is maintaining ritual purity and constant presence in the mosque, for one frequently needs to leave due to drinking much water and relieving oneself. Among its benefits is fasting, for it becomes easy for one accustomed to hunger. Thus, fasting, constant retreat in the mosque, continuous purity, and diverting the time occupied with eating and its preparations to worship yield abundant profits—profits belittled only by the heedless who do not recognize the worth of religion, but are content with the life of this world and feel at ease in it, "knowing an outward aspect of the life of this world, while they are heedless of the Hereafter."

Abu Sulayman al-Darani pointed to six harms of satiety, saying: "Whoever is full is afflicted by six harms: loss of the sweetness of intimate prayer, difficulty in preserving wisdom, deprivation of compassion for creation—for when full, he thinks all people are full—heaviness in worship, increase of desires, and that while the believers circulate around the mosques, the satiated circulate around the dunghills."

The eighth benefit: From eating little one gains health of the body and repulsion of diseases, for their cause is excessive eating and the accumulation of waste humors in the stomach and veins. Then illness prevents acts of worship, disturbs the heart, hinders remembrance and reflection, spoils life, and necessitates bloodletting, cupping, medicine, and physicians—all requiring expenses and costs from which a person is not spared after toil, along with committing various sins and indulging desires. In hunger lies what prevents all of that.

It is recounted that al-Rashid gathered four physicians: an Indian, a Byzantine, an Iraqi, and a black man. He said, "Let each of you describe the remedy that contains no malady." The Indian said, "The remedy that contains no malady, in my view, is black myrobalan." The Iraqi said, "It is white garden cress." The Byzantine said, "In my view, it is hot water." The black man—who was the most knowledgeable among them—said, "Myrobalan constricts the stomach, and this is a malady; garden cress causes the stomach to become slippery, and this is a malady; hot water relaxes the stomach, and this is a malady." They said, "Then what is your view?" He replied, "The remedy that is accompanied by no malady, in my view, is that you do not eat food until you desire it, and that you withdraw your hand from it while you still desire it." They said, "You have spoken truthfully."

And it was mentioned to one of the philosophers among the physicians of the People of the Book that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "One-third [of the stomach] for food, one-third for drink, and one-third for breath." He was amazed by it and said, "I have never heard any statement regarding moderation in food more judicious than this; verily, it is the speech of a sage." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Gluttony is the root of every malady, and abstinence is the root of every remedy; and accustom every body to what it is accustomed to." I believe the physician's amazement stemmed from this report, not the former one.

Ibn Salim said, "Whoever eats wheat bread plainly, with proper etiquette, will not be afflicted by any ailment except the ailment of death." It was asked, "And what is the etiquette?" He said, "You eat when hungry and stop before being full." And one of the eminent physicians said in condemnation of excess: "The most beneficial thing a man puts into his belly is pomegranate, and the most harmful thing he puts into his stomach is salt; and for him to consume little salt is better for him than to consume much pomegranate." And in the hadith: "Fast, and you will be healthy." Thus, in fasting, hunger, and moderation in food lies the health of bodies and the health of hearts from the sickness of insolence, arrogance, and other such ailments.

The Ninth Benefit: Lightness of Burden. For whoever accustoms himself to eating little finds that a small amount of water suffices him, while he who accustoms himself to satiety makes his stomach a persistent creditor, seizing him by the collar each day, saying, "What will you eat today?" Thus he needs to enter into various means, acquiring from the unlawful and thereby disobeying, or from the lawful and thereby being humbled. Perhaps he needs to cast the eyes of greed upon people, and that is the ultimate humiliation and abasement. The believer is light in his needs. A certain sage said: "Indeed, I fulfill most of my needs by abandoning them, and that brings greater comfort to my heart." Another said: "When I wish to borrow from another for a desire or an excess, I borrow from myself by abandoning the desire, and it is the best creditor for me." Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, would ask his companions about the price of foods, and when they said they were expensive, he would say: "Make them cheap by abandoning them." And Sahl, may God have mercy on him, said: "The glutton is blameworthy in three situations: if he is among the people of worship, he becomes lazy; if he is an earner, he is not safe from afflictions; and if he is one upon whom something comes, he does not give God, exalted is He, His due from himself."

In summary, the cause of people's ruin is their greed for this world, and the cause of their greed for this world is the belly and the private parts, and the cause of the desire for the private parts is the desire of the belly. In reducing food intake lies what severs all these conditions, which are the gates of Hell, and in severing them lies the opening of the gates of Paradise, as it is said, "Persist in knocking on the door of Paradise with hunger." So whoever is content with a loaf of bread each day becomes content in all other desires as well, becomes free, becomes independent of people, finds rest from toil, and devotes himself to the worship of God Almighty and to the commerce of the Hereafter. Thus, he becomes among those whom no commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God. They are not distracted only because they are independent of such things through contentment. As for the needy one, he is inevitably distracted.

The tenth benefit: That one becomes capable of preferring others and giving in charity the surplus of one's food to orphans and the needy, so that on the Day of Resurrection he will be in the shade of his charity, as has come in the report: "What he eats becomes the store of the privy, and what he gives in charity becomes the store of God, the Exalted. Thus, the servant has nothing from his wealth except what he gives in charity and thus preserves, or eats and thus consumes, or wears and thus wears out. Therefore, giving the leftovers of food in charity is more worthy than gluttony and satiety." Al-Hasan, God's mercy upon him, when he recited the saying of God, the Exalted, "Indeed, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and feared it; but man undertook it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant," would say: "He offered it to the seven layered heavens and the pathways He adorned with stars and the bearers of the Great Throne. So He, glorious and exalted, said to it: 'Will you bear the Trust with what it entails?' It said: 'And what does it entail?' He said: 'If you do well, you will be rewarded, and if you do ill, you will be punished.' It said: 'No.' Then He offered it to man, and he undertook it. Indeed, he was unjust to himself, ignorant of his Lord's command.' By God, we have seen them purchase the Trust with their wealth and gain thousands, so what did they do with it? They expanded their homes with it and narrowed their graves with it; they fattened their nags and emaciated their religion; they exhausted themselves with the morning and evening journeys to the door of the ruler, exposing themselves to tribulation while they were in safety from God. One of them would say, 'Sell me such-and-such land and I will increase you such-and-such,' reclining on his left side and eating from wealth not his own. His speech is mockery and his wealth is forbidden. Until when indigestion seized him and satiety descended upon him, he would say, 'O servant, bring me something to digest my food with.' Woe to you! Is it your food that is digested? Rather, it is your religion that is digested. Where is the poor person? Where is the widow? Where is the needy? Where is the orphan whom God, the Exalted, has commanded you concerning?' This is an allusion to this benefit, which is directing surplus food to the poor person to store reward with it, for that is better for him than eating it until the burden multiplies upon him. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, looked at a man with a fat belly and gestured to his belly with his finger and said, 'If this were elsewhere, it would be better for you,' meaning if you had advanced it for your Hereafter and preferred others with it. And from Al-Hasan, who said, 'By God, I have encountered people among whom a man would have with him in the evening food sufficient for him, and if he wished, he could eat it, but he would say, 'By God, I will not make all of this for my belly until I make some of it for God.''

Thus, these are ten benefits of hunger, from each of which branch out benefits whose number cannot be confined nor their advantages exhausted. Hunger is a great treasury for the benefits of the Hereafter. For this reason, some of the pious predecessors said: Hunger is the key to the Hereafter and the door to asceticism, while satiety is the key to this world and the door to worldly desire. Indeed, that is made explicit in the narrations we have transmitted; by pondering the details of these benefits, one grasps the meanings of those narrations with knowledge and insight. If you do not recognize this yet believe in the virtue of hunger, you will have the rank of the imitators in faith—and God knows best what is correct.

Explanation of the Method of Spiritual Discipline in Breaking the Appetite of the Stomach

Know that the seeker has four duties regarding his stomach and what he consumes: The first is to eat nothing but what is lawful, for worship accompanied by consuming the unlawful is like building upon the waves of the sea. We have already mentioned what must be observed concerning the degrees of scrupulous piety in the Book of the Lawful and the Unlawful. There remain three duties specific to eating itself: determining the measure of food in terms of scantness and abundance, determining its timing in terms of delay and haste, and specifying the type of food consumed in terms of partaking of or abstaining from desired delicacies.

As for the first duty: concerning the reduction of food, the path of spiritual discipline therein is gradual progression. For he who is accustomed to much eating and shifts all at once to little, his temperament cannot bear it, and he weakens, and his hardship becomes great. Therefore, he should progress toward it little by little. This is by diminishing from his habitual food little by little. For example, if he eats two loaves and wishes to return himself to one loaf, he should diminish each day a quarter of a seventh of a loaf—that is, he diminishes one part out of twenty-eight parts, or one part out of thirty parts—thus returning to one loaf in a month, without harm befalling him and without its effect becoming apparent. If he wishes, he may do this by weighing, or if he wishes, by observation: he leaves each day the amount of a morsel and diminishes it from what he ate the day before. Now, in this there are four degrees.

Its utmost degree is to reduce oneself to the bare minimum sustenance without which one cannot survive, which is the practice of the truthful saints. This was the chosen path of Sahl al-Tustari, may God have mercy upon him, when he said: "God has bound creation with three things: life, intellect, and strength. If a servant fears for two of these—namely life and intellect—he should eat and break his fast if fasting, and strive to seek provision if he is poor. But if he does not fear for these two, but only for his strength, then he said it is fitting not to be concerned. Even if he becomes so weak that he prays sitting, I hold that his prayer sitting due to the weakness of hunger is better than his prayer standing with abundant food." Sahl was asked about his beginnings and what he used to subsist on. He replied: "My yearly provision was three dirhams: I would take one dirham's worth of syrup, one dirham's worth of rice flour, and one dirham's worth of clarified butter. I would mix them all and make three hundred and sixty morsels from it, taking one morsel each night to break my fast." He was asked: "And now, how do you eat?" He said: "Without limit or fixed timing." It is related of the self-denying devotees that they may reduce themselves to the measure of a dirham's worth of food.

The second degree: to discipline oneself through spiritual exercise to consume in a day and night half a mudd, which is a loaf and something of what constitutes four of these from a mann. It is likely that this amounts to one-third of the stomach's capacity for most people—as the Prophet ﷺ mentioned—and it is more than a few morsels, for this form indicates a small number, being less than ten. This was the habit of Umar, may God be pleased with him, for he would eat seven morsels or nine morsels.

The third degree: to reduce it to the measure of a mudd, which is two and a half loaves. This exceeds one-third of the stomach for most people and nearly reaches two-thirds of it, leaving one-third for drink and nothing left for remembrance. In some versions, it is "one-third for remembrance" instead of his saying "for the breath."

The fourth degree is to exceed the measure up to the *mann*, and it seems that what lies beyond the *mann* is extravagance, contrary to the saying of the Almighty, "And do not be extravagant," meaning for most people, for the amount of need for food varies by age, individual, and the work one engages in. And here is a fifth way in which there is no fixed measure, but it is a place of error: that one eats when his hunger is true and withdraws his hand while still having a genuine appetite. However, it is most likely that whoever does not limit himself to one or two loaves will not discern the limit of true hunger, and it will be confused for him with false appetite.

For genuine hunger, signs have been mentioned; one of them is that the soul does not crave a condiment, but rather eats bread alone with appetite—whatever bread it may be. So whenever his soul craves a specific type of bread or seeks a condiment, that is not genuine hunger. And it has been said: among its signs is that one spits and flies do not land upon it; meaning, no greasiness or fat remains in it, indicating the emptiness of the stomach. Understanding this is subtle, so the correct approach for the seeker is to gauge with his soul the amount that does not weaken him for the worship he is engaged in. When he reaches that point, he should stop, even if his appetite remains.

In summary, precisely measuring food is not feasible because it varies according to circumstances and individuals. Indeed, the sustenance for a group of the Companions was one *sa'* of wheat each week. When they ate dates, they would sustain themselves with a *sa'* and a half thereof. A *sa'* of wheat is four *mudd*, so each day's portion would be close to half a *mud*—which is what we mentioned as being the measure of one-third of the stomach. An increase was needed for dates due to the removal of the pits. Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "My food each week is a *sa'* of barley from the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and by God, I will not add anything to it until I meet him, for I heard him say: 'The closest of you to me in seating on the Day of Resurrection and the most beloved to me are those who die upon what they are upon today.'" And he would say in his disapproval of some Companions: "You have changed; barley is sifted for you, though it was not sifted; you bake thin bread, combine two condiments, and vary the colors of your food, and one of you goes out in the morning in one garment and returns in another. They were not like this in the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." The sustenance of the People of the Bench was a *mud* of dates between two men each day. A *mud* is one and one-third *ratl*, and the pits are removed from it. Al-Hasan, mercy of God upon him, would say: "The believer is like the wild goat; a handful of dry dates, a fistful of parched barley flour, and a gulp of water suffice him. The hypocrite is like the ravenous beast, gulping and devouring, never filling his belly for his neighbor nor preferring his brother with his surplus. Direct these excesses before you." Sahl said: "If the world were pure blood, the believer's sustenance from it would be lawful, for the believer's eating in necessity is only to the measure of what maintains him."

The Second Duty: Concerning the Time of Eating and the Extent of Its Postponement, which also comprises four degrees:

The highest degree is to fast for three days or more. Among the aspirants, some have made the spiritual exercise about the act of folding [the days] itself, not about the specific duration, to the extent that some reached thirty days and forty days. A group of scholars, whose number is considerable, attained this, among them: Muhammad ibn 'Amr al-Muqarani, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Ibrahim, Rahim, Ibrahim al-Taymi, Hajjaj ibn Farafisa, Hafs al-'Abid al-Misisi, al-Muslim ibn Sa'id, Zuhayr, Sulayman al-Khawwas, Sahl ibn 'Abd Allah al-Tustari, and Ibrahim ibn Ahmad al-Khawwas. Indeed, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, would fast for six days, and 'Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr would fast for seven days, and Abu al-Jawza', the companion of Ibn 'Abbas, would fast for seven. It is narrated that al-Thawri and Ibrahim ibn Adham would fast in sets of three days. All of them would seek assistance through hunger for the path of the Hereafter.

Some scholars have said: Whoever secludes himself for God for forty days, a power from the dominion appears to him—meaning he is unveiled to some of the divine mysteries. It has been related that one of the people of this group passed by a monk and conversed with him about his state, hoping for his conversion to Islam and abandonment of the delusion he was upon. He spoke to him at length on the matter until the monk said to him: "Verily, the Messiah would seclude himself for forty days, and that is a miracle that occurs only for a prophet or a righteous saint." The Sufi said to him: "Then if I seclude myself for fifty days, will you leave what you are upon and enter the religion of Islam, knowing that it is the truth and that you are upon falsehood?" He said: "Yes." So he sat, not departing except from where he could see him, until he completed fifty days. Then he said: "And I will increase it for you further," and he secluded himself until the completion of sixty days. The monk was amazed at him and said: "I did not think anyone could surpass the Messiah." That became the cause of his conversion to Islam. This is a great station; few reach it except one who is unveiled, carried by witnessing what severs him from his innate nature and his habit, fulfilling his soul in its delight and making him forget his hunger and his need.

The second degree is to fast for two to three days consecutively, which is not beyond ordinary human capacity but rather attainable through earnest effort and spiritual striving.

The third degree, which is the lowest, is to limit oneself to one meal per day and night, and this is the minimum. Anything beyond that is extravagance and persistent satiety to the point of never experiencing hunger, which is the practice of the indulgent and far removed from the Sunnah. It has been narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, would not eat supper if he had eaten lunch, and would not eat lunch if he had eaten supper. The early generations would eat one meal each day. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to 'A'ishah, "Beware of extravagance, for two meals in a day are extravagance, one meal every two days is austerity, and one meal per day is a balanced moderation between them." This is what is praised in the Book of Allah, the Almighty.

Whoever limits himself to one meal per day, it is recommended for him to eat it during the pre-dawn meal (suhur) before the break of dawn. Thus, his eating occurs after the night vigil prayer (tahajjud) and before the dawn prayer (fajr). This secures for him the hunger of the day for fasting and the hunger of the night for standing in prayer, along with the heart's clarity due to an empty stomach and the refinement of thought, the focusing of concern, and the settling of the soul upon the known, so it does not contend with him before its time. In the hadith of 'Asim ibn Kulayb from his father from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, never performed your kind of standing (in prayer). Indeed, he would stand until his feet became swollen, and he never fasted continuously like your continuous fasting, except that he would delay breaking his fast until the pre-dawn meal." And in the hadith of 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, she said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, would fast continuously until the pre-dawn meal." If the heart of the fasting person turns after sunset towards food and that distracts him from the presence of heart during the night vigil, then it is preferable for him to divide his food into two portions. For example, if he has two loaves, he eats one loaf at the time of breaking the fast (iftar) and one loaf at the time of the pre-dawn meal, so that his soul may be settled and his body light during the night vigil, and his hunger during the day is not severe due to having taken the pre-dawn meal. Thus, he is aided by the first loaf for the night vigil and by the second for the fast. And whoever fasts one day and breaks his fast the next day, there is no harm in him eating his meal for the day of breaking fast at noon, and on his fasting day at the time of the pre-dawn meal. These are the methods regarding the timings of eating, its spacing, and its proximity.

The Third Duty: Concerning the Types of Food and Abstaining from Condiments. The highest grade of food is fine wheat flour; if it is sifted, it represents the peak of luxury. The middle grade is sifted barley, and the lowest is unsifted barley. The highest condiments are meat and sweets, the lowest are salt and vinegar, and the middle are dishes prepared with oils but without meat. The practice of those who tread the path to the Hereafter is to abstain from condiments consistently, indeed to abstain from all appetites. For every delightful thing a person craves, and whose consumption he pursues, induces arrogance in his soul, hardness in his heart, and familiarity with worldly pleasures until he becomes accustomed to them and develops an aversion to death and meeting God Almighty. The world thus becomes a paradise in his estimation, and death a prison for him. But if he denies his soul its appetites, constricts it, and deprives it of its pleasures, the world becomes a prison and a constriction for him, and his soul yearns to escape from it. Then death becomes its release. This is alluded to in the saying of Yahya ibn Mu'adh when he said: "O assembly of the truthful, starve your souls for the banquet of Paradise, for the appetite for food is proportionate to the starving of the soul." All the harms of satiety we have mentioned apply to all appetites and the indulgence in pleasures, so we shall not prolong by repeating them. Therefore, the reward for abstaining from appetites, even permissible ones, is immense, and the danger in indulging them is great. It was said: "The worst of my community are those who eat fine wheat flour." This is not a prohibition; rather, it is permissible in the sense that one who eats it once or twice does not sin, and even one who persists in it does not sin by consuming it. However, his soul is nurtured by comfort, becomes familiar with the world, grows accustomed to pleasures, and strives to seek them, which then leads him to sins. They are the worst of the community because fine wheat flour leads them to plunge into matters, and those matters are sins. And it was said: "The worst of my community are those who are nourished with comfort and whose bodies grow upon it." Their only concern is the varieties of food and types of clothing, and they are verbose in speech. God Almighty revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "Remember that you are a dweller of the grave, for that will prevent you from many appetites." The predecessors were intensely fearful of consuming delicious foods and accustoming the soul to them, seeing that as a sign of wretchedness, and they saw being prevented by God from it as the ultimate happiness. It is narrated that Wahb ibn Munabbih said: "Two angels met in the fourth heaven. One said to the other: 'From where have you come?' He replied: 'I was commanded to drive a fish from the sea that a certain cursed Jew craved.' The other said: 'I was commanded to spill oil that a certain worshipper craved.'" This is an indication that facilitating the means to appetites is not among the signs of good. For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, refrained from a drink of cold water with honey, saying: "Spare me its account." There is no act of worship to God Almighty greater than opposing the soul in its appetites and abandoning pleasures—as we have mentioned in the Book of Disciplining the Soul. It is narrated that Nafi' said: Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, was ill and craved a fresh fish. It was sought for him in Medina but was not found, then found after such and such time. It was bought for him for a dirham and a half, grilled, and brought to him on a loaf of bread. A beggar stood at the door, and he said to the servant: "Wrap it in its bread and give it to him." The servant said to him: "May God rectify you, I have craved it for such and such time and we did not find it. When we found it, I bought it for a dirham and a half. Let us give him its price." He said: "Wrap it and give it to him." Then the servant said to the beggar: "Will you take a dirham and leave it?" He said: "Yes." So he gave him a dirham and took it, brought it, and placed it before him, saying: "I gave him a dirham and took it from him." He said: "Wrap it and give it to him, and do not take the dirham from him, for I heard the Messenger of God say: 'Any person who craves an appetite and then denies his appetite, preferring it for himself, God will forgive him.'" And he said: "If you block the dog of hunger with a loaf and a jug of pure water, then upon the world and its people be destruction." He indicated that the objective is to repel the pain of hunger and thirst and ward off their harm, not to indulge in worldly pleasures. It reached 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, that Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan ate various types of food. 'Umar said to a servant of his: "When you know his supper is ready, inform me." He did so, and 'Umar entered upon him. His supper was brought near, and they brought him a meat broth. 'Umar ate with him. Then roasted meat was brought near, and Yazid extended his hand, but 'Umar restrained his hand and said: "O Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, food after food? By the One in whose hand is 'Umar's soul, if you deviate from their way, you will be deviated from their path." From Yasar ibn 'Umair, who said: "I never sifted flour for 'Umar without being disobedient to him." It is narrated that 'Utbah the servant would knead his flour and dry it in the sun, then eat it, saying: "A morsel and salt," so that in the Hereafter roasted meat and good food would be prepared for him. He would take a jug and scoop with it from a well that had been in the sun all day. A female servant of his said to him: "O 'Utbah, if you gave me your flour, I would bake bread for you and cool water for you?" He would say to her: "O mother of so-and-so, you have driven away from me the dog of hunger."

Saqiq ibn Ibrahim said: I met Ibrahim ibn Adham in Mecca at the Night Market—near the Prophet’s birthplace—weeping as he sat by the side of the road. I turned aside to him, sat with him, and said, “What is this weeping, O Abu Ishaq?” He replied, “It is good.” I asked him again a second and a third time. He said, “O Saqiq, keep this concealed for me.” I said, “My brother, say what you wish.” He told me, “My soul has craved a meat stew for thirty years, and I restrained it with all my strength. Until last night, I was sitting when drowsiness overcame me, and behold, a young lad was before me holding a green bowl from which rose steam and the aroma of that stew. My resolve gathered against it, but he brought it near and said, ‘O Ibrahim, eat.’ I said, ‘I will not eat; I have left it for God, Mighty and Majestic.’ He said to me, ‘God has fed it to you—eat.’ I had no reply except that I wept. He said to me, ‘Eat, may God have mercy on you.’ I said, ‘We have been commanded not to put into our vessel except from a source we know.’ He said, ‘Eat, may God preserve you, for it has been given to you.’ Then it was said, ‘O Khidr, take this and feed the soul of Ibrahim ibn Adham, for God has shown it mercy due to its long patience in bearing what it withholds from itself. Know, O Ibrahim, that I heard the angels say: Whoever gives and does not take, seeks and is not given.’ I said, ‘If that is so, then here I am before you on account of the covenant with God, Exalted.’ Then I turned and there was another lad; he handed him something and said, ‘O Khidr, feed him yourself.’ He kept feeding me until I grew drowsy, then I awoke with its sweetness in my mouth.” Saqiq said: I said, “Show me your hand.” I took his hand and kissed it, saying, “O You who feed the hungry their cravings when they make abstinence sound, O You who kindle certainty in the conscience, O You who heals their hearts with love of You—do You see any state for Saqiq with You?” Then I raised Ibrahim’s hand to heaven and said, “By the measure of this hand with You, and by the measure of its owner, and by the generosity that has been found from You—be generous to Your poor servant who is in need of Your bounty, Your kindness, and Your mercy, even if he does not deserve it.” Then Ibrahim stood and walked until we reached the house.

It is narrated that Malik ibn Dinar remained for forty years desiring milk, yet he did not drink it. One day, fresh dates were gifted to him, and he said to his companions, "Eat, for I have not tasted these for forty years." Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari said: Abu Sulayman al-Darani craved a hot loaf of bread with salt. I brought it to him; he took a bite, then cast it aside and began to weep, saying, "I hastened to my desire after prolonging my struggle and toil! I had resolved upon repentance, so pardon me!" Ahmad said: I never saw him eat salt again until he met God, the Exalted. Malik ibn Digham said: I passed through the market in Basra and looked at the vegetables. My soul said to me, 'If only you would feed me some of this tonight.' So I swore not to feed it any for forty nights. And Malik ibn Dinar stayed in Basra for fifty years, never eating a single fresh date or dried date from its people. He said, "O people of Basra, I have lived among you fifty years without eating a single fresh or dried date of yours. What increased for you did not decrease for me, and what decreased for me did not increase for you." And he said, "I divorced the world fifty years ago. My soul has desired milk for forty years, and by God, I will not feed it until I meet God, the Exalted." Hammad ibn Abi Hanifah said: I came to Dawud al-Ta'i while his door was closed, and I heard him saying, "My soul, you desired carrots, and I fed you carrots. Then you desired dates, so I vowed you would never eat them." I gave greetings, entered, and found him alone. One day, Abu Hazim passed through the market, saw fruit, and bought it. He said to his son, "Buy us some of this cut and forbidden fruit, perhaps we may proceed to the fruit that is neither cut nor forbidden." When he bought it and brought it to him, he said to his soul, "You have deceived me until I looked and desired, and you overpowered me until I bought. By God, I will make you taste it!" So he sent it to some orphaned poor. And from Musa al-Ashaj, it is said he stated, "My soul has craved coarse salt for twenty years." Ahmad ibn Khalifah said, "My soul has desired for twenty years; it asks nothing of me but water until it is quenched, yet I do not quench it." It is narrated that 'Utbah al-Ghulam craved meat for seven years. After that time, he said, "I became ashamed before my soul for resisting it for seven years—year after year." So he bought a piece of meat with bread, roasted it, and left it on a loaf. He met a boy and said, "Are you not the son of so-and-so, and has your father died?" He said, "Yes." So he gave it to him. They said: He turned away weeping and reciting, "And they give food, despite their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive." Then he did not taste it after that. He remained craving dates for years. Then one day, he bought dates for a qirat and kept them until night to break his fast with them. He said: "A strong wind blew until the world grew dark, and the people were alarmed. 'Utbah turned to his soul, saying, 'This is due to my audacity against you and my buying dates for a qirat!' Then he said to his soul, 'I think the people are only seized because of your sin—on condition that you do not taste it.'" Dawud al-Ta'i bought vegetables for half a fals and vinegar for a fals, and spent his whole night saying to his soul, "Woe to you, O Dawud, how long your account will be on the Day of Resurrection!" Then he ate nothing afterward but dry bread. One day, 'Utbah al-Ghulam said to 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zayd, "So-and-so describes a spiritual station for himself that I do not recognize in myself." He said, "Because you eat dates with your bread, while he adds nothing to his bread." He said, "If I cease eating dates, will I know that station?" He said, "Yes, and others besides." So he began to weep. One of his companions said to him, "May God not make your eye weep—are you weeping over dates?" 'Abd al-Wahid said, "Leave him, for his soul has recognized the truth of his resolve to abandon, and when he leaves something, he does not return to it." Ja'far ibn Nasr said: Al-Junayd ordered me to buy him Waziri figs. When I bought them, he took one at breakfast, placed it in his mouth, then threw it away and began to weep. Then he said, "Take it away." I questioned him about it, and he said, "A caller called out to me: 'Are you not ashamed? You left it for My sake, then you return to it!'" Salih al-Murri said: I said to 'Ata' al-Sulami, "I have taken trouble to prepare something for you, so do not reject my kindness." He said, "Do as you wish." So I sent him with my son a drink of sawiq mixed with butter and honey, saying, "Do not leave until he drinks it." The next day, I prepared the like for him, but he returned it and did not drink it. I reproached and blamed him for that, saying, "Glory be to God! You have rejected my kindness!" When he saw my distress, he said, "Let this not grieve you. I drank it the first time, but I tried to persuade my soul to drink it the second time and could not. Whenever I intended to, I remembered the saying of God, the Exalted, 'He will gulp it but will hardly swallow it...'" Salih said: I wept and said to myself, "I am in one valley, and you are in another." Al-Sari al-Saqati said: "For thirty years, my soul has demanded that I dip a carrot in dibs, but I have not fed it." Abu Bakr al-Jalla' said: I know a man whose soul says to him, "I will endure fasting for ten days for you, then feed me a craving I desire." He says to it, "I do not want you to fast ten days; rather, leave this craving." It is narrated that an ascetic invited one of his brothers and presented him with two loaves. His brother began to turn the loaves over to choose the better one. The ascetic said to him, "Stop! What are you doing? Do you not know that in the loaf you turned away from are such-and-such wisdoms, and such-and-such a maker worked on it—from the cloud that carries the water, and the water that irrigates the earth, and the winds, and the earth, and the beasts, and the children of Adam, until it came to you? Then after all this, you turn it over and are not satisfied with it?"

In the tradition: "The loaf does not complete its round and is placed before you until three hundred and sixty craftsmen have labored upon it. The first of them is Michael, peace be upon him, who measures out water from the treasuries of mercy; then the angels who drive the clouds, the sun, the moon, and the celestial spheres; and the angels of the air and the creatures of the earth—the last of them being the baker." "And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them." [46] One of them said: I came to Qasim al-Jar'i and asked him about asceticism—what is it? He said: What have you heard concerning it? I enumerated various sayings, and he remained silent. I said: And what do you say? He said: Know that the stomach is the world of the servant; to the extent he possesses his stomach, he possesses asceticism, and to the extent his stomach possesses him, the world possesses him. Bishr ibn al-Harith once fell ill, and 'Abd al-Rahman the physician came to him, asking about some suitable foods. He said: You ask me, yet if I prescribe for you, you will not accept from me. Describe to me so that I may hear. He said: You should drink oxymel, suck on a quince, and after that eat safidbaj. Bishr said to him: Do you know of anything less than oxymel that could take its place? He said: No. He said: I know. He said: What is it? He said: Chicory with vinegar. Then he said: Do you know of anything less than a quince that could take its place? He said: No. He said: I know. He said: What is it? He said: Syrian carob. He said: Then do you know of anything less than safidbaj that could take its place? He said: No. He said: I know; chickpea water with cow's ghee is equivalent to it. 'Abd al-Rahman said to him: You are more knowledgeable than I in medicine; why then did you ask me? By this, I understood that these individuals refrained from desires and from satiety in sustenance, and their abstention was for the benefits we have mentioned. At times, it was because lawful provision was not pure for them, so they permitted themselves only what was necessary. Desires are not among the necessities, to the point that Abu Sulayman said: Salt is a desire, for it is an addition to bread, and whatever is beyond bread is a desire. This is the ultimate degree. Whoever is incapable of that should not be heedless of himself nor plunge into desires. It is sufficient extravagance for a person to eat all he desires and do all he inclines to. Thus, one should not persist in eating meat. 'Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: Whoever forsakes meat for forty days, his character deteriorates; and whoever persists in it for forty days, his heart hardens. It is said that persistence in eating meat creates a craving like the craving for wine. Whenever one is hungry and his soul yearns for intercourse, he should not eat and then engage in intercourse, thereby granting his soul two desires so that it overpowers him; perhaps the soul seeks food to become vigorous for intercourse. It is recommended not to sleep on fullness, combining two heedlessnesses, so that lethargy returns and his heart hardens because of it. Rather, let him pray or sit remembering God Almighty, for that is closer to gratitude. In the hadith: "Dissolve your food with remembrance and prayer, and do not sleep upon it, lest your hearts harden." [47] The minimum of that is to pray four rak'ahs, or glorify God a hundred times, or recite a portion of the Qur'an after his meal. Indeed, Abu Sufyan al-Thawri, if he was full at night, would keep vigil, and if he was full during the day, he would follow it with prayer and remembrance. He used to say: Feed the Zanj slave and he will toil; and at times he would say: Feed the donkey and he will toil. Whenever one desires something from food or fine fruits, he should leave the bread and eat them instead, so that they become sustenance and not mere indulgence, lest he combine for his soul both habit and desire. Sahl looked at Ibn Salim, and in his hand was bread and dates. He said to him: Begin with the dates; if they suffice you, well and good; if not, then take from the bread afterward according to your need. Whenever one finds delicate food and coarse food, let him take the delicate first, for he will not desire the coarse afterward. If he were to take the coarse first, he would eat the delicate also due to its delicacy. One of them said to his companions: Do not eat the desired foods; if you eat them, do not seek them; if you seek them, do not love them. And seeking certain types of bread is a desire. 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, mercy of God upon them both, said: No fruit comes to us from Iraq more beloved to us than bread—thus he considered that bread a fruit.

In summary, there is no way to neglect the soul in permissible desires and follow it in every circumstance. For to the extent that a servant indulges his desire, he may fear that it will be said to him on the Day of Resurrection, "You exhausted your good things in your worldly life and enjoyed them therein." And to the extent that he strives against his soul and abandons his desire, he will enjoy his desires in the Abode of the Hereafter. A certain man from Basra said: "My soul contended with me for a loaf of barley bread and some fish, and I denied it. Its demand grew strong and my struggle against it intensified for twenty years. When I died, someone said: 'I saw him in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He replied, "I cannot adequately describe what my Lord bestowed upon me of blessings and honors. The first thing with which He received me was a loaf of barley bread and fish." And He said, "Eat your desire today, wholesome and without account."'" And God Almighty has said, "Eat and drink wholesomely for what you sent ahead in the days gone by." And they had sent ahead the abandonment of desires. For this reason, Abu Sulayman said: "Abandoning a single desire is more beneficial for the heart than fasting and praying at night for a year." May God grant us success in what pleases Him.

Explanation of the Differences in the Ruling and Virtue of Hunger

And the differing states of people concerning it.

Know that the ultimate aim in all matters and character traits is the middle path, for the best of matters are their balanced means, and both extremes of intended matters are blameworthy. What we have presented regarding the virtues of hunger may perhaps suggest that excess in it is desirable—far from it! But among the secrets of the wisdom of the Sacred Law is that whenever nature seeks the extreme in something wherein lies corruption, the Law comes with an emphatic prohibition of it, in a manner that hints to the ignorant that the aim is to oppose what nature demands to the utmost extent possible. The discerning person realizes that the intended goal is the middle path, because if nature seeks the limit of satiety, the Law ought to praise the limit of hunger, so that nature becomes an instigator and the Law a restrainer; they counterbalance each other and moderation is achieved. For one who is capable of suppressing nature entirely is rare, and it is known that he does not reach the extreme; indeed, if he were to be excessive in opposing nature, there would also be in the Law evidence indicating his wrongdoing—just as the Law greatly praises standing in prayer at night and fasting by day, yet when the Prophet (peace be upon him) learned of the condition of some who fasted the entire year and stood in prayer all night, he forbade it. So when you understand this, know that what is best relative to a balanced nature is to eat in such a way that one does not feel the heaviness of the stomach nor the pain of hunger, but rather forgets his stomach so that hunger leaves no trace in him at all. For the purpose of eating is the preservation of life and strength for worship, and heaviness of the stomach prevents worship, while the pain of hunger also distracts the heart and hinders it. Thus, the aim is to eat in a manner where the food leaves no trace, so that one may resemble the angels, for they are sanctified from the heaviness of food and the pain of hunger, and the utmost aspiration of man is to emulate them. And if a person cannot escape satiety and hunger entirely, then the state farthest from both extremes is the middle path, which is moderation.

The example of a human seeking distance from these opposing extremes by returning to the middle is like an ant thrown into the center of a ring of fire laid upon the ground. The ant flees from the heat of the ring, which surrounds it, unable to escape. It continues to flee until it settles upon the center point, which is the middle. If it were to die, it would die in the middle, for the middle is the farthest place from the heat of the surrounding ring. Likewise, desires surround a person just as that ring surrounds the ant, while the angels are outside that ring. A person has no hope of escaping it, yet desires to resemble the angels in deliverance. The state most resembling them is distance, and the farthest place from the extremes is the middle. Thus, the middle becomes sought in all these opposing conditions. From this, the Prophet ﷺ expressed with his saying, "The best of matters are their middle ones," and to this points the saying of the Almighty, "Eat and drink, but do not be excessive." Whenever a person feels neither hunger nor fullness, worship and contemplation become easy for him, his soul becomes light, and he gains strength for action along with that lightness. But this is after the temperament has become balanced.

At the outset, when the soul is unruly, yearning for pleasures, and inclined to excess, moderation does not benefit it. Rather, it is necessary to go to extremes in causing it pain through hunger, just as one goes to extremes in causing pain to an untamed beast through hunger, beating, and the like until it becomes balanced. Once it is trained, becomes upright, and returns to moderation, the torment and pain are ceased. For this very reason, the spiritual master commands his disciple to do what he himself does not undertake—he commands him to fast while he himself does not go hungry, and he forbids him fruits and pleasures, though he may not abstain from them himself. This is because he has already completed disciplining his soul and thus has no need for torment. Since the predominant states of the soul are greed, desire, unruliness, and resistance to worship, what is most beneficial for it is hunger, whose pain it feels in most circumstances, so that its self may be broken. The aim is to break it until it becomes balanced, after which nourishment is also restored to moderation. Only two types among the travelers on the path to the Hereafter abstain from persistent hunger: either a sincere saint or a deluded fool.

As for the upright truthful one: it is due to the straightness of his soul upon the straight path and his self-sufficiency from being driven by the whips of hunger to the Truth. As for the deluded one: it is due to his presumption about his soul that he is the truthful one who is in no need of disciplining his soul, supposing it to be good. And this is a great delusion, and it is the most prevalent. For the soul is seldom disciplined with complete discipline, and often it is deluded, so it looks at the truthful one and his leniency with his soul in that matter, and thus he becomes lenient with his own soul—like a sick person who looks at one who has recovered from his illness and partakes of what he partakes, presuming his own health, and so perishes. What indicates that interpreting food as a small amount—at a specific time and of a specific kind—is not the objective in itself—but rather it is a struggle against a soul that is distant from the Truth, not reaching the rank of perfection—is that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had no fixed measure or timing for his food.

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would fast so continuously that we would say, "He will not break his fast," and he would break his fast so continuously that we would say, "He will not fast." He would enter upon his family and ask, "Do you have anything?" If they said yes, he would eat; and if they said no, he would say, "Then I am fasting." Sometimes something would be presented to him, and he would say, "I had intended to fast," but then he would eat. One day he went out and said, "I am fasting." Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said to him, "Some dates mixed with butter and cheese have been gifted to us." He said, "I had intended to fast, but bring it near."

It is related of Sahl that he was asked: "How were you in your beginnings?" He then recounted various forms of spiritual discipline, among them: that he subsisted on the leaves of the Christ's thorn for a period; and that he ate dried figs for a period of three years. Then he mentioned that he subsisted on three dirhams over three years. So it was said to him: "And how are you in this time of yours?" He replied: "I eat without limit or fixed measure." The meaning of his saying "without limit or fixed measure" is not that I eat much, but rather that I do not determine by a single measure what I eat.

Ma‘ruf al-Karkhi was presented with fine foods and would eat them. It was said to him: "Your brother Bishr does not eat the like of this?" He replied: "My brother Bishr has been seized by scrupulosity, while I have been expanded by spiritual knowledge." Then he said: "I am but a guest in the abode of my Master; if He feeds me, I eat, and if He makes me hungry, I endure patiently. What have I to do with objection and discrimination?"

Ibrahim ibn Adham gave some dirhams to one of his brethren and said: "Take these dirhams and get for us some fresh butter, honey, and soft bread." It was said: "O Abu Ishaq, all this with these?" He said: "Woe to you! When we find, we eat as men eat, and when we lack, we endure as men endure."

One day he prepared a great deal of food and invited a small group to it, among whom were al-Awza‘i and al-Thawri. Al-Thawri said to him: "O Abu Ishaq, do you not fear that this is extravagance?" He replied: "There is no extravagance in food; extravagance is only in clothing and furnishings."

He who acquires knowledge merely through hearing and transmission by imitation sees this from Ibrahim ibn Adham and hears from Malik ibn Dinar that he said, "Salt has not entered my house for twenty years." And from Sari al-Saqati that for forty years he desired to dip a carrot in syrup but did not do it, so he considers it contradictory and becomes perplexed or concludes that one of them is mistaken. But the insightful one, who perceives the secrets of speech, knows that all of that is true, yet relative to the differing states. Then these varying states are heard by an astute, needy person or a deluded fool. The cautious one says, "I am not among the knowers such that I may indulge myself, for there is none more obedient than the soul of Sari al-Saqati and Malik ibn Dinar, and these are among those who abstain from desires, so they are to be followed." The deluded one says, "My soul is not more disobedient to me than the soul of Ma'ruf al-Karkhi and Ibrahim ibn Adham, so I will follow them and elevate my estimation in my food, for I too am a guest in the abode of my Master, so what have I to do with objection?" Then, if someone fell short in his right, his reverence, his wealth, or his status in a single manner, an uproar would arise against him and he would busy himself with objection. This is a vast field for Satan with the foolish. Rather, elevating estimation in food, fasting, and consuming desires is only safe for one who looks from the niche of sainthood and prophethood, so that between him and God there is a sign in his indulgence and restraint. And that is only after the soul exits entirely from obedience to caprice and habit, such that his eating when he eats is with intention just as his abstention is with intention, so he becomes an actor for God in his eating and breaking fast. Thus, one should learn caution from Umar, may God be pleased with him, for he saw the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, love honey and eat it, yet he did not equate himself with him. Rather, when a cold drink mixed with honey was presented to him, he turned the vessel in his hand and said, "Should I drink it, its sweetness will vanish but its consequence will remain. Keep its account away from me," and he left it.

These secrets are not permissible for a spiritual guide to disclose to his disciple; rather, he should confine himself to praising hunger alone. He should not call him to moderation, for he will inevitably fall short of what he is called to. Therefore, he should call him to the utmost degree of hunger until moderation becomes easy for him. Nor should he mention to him that the perfect gnostic is independent of spiritual discipline, for Satan finds a point of attachment in his heart and whispers to him every hour: 'You are a perfect gnostic; what is lacking in your gnosis and perfection?' Indeed, it was the habit of Ibrahim al-Khawwas to engage with the disciple in every spiritual discipline he commanded him to perform, lest it occur to his mind that the guide commands him to do what he himself did not do, and thus repel him from his discipline. And the strong one, when he occupies himself with spiritual discipline and the rectification of others, must descend to the level of the weak, emulating them and being gentle in guiding them to felicity. This is a great trial for the prophets and the saints. And since moderation is hidden in the case of every individual, caution and prudence should never be abandoned under any circumstance. For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, disciplined his son 'Abdullah when he entered upon him and found him eating meat cooked with clarified butter. He struck him with a whip and said: 'May your mother be bereft of you! Eat one day bread with meat, another day bread with milk, another day bread with clarified butter, another day bread with oil, another day bread with salt, and another day bread alone.' This is moderation. As for persistent consumption of meat and appetites, that is excess and extravagance; and completely abandoning meat is austerity. This is the balanced middle course between them, and God, the Exalted, knows best.

Explanation of the affliction of ostentation that infiltrates those who abandon indulging in appetites and reduce their food intake.

Know that two great calamities befall one who abandons worldly desires, which are greater than indulging in them. The first is that the soul may be unable to relinquish certain desires and thus craves them, yet the person does not wish to be known as craving them, so he conceals his appetite and consumes in private what he would not consume in public. This is hidden polytheism. A scholar was once asked about a certain ascetic and remained silent. When asked, "Do you know of any fault in him?" he replied, "He eats in private what he does not eat in public." This is a grave calamity. Indeed, it is incumbent upon the servant, when afflicted by desires and love for them, to reveal them, for this is sincerity in one's state, and it substitutes for the loss of spiritual struggles through deeds. Concealing deficiency and displaying its opposite as perfection are two compounded shortcomings, and lying while hiding constitutes two falsehoods, making one deserving of punishment and unacceptable except through two sincere repentances. For this reason, the matter of the hypocrites was made severe, as God Almighty said, "Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire." For the disbeliever disbelieves and makes it apparent, while this one disbelieves and conceals it. His concealment of his disbelief becomes another disbelief, because he belittles God’s gaze into his heart and magnifies the gaze of creatures, thus erasing disbelief from his outward appearance. The knowers of God are tested with desires, even with sins, but they are not tested with hypocrisy, deceit, and concealment. Rather, the perfection of the knower is to abandon desires for the sake of God Almighty and to reveal the desire within himself, thereby lowering his station in the hearts of creation. Some of them would purchase desires and hang them in their homes while being among the ascetics, intending only to obscure their true state so as to divert the hearts of the heedless away from themselves, lest they disturb his spiritual condition.

The ultimate degree of asceticism is to renounce even the display of renunciation by manifesting its opposite, and this is the practice of the truthful ones. For it combines two truths, just as the former combines two falsehoods. This one has borne upon the soul two burdens and made it drink the cup of patience twice: once by drinking it and once by casting it away. Thus, no wonder those are given their reward twice for what they patiently endured. This resembles the way of one who gives openly but takes and returns secretly, to humble himself openly through humiliation and secretly through poverty. Whoever misses this should not miss manifesting his desire and deficiency and being truthful therein. Nor should he be deceived by Satan’s whisper: “If you reveal it, others will follow your example, so conceal it for the sake of reforming others.” For if he truly intended to reform others, reforming himself would be more pressing upon him than reforming others. This one merely aims at pure ostentation, which Satan makes appealing to him under the guise of reforming others. Therefore, the manifestation of this becomes burdensome to him. And know that whoever becomes aware of it is not to be followed in action, nor is he deterred by the belief that he has abandoned desires.

The second affliction is when one is capable of abandoning lusts, yet delights in being known for it, thereby becoming renowned for abstaining from desires. In this, he has opposed a weak lust—the lust for food—but obeyed a lust that is worse than it: the lust for status. That is the hidden lust. Whenever one perceives this within himself, breaking this lust is more imperative than breaking the lust for food; so let him eat, for that is more fitting for him. Abu Sulayman said: "If a lust is presented to you, and you had been abstaining from it, then partake of it a little, but do not grant your soul its full desire. Thus, you will have removed the lust from yourself and will have made it bitter for your soul by not granting it its craving." Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq said: "If a lust is presented to me, I look at my soul. If it displays its lust, I feed it from that, and that is better than denying it. But if it conceals its lust and displays abstinence from it, I punish it by abandonment and do not allow it anything from it." This is a method for disciplining the soul regarding this hidden lust. In summary, whoever abandons the lust for food but falls into the lust of ostentation is like one who flees from a scorpion only to take refuge with a viper; for the lust of ostentation is far more harmful than the lust for food. And God is the Guardian of success.

The Discourse on Carnal Desire

Know that the desire for intercourse has been imposed upon humanity for two benefits. The first is that one may experience its pleasure and thereby analogize it to the pleasures of the Hereafter. For if the pleasure of intercourse were to endure, it would be the most intense of bodily delights, just as fire and its pains are the greatest of bodily afflictions. Encouragement and warning drive people toward their felicity, and this is only achieved through tangible pain and perceptible pleasure, for what is not grasped by direct experience does not inspire profound longing.

The second benefit: the preservation of progeny and the continuity of existence—this is its benefit. Yet within it lie afflictions that can ruin both religion and worldly life if they are not restrained, subdued, and brought to the limit of moderation. It has been said in interpretation of His words, exalted is He, "Our Lord, do not burden us with what we have no strength to bear," that its meaning is the intensity of overpowering desire. And from Ibn Abbas, regarding His words, exalted is He, "and from the evil of the darkening night when it settles," he said: it is the rising of the sexual urge. Some narrators have attributed it to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, except that he said in its explanation: the sexual urge when it enters. And it has been said: "When a man's sexual urge rises, two-thirds of his intellect depart." And he, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication: "O God, I seek refuge in You from the evil of my hearing, my sight, my heart, and my sexual organ." And he, upon him be peace, said: "Women are the snares of Satan, and were it not for this desire, women would have no dominion over men."

It is narrated that Moses, peace be upon him, was sitting in one of his gatherings when Iblis approached him, wearing a cloak of many colors. When he drew near, he removed the cloak and set it aside, then came forward and said, "Peace be upon you, O Moses." Moses said to him, "Who are you?" He replied, "I am Iblis." Moses said, "May God not grant you life! What brings you here?" He said, "I have come to greet you due to your station with God and your rank with Him." Moses asked, "What is that I see upon you?" He replied, "A cloak with which I snatch the hearts of the children of Adam." Moses asked, "What is it that, when a human does it, you gain mastery over him?" He replied, "When he is pleased with himself, considers his deeds abundant, and forgets his sins. And I warn you of three things: Do not be alone with a woman who is not lawful for you, for whenever a man is alone with a woman who is not lawful for him, I am his companion above all my companions until I tempt him with her and tempt her with him. Do not make a covenant with God except that you fulfill it. And do not take out charity except that you deliver it, for whenever a man takes out charity and does not deliver it, I am his companion above all my companions until I prevent him from fulfilling it." Then he departed, saying, "Moses has learned what he must warn the children of Adam about."

And from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, who said: "God has not sent a prophet in times past except that Iblis did not despair of destroying him through women, and there is nothing I fear more than them. And there is no house in Medina that I enter except my house and the house of my daughter, where I perform the ritual bath for Friday prayer and then go forth."

And some of them said: "Indeed, Satan says to a woman: 'You are half of my army, and you are my arrow with which I shoot and never miss. You are the repository of my secret, and you are my messenger for my needs.' Thus, half his army is lust and half his army is anger."

The greatest of desires is the desire for women. This desire also has excess, deficiency, and moderation.

Excess is that which overpowers the intellect, diverting men's ambition toward the enjoyment of women and female slaves, thus barring them from treading the path of the Hereafter; or it overpowers religion, leading to the commission of abominations. Its excess may culminate for some people in two vile matters: One is that they consume what strengthens their desires for frequent copulation—just as some people consume medicines to strengthen the stomach to increase the appetite for food. The likeness of this is none other than one afflicted with ravenous beasts and predatory serpents that are dormant at times, yet he schemes to arouse and provoke them, then busies himself with mending and treating them. For truly, the desire for food and copulation are pains from which a person seeks deliverance, and he attains pleasure due to that deliverance.

If you say, "It has been reported in the rare Hadith that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'I complained to Gabriel about weakness in intercourse, and he instructed me to eat harisa (a meat and wheat dish),'" then know that he, peace be upon him, had nine wives, and it was incumbent upon him to protect them through intimate relations. It was forbidden for anyone else to marry them even if he divorced them. Thus, his seeking strength was for this purpose, not for mere pleasure.

The second matter is that this base desire may, in some cases of misguidance, culminate in obsessive infatuation, which represents the utmost ignorance regarding the purpose for which physical union was instituted. It is an excess in bestiality that surpasses even the limits of beasts, for the infatuated one is not content merely to expend the urge for copulation—which is the foulest of desires and most deserving of being shunned—but I hold that his desire does not subside except from one specific place, whereas an animal satisfies its urge wherever it occurs and is thereby content. Yet this one is not satisfied except with one particular person, thereby increasing in degradation upon degradation and servitude upon servitude, until he enslaves the intellect to serve the base desire—though it was created to be obeyed, not to become a servant to desire and a schemer for its sake. And infatuation is nothing but the extreme excess of desire; it is a disease of a corrupt heart that has no higher concern. One must guard against its beginnings by refraining from repeated gazing and dwelling upon thoughts, for once it takes firm hold, it becomes difficult to repel. Likewise is the infatuation with wealth, status, property, and children—even the love of playing with birds, dice, and chess—for these matters can gain mastery over a group to such an extent that they spoil both their religion and worldly life, and they cannot bear to be parted from them at all.

The example of one who frequently indulges in the passion of love at its initial stirring is like one who turns the reins of a mount when it first heads toward a gate to enter it—how easy it is to prevent it by turning its reins. And the example of one who treats it after it has become firmly established is like one who leaves the mount until it enters and passes beyond the gate, then seizes its tail and drags it backward. How immense is the disparity between the two in ease and difficulty. Therefore, let precaution be taken in the beginnings of matters, for in their endings they do not accept treatment except with strenuous effort that nearly leads to the extraction of the soul.

Therefore, the excess of desire is when it overpowers reason to this extent, and it is greatly blameworthy. Its deficiency is through chastity or weakness in satisfying one's spouse, which is also blameworthy. What is praiseworthy is for it to be moderate and obedient to reason and religious law in its restraint and indulgence. Whenever it becomes excessive, curb it through hunger and marriage, for the Prophet ﷺ said, "O young men, those among you who can afford marriage should marry, and whoever cannot, let him fast, for fasting is a shield for him."

Explanation of What is Required of the Seeker Regarding Abstaining from Marriage and Engaging in It

Know that the seeker, at the beginning of his journey, should not occupy himself with marriage, for it is a preoccupying distraction that hinders his spiritual progress and draws him into intimacy with a wife. Whoever finds intimacy with other than God Almighty is distracted from God. Let not the frequent marriages of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) deceive you, for nothing in this world could distract his heart from God Almighty. Therefore, do not compare angels with blacksmiths. For this reason, Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "Whoever marries has leaned toward the world." And he said: "I have never seen a seeker who married and remained steadfast in his initial state." Once he was asked: "How much you need a woman to find comfort with?" He replied: "May God not make me find comfort with her," meaning that comfort with her prevents comfort with God Almighty. He also said: "Anything that distracts you from God—be it family, wealth, or children—is an ill omen for you." So how can anyone other than the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) be compared to him? His immersion in the love of God Almighty was such that he felt a burning within him to the extent that he feared, in some circumstances, it might spread to his physical frame and destroy it. Therefore, he would sometimes pat 'A'ishah's thigh and say: "Talk to me, O 'A'ishah," so that her speech would distract him from the overwhelming state he was in, due to the incapacity of his physical frame to bear it. His innate nature was intimacy with God, and his intimacy with creation was incidental, out of mercy for his body. Moreover, he could not endure patience when sitting with people; when his chest felt constricted, he would say: "Give us relief with it, O Bilal," until he returned to what was the delight of his eye. So the weak one who observes his conditions in such matters is deluded, for understandings fall short of grasping the secrets of his actions (peace be upon him). Thus, the condition for the seeker is celibacy at the outset until he becomes strong in knowledge—this if passion does not overpower him. If passion overpowers him, let him break it through prolonged hunger and constant fasting. If passion is not subdued by that, and he is such that he cannot, for example, guard his gaze—even if he can guard his private parts—then marriage is preferable for him to calm passion. Otherwise, as long as he does not guard his gaze, his thoughts will not be preserved, his focus will scatter, and he may fall into a trial he cannot bear. The adultery of the eye is among the major minor sins, and it leads to proximity to the major, abominable sin, which is adultery of the private parts. Whoever cannot lower his gaze cannot guard his private parts. Jesus (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of the glance, for it plants desire in the heart, and it is sufficient as a trial." Sa'id ibn Jubayr said: "The trial came to David (peace be upon him) from a glance." Therefore, he said to his son (peace be upon him): "O my son, walk behind a lion and lions, but do not walk behind a woman." It was said to John (peace be upon him): "What is the beginning of adultery?" He said: "Looking and wishing." Al-Fudayl said: "Iblis says: 'It is my ancient bow and my arrow that I never miss with'—meaning the glance." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "The glance is a poisoned arrow from the arrows of Iblis; whoever abandons it out of fear of God Almighty, God will grant him faith whose sweetness he finds in his heart." And he (peace be upon him) said: "I have left behind no trial more harmful to men than women." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Fear the trial of this world and the trial of women, for the first trial of the Children of Israel was because of women." God Almighty said: "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze..." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Every son of Adam has a share of adultery: the eyes commit adultery and their adultery is looking; the hands commit adultery and their adultery is touching; the feet commit adultery and their adultery is walking; the mouth commits adultery and its adultery is kissing; and the heart desires and wishes, and the private parts either confirm that or deny it." Umm Salamah said: "Ibn Umm Maktum, the blind man, sought permission to enter upon the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) while Maymunah and I were sitting there. He said: 'Veil yourselves.' We said: 'Is he not blind and cannot see?' He said: 'Are you two not seeing him?'" This indicates that it is not permissible for women to sit with blind men, as is customary at funerals and feasts. Thus, it is forbidden for a blind man to be alone with women, and it is forbidden for a woman to sit with a blind man and converse with him without need, except that women are permitted to converse with men and look at them due to general necessity. If one can guard his gaze from women but cannot guard it from beardless youths, then marriage is more appropriate for him, for the harm in beardless youths is greater. If his heart inclines toward a woman, he can attain permissibility through marriage. Looking at the face of a beardless youth with desire is forbidden. Indeed, anyone whose heart is affected by the beauty of a beardless youth's appearance to the extent that he perceives a distinction between him and a bearded man, it is not lawful for him to look at him.

If you say: Every being with perception inevitably discerns the distinction between the beautiful and the ugly, and the faces of youths have always been uncovered? I say: I do not mean merely the distinction of the eye alone. Rather, his discernment of the distinction should be like his discernment of the distinction between a green tree and a withered one, between clear water and murky water, between a tree adorned with its blossoms and lights and a tree whose leaves have fallen. For he inclines toward one of them with his eye and innate disposition, but with an inclination devoid of desire. And for that reason, he does not desire to touch the blossoms and lights and kiss them, nor to kiss the clear water. Similarly, a handsome elder may attract the eye, and one discerns the distinction between it and an ugly face, but it is a distinction devoid of desire. This is known by the soul's inclination toward proximity and touch. Whenever that inclination is found in his heart, and he perceives a distinction between a beautiful face and lovely vegetation, embroidered garments, and gilded ceilings, then his gaze is a gaze of desire, and it is forbidden. This is something people take lightly, and it leads them into perils while they are unaware.

Some of the Successors said: "I do not fear the ravenous lion for the devout youth as much as I fear a beardless boy sitting with him." Sufyan said: "If a man were to play with a boy between two of his toes with lustful intent, it would be sodomy." And from some of the pious predecessors: "There will be in this nation three types of sodomites: a type who look, a type who shake hands, and a type who act."

Thus, the affliction of gazing upon youthful forms is indeed great. Whenever the seeker is unable to lower his gaze and restrain his thoughts, the correct course for him is to subdue his desire through marriage, for many a soul finds its craving not stilled by fasting.

Some have said: My desire overcame me at the onset of my will with what I could not bear, so I increased my lamentation to God, the Exalted. Then I saw a figure in a dream who said: "What is the matter with you?" So I complained to him. He said: "Come forward to me," so I came forward to him, and he placed his hand upon my chest. I felt its coolness in my heart and throughout my entire body. I awoke and what afflicted me had vanished, and I remained sound for a year. Then it returned to me, so I increased my supplication for aid, and a figure came to me in a dream and said to me: "Would you love for what you feel to depart, and for your neck to be struck?" I said: "Yes." He said: "Extend your neck," so I extended it. He drew a sword of light and struck my neck with it. I awoke and what afflicted me had vanished, and I remained sound for a year. Then it returned to me, or something more severe, and I saw as if a figure between my shoulders and my chest was addressing me, saying: "Woe to you! How long will you ask God, the Exalted, to remove what He does not love to remove?" He said: So I married, and that was cut off from me, and I had children.

Whenever a seeker is in need of marriage, he should not abandon the condition of sincere intention at the outset and throughout the marriage. As for the outset, it is through a goodly intention; and as for its continuity, it is through good character, upright conduct, and fulfilling the obligatory rights—as we have detailed all of that in the Book of the Etiquettes of Marriage, so we shall not prolong by repeating it. The sign of the truthfulness of his intention is that he marries a poor, devout woman and does not seek a wealthy one. Some have said: "Whoever marries a wealthy woman will have from her five traits: exorbitant dowry, delay of the wedding, loss of service, abundant expenses, and when he wishes to divorce her, he is unable, fearing the loss of her wealth." The poor woman is the opposite of that. And some have said: "The woman should be beneath the man in four aspects, or else she will belittle him: in age, height, wealth, and lineage; and she should be above him in four: in beauty, refinement, piety, and character." And the sign of the truthfulness of intention in the continuity of marriage is character.

A certain disciple married a woman and served her continuously until the woman became embarrassed and complained of this to her father, saying, "I am bewildered by this man. I have been in his house for years, yet I have never once gone to the privy before him, nor carried water to him before he carries it to me?" Another married a woman of beauty, but as her wedding procession drew near, she was afflicted with smallpox. Her family grieved intensely over this, fearing he would find her ugly. The man then showed them that he had contracted an eye ailment, and then showed them that his sight had gone, until she was brought to him in the wedding procession, and thus their grief was lifted. She remained with him for twenty years until she died, and only then did he open his eyes. When questioned about it, he said, "I did it intentionally for the sake of her family, so they would not grieve." It was said to him, "You have surpassed your brethren with this character."

A certain Sufi married a woman of ill character and endured her patiently. He was asked, "Why do you not divorce her?" He replied, "I fear that one who would not be patient with her might marry her and be harmed by her. If a disciple does marry, then this is how he ought to be. Yet, if he is capable of abstaining, that is more fitting for him, since he cannot combine the merit of marriage with traversing the Path, knowing it would distract him from his spiritual state."

As it is related that Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Hashimi possessed worldly revenue of eighty thousand dirhams every day. He wrote to the people of Basra and its scholars concerning a woman he might marry. They all agreed upon Rabi‘ah al-‘Adawiyyah, may God have mercy upon her. He wrote to her: "In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. To proceed: God Almighty has granted me worldly revenue of eighty thousand dirhams every day, and the days and nights will not pass until I complete it to one hundred thousand, and I will make for you the like of it and more. Respond to me."

She wrote to him: "In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. To proceed: Asceticism regarding the world is a comfort for the heart and body, while desire for it begets anxiety and grief. When this letter of mine reaches you, prepare your provision and advance toward your return, and be the executor of your own soul; do not make men your executors to divide your inheritance. Fast perpetually, and let your breaking of the fast be death. As for me, even if God Almighty were to grant me the like of what He has granted you and multiples thereof, it would not please me to be distracted from God for the blink of an eye."

This is an indication that everything which distracts from God Most High is a deficiency. Therefore, the spiritual seeker should examine his state and his heart. If he finds himself in a state of celibacy, that is closer [to God]. If he is incapable of that, then marriage is more suitable for him.

The remedy for this ailment is three things: hunger, lowering the gaze, and occupying oneself with a task that dominates the heart. If these three do not benefit, then marriage is what utterly eradicates its root cause. For this reason, the early pious predecessors hastened to marriage and to marrying off their daughters. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said, "Satan does not despair of anyone except that he comes at him through women." Sa'id also said—while he was eighty-four years old, having lost one eye and being dim-sighted in the other—"There is nothing I fear more than women."

And from 'Abdullah ibn Abi Wadda'ah, who said: "I used to sit with Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, and he missed me for some days. When I came to him, he said, 'Where were you?' I said, 'My wife died, so I was occupied with her affairs.' He said, 'Why did you not inform us so we could have attended her funeral?' Then I intended to leave, and he said, 'Have you taken a new wife?' I said, 'May God Most High have mercy on you! Who would marry me when I possess nothing but two or three dirhams?' He said, 'I will.' I said, 'You would do that?' He said, 'Yes.' He praised God Most High, invoked blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ, and married me [to his daughter] for two dirhams—or he said three. I left, not knowing what to do from joy. I went to my house and began thinking from whom I could borrow. I prayed the Maghrib prayer and returned to my house. I lit the lamp—I was fasting—and brought my dinner to break my fast—it was bread and oil—when my door was knocked. I said, 'Who is it?' He said, 'Sa'id.' I thought of every person named Sa'id except Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib—for he had not been seen for forty years except between his house and the mosque. I went out to him, and it was Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib. I thought he had changed his mind. I said, 'O Abu Muhammad, if you had sent for me, I would have come to you.' He said, 'No, you are more deserving of being visited.' I said, 'What do you command?' He said, 'You were a single man and have married. I disliked leaving you alone in your house tonight. Here is your wife.' And there she was, standing behind him, as tall as him. He took her by the hand, pushed her inside the door, and closed it. The woman fell down from shyness. I secured the door, then went to the bowl containing the bread and oil and placed it in the shadow of the lamp so she would not see it. Then I went up to the roof and called my neighbors. They came and said, 'What is the matter?' I said, 'Woe to you! Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib married me to his daughter today, and he has brought her tonight unexpectedly.' They said, 'Did Sa'id marry you?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'And she is in the house?' I said, 'Yes.' They went down to her. My mother heard of it and came, saying, 'My face is forbidden from your face if you touch her before I prepare her for three days.' I waited three days, then consummated the marriage. She was among the most beautiful women, the most memorizer of the Book of God Most High, the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah of the Messenger of God ﷺ, and the most aware of the husband's rights."

He said: "A month passed without Sa'id coming to me or me going to him. After a month, I went to him while he was in his teaching circle. I greeted him, and he returned the greeting but did not speak to me until the people had dispersed from the gathering. He said, 'How is that person?' I said, 'Well, O Abu Muhammad, in a manner that pleases the friend and displeases the enemy.' He said, 'If anything from her troubles you, you have the stick.' I returned to my house, and he sent me twenty thousand dirhams."

'Abdullah ibn Sulayman said: "This daughter of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib had been sought in marriage from him by 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan for his son al-Walid when he was appointed heir apparent. Sa'id refused to marry her to him. 'Abd al-Malik kept plotting against Sa'id until he had him whipped one hundred lashes on a cold day, poured a jug of water over him, and clothed him in a woolen cloak. Sa'id's hastening the wedding that very night makes you recognize the peril of lust and the obligation in religion to hasten to extinguish its fire through marriage—may God Most High be pleased with him and have mercy on him."

An Exposition on the Merit of One Who Opposes the Desires of the Private Parts and the Eyes

Know that this desire is the most dominant and most rebellious of desires in man when it surges against reason, except that its demand is vile, causing shame and fear of plunging into it. The restraint of most people from its demand is either due to incapacity, fear, shame, or preservation of one's body, and in none of these is there reward, for it is preferring one of the soul's inclinations over another. Indeed, immunity lies in not having the ability, so in these obstacles there is benefit—namely, warding off sin. For whoever refrains from fornication, his sin is averted by whatever cause he refrained. Yet the virtue and abundant reward are in refraining out of fear of God Almighty, despite having the capability, the removal of obstacles, and the availability of means, especially when the desire is genuine—and this is the rank of the truthful. Therefore, the Prophet ﷺ said, "Whoever loves, yet remains chaste, conceals it, and then dies, he is a martyr." And he ﷺ said, "Seven whom God will shade in the shade of His Throne on a day when there is no shade but His shade—among them is a man whom a woman of beauty and lineage invited to herself, and he said, 'Indeed, I fear God, Lord of the worlds.'" The story of Joseph, peace be upon him, and his refusal of Zulaykha despite his capability and her desire is well-known, and God Almighty praised him for it in His Noble Book. He is an exemplar for all who are granted success in striving against Satan in this immense desire.

It is narrated that Sulayman ibn Yasar was among the most handsome of people in appearance. A woman entered upon him and his soul desired her, but he refused her and fled from his house, leaving her within. Sulayman said: “That night I saw in a dream Joseph, peace be upon him, and it was as if I said to him, ‘Are you Joseph?’ He said, ‘Yes, I am Joseph who was tempted, and you are Sulayman who was not tempted.’” He was referring to the words of the Almighty: “And she certainly desired him, and he would have desired her had he not seen the proof of his Lord.” And from him also is what is more astonishing than this: that he left Medina for pilgrimage with a companion until they alighted at al-Abwa’. His companion rose, took the provision bag, and went to the market to buy something, while Sulayman sat in the tent—and he was among the most beautiful of people in face and the most pious. A Bedouin woman from the foot of the mountain caught sight of him, descended to him, and stood before him—she was wearing a face veil and gloves—then she unveiled a face like a sliver of the moon and said, “Congratulate me.” He thought she wanted food, so he rose to give her from the leftover provisions, but she said, “I do not want this; I only want what a man does with his wife.” He said, “Has Satan adorned you?” Then he placed his head between his knees and began to weep bitterly. He did not cease crying until she, seeing that from him, drew the veil over her face and turned back until she reached her people. His companion came and saw him with eyes swollen from weeping and his voice choked, and said, “What makes you weep?” He said, “A good thing—I remembered my children.” He said, “No, by God, unless you have a story; your mention of your children was only about three days ago or so.” He persisted until he told him the news of the Bedouin woman. Then his companion put down the provision bag and began to weep intensely. Sulayman said, “And you, what makes you weep?” He said, “I am more deserving of weeping than you, for I fear that had I been in your place I would not have resisted her.” They did not cease weeping. When Sulayman reached Mecca, he performed the Sa‘i and Tawaf, then came to the Hijr, wrapped himself in his garment, and sleep overtook him. In his sleep, a handsome, tall man with a fine appearance and a pleasant fragrance appeared to him. Sulayman said to him, “May God have mercy on you, who are you?” He said to him, “I am Joseph.” He said, “Joseph the Truthful?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Indeed, in your affair and the affair of the wife of al-‘Aziz there is wonder!” Joseph said to him, “Your affair and the affair of the woman of al-Abwa’ is more wondrous.”

It is narrated from Abdullah ibn Umar, who said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "Three men from among those before you set out until nightfall forced them to take shelter in a cave. They entered it, and a rock slid down from the mountain and blocked the cave's entrance upon them. They said, 'Nothing will save you from this rock except that you call upon God, exalted is He, with your righteous deeds.'

So one of them said: 'O God, You know I had two elderly parents, and I would never serve drink to my household or wealth before them. One day, I was delayed in seeking firewood and did not return to them until they had slept. I milked their evening drink for them and found them asleep. I disliked to serve drink to my household or wealth before them, so I remained with the cup in my hand, waiting for them to awaken, until dawn broke and the children were crying around my feet. Then they awoke and drank their evening drink. O God, if I did that seeking Your Countenance, then relieve us from this predicament we are in with this rock.' The rock then shifted slightly, but they could not get out.

The second said: 'O God, You know I had a cousin who was the dearest of people to me. I sought to seduce her, but she refused me, until a year of hardship came upon her. She came to me, and I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on the condition that she would yield herself to me, and she did so. When I was able to have my way with her, she said: "Fear God, and do not break the seal except by its rightful due." So I shrank from violating her and withdrew from her, though she was the dearest of people to me, and I left the gold I had given her. O God, if I did that seeking Your Countenance, then relieve us from this predicament.' The rock shifted further for them, but they still could not get out.

The third said: 'O God, You know I hired laborers and gave them their wages except for one man, for he left his due wage and departed. I invested his wage for him until it grew into much wealth. After a time, he came to me and said: "O servant of God, give me my wage." I said: "Everything you see—the camels, cattle, sheep, and servants—is your wage." He said: "O servant of God, are you mocking me?" I said: "I am not mocking you; take it." So he drove it all away and took everything, leaving nothing behind. O God, if I did that seeking Your Countenance, then relieve us from this predicament.' The rock then shifted completely, and they walked out."

This is the merit of one who is capable of fulfilling this desire yet remains chaste, and similar to it is the merit of one who is capable of fulfilling the desire of the eye. For the eye is the gateway to fornication, so guarding it is crucial, yet it is difficult because it is often taken lightly and the fear of its consequences is not held in great esteem, while all calamities stem from it. The first glance, if not intentional, is not held accountable, but repetition is held accountable. He (peace be upon him) said, "You are allowed the first, but you are accountable for the second," meaning the glance. And Al-'Ala' ibn Ziyad said: Do not let your gaze follow the garment of a woman, for the glance plants desire in the heart. Rarely does a person, in his comings and goings, avoid letting his gaze fall upon women and youths. Whenever beauty appears to him, nature demands repetition, and at that point he should firmly establish in himself that this repetition is pure ignorance. For if he gazes intently and finds beauty pleasing, desire is stirred yet he is unable to attain it, leaving him with nothing but regret. If he finds it ugly, he takes no pleasure and is pained because he sought pleasure yet did what caused him pain. Thus, in both states, he is not free from sin, pain, and regret. Whenever one guards the eye in this manner, many calamities are repelled from his heart. If his eye errs but he guards his private parts despite having the capability, that demands the utmost strength and the pinnacle of divine success. It has been narrated from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdullah al-Muzani: A butcher became infatuated with a slave girl belonging to one of his neighbors. Her family sent her on an errand to another village, so he followed her and solicited her. She said to him, "Do not do this, for I love you more than you love me, but I fear God." He said, "You fear Him, and I do not?" So he returned repentant. Thirst overcame him until he was near death. Then a messenger of one of the prophets of the Children of Israel appeared to him and asked, "What is wrong with you?" He said, "Thirst." He said, "Come, let us pray to God that a cloud may shade us until we enter the village." He said, "I have no righteous deed by which I may pray; you pray." He said, "I will pray, and you say 'Amen' to my supplication." So the messenger prayed, and he said 'Amen,' and a cloud shaded them until they reached the village. The butcher went to his place, and the cloud inclined with him. The messenger said to him, "You claimed you had no righteous deed, yet I was the one who prayed and you were the one who said 'Amen,' and the cloud shaded us and then followed you. Tell me your story." So he told him. The messenger said, "The repentant sinner holds a station with God Almighty that no one among the people holds." And from Ahmad ibn Sa'id al-'Abid, from his father, who said: In our midst in Kufa was a devout youth who frequented the main mosque, scarcely leaving it. He was handsome of face, stature, and demeanor. A woman of beauty and intellect looked upon him and became passionately enamored, and this state prolonged for her. One day, she stood in his path as he was heading to the mosque and said to him, "O young man, hear a few words from me, then do as you wish." He passed by without speaking to her. Later, she stood in his path as he was heading to his home and said, "O young man, hear a few words from me." He lowered his head for a long while and said to her, "This is a place of suspicion, and I dislike being a subject for suspicion." She said to him, "By God, I did not stand in this place of mine in ignorance of your situation, but God forbid that the worshippers should suspect such a thing from me. What compelled me to meet you personally for such a matter is my knowledge that a little of this is much among people, and you worshippers are like glass vessels—the slightest thing mars them. The sum of what I say to you is that all my limbs are preoccupied with you, so what is to be done about my affair and yours?" The youth went to his home and wished to pray, but he could not comprehend how to pray! He took a paper and wrote a letter, then left his home. The woman was standing in her place, so he threw the letter to her and returned to his home. It said: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Know, O woman, that when a servant disobeys God Almighty, He is forbearing. If he returns to disobedience a second time, He conceals him. If he dons its garments a third time, God Almighty becomes angry for Himself with an anger at which the heavens, the earth, the mountains, the trees, and the beasts tremble. Who can endure His anger? If what you mentioned is false, then I remind you of a day when the sky will be like molten brass, the mountains will be like carded wool, and the nations will kneel before the onslaught of the All-Compelling, the Supreme. By God, I have been too weak to reform myself, so how can I reform another? If what you mentioned is true, then I direct you to a Guiding Physician who heals festering wounds and chronic pains—that is God, Lord of the worlds. Seek Him with sincere supplication, for I am preoccupied from you by His saying, exalted is He: "And warn them of the Approaching Day, when hearts will be at the throats, filled with distress. The wrongdoers will have no close friend nor any intercessor who could be heard. He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal." So where is the escape from this verse? Then she came after some days and stood in his path. When he saw her from afar, he intended to return to his home so as not to see her. She said, "O young man, do not turn back. There will be no meeting after this day ever, except tomorrow before God Almighty." Then she wept bitterly and said, "I ask God, in whose hand are the keys to your heart, to ease what has become difficult in your affair." Then she followed him and said, "Grant me a favor: give me an admonition to carry from you and counsel me with advice upon which I may act." He said to her, "I counsel you to guard yourself from yourself, and I remind you of His saying, exalted is He: 'And He is the one who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day.'" He said: She lowered her head and wept a weeping more intense than her first. Then she recovered, confined herself to her home, and devoted herself to worship, remaining so until she died of grief. The youth would remember her after her death and weep. He was asked, "Why do you weep when you were the one who cut off her hope from yourself?" He said, "I slaughtered her hope at the beginning of her affair and made her severance a treasure stored for me with God Almighty. I am ashamed before Him to reclaim a treasure I have stored with Him, exalted is He."

The book "Breaking the Two Desires" is completed, by the praise and grace of God Almighty. To follow, God willing, is the book "The Afflictions of the Tongue." All praise is to God, the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and His blessings upon our master Muhammad, the best of His creation, and upon every chosen servant from the people of the earth and the heavens, with abundant peace.
