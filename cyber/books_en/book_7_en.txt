The Book of the Secrets of Hajj
Which is the Seventh Book of the Quarter of Worship
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, who made the word of monotheism a fortress and a stronghold for His servants, and made the Ancient House a place of return and security for people, honoring it by relating it to Himself as an act of glorification, fortification, and favor. He made visiting it and circumambulating it a veil between the servant and punishment, and a shield. And blessings upon Muhammad, the Prophet of Mercy and master of the community, and upon his family and companions, the guides of truth and the nobles of creation, abundant peace.
Now then: Hajj, among the pillars and foundations of Islam, is the worship of a lifetime and the seal of the matter, the perfection of Islam and the completion of religion. Concerning it, God Almighty revealed His saying: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." And concerning it, He said: "Whoever dies without having performed Hajj, let him die if he wishes as a Jew or if he wishes as a Christian." So how immense is a worship the absence of which negates the perfection of religion, and whose abandoner is equated with Jews and Christians in misguidance! It is most deserving that care be devoted to explaining it, detailing its pillars, its traditions, its etiquettes, its virtues, and its secrets. The totality of this is unveiled, by the facilitation of God Almighty, in three chapters.
Chapter One: Concerning its virtues and the virtues of Makkah and the Ancient House, and a summary of its pillars and conditions of obligation.
Chapter Two: Concerning its outward acts in order, from the beginning of the journey to the return.
Chapter Three: Concerning its subtle etiquettes, its hidden secrets, and its inward acts. So let us begin with the first chapter, which contains two sections.
Section One: Concerning the virtues of Hajj and the virtue of the House, Makkah, and Madinah—may God Almighty protect them—and traveling to mosques.

(The Virtue of Hajj)
God Almighty said: "And proclaim to the people the Hajj; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass." And Qatadah said: When God Almighty commanded Abraham—and upon our Prophet and upon every chosen servant be peace—to proclaim to the people the Hajj, he called out: "O people, God Almighty has built a House, so perform Hajj to it." And the Exalted said: "That they may witness benefits for themselves." It is said: trade during the season and reward in the Hereafter. When some of the predecessors heard this, he said: "They are forgiven, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!" And it is said in interpretation of His saying, the Almighty: "I will surely sit in ambush for them on Your straight path," meaning the road to Makkah; Satan sits upon it to prevent people from it. And He said: "Whoever performs Hajj to the House and does not commit obscenity or wickedness, he emerges from his sins as on the day his mother bore him." And He also said: "Satan is not seen on any day smaller, more abased, more humiliated, or more furious than on the Day of Arafah." And that is only because of what he sees of the descent of mercy and God's pardon for great sins, for it is said: "Indeed, among sins are sins that are not expiated except by standing at Arafah." Ja'far ibn Muhammad attributed it to the Messenger of God. And one of the unveiled among the close ones mentioned: That Iblis—may God curse him—appeared to him in the form of a person at Arafah, and he was emaciated in body, sallow in complexion, weeping of eye, and bent of back. He said to him: "What has made your eye weep?" He said: "The pilgrims coming to Him without trade. I say they have sought Him; I fear He will not disappoint them, and that grieves me." He said: "What has emaciated your body?" He said: "The neighing of horses in the cause of God Almighty. Had they been in my cause, it would have been dearer to me." He said: "What has changed your complexion?" He said: "The community cooperating in obedience. Had they cooperated in disobedience, it would have been dearer to me." He said: "What has bent your back?" He said: "The servant saying, 'I ask You for a good end.' I say, 'Woe is me! When will this one become pleased with his deed?' I fear he has become aware." And He said: "Whoever leaves his home as a pilgrim or one performing 'Umrah and then dies, the reward of the pilgrim and the one performing 'Umrah is recorded for him until the Day of Resurrection. And whoever dies in one of the Two Sanctuaries is not presented [for judgment] nor called to account, and it is said to him: 'Enter Paradise.'" And He said: "An accepted Hajj is better than the world and all it contains, and an accepted Hajj has no reward except Paradise." And He said: "The pilgrims and those performing 'Umrah are the delegation of God Almighty and His visitors. If they ask Him, He gives them; if they seek His forgiveness, He forgives them; if they call upon Him, He answers them; and if they intercede, they intercede." And in a transmitted narration from the way of the Household, peace be upon them: "The greatest sinner among people is he who stands at Arafah and thinks that God Almighty has not forgiven him." And Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, narrated from the Prophet that he said: "Upon this House descend every day one hundred and twenty mercies: sixty for those circumambulating, forty for those praying, and twenty for those looking." And in the report: "Increase in circumambulating the House..."

For indeed it is among the most noble things you will find in your scrolls on the Day of Resurrection and the most enviable deed you will find. And for this reason, performing Tawaf is recommended to begin with, without it being for Hajj or Umrah. And in the report: "Whoever performs Tawaf for one week barefoot and bareheaded, it is for him like freeing a slave; and whoever performs Tawaf for one week in the rain, his past sins are forgiven for him." And it is said that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, when He forgives a servant a sin at the Standing Place, forgives it for everyone who was present in that Standing Place. And some of the predecessors said: If the Day of Arafah coincides with a Friday, forgiveness is granted for all the people of Arafah, and it is the best day in the world, and in it...

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ performed the Farewell Hajj and was standing when His word, the Mighty and Majestic, was revealed: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." The People of the Book said: "If this verse had been revealed to us, we would have made it a day of celebration." So Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I bear witness that this verse was indeed revealed on two celebration days: the Day of Arafah and a Friday, upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was standing at Arafah." And he ﷺ said: "O Allah, forgive the pilgrim and the one for whom the pilgrim seeks forgiveness."

And it is narrated that Ali ibn Muwaffaq performed Hajj on behalf of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for several Hajjs. He said: "I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a dream, and he said to me: 'O son of Muwaffaq, have you performed Hajj on my behalf?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'And have you performed the Tawaf of Ifadah on my behalf?' I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Then I will reward you for it on the Day of Resurrection. I will take you by the hand at the Standing Place and admit you into Paradise while the creation is in the distress of the Reckoning.'"

And Mujahid and other scholars said: "Indeed, when the pilgrims arrive in Makkah, the angels meet them, greet the riders of the camels, shake hands with the riders of the donkeys, and embrace the pedestrians with an embrace." And Al-Hasan said: "Whoever dies following Ramadan, or following a military expedition, or following Hajj, dies a martyr." And Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The pilgrim is forgiven, and so is the one for whom he seeks forgiveness, in the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, al-Muharram, Safar, and twenty days of Rabi' al-Awwal."

And it was from the practice of the predecessors, may Allah be pleased with them, to bid farewell to those going on military expeditions and to receive the pilgrims, and to kiss between their eyes, and to ask them for supplication, and they would hasten to do that before they became soiled with sins.

And it is narrated from Ali ibn Muwaffaq, who said: "I performed Hajj one year. When it was the night of Arafah, I slept in Mina at the Mosque of al-Khayf. I saw in a dream as if two angels had descended from the sky upon them green garments. One of them called to his companion, 'O Abdullah!' The other replied, 'At your service, O Abdullah!' He said, 'Do you know how many have performed Hajj to the House of our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, this year?' He said, 'I do not know.' He said, 'Six hundred thousand have performed Hajj to the House of our Lord. Do you know how many were accepted from them?' He said, 'No.' He said, 'Six individuals.' Then they ascended into the air and disappeared from me. I awoke alarmed and grieved with intense grief, and my affair concerned me greatly. I said, 'If the Hajj of six individuals is accepted, where will I be among those six?' When I departed from Arafah, I stood at al-Mash'ar al-Haram and began to reflect on the multitude of creation and the fewness of those accepted from them. Sleep overcame me, and there were the two figures descending in their form. One called to his companion and repeated the exact speech. Then he said, 'Do you know what our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has decreed this night?' He said, 'No.' He said, 'Indeed, He has granted for each one of the six, six hundred thousand.'" He said: "I awoke, and within me was a joy too great to describe."

And from him also, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: "I performed Hajj one year. When I completed my rites, I reflected on those whose Hajj is not accepted. I said, 'O Allah, I have given my Hajj as a gift and made its reward for the one whose Hajj You did not accept.'" He said: "I saw the Lord of Might in a dream, glory be to His majesty, and He said to me: 'O Ali, are you generous to Me, when I created generosity and the generous ones? I am the Most Generous of the generous, the Most Noble of the noble, and more deserving of generosity and nobility than all the worlds. I have granted everyone whose Hajj I did not accept to the one whose Hajj I accepted.'"

(The Virtue of the House and Honorable Makkah)
He ﷺ said: "Indeed Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has promised this House that six hundred thousand will perform Hajj to it every year. If they fall short, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will complete their number from the angels." And indeed, the Ka'bah will be resurrected like a adorned bride, and everyone who performed Hajj to it will cling to its curtains, hastening around it until it enters Paradise, and they will enter with it. And in the report: "Indeed the Black Stone is a ruby from the rubies of Paradise, and it will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection having two eyes and a tongue with which it will speak, testifying for everyone who touched it with truth and sincerity." And he ﷺ would kiss it often. And it is narrated that he ﷺ prostrated upon it, and he would perform Tawaf while mounted, placing his staff upon it, then kissing the end of the staff. And Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, kissed it, then said: "I certainly know that you are a stone that can neither harm nor benefit. Were it not that I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ kissing you, I would not have kissed you." Then he wept until his sobbing became loud. He turned behind him and saw Ali, may Allah honor his face and be pleased with him, and said: "O Abu al-Hasan, here tears are shed and supplications are answered." So Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "O Commander of the Faithful, rather..."

He causes harm and brings benefit. It was asked, "How?" He replied, "When God Almighty took the covenant from the progeny, He inscribed a decree upon them, then entrusted it to this stone. Thus, it testifies to the believer's fidelity and bears witness against the disbeliever's denial." It is said that this is the meaning behind people's supplication during the circumambulation: "O God, [we do this] in faith in You, affirming Your Book, and fulfilling Your covenant."

It is narrated from al-Hasan al-Basri, may God be pleased with him, that fasting a day therein is equivalent to a hundred thousand days, and charity of a dirham is like a hundred thousand dirhams, and likewise every good deed is multiplied a hundred thousandfold. It is said that circumambulating for seven weeks equals an 'Umrah, and three 'Umrahs equal a Hajj. In the authentic tradition: "An 'Umrah performed in Ramadan is like performing Hajj with me." And He, peace be upon him, said: "I am the first from whom the earth will split open, then I will come to the people of al-Baqi' and they will be resurrected with me, then I will come to the people of Mecca and I will be resurrected between the two Sacred Precincts." And in the tradition: "When Adam, peace be upon him, completed his rites, the angels met him and said, 'May your Hajj be accepted, O Adam. We have performed Hajj to this House two thousand years before you.'"

It is related in the narrations: God Almighty looks upon the inhabitants of the earth every night, and the first upon whom He looks are the people of the Sacred Precinct, and the first among them are the people of the Sacred Mosque. Whoever He sees performing circumambulation, He forgives; whoever He sees praying, He forgives; and whoever He sees standing facing the Kaaba, He forgives. Some of the saints, may God be pleased with them, were granted spiritual unveiling and said, "I saw all the frontier outposts prostrating to 'Abadan, and I saw 'Abadan prostrating to Jeddah." It is said that the sun does not set on any day except that a man from the Abdal performs circumambulation of this House, and no dawn breaks except that one of the Awtad performs circumambulation. If this ceases, it will be the cause of its removal from the earth, and people will wake to find the Kaaba lifted, with no trace of it visible to people. This will occur when seven years pass without anyone performing Hajj to it. Then the Quran will be lifted from the manuscripts, and people will wake to find the pages white and gleaming, with not a letter upon them. Then the Quran will be effaced from hearts, so that not a word of it is remembered. Then people will revert to poems, songs, and tales of the Age of Ignorance. Then the False Messiah will emerge, and Jesus, peace be upon him, will descend and kill him. The Hour at that point will be like a pregnant woman nearing her time, expecting delivery. In the tradition: "Perform abundant circumambulation of this House before it is raised, for it has been destroyed twice and will be raised a third time."

It is narrated from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "God Almighty said: 'When I wish to bring ruin upon the world, I begin with My House and ruin it, then I ruin the world thereafter.'"

(The Virtue of Residing in Mecca, May God Protect It, and the Dislike for It)
The cautious, pious scholars disliked residing in Mecca for three reasons. First: fear of becoming weary and overly familiar with the House, for that may affect the calming of the heart's burning reverence. Thus, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to strike the pilgrims when they performed Hajj, saying, "O people of Yemen, to your Yemen! O people of Syria, to your Syria! O people of Iraq, to your Iraq!" For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, intended to prevent people from excessive circumambulation, saying, "I feared that people would become overly familiar with this House." Second: stirring longing through separation to motivate the desire to return, for God Almighty made the House a place of return and security for people—meaning they come back to it time and again, never having their fill of it. Some said: "Being in a land while your heart yearns for Mecca and is attached to this House is better for you than being in it while weary of residence and your heart in another land." Some of the predecessors said: "How many a man in Khorasan is closer to this House than one who circumambulates it." It is said: "God Almighty has servants whom the Kaaba circumambulates, drawing near to God Almighty." Third: fear of committing sins and offenses therein, for that is perilous/forbidden and more likely to incur the wrath of God Almighty due to the sanctity of the place. It is narrated from Wahb ibn al-Ward al-Makki: "I was praying one night in the Hijr when I heard speech between the Kaaba and its curtains, saying, 'To God I complain, then to you, O Gabriel, about what I endure from those circumambulating me—their preoccupation with idle talk, their frivolity, and their amusement. If they do not desist from that, I will shake with such a tremor that every stone of me will return to the mountain from which it was cut.'"

Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "There is no city where a servant is held accountable for intention before action except Mecca," and he recited God's word: "And whoever intends therein deviation [by] wrongdoing – We will make him taste of a painful punishment." Meaning, it is for mere intention. It is said: "Evil deeds are multiplied there just as good deeds are multiplied." Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "Hoarding in Mecca is a form of deviation in the Sacred Precinct," and lying was also mentioned. Ibn 'Abbas said: "I would prefer to commit seventy sins at Rukayyah than to commit a single sin in Mecca," and Rukayyah is a dwelling between Mecca and Ta'if. And out of fear...

Some residents reached the point that they would not relieve themselves within the Sacred Precinct, but would go out to the non-sacred area to answer the call of nature. Some even stayed for a month without laying their side upon the ground. Regarding the discouragement of prolonged stay, some scholars disliked taking rent for dwellings in Makkah. Do not think that disliking a prolonged stay contradicts the virtue of the place, for this dislike is due to the weakness of human nature and their inability to fulfill the rights of the place. The meaning of our statement that leaving residence there is better is relative to residing there while being negligent and impatient. As for it being better than residing while fulfilling its rights, that is far-fetched. How could it not be, when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, upon returning to Makkah, faced the Ka'bah and said: "You are the best land of God, the Mighty and Majestic, and the most beloved land of God, the Exalted, to me. Were it not that I was expelled from you, I would not have left." How could it not be, when looking at the House is an act of worship and good deeds therein are multiplied, as we have mentioned.

(The Virtue of the Noble City Over Other Lands)
After Makkah, no place is better than the city of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Deeds there are also multiplied. He, peace be upon him, said: "A prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere, except the Sacred Mosque." Likewise, every deed in the city is worth a thousand. After his city comes the Sacred Land (Jerusalem), for prayer there is worth five hundred prayers elsewhere, except the Sacred Mosque, and likewise for other deeds. Ibn 'Abbas reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "A prayer in the mosque of the city is worth ten thousand prayers, a prayer in the Aqsa Mosque is worth a thousand prayers, and a prayer in the Sacred Mosque is worth a hundred thousand prayers." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever endures its hardship and adversity, I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever is able to die in the city, then let him die there, for no one dies there but that I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection." After these three places, other places are equal, except for the frontier posts, for residing there for garrison duty holds great virtue. Therefore, he, peace be upon him, said: "Do not undertake journeys except to three mosques: the Sacred Mosque, this mosque of mine, and the Aqsa Mosque." Some scholars have used this hadith to argue against traveling to visit shrines and the graves of scholars and the righteous. However, what has become clear to me is that this is not the case; rather, visitation is commanded. He, peace be upon him, said: "I had forbidden you from visiting graves, but now visit them, and do not say anything futile." The hadith pertains specifically to mosques, and shrines are not in the same category, for mosques other than the three are equal, and there is no town without a mosque, so there is no point in traveling to another mosque. As for shrines, they are not equal; rather, the blessing of visiting them is according to their degrees with God, the Mighty and Majestic. Indeed, if a place has no mosque, one may travel to a place that has a mosque and relocate there entirely if one wishes. Then, I wonder, would this proponent also forbid traveling to the graves of the prophets, peace be upon them, such as Abraham, Moses, John, and others, peace be upon them? Forbidding that is extremely far-fetched. If this is permitted, then the graves of the saints, scholars, and righteous are in the same category, so it is not far-fetched that this be among the purposes of travel, just as visiting scholars in their lifetime is among the objectives. This is regarding travel. As for residence, it is preferable for the seeker to remain in his place if his intention in traveling is not to seek knowledge, as long as his spiritual state is sound in his homeland. If it is not sound, then he should seek places that are more conducive to obscurity, safer for his religion, more freeing for the heart, and easier for worship; that is the best place for him. He, peace be upon him, said: "The lands are the lands of God, the Mighty and Majestic, and the people are His servants, so wherever you find comfort, reside there and praise God, the Exalted." And in a report: "Whoever is blessed in something, let him adhere to it, and whoever has his livelihood in something, let him not leave it until it changes for him." Abu Nu'aym said: I saw Sufyan al-Thawri with his saddlebag on his shoulder and his sandals in his hand. I said: "Where to, O Abu 'Abdullah?" He said: "To a land where I can fill my saddlebag with a dirham." In another account: "I heard of a village with cheap prices, so I will reside there." I said: "And you would do this, O Abu 'Abdullah?" He said: "Yes, if you hear of cheap prices in a land, head for it, for it is safer for your religion and less worrisome." He used to say: "This is a time of evil where the obscure are not safe, so what about the famous? This is a time of moving; a man moves from village to village, fleeing with his religion from trials." It is narrated from him that he said: "By God, I do not know which land to settle in." He was asked about Khurasan, and he said: "Different schools and corrupt opinions." He was asked about Syria, and he said: "You would be pointed at with fingers," meaning fame. He was asked about Iraq, and he said: "The land of tyrants." He was asked about Makkah, and he said: "Makkah melts the mind and the body." A stranger said to him...

I resolved to reside in Mecca, so he advised me. He said: I advise you with three things: do not pray in the first row, do not accompany a Qurayshi, and do not make your charity public. The dislike for the first row is because one becomes prominent, so if he is absent he is missed, and ostentation and affectation become mixed with his deed.

(Chapter Two: On the Conditions for the Obligation of Hajj, the Validity of its Pillars, its Obligatory Acts, and its Prohibitions)

As for the conditions, the conditions for the validity of Hajj are two: the time and Islam. Thus, the Hajj of a child is valid, and he enters the state of consecration (ihram) by himself if he is discerning; if he is young, his guardian enters ihram on his behalf, and he performs with him what is performed in Hajj, such as the circumambulation (tawaf), the ritual walk (sa'i), and other rites. As for the time, it is Shawwal, Dhu al-Qa'dah, and nine days of Dhu al-Hijjah until the dawn of the Day of Sacrifice. Whoever enters the state of ihram for Hajj outside this period, it is an 'Umrah. The entire year is the time for 'Umrah, but for one who is occupied with the rites during the days of Mina, it is not fitting to enter ihram for 'Umrah because he will not be able to engage in it afterward due to his preoccupation with the rites of Mina.

As for the conditions for it to count as the obligatory Hajj of Islam, they are five: Islam, freedom, puberty, sanity, and the time. If a child or a slave enters ihram, but the slave is freed and the child reaches puberty at 'Arafah or Muzdalifah and returns to 'Arafah before dawn, it suffices for them as the obligatory Hajj of Islam, because Hajj is 'Arafah. There is no blood sacrifice (dam) upon them except a sheep. These conditions are stipulated for 'Umrah to count as the obligatory 'Umrah of Islam, except for the time.

As for the conditions for a supererogatory Hajj to be valid for a free, adult person, it is after his obligation is cleared of the obligatory Hajj of Islam. Thus, the obligatory Hajj of Islam takes precedence, then making up for one who invalidated it during the state of standing (at 'Arafah), then a vowed Hajj, then a proxy Hajj, then a supererogatory Hajj. This order is obligatory, and it is valid even if he intends otherwise.

As for the conditions that make Hajj obligatory, they are five: puberty, Islam, sanity, freedom, and capability. Whoever is obligated with the obligatory Hajj is also obligated with the obligatory 'Umrah. Whoever intends to enter Mecca for visitation or trade, and is not a woodcutter, must enter the state of ihram according to one opinion, then he may exit the consecrated state by performing the rites of an 'Umrah or a Hajj.

As for capability, it is of two types. The first is direct capability, and it has causes: regarding oneself, it is through health; regarding the route, it is that it be fertile and safe, without a perilous sea or a dominant enemy; regarding wealth, it is that he finds the expenses for his going and returning to his homeland—whether he has dependents or not—because separation from the homeland is severe, and that he possesses the expenses for those whose maintenance is obligatory upon him during this period, and that he possesses what to repay his debts with, and that he is able to have a mount or hire one with a litter or a pack-animal if he insists on the pack-animal.

The second type is the capability of one whose wealth is delegated, which is that he hires someone to perform Hajj on his behalf after the hired person has performed the obligatory Hajj of Islam for himself. In this type, the expense of going with a pack-animal suffices. If a son offers his obedience to his infirm father, he thereby becomes capable; but if he offers his wealth, he does not thereby become capable, because service with the body holds honor for the son, and offering wealth constitutes a favor upon the father.

Whoever becomes capable, Hajj becomes obligatory upon him, and he may delay it, but he is in danger in doing so. If it becomes easy for him, even at the end of his life, it is dropped from him. If he dies before performing Hajj, he will meet God Almighty as a sinner for abandoning Hajj, and the Hajj will be upon his estate to be performed on his behalf, even if he did not bequeath it, like his other debts. If he became capable in a year but did not depart with the people, and his wealth perished in that year before the people performed Hajj, then he died, he will meet God Almighty and there is no Hajj upon him.

Whoever dies without performing Hajj despite having the means, his affair is severe with God Almighty. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "I was resolved to write to the provinces to impose the poll tax (jizyah) on those who are capable but did not perform Hajj." From Sa'id ibn Jubayr, Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, Mujahid, and Tawus: "If I knew of a wealthy man upon whom Hajj was obligatory, then he died before performing it, I would not pray over him." Some of them had a wealthy neighbor who died without performing Hajj, so he did not pray over him. Ibn 'Abbas used to say: "Whoever dies without paying the zakat and without performing Hajj will ask to be returned to the world," and he recited the word of the Almighty: {"My Lord, send me back, that I might do righteousness in what I left behind."} He said: "Hajj."

As for the pillars without which Hajj is not valid, they are five: entering the state of consecration (ihram), the circumambulation (tawaf), the ritual walk (sa'i) after it, standing at 'Arafah, and shaving the head after it according to one opinion. The pillars of 'Umrah are the same except for the standing.

The obligatory acts compensated by a blood sacrifice are six: entering ihram from the designated point (miqat). Whoever neglects this and passes the miqat in a state of non-consecration (muhill), upon him is a sheep. Stoning (the pillars) also requires a blood sacrifice by unanimous opinion. As for remaining at 'Arafah until sunset, spending the night at Muzdalifah, spending the night at Mina, and the farewell circumambulation (tawaf al-wada')—these four, neglecting them is compensated by a blood sacrifice according to one of two opinions; according to the second opinion, there is a blood sacrifice for them as a recommended act.

As for the methods of performing Hajj and 'Umrah, they are three. The first is Ifrad (performing Hajj alone), and it is the best. That is, one begins with Hajj alone, then when finished, he goes out to the non-sanctuary area (al-hill) and enters ihram and performs 'Umrah. The best place in the non-sanctuary area for entering ihram for 'Umrah is al-Ji'ranah, then al-Tan'im, then al-Hudaybiyah. There is no blood sacrifice upon the performer of Ifrad except...

The second is Qirān, which is to combine by saying "Labbayka for Hajj and ‘Umrah together," thus entering the state of consecration (iḥrām) for both, and the rites of Hajj suffice him, with ‘Umrah being subsumed under Hajj just as ablution (wuḍū’) is subsumed under the ritual bath (ghusl). However, if he performs the circumambulation (ṭawāf) and the ritual walk (sa‘y) before standing at ‘Arafah, his sa‘y is counted for both rites, whereas his ṭawāf is not counted, because the condition for the obligatory ṭawāf in Hajj is that it occur after the standing. Upon the one performing Qirān is due a sheep as sacrifice, unless he is a resident of Makkah, in which case there is nothing upon him, for he did not pass beyond his designated point of consecration (mīqāt), as his mīqāt is Makkah itself.

The third is Tamattu‘, which is to pass the mīqāt in the state of consecration for ‘Umrah, then to release oneself from consecration in Makkah and avail of the previously prohibited matters until the time of Hajj, after which one enters the state of consecration for Hajj. One is only considered a Mutamatti‘ (one performing Tamattu‘) if five conditions are met: First, that he not be among the residents of the Sacred Mosque; its resident is one whose home is within a distance from it that does not permit shortening the prayer. Second, that he perform ‘Umrah before Hajj. Third, that his ‘Umrah occur within the months of Hajj. Fourth, that he not return to the mīqāt for Hajj nor to a distance equivalent to it to assume the state of consecration for Hajj. Fifth, that his Hajj and ‘Umrah be for one and the same person. If these descriptions are present, he is a Mutamatti‘ and a sheep as sacrifice becomes obligatory upon him. If he does not find one, then fasting for three days during Hajj before the Day of Sacrifice, either separated or consecutively, and seven days when he returns to his homeland. If he does not fast the three days before returning to his homeland, he fasts ten days, either consecutively or separately. The substitute for the sacrifice in Qirān and Tamattu‘ is the same. The order of preference is: Ifrād (performing Hajj alone) is best, then Tamattu‘, then Qirān.

As for the prohibitions of Hajj and ‘Umrah, they are six: The first is wearing a tailored garment, such as a shirt, trousers, socks, or turban. Rather, one should wear an izār (waist-wrapper) and a ridā’ (upper garment) and sandals. If he does not find sandals, then leather slippers. If he does not find an izār, then trousers. There is no harm in a belt or shading oneself in a litter, but he should not cover his head, for his state of consecration pertains to his head. A woman may wear any tailored garment provided she does not cover her face with something that touches it, for her state of consecration pertains to her face. The second is perfume; he must avoid everything considered perfume by people of sound judgment. If he applies perfume or wears (tailored garments), a sheep as sacrifice is due upon him. The third is shaving and cutting the nails; for these there is a redemption (fidyah), namely a sheep. There is no harm in applying kohl, entering the bathhouse, bloodletting, cupping, or combing the hair. The fourth is sexual intercourse; it invalidates (the pilgrimage) if it occurs before the first release from consecration, and for it is due a camel or a cow or seven sheep. If it occurs after the first release from consecration, a camel becomes obligatory upon him, but his Hajj is not invalidated. The fifth is the preliminaries to intercourse, such as kissing and touching that breaks the state of ritual purity with women; it is forbidden and for it is a sheep, and likewise for masturbation. Marriage and arranging marriage are forbidden, but there is no sacrifice for it because it is not validly contracted. The sixth is killing the game of the land, meaning what is lawful to eat or what is born from lawful and unlawful parents. If he kills game, upon him is its equivalent from livestock, taking into consideration similarity in form. The game of the sea is lawful and there is no redemption for it.

(Chapter Two: On the Order of the Outward Acts from the Beginning of the Journey until the Return, which are Ten Sections)

The First Section: On Travel from the Initial Departure until Assuming Iḥrām, which has Eight Points.

The First Point: Concerning Wealth. He should begin with repentance, restoring wrongfully taken rights, settling debts, and preparing provision for all those whose maintenance is obligatory upon him until the time of return. He should return any trusts in his possession and take with him from lawful, wholesome wealth what suffices him for his going and returning without stinginess, but rather in a manner that enables him to be generous with provisions and kind to the weak and the poor. He should give charity with something before his departure and purchase for himself a sturdy mount capable of carrying the load without weakening, or hire one. If he hires, he should disclose to the carrier all that he intends to carry, whether little or much, and secure his consent therein.

The Second Point: Concerning Companions. He should seek a righteous companion who loves good and assists in it; if he forgets, he reminds him; if he remembers, he assists him; if he is cowardly, he encourages him; if he is incapable, he strengthens him; if his heart is troubled, he consoles him. He should bid farewell to his companions who are staying behind, his brothers, and his neighbors, bidding them farewell and seeking their supplications, for God Almighty places good in their supplications. The Sunnah in bidding farewell is to say: "I entrust to God your religion, your trust, and the final outcome of your deeds." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to say to one intending travel: "May God provision you with piety, forgive your sin, and direct you to goodness wherever you are."

The Third Point: Concerning Departure from the Home. When he intends to depart, he should first pray two rak‘ahs, reciting in the first after al-Fātiḥah: "Say, O disbelievers," and in the second: "Sincerity." When he finishes, he raises his hands and supplicates to God, glorified be He, with pure sincerity and truthful intention, saying: "O God, You are the Companion on the journey and the Successor over the family, wealth, children, and companions. Protect us and them from every affliction and calamity. O God, we ask You on this journey of ours for righteousness and piety, and for deeds that please You. O God, we ask You to fold the earth for us, make the journey easy for us, and grant us in..."

Our journey is for the safety of body, faith, and wealth, and to attain the pilgrimage to Your House and the visitation to the grave of Your Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. O Allah, we seek refuge in You from the hardships of travel, from gloomy sights, and from an evil return to family, wealth, children, and companions. O Allah, place us and them under Your protection, and do not strip us and them of Your favor, nor alter the well-being You have granted us and them. Fourth: When one arrives at the door of the house, let him say: In the name of Allah, I have placed my trust in Allah; there is no power nor strength except with Allah. I seek refuge in Allah, my Lord, from leading astray or being led astray, from oppressing or being oppressed, from causing to slip or being made to slip, from wronging or being wronged, from acting ignorantly or having ignorance imposed upon me. O Allah, I have not set out in arrogance, extravagance, for show, or for reputation, but I have set out to avoid Your displeasure, to seek Your good pleasure, to fulfill Your obligation, to follow the tradition of Your Prophet, and out of longing to meet You. When he walks, let him say: O Allah, by You I have set forth, in You I have placed my trust, in You I have taken refuge, and to You I have turned. O Allah, You are my confidence and You are my hope, so suffice me in what concerns me and what does not concern me, and in what You know better than I. Mighty is Your protection and exalted is Your praise; there is no god but You. O Allah, provision me with piety, forgive me my sin, and guide me to good wherever I turn. And he should supplicate with this prayer at every dwelling he enters. Fifth: Regarding mounting: When he mounts the riding animal, let him say: In the name of Allah, and by Allah, and Allah is the Greatest. I have placed my trust in Allah; there is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. What Allah wills, is; and what He does not will, is not. Glory be to Him who has subjected this to us, for we could not have subdued it by ourselves, and indeed to our Lord we shall return. O Allah, I have turned my face to You, I have entrusted all my affairs to You, and in all my matters I have placed my trust in You; You are sufficient for me and excellent is the Trustee. When he is seated upon the riding animal and it is steady beneath him, let him say: Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest—seven times. And let him say: Praise be to Allah who has guided us to this, for we would not have been guided had Allah not guided us. O Allah, You are the Carrier upon the back and You are the One sought for help in all affairs. Sixth: Regarding dismounting: The tradition is not to dismount until the day grows hot, and to do most of his traveling by night, as the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "You should travel by night, for the earth is traversed more at night than by day." And let him reduce his sleep at night so that it may aid him in traveling. Whenever he sights a stopping place, let him say: O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and what they shade, Lord of the seven earths and what they bear, Lord of the devils and whom they mislead, Lord of the winds and what they scatter, Lord of the seas and what they carry, I ask You for the good of this stopping place and the good of its inhabitants, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and the evil within it. Turn away from me the evil of its most wicked. When he alights at the stopping place, let him pray two units of prayer therein, then say: I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah which no righteous or wicked can surpass, from the evil of what He has created. When night falls upon him, let him say: O earth, my Lord and your Lord is Allah; I seek refuge in Allah from your evil and the evil within you and the evil that creeps upon you. I seek refuge in Allah from the evil of every lion, black creature, snake, and scorpion, and from the evil of the dweller of the land and the parent and what is born. To Him belongs whatever resides in the night and the day, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Seventh: Regarding vigilance: One should be cautious by day and not walk alone outside the caravan, for he may be waylaid or become separated. At night, he should be watchful when sleeping. If he sleeps at the beginning of the night, let him rest on his forearm; if he sleeps at the end of the night, let him prop up his forearm and place his head in his palm, for thus did the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, sleep during his travels, lest he sleep too heavily and the sun rise without his knowledge, for what he misses of prayer is greater than what he attains of pilgrimage. It is preferable at night for two companions to take turns keeping watch; if one sleeps, the other guards—this is the tradition. If an enemy or a beast approaches him by night or day, let him recite the Verse of the Throne, "Allah bears witness," "Say: He is Allah, the One," and the two chapters of refuge, and let him say: In the name of Allah, as Allah wills; there is no strength except with Allah; Allah is sufficient for me; I have placed my trust in Allah; as Allah wills, none brings good except Allah; as Allah wills, none averts evil except Allah; Allah is sufficient for me and He suffices; Allah hears whoever calls; there is no endpoint beyond Allah nor any refuge below Allah. "Allah has decreed: 'I will surely prevail, I and My messengers.' Indeed, Allah is Powerful, Mighty." I have fortified myself with Allah the Most Great and sought aid from the Ever-Living who does not die. O Allah, guard us with Your eye that does not sleep, and shelter us with Your pillar that cannot be assailed. O Allah, have mercy on us by Your power over us, so we do not perish while You are our confidence and our hope. O Allah, incline towards us the hearts of Your servants, male and female, with compassion and mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. Eighth: Whenever he ascends a high place on the road, it is recommended to say Allahu Akbar three times, then say: O Allah, to You belongs grandeur above all grandeur, and to You is praise in every circumstance. Whenever he descends, let him glorify Allah, and whenever he fears loneliness in his journey, let him say: Glory be to Allah, the Sovereign, the Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit. You have clothed the heavens with might and majesty.

(The second section on the etiquettes of entering the state of consecration (ihrām) from the designated boundary (mīqāt) until entering Mecca, comprising five points)

First: To perform the ritual bath (ghusl) with the intention of the bath for consecration, meaning when one reaches the well-known boundary from which people enter the state of consecration, and to complete the bath with thorough cleansing, comb the beard and head, trim the nails, clip the mustache, and achieve the complete cleanliness we mentioned in the chapter on purification. Second: To set aside sewn garments and don the two garments of consecration, wrapping one over the upper body and the other around the lower body, both white, for white is the most beloved of garments to God Almighty. To apply perfume to one’s garments and body, and there is no harm in using a perfume whose substance remains after entering consecration, for some musk was seen on the parting of the hair of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) after entering consecration from what he had used before it. Third: After donning the garments, to wait until one’s mount sets off if riding, or to begin walking if on foot. At that point, one should intend to enter consecration for the Hajj or the ‘Umrah, whether combined (qirān) or single (ifrād), as one wishes. Mere intention suffices for the consecration to be established, but the Sunnah is to accompany the intention with the utterance of the talbiyah, saying: “Labbayk Allāhumma labbayk, labbayka lā sharīka laka labbayk, inna al-ḥamda wa al-ni‘mata laka wa al-mulk, lā sharīka lak.” And if one adds: “Labbayk wa sa‘dayk, wa al-khayru kulluhu bi yadayk, wa al-raghbā’u ilayk, labbayk bi ḥajjatin ḥaqqan ta‘abbudan wa riqqan. Allāhumma ṣalli ‘alā Muḥammad wa ‘alā āli Muḥammad.” Fourth: Once one’s consecration is established with the aforementioned talbiyah, it is recommended to say: “O God, I intend to perform Hajj, so facilitate it for me, aid me in fulfilling its obligation, and accept it from me. O God, I have intended to perform Your obligation in Hajj, so make me among those who have responded to You, believed in Your promise, and followed Your command. Make me among Your guests whom You are pleased with and have accepted. O God, facilitate for me the performance of what I have intended of Hajj. O God, I have consecrated for You my flesh, my hair, my blood, my nerves, my marrow, my bones, and I have forbidden upon myself women, perfume, and wearing sewn garments, seeking Your countenance and the Abode of the Hereafter.” From the moment of consecration, the six prohibited acts we previously mentioned become forbidden, so one must avoid them. Fifth: It is recommended to renew the talbiyah throughout the state of consecration, especially when meeting fellow travelers, when people gather, with every ascent and descent, and with every mounting and dismounting, raising one’s voice with it without straining the throat or causing disturbance, for one is not calling upon one who is deaf or absent, as mentioned in the report. There is no harm in raising the voice with the talbiyah in the three mosques, for they are the sites of the rites: namely, the Sacred Mosque, the Mosque of al-Khayf, and the Mosque of the Boundary. As for other mosques, there is no harm in uttering the talbiyah without raising the voice. And he (peace be upon him), when something pleased him, would say: “Labbayk, indeed the true life is the life of the Hereafter.”

(The third section on the etiquettes of entering Mecca until the circumambulation, comprising six points)

First: To perform the ritual bath at Dhū Ṭuwā for entering Mecca. The recommended, Sunnah baths during Hajj are nine: first, for entering consecration from the boundary; then for entering Mecca; then for the arrival circumambulation (ṭawāf al-qudūm); then for standing at ‘Arafah; then for standing at Muzdalifah; then three baths for stoning the three pillars (jamarāt), with no bath for stoning the Jamrat al-‘Aqabah; then for the farewell circumambulation (ṭawāf al-wadā‘). In his later opinion, al-Shāfi‘ī (may God be pleased with him) did not see the bath as recommended for the visitation circumambulation (ṭawāf al-ziyārah) or the farewell circumambulation, thus reducing them to seven. Second: Upon entering the sacred precinct (ḥaram) while still outside Mecca, to say: “O God, this is Your sacred precinct and Your sanctuary, so make my flesh, my blood, my hair, and my skin forbidden to the Fire, and grant me security from Your punishment on the day You resurrect Your servants, and make me among Your allies and the people of Your obedience.” Third: To enter Mecca from the side of al-Abṭaḥ, which is the pass of Kadā’ (with a fatḥah on the kāf), for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) turned from the main road toward it, so emulating him is preferable. And when leaving, to exit from the pass of Kadī (with a ḍammah on the kāf), which is the lower pass, the first being the upper one. Fourth: When entering Mecca and reaching the top of the embankment, where the sight of the House falls upon one, to say: “There is no god but God, and God is greatest. O God, You are Peace, and from You is peace, and Your abode is the abode of peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor. O God, this is Your House, which You have made great, honored, and ennobled. O God, increase it in grandeur, increase it in honor and nobility, increase it in awe, and increase those who perform its Hajj in goodness and honor. O God, open for me the gates of Your mercy, admit me into Your Garden, and protect me from the accursed Satan.” Fifth: When entering the Sacred Mosque, to enter from the Gate of Banī Shaybah and say: “In the name of God, and by God, and from God, and to God, and in the path of God, and upon the creed of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him).” Then, when approaching the House, to say: “Praise be to God, and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen. O God, send blessings upon Muḥammad, Your servant and messenger, and upon Abraham, Your friend, and upon all Your prophets and messengers.” And to raise one’s hands and say: “O God, I ask You in this station of mine, at the beginning of my rites, that You accept my repentance and overlook my misdeed.”

And I lay down my burden. Praise be to God who has brought me to His Sacred House, which He made a place of return for people and a sanctuary, and made it blessed and a guidance for the worlds. O God, I am Your servant, and the city is Your city, and the sanctuary is Your sanctuary, and the House is Your House. I have come to You seeking Your mercy and asking of You the request of the distressed one, the one who fears Your punishment, the one hopeful for Your mercy, the seeker of Your good pleasure. Sixth: That you then intend for the Black Stone, touch it with your right hand, and kiss it, and say: O God, I have fulfilled my trust and discharged my covenant; bear witness for me of its fulfillment. If he is unable to kiss it, he stands opposite it and says that. Then he does not turn to anything before the circumambulation—which is the Arrival Circumambulation—unless he finds the people in the obligatory prayer, in which case he prays with them, then performs the circumambulation.
                         (The Fourth Sentence on Circumambulation)
   When he intends to commence the circumambulation, whether for arrival or otherwise, he should observe six matters.
First: That he observes the conditions of prayer, from purification from minor and major impurity, and from filth on the garment, body, and place, and covering the private parts. For circumambulating the House is a prayer, but God the Exalted has permitted speech within it. And he should perform *idṭibāʿ* before beginning the circumambulation, which is to place the middle of his upper garment under his right armpit and gather its two ends over his left shoulder, so that one end hangs behind his back and the other on his chest. And he ceases the *talbiyah* at the commencement of the circumambulation and occupies himself with the supplications we will mention. Second: When he has finished the *idṭibāʿ*, he should place the House on his left, and stand at the Black Stone, and move a little away from it so that the Stone is in front of him. He passes his entire body by the entire Stone at the beginning of his circumambulation. And he should place between himself and the House a distance of about three steps, to be close to the House, for that is best, and so that he is not circumambulating on the *shādhurwān*, for it is part of the House. And at the Black Stone, the *shādhurwān* may connect to the ground and be confused with it. One who circumambulates upon it, his circumambulation is not valid, for he is circumambulating inside the House. The *shādhurwān* is that which protrudes from the width of the wall of the House after the top of the wall was narrowed. Then from this position he begins the circumambulation. Third: That he says, before passing the Stone, indeed at the beginning of the circumambulation: "In the name of God, and God is greatest. O God, out of faith in You, and affirmation of Your Book, and fulfillment of Your covenant, and following the way of Your Prophet Muhammad ﷺ." And he circumambulates. The first thing he passes after the Stone, he reaches the door of the House and says: "O God, this House is Your House, and this sanctuary is Your sanctuary, and this security is Your security, and this is the station of one who seeks refuge in You from the Fire." And when mentioning the station, he gestures with his eye toward the Station of Abraham, peace be upon him: "O God, Your House is mighty, and Your countenance is noble, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful. So grant me refuge from the Fire and from the accursed Satan, and make my flesh and blood forbidden to the Fire, and grant me security from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection, and suffice me for the burdens of this world and the Hereafter." Then he glorifies and praises God the Exalted until he reaches the Iraqi Corner. There he says: "O God, I seek refuge in You from polytheism, doubt, disbelief, hypocrisy, discord, bad character, and an evil appearance in family, wealth, and children." When he reaches the Spout, he says: "O God, shade us under Your Throne on the day when there is no shade except Your shade. O God, give me to drink from the cup of Muhammad ﷺ a drink after which I will never thirst again." When he reaches the Syrian Corner, he says: "O God, make it a righteous pilgrimage, a thanked effort, a forgiven sin, and a trade that will never perish, O Mighty, O Forgiving. My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and overlook what You know. Indeed, You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous." When he reaches the Yemeni Corner, he says: "O God, I seek refuge in You from disbelief, and I seek refuge in You from poverty, and from the punishment of the grave, and from the trials of life and death, and I seek refuge in You from disgrace in this world and the Hereafter." And he says between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone: "O God, our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us by Your mercy from the trial of the grave and the punishment of the Fire." When he reaches the Black Stone, he says: "O God, forgive me by Your mercy. I seek refuge with the Lord of this Stone from debt, poverty, constriction of the chest, and the punishment of the grave." At that point, one circuit is completed. He thus circumambulates seven circuits, supplicating with these supplications in every circuit. Fourth: That he performs *ramal* in three circuits and walks in the remaining four in the customary manner. The meaning of *ramal* is hastening in walking with short, quick steps. It is less than running and more than the customary walk. The purpose of it and of the *idṭibāʿ* is to show vigor, toughness, and strength. This was certainly the original intent, to cut off the covetousness of the disbelievers, and that practice has remained. The best is to perform *ramal* while close to the House. If it is not possible due to crowding, then *ramal* while farther away is better, so he goes to the edge of the circumambulation area. He should perform *ramal* for three, then draw near to the House in the crowded area and walk for four. If he is able to touch the Stone in every circuit, that is most beloved. If crowding prevents him, he gestures with his hand and kisses his hand. Likewise, touching the Yemeni Corner is recommended, as is touching the other corners.

It is narrated: (He ﷺ used to touch the Yemeni Corner, kiss it, and place his cheek upon it). Whoever wishes to specify the Black Stone for kissing and confines himself to merely touching the Yemeni Corner, dispensing with touching it by hand, that is preferable. Fifth: When the circumambulation is completed with seven circuits, let him proceed to the *Multazam*, which is between the Black Stone and the Door. It is a place where supplications are answered. Let him cling to the House, hold onto the curtains, press his stomach against the House, place his right cheek upon it, spread his forearms and palms upon it, and say: O Allah, Lord of the Ancient House, free my neck from the Fire, grant me refuge from the accursed Satan, grant me refuge from all evil, make me content with what You have provided me, and bless me in what You have given me. O Allah, verily this House is Your House, and the servant is Your servant, and this is the station of one seeking refuge in You from the Fire. O Allah, make me among the most honored of Your visitors to You. Then let him praise Allah abundantly in this place, send blessings upon His Messenger ﷺ and upon all the Messengers abundantly, and supplicate for his personal needs and seek forgiveness for his sins. Some of the pious predecessors in this place would say to his servants: Step away from me so that I may confess my sins to my Lord. Sixth: Upon finishing that, it is fitting that he pray two *rak'ahs* behind the Station of Abraham, reciting in the first *Surah Al-Kafirun* and in the second *Surah Al-Ikhlas*. These are the two *rak'ahs* of the circumambulation. Al-Zuhri said: The established practice is to pray two *rak'ahs* for every seven circuits. If one combines several sets of circuits and prays two *rak'ahs*, it is permissible. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did that. Every set of seven is a circumambulation. Let him supplicate after the two *rak'ahs* of the circumambulation and say: O Allah, make ease easy for me, keep hardship away from me, forgive me in the Hereafter and the First Life, protect me with Your gentle care so that I do not disobey You, aid me in obeying You with Your enabling grace, keep me away from Your acts of disobedience, and make me among those who love You and love Your angels and Your messengers and love Your righteous servants. O Allah, make me beloved to Your angels, Your messengers, and Your righteous servants. O Allah, just as You have guided me to Islam, so make me firm upon it with Your gentle care and Your guardianship, and employ me for Your obedience and the obedience of Your Messenger, and deliver me from misleading trials. Then let him return to the Black Stone, touch it, and thereby conclude the circumambulation. He ﷺ said: (Whoever circumambulates the House seven times and prays two *rak'ahs*, for him is a reward like that of freeing a slave). This is the manner of the circumambulation. The obligatory elements from its totality, after the conditions of prayer, are: to complete the number of circuits as seven around the entire House; to begin at the Black Stone; to keep the House on one's left; to perform the circumambulation inside the mosque but outside the House, not upon the *Shadharwan* nor inside the *Hijr*; and to perform the circuits consecutively without separating them with a separation outside the customary practice. All else besides this are recommended practices and etiquettes.

                          (The Fifth Discourse: On the Sa'i)

When he finishes the circumambulation, let him exit through the door of Safa, which is aligned with the side between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone. When he exits that door and reaches Safa, which is a hill, let him ascend some steps at the base of the hill, about the height of a man. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ascended until the Ka'bah became visible to him—a narration states he ascended Safa until the Ka'bah became visible to him. Beginning the Sa'i from the base of the hill is sufficient, and this increase is recommended, but some of those steps are later additions, so he should not leave them behind his back, lest he not be completing the Sa'i. If he begins from here, he performs the Sa'i between it and Marwah seven times. Upon ascending Safa, he should face the House and say: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest. Praise be to Allah for what He has guided us to. Praise be to Allah with all His praises for all His favors entirely. There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and causes death. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things. There is no god but Allah alone. He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His servant, honored His soldiers, and defeated the confederates alone. There is no god but Allah, making our religion sincerely for Him, even if the disbelievers dislike it. There is no god but Allah, making our religion sincerely for Him. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. So glorify Him in the evening and in the morning. And to Him is praise in the heavens and the earth, and at nightfall and when you enter the noon. He brings the living from the dead and brings the dead from the living, and He gives life to the earth after its death. Thus shall you be brought forth. And among His signs is that He created you from dust; then, behold, you are human beings dispersing. O Allah, I ask You for enduring faith, truthful certainty, beneficial knowledge, a humble heart, a remembering tongue, and I ask You for pardon, well-being, and lasting safety in this world and the Hereafter. And he sends blessings upon Muhammad ﷺ and supplicates to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, with whatever he wishes of his needs following this supplication. Then he descends and begins the Sa'i, saying: My Lord, forgive, have mercy, and overlook what You know. Indeed, You are the Most Mighty, the Most Generous. O Allah, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire. And he walks at a moderate pace until he reaches the last green milestone, which is the first thing he encounters when descending from Safa, and it is upon...

At the corner of the Sacred Mosque, when six cubits remain between him and aligning with the milestone, he begins walking swiftly, which is the ramal, until he reaches the two green milestones. Then he returns to a gentle pace. When he reaches al-Marwah, he ascends it as he ascended al-Safa, turns his face toward al-Safa, and supplicates with a similar supplication. Thus, one circuit of sa'i is completed. When he returns to al-Safa, two circuits are completed. He does this seven times, performing the ramal at the place of ramal and walking calmly at the place of calmness as previously described. In each circuit, he ascends al-Safa and al-Marwah. When he does this, he has completed the Arrival Tawaf and the Sa'i, both of which are Sunnah acts. Purity is recommended for sa'i but not obligatory, unlike tawaf. If he performs sa'i, he should not repeat it after the standing (at Arafah) and suffice with this as a pillar, for it is not a condition of sa'i that it be delayed until after the standing; that is only a condition for the essential tawaf. Indeed, the condition for every sa'i is that it occurs after a tawaf, any tawaf.

(The Sixth Discourse: On the Standing and What Precedes It)

When the pilgrim concludes the day of Arafah at Arafat, he should have already completed the Arrival Tawaf and entering Makkah before the standing. If he arrived days before that and performed the Arrival Tawaf, he remains in the state of ihram until the seventh day of Dhu al-Hijjah. The Imam delivers a sermon in Makkah after the noon prayer near the Ka'bah, instructing the people to prepare to depart for Mina on the Day of Tarwiyah, to spend the night there, and to proceed from there to Arafah to establish the obligatory standing after the sun passes its zenith, for the time of the standing is from the zenith until the true dawn of the Day of Sacrifice. He should go out to Mina in the state of talbiyah, and it is recommended for him to walk from Makkah in the rites until his Hajj is completed, if he is able. Walking from the Mosque of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to the standing place is better and more emphasized. When he reaches Mina, he says: "O Allah, this is Mina, so bestow upon me what You have bestowed upon Your allies and the people of Your obedience." He spends this night at Mina, which is a night of lodging not connected to a rite. When he wakes on the day of Arafah, he prays the dawn prayer. When the sun rises over Thabir, he proceeds to Arafat, saying: "O Allah, make this the best morning I have ever embarked upon, the closest to Your pleasure, and the farthest from Your wrath. O Allah, to You I have set out, in You I have hoped, upon You I have relied, and Your face I have sought. Make me among those whom You boast of today to one better and superior to me." When he reaches Arafat, he should pitch his tent at Namirah, close to the mosque, for there the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, pitched his tent. Namirah is the valley of 'Aranah, below the standing place and below Arafah. He should perform the ritual bath for the standing. When the sun passes its zenith, the Imam delivers a brief sermon, then sits, and the mu'adhdhin begins the call to prayer while the Imam delivers the second sermon, connecting the iqamah to the adhan. The Imam finishes with the completion of the mu'adhdhin's iqamah. Then he combines the noon and afternoon prayers with one adhan and two iqamahs, shortening the prayers. He then proceeds to the standing place. He should stand at Arafah and not stand in the valley of 'Aranah. As for the Mosque of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, its front is in the valley and its rear is from Arafah. Whoever stands at the front of the mosque has not achieved the standing at Arafah. The place of Arafah is distinguished from the mosque by large stones that were laid. The best is to stand near the stones, close to the Imam, facing the qiblah, mounted. He should increase in various forms of praise, glorification, declaring Allah's oneness, extolling Allah the Almighty, supplication, and repentance. He should not fast on this day to have strength for persistent supplication. He should not cease the talbiyah on the day of Arafah; rather, it is beloved to recite the talbiyah at times and devote himself to supplication at others. He should not depart from the edge of Arafah except after sunset, to combine night and day at Arafah. If he can stand for an hour on the eighth day, in case of possible error in sighting the crescent, that is prudent and secures him from missing it. Whoever misses the standing until the dawn of the Day of Sacrifice has missed Hajj; he must release himself from ihram by performing the rites of 'Umrah, then sacrifice an animal due to missing it, and perform the pilgrimage the following year. His primary occupation on this day should be supplication, for in such a place and such a gathering, the answering of supplications is hoped for. The transmitted supplication from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and from the predecessors on the day of Arafah, with which one should begin, is to say: "There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is Ever-Living and does not die. In His hand is all good, and He is over all things competent. O Allah, place light in my heart, light in my hearing, light in my sight, and light on my tongue. O Allah, expand my chest for me and make my affair easy for me." And let him say: "O Allah, Lord of praise, Yours is the praise as You say, and better than what we say. To You is my prayer, my devotion, my living, and my dying, and to You is my return, and to You is my reward. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the whisperings of the chest, the scattering of affairs, and the punishment of the grave. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evil..."

What enters by night, and from the evil of what enters by day, and from the evil of what the winds blow, and from the evil of the calamities of time. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the withdrawal of Your well-being and the suddenness of Your wrath, and from all Your displeasure. O Allah, guide me with guidance and forgive me in the Hereafter and the first life. O Best of those sought, Most Sublime of those supplicated, Most Generous of those asked—He to whom belongs all—grant me this evening the best of what You have granted any of Your creation and the pilgrims of Your House, O Most Merciful of the merciful.

O Allah, O Elevator of ranks, Bestower of blessings, O Originator of the earths and the heavens, voices have clamored to You in diverse languages, asking You for their needs, and my need to You is that You do not forget me in the abode of tribulation when the people of the world forget me. O Allah, You hear my speech, see my place, know my secret and my public, and nothing of my affair is hidden from You. I am the wretched, the poor, the one crying for help, the one seeking refuge, the fearful, the apprehensive, the one confessing his sin. I ask You with the asking of the destitute, I implore You with the imploring of the sinful, the humbled, and I call upon You with the call of the fearful, the blind—the call of one whose neck has submitted to You, whose tears have flowed for You, whose body has been humbled before You, and whose nose has been ground in the dust for You. O Allah, do not make me through my supplication to You, my Lord, wretched, and be to me Kind, Merciful, O Best of those asked and Most Generous of givers.

My God, if anyone praises himself to You, then I am one who reproaches myself. My God, sins have silenced my tongue, so I have no means through deeds, nor any intercessor save hope. My God, I know that my sins have left me with no standing before You, nor any face for excuse, but You are the Most Generous of the generous. My God, if I am not worthy to reach Your mercy, then Your mercy is worthy to reach me, and Your mercy encompasses all things, and I am a thing. My God, even if my sins are great, they are small beside Your pardon, so forgive them for me, O Generous One.

My God, You are You, and I am I. I am the one who returns to sins, and You are the One who returns to forgiveness. My God, if You only show mercy to the people of obedience, then to whom will the sinners flee? My God, I deliberately avoided Your obedience and purposefully turned to Your disobedience, so glory be to You! How great is Your argument against me, and how generous Your pardon toward me. By the binding of Your argument against me, the severance of my argument before You, my need of You, and Your independence from me, You must forgive me, O Best of those called upon and Most Excellent of those hoped in. By the sanctity of Islam and the covenant of Muhammad, peace be upon him, I beseech You, so forgive me all my sins, and send me from this standing-place of mine with my needs fulfilled, and grant me what I have asked, and realize my hope in what I have desired.

My God, I have called upon You with the supplication You taught me, so do not deprive me of the hope You have made known to me. My God, what will You do this evening with a servant who acknowledges his sin to You, is humble before You in his lowliness, submissive in his guilt, supplicating to You from his deeds, repentant to You from his offenses, seeking Your forgiveness for his wrong, imploring You for pardon, seeking from You the success of his needs, hoping in You at his standing despite the multitude of his sins? O Refuge of every living being and Guardian of every believer, he who does good attains success by Your mercy, and he who errs is ruined by his misdeed.

O Allah, to You we have set out, and in Your courtyard we have alighted, and in You we hope, and what is with You we seek, and for Your favor we present ourselves, and Your mercy we hope for, and from Your punishment we are fearful, and to You from the burdens of sins we have fled, and to Your Sacred House we have performed pilgrimage. O You who possesses the needs of the askers and knows the secrets of the silent, O He beside whom there is no lord to be called upon, and above whom there is no creator to be feared, and for whom there is no minister to be approached nor gatekeeper to be bribed, O He who is not increased by the multitude of asking except in generosity and nobility, and by the multitude of needs except in graciousness and kindness.

O Allah, You have appointed hospitality for every guest, and we are Your guests, so make our hospitality from You Paradise. O Allah, for every delegation there is a reward, and for every visitor an honor, and for every asker a gift, and for every hopeful one a recompense, and for every seeker of what is with You a requital, and for every one seeking mercy from You mercy, and for every one desiring nearness to You closeness, and for every one beseeching You pardon. And we have come as a delegation to Your Sacred House and stood at these great sites and witnessed these noble scenes, hoping for what is with You, so do not disappoint our hope.

Our God, You have followed blessings upon blessings until souls became content with the succession of Your favors, and You have shown proofs until the silent spoke with Your argument, and You have manifested favors until Your allies confessed shortcoming in fulfilling Your due, and You have displayed signs until the heavens and the earths declared with Your evidences, and You have subdued by Your power until everything submitted to Your might and faces were humbled before Your majesty. When Your servants do wrong, You are forbearing and grant respite; and when they do good, You are gracious and accept; and when they disobey, You cover; and when they sin, You pardon and forgive; and when we call, You answer; and when we cry out, You hear; and when we turn to You, You draw near; and when we turn away, You call.

Our God, You said in Your clear Book to Muhammad, the seal of the prophets: "Say to those who have disbelieved: if they desist, what has preceded will be forgiven them." So You were pleased with them by their affirmation of the word of monotheism after denial. And we bear witness to You of monotheism in humility, and to Muhammad of messengership in sincerity, so forgive us by this testimony our past crimes, and do not make our portion in it less than the portion of one who entered into Islam.

Our God, indeed You have loved drawing near to You through freeing those whom our right hands possess, and we are Your servants, so You are more deserving of graciousness—therefore free us. And indeed You have commanded us to give charity to our poor, and we are Your poor, so You are more entitled to generosity—therefore bestow charity upon us. And You have enjoined us to pardon those who wrong us, while we have wronged ourselves, so You are more worthy of magnanimity—therefore pardon us. Our Lord, forgive us and have mercy upon us; You are our Protector. Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us by Your mercy from the punishment of the Fire.

And let him frequently recite the supplication of al-Khidr, peace be upon him, which is to say: O You whom no affair distracts from another affair, nor does one hearing distract from another hearing, nor are voices confused before You; O You whom petitions do not perplex, nor do diverse languages cause You difficulty; O You whom the insistence of the insistent does not weary, nor does the asking of askers annoy—let us taste the coolness of Your pardon and the sweetness of communion with You. And let him supplicate with whatever comes to mind, and seek forgiveness for himself, his parents, and all believing men and women, and let him be persistent in supplication and magnify his request, for nothing is too great for God. And Mutarrif ibn ‘Abd Allah said at ‘Arafah: O God, do not turn all away on my account. And Bakr al-Muzani said: A man said, “When I looked upon the people of ‘Arafah, I thought they had been forgiven, were it not that I was among them.”

(The seventh section concerning the remaining rites of Hajj after the standing, including the overnight stay, stoning, sacrifice, shaving, and circumambulation.)

When he departs from ‘Arafah after sunset, he should be in a state of tranquility and dignity, and avoid the galloping of horses and the overdriving of camels as some people are accustomed to do, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, forbade the galloping of horses and the overdriving of camels, saying: “Fear God and travel at a gentle pace; do not trample the weak nor harm a Muslim.” When he reaches Muzdalifah, he should perform a ritual bath for it, because Muzdalifah is part of the Sacred Precinct, so let him enter it with a bath. If he is able to enter it walking, that is better and closer to honoring the Sacred Precinct. On the way, he should raise his voice with the talbiyah. When he reaches Muzdalifah, he should say: O God, this is Muzdalifah, where diverse tongues have gathered asking You for varied needs; make me among those who called upon You and You answered them, and who relied upon You and You sufficed them. Then he combines Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers at Muzdalifah at the time of ‘Isha’, shortening them, with one adhan and two iqamahs, with no voluntary prayer between them. However, he combines the voluntary prayers of Maghrib and ‘Isha’ and the Witr prayer after the two obligatory prayers, beginning with the voluntary of Maghrib then the voluntary of ‘Isha’, as with the obligatory prayers. For abandoning voluntary prayers during travel is a clear loss, and obligating their performance at their specific times is harmful and severs their following upon the obligatory prayers. If it is permissible to perform the voluntary prayers with the obligatory prayers under one tayammum due to the rule of following, then it is more appropriate to permit performing them under the rule of combination due to following. This is not prevented by the voluntary prayer differing from the obligatory prayer in the permissibility of performing it while mounted, due to what we have indicated regarding following and necessity. Then he spends that night at Muzdalifah, which is an overnight stay that is part of the rites. Whoever leaves it in the first half of the night and does not stay overnight owes a sacrifice. Reviving this noble night is among the beauties of acts of nearness for those who are able. Then when midnight comes, he prepares to depart and gathers pebbles from there, for there are soft stones there. Let him take seventy pebbles, as that is sufficient for the need, and there is no harm in taking extra, for some may fall from him. Let the pebbles be small enough to be held between the fingertips. Then he should pray the Fajr prayer at the time of dawn and begin traveling until he reaches al-Mash‘ar al-Haram, which is the end of Muzdalifah, and he stands and supplicates until daybreak, saying: O God, by the right of the Sacred Monument, the Sacred House, the Sacred Month, the Corner, and the Station, convey to the spirit of Muhammad from us greetings and peace, and admit us into the Abode of Peace, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor. Then he departs from there before sunrise until he reaches a place called Wadi Muhassir, where it is recommended for him to urge his mount until he crosses the width of the valley, and if he is on foot, he should walk briskly. Then when the Day of Sacrifice dawns, he mixes the talbiyah with takbir, alternating between them, until he reaches Mina and the locations of the jamarat, which are three. He passes the first and second, having no concern with them on the Day of Sacrifice, until he reaches Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, which is on the right facing the qiblah on the path, and the target is slightly elevated on the mountainside, clearly marked among the stoning sites. He stones Jamarat al-‘Aqabah after sunrise by the measure of a spear’s length. The manner is to stand facing the qiblah, though if he faces the jamrah, there is no harm. He stones with seven pebbles, raising his hand, replacing the talbiyah with takbir, saying with each pebble: “God is greater, in obedience to the Merciful and in defiance of Satan. O God, in affirmation of Your Book and following the sunnah of Your Prophet.” When he has stoned, he ceases the talbiyah and takbir, except for the takbir following the obligatory prayers.

The prayers from the noon of the Day of Sacrifice until after the dawn of the last days of Tashreeq, and one does not stand for supplication on this day but rather supplicates in his home. The manner of magnification is to say: Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, Great is He. And praise be to Allah abundantly, and glory be to Allah in the morning and the evening. There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner to Him, sincere to Him in religion even if the disbelievers detest it. There is no god but Allah alone, He fulfilled His promise, supported His servant, and defeated the confederates alone. There is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest. Then let him sacrifice the offering if he has one, and it is preferable that he sacrifices it himself, and let him say: In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest. O Allah, from You, to You, and for You, accept from me as You accepted from Your intimate friend Ibrahim. Sacrificing with a camel is best, then with a cow, then with a sheep. And a sheep is better than sharing in a camel or a cow with six others. A sheep is superior to a goat. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "The best sacrifice is a horned ram." And the white is better than the gray and the black. Abu Huraira said: "The white is better in sacrifice than two black ones." And let him eat from it if it is a voluntary offering. And he should not sacrifice the lame, the one with a cut-off ear, the one with a broken horn, the scabby, the one with a slit ear from above, the one with a perforated ear from below, the one with a hole in the front of the ear, the one with a hole in the back of the ear, and the emaciated one that has no marrow due to leanness. Then let him shave after that. The Sunnah is to face the Qiblah and begin with the front of his head, shaving the right side to the two prominent bones at the back of the neck, then shave the remainder and say: O Allah, grant me a good deed for every hair, erase from me a sin by it, and raise me a degree by it with You. The woman shortens her hair. The bald man is recommended to pass the razor over his head. Whenever he shaves after stoning the Jamrah, he has attained the first release, and all prohibitions become lawful for him except women and hunting. Then he proceeds to Mecca and performs the Tawaf as we have described. This Tawaf is a pillar of Hajj and is called Tawaf al-Ziyarah. Its earliest time is after midnight of the Night of Sacrifice, and its best time is the Day of Sacrifice. There is no end to its time; rather, he may delay it to any time he wishes, but he remains bound by the restrictions of Ihram, so women are not lawful for him until he performs the Tawaf. When he performs the Tawaf, the release is complete, intercourse becomes lawful, and the Ihram is lifted entirely, and nothing remains except the stoning of the days of Tashreeq and the stay in Mina, which are obligations after the removal of Ihram by way of following the truth. The manner of this Tawaf with the two Rak'ahs is as preceded in the Tawaf of Arrival. When he finishes the two Rak'ahs, let him perform the Sa'i as we described if he did not perform Sa'i after the Tawaf of Arrival. If he had already performed it, that has occurred as a pillar, so he should not repeat the Sa'i. The causes of release are three: the stoning, the shaving, and the Tawaf which is a pillar. Whenever two of these three are done, he has attained one of the two releases, and there is no blame on him in advancing or delaying these three with the sacrifice. But the best is to stone, then sacrifice, then shave, then perform Tawaf. The Sunnah for the Imam on this day is to deliver the sermon after noon, and it is the farewell sermon of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. In Hajj there are four sermons: the sermon of the seventh day, the sermon of the Day of Arafah, the sermon of the Day of Sacrifice, and the sermon of the first day of departure. All of them are after noon, and all are single except the sermon of the Day of Arafah, for it is two sermons with a sitting between them. Then when he finishes the Tawaf, he returns to Mina for the stay and stoning. He stays that night in Mina, and it is called the Night of Settlement because the people will settle in Mina the next day and not depart. When the second day of Eid dawns and the sun has passed its zenith, he performs ablution for the stoning and heads to the first Jamrah, which is near Arafah, on the right of the road, and stones it with seven pebbles. When he passes it, he deviates slightly to the right of the road and stands facing the Qiblah, praising Allah Almighty, declaring His oneness, magnifying Him, and supplicating with presence of heart and humility of limbs, standing facing the Qiblah for the duration of reciting Surah Al-Baqarah, devoted to supplication. Then he proceeds to the middle Jamrah and stones as he stoned the first, and stands as he stood for the first. Then he proceeds to the Jamrah of Aqabah and stones seven, and does not linger for any task but returns to his lodging. He stays that night in Mina, and this night is called the Night of the First Departure. He awakens, and when he prays Dhuhr on the second day of the days of Tashreeq, he stones on this day twenty-one pebbles like the day before. Then he has the choice between remaining in Mina and returning to Mecca. If he leaves Mina before sunset, there is no harm upon him. If he endures until night, it is not permissible for him to leave; rather, he is obliged to stay until he stones on the day.

The second group consists of twenty-one stones, as previously mentioned. Regarding the omission of spending the night [in Mina] and the stoning, it necessitates the shedding of blood [as expiation], and he should give the meat in charity. He may visit the Sacred House during the nights of Mina on the condition that he does not spend the night except in Mina. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to do this, and one should not neglect attending the obligatory prayers with the Imam in the Mosque of al-Khayf, for its merit is great. When he departs from Mina, it is preferable to stay at al-Muhassab in Mina and pray the 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha prayers and take a brief rest there; this is the Sunnah, narrated by a group of the Companions, may God be pleased with them. If he does not do that, there is no blame upon him.

(The Eighth Section: On the Description of 'Umrah and What Follows It Until the Farewell Circumambulation)

Whoever wishes to perform 'Umrah before or after his Hajj, however he wishes, should perform the ritual bath and don the garments of Ihram as previously described for Hajj, and assume the state of Ihram for 'Umrah from its designated point. The best of its points are al-Ji'ranah, then al-Tan'im, then al-Hudaybiyah. He should intend the 'Umrah, recite the Talbiyah, and proceed to the mosque of 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, and pray two rak'ahs and supplicate as he wishes. Then he should return to Makkah while reciting the Talbiyah until he enters the Sacred Mosque. When he enters the mosque, he should cease the Talbiyah and perform the circumambulation, seven circuits, and the Sa'y, seven laps, as we have described. When he finishes, he should shave his head, and his 'Umrah is then complete. The resident of Makkah should frequently perform 'Umrah and circumambulation, and he should frequently gaze upon the Sacred House. When he enters it, he should pray two rak'ahs between the two pillars, for that is best. He should enter it barefoot, with reverence. It was said to one of them, "Have you entered the House of your Lord today?" He replied, "By God, I do not deem these two feet worthy of circumambulating the House of my Lord, so how could I deem them worthy to tread with them in the House of my Lord, knowing where they have walked and to where they have walked?" He should drink plentifully from the water of Zamzam and draw it with his own hand without delegation if possible, and quench his thirst from it until fully satisfied. And he should say, "O God, make it a healing from every illness and ailment, and grant me sincerity, certainty, and well-being in this world and the next." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for," meaning it heals what is intended by it.

(The Ninth Section: On the Farewell Circumambulation)

Whenever it becomes possible for him to return to his homeland after completing the Hajj and 'Umrah, he should first conclude his affairs, prepare his journey, and make his final affair the farewell to the House, bidding it farewell by performing the circumambulation around it, seven circuits as before, but without the Ramal [brisk walking] or Idtiba' [uncovering the right shoulder]. When he finishes, he should pray two rak'ahs behind the Station [of Abraham] and drink from the water of Zamzam. Then he should come to the Multazam, supplicate, humble himself, and say: "O God, the House is Your House, and the servant is Your servant, the son of Your servant and the son of Your maidservant. You have carried me upon what You have subjugated of Your creation until You journeyed me through Your lands and brought me by Your favor until You enabled me to fulfill Your rites. If You are pleased with me, then increase Your pleasure with me; if not, then from now, before I distance myself from Your House, this is the time of my departure, if You permit me, not substituting another for You nor for Your House, nor desiring other than You or other than Your House. O God, accompany me with well-being in my body and protection in my religion, and make my return good, and grant me Your obedience always as long as You keep me alive, and gather for me the good of this world and the next. Indeed, You have power over all things. O God, do not make this the last of my covenant with Your Sacred House, and if You make it the last, then compensate me for it with Paradise." It is beloved that he does not turn his gaze away from the House until it disappears from his sight.

(The Tenth Section: On Visiting Medina and Its Etiquettes)

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever visits me after my death, it is as if he visited me during my life." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever has the means and does not come to me as a visitor has been neglectful of me." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever comes to me as a visitor, having no concern but my visit, it is a right upon God, glorified be He, that I be an intercessor for him." So whoever intends to visit Medina should send abundant blessings upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, on his way. When his sight falls upon the walls and trees of Medina, he should say: "O God, this is the sanctuary of Your Messenger, so make it for me a protection from the Fire, and safety from the punishment and the evil reckoning." He should perform the ritual bath before entering, from the well of al-Harrah, and apply perfume, and wear his cleanest clothes. When he enters it, he should enter humbly, with reverence, and say: "In the name of God, and upon the creed of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. My Lord, cause me to enter a truthful entrance and cause me to exit a truthful exit, and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority." Then he should proceed to the Mosque, enter it, and pray two rak'ahs beside the pulpit, making the pillar of the pulpit aligned with his right shoulder, and face the column beside which is the chest, so that the circle which is in the qiblah direction of the mosque is between his eyes, for that was the standing place of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, before the mosque was altered. He should strive to pray in the original mosque before its expansion. Then he should come to the grave of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and stand facing his noble face, which is done by turning his back to the qiblah and facing the wall of the grave at a distance of about four cubits from the column in the corner of the grave's wall, making the chandelier above his head. It is not from the Sunnah to touch the wall or kiss it; rather...

Standing at a respectful distance, one stands and says: Peace be upon you, O Messenger of God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet of God. Peace be upon you, O Trustee of God. Peace be upon you, O Beloved of God. Peace be upon you, O Chosen One of God. Peace be upon you, O Elect of God. Peace be upon you, O Ahmad. Peace be upon you, O Muhammad. Peace be upon you, O Abu al-Qasim. Peace be upon you, O Effacer (of disbelief). Peace be upon you, O Successor. Peace be upon you, O Gatherer. Peace be upon you, O Bearer of Glad Tidings. Peace be upon you, O Warner. Peace be upon you, O Pure One. Peace be upon you, O Purified One. Peace be upon you, O Noblest of the Children of Adam. Peace be upon you, O Master of the Messengers. Peace be upon you, O Seal of the Prophets. Peace be upon you, O Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds. Peace be upon you, O Leader of Goodness. Peace be upon you, O Opener of Righteousness. Peace be upon you, O Prophet of Mercy. Peace be upon you, O Guide of the Community. Peace be upon you, O Leader of the Radiant, Marked Ones. Peace be upon you and upon your household, whom God has purified and kept away from all impurity, a thorough purification. Peace be upon you and upon your good Companions and upon your pure wives, the Mothers of the Believers. May God reward you on our behalf with the best reward He has given any prophet for his people or any messenger for his community. And may He bless you whenever the mindful remember you and whenever the heedless are heedless of you. And may He bless you in the former and the latter generations with the best, most complete, most exalted, most majestic, most excellent, and purest blessings with which He has blessed any of His creation, just as You delivered us through you from misguidance, opened our eyes through you from blindness, and guided us through you from ignorance. I bear witness that there is no god but God, alone, without partner, and I bear witness that you are His servant and His messenger, His trustee, His chosen one, and His elect from His creation. And I bear witness that you have conveyed the message, fulfilled the trust, counseled the community, striven against your enemy, guided your community, and worshiped your Lord until certainty came to you. So may God bless you and your pure household, and grant you peace, honor, nobility, and grandeur. And if one has been entrusted to convey a greeting, one says: Peace be upon you from so-and-so. Peace be upon you from so-and-so.

Then one steps back about an arm's length and greets Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, for his head is at the shoulder of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and the head of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, is at the shoulder of Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him. Then one steps back about an arm's length and greets al-Faruq 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, and says: Peace be upon you both, O two ministers of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and his helpers in upholding the religion as long as he lived, and those who undertook the affairs of the religion in his community after him, following in that his traces and acting according to his Sunnah. So may God reward you both with the best reward He has given two ministers of a prophet for his religion.

Then one returns and stands at the head of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, between the grave and the pillar today, and faces the Qiblah. Let him praise God, the Mighty and Majestic, glorify Him, and abundantly send blessings upon the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Then let him say: O God, You have said—and Your word is truth—"If only they, when they wronged themselves, had come to you and asked forgiveness of God, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found God Accepting of Repentance, Merciful." O God, we have heard Your word and obeyed Your command, and we have come to Your Prophet, seeking his intercession with You for our sins and the burdens that weigh down our backs from our misdeeds, repentant of our faults, acknowledging our errors and shortcomings. So accept our repentance, O God, and let this Prophet of Yours intercede for us, and elevate us by his station with You and his right upon You. O God, forgive the Emigrants and the Helpers, and forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith. O God, do not make this the last visit to the grave of Your Prophet and Your sanctuary, O Most Merciful of the merciful.

Then one comes to the Rawdah and prays two rak'ahs there and supplicates as much as one is able, due to his saying, peace be upon him: "What is between my grave and my pulpit is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, and my pulpit is upon my cistern." And one supplicates at the pulpit. It is recommended to place one's hand on the lower pomegranate-shaped knob upon which the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would place his hand during the sermon. It is recommended for one to go to Uhud on a Thursday and visit the graves of the martyrs. One prays the dawn prayer in the Mosque of the Prophet, peace be upon him, then goes out and returns to the mosque for the noon prayer, so as not to miss a congregational obligatory prayer in the mosque. It is recommended to go out every day to al-Baqi' after greeting the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and to visit the grave of 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him, and the grave of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, may God be pleased with them both. In it also is the grave of 'Ali ibn al-Husayn, Muhammad ibn 'Ali, and Ja'far ibn Muhammad, may God be pleased with them. And one prays in the mosque of Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, and visits the grave of Ibrahim, the son of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and the grave of Safiyyah, the aunt of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. All of that is in al-Baqi'. It is recommended for one to go to the Mosque of Quba every Saturday and pray in it, due to what is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever goes out from his house until he comes to the Mosque of Quba and prays in it, for him is the reward of an 'Umrah." And one comes to the Well of Aris—it is said the Prophet, peace be upon him, spat in it—and it is near the mosque, so one performs ablution from it and drinks from its water. And one comes to the Mosque of al-Fath, which is at the Trench, and likewise...

He visits the remaining mosques and sacred sites, and it is said that all the sacred sites and mosques in Medina number thirty places, known to the locals, so he intends those he is able to. Likewise, he intends the wells from which the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, performed ablution, bathed, and drank—they are seven wells—seeking healing and blessings through him, peace and blessings be upon him. If he is able to reside in Medina while observing its sanctity, it holds immense merit. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No one endures its hardships and difficulties except that I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection." And he said: "Whoever is able to die in Medina, let him die there, for no one dies there except that I will be an intercessor or a witness for him on the Day of Resurrection." Then, when he has completed his affairs and resolved to depart from Medina, it is recommended that he come to the noble grave and repeat the visitation supplication as before, bid farewell to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and ask God Almighty to grant him return to him and safety in his journey. Then he prays two rak'ahs in the small Rawdah, which is the place where the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood before the enclosure was added to the mosque. When leaving, he should exit with his left foot first, then the right, and say: "O God, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and do not make this the last visit to Your Prophet. Relieve my burdens through visiting him, accompany me with safety in my journey, and ease my return to my family and homeland in safety, O Most Merciful of the merciful." And he should give charity to the neighbors of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, according to his ability, and follow the mosques between Medina and Mecca, praying in them—they are twenty places.

(Chapter on the Traditions of Returning from Travel)

When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, returned from a campaign, Hajj, or Umrah, he would glorify God at the top of every elevated ground with three glorifications, saying: "There is no god but God alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent. We return repentant, worshipping, prostrating, praising our Lord. God has fulfilled His promise and supported His servant and defeated the confederates alone." In some narrations: "And everything will perish except His Face. To Him belongs the judgment, and to Him you will be returned." Thus, one should practice this tradition upon returning. When overlooking his city, he should urge his mount and say: "O God, grant us settlement therein and good provision." Then he should send someone to inform his family of his arrival so as not to come upon them suddenly, for that is the tradition. He should not arrive at his family at night. When entering the town, he should head to the mosque first and pray two rak'ahs, for that is the tradition, as the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did. When entering his home, he says: "Repentance, repentance to our Lord, a return that leaves no sin upon us." When settled in his home, he should not forget the favor God has bestowed upon him through visiting His House, His Sanctuary, and the grave of His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, such that he repays that favor by returning to heedlessness, diversion, and indulgence in sins. That is not the sign of an accepted Hajj; rather, its sign is that he returns abstinent from the world, desirous of the Hereafter, prepared to meet the Lord of the House after visiting the House.

(The Third Chapter on Subtle Etiquettes and Inner Works)
Explanation of Subtle Etiquettes, Which Are Ten

First: That the provision be lawful and the hand be free from trade that distracts the heart and divides attention, so that attention is devoted solely to God Almighty and the heart is tranquil, turned to the remembrance of God Almighty and the veneration of His rites. It has been narrated in a report from the People of the Household: "When the end of time approaches, people will go for Hajj in four categories: their rulers for leisure, their wealthy for trade, their poor for begging, and their reciters for reputation." The report alludes to the various worldly purposes that may become attached to Hajj, all of which prevent the virtue of Hajj and remove it from the realm of the Hajj of the elect, especially if it is undertaken solely for another for a fee, seeking the world through the work of the Hereafter. The pious and people of heart have disliked that, unless one's intention is to reside in Mecca and he lacks the means to reach it; then there is no harm in taking that with this intention—not to use religion to attain the world, but to use the world to attain religion. In that case, his intention should be to visit the House of God Almighty and to assist his Muslim brother by fulfilling the obligation on his behalf. In such a case, the saying of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, applies: "God Almighty admits three into Paradise through one Hajj: the one who bequeathed it, the one who executed it, and the one who performed Hajj on behalf of his brother." I do not say that the fee is impermissible or that it is forbidden after one has fulfilled the obligation of Islam upon himself, but it is preferable not to do so and not to take it as one's trade and gain, for God Almighty gives the world through religion but does not give religion through the world. In a report: "The likeness of one who fights in the cause of God Almighty and takes a fee is like the mother of Moses, peace be upon him, nursing her child and taking her fee."

Whoever's example in taking payment for Hajj resembles that of Moses' mother faces no issue in doing so, for they take it to enable the Hajj and visitation therein, not performing Hajj to take payment, but taking payment to perform Hajj, just as Moses' mother took it to facilitate nursing by concealing her situation from them. Second: not to assist the enemies of God, glorified be He, by handing over the tax, who are the obstructors from the Sacred Mosque among the rulers of Mecca and the Bedouins lying in wait on the path. For delivering wealth to them is aiding in oppression and facilitating its means for them, akin to aiding with one's very self. Thus, one should ingeniously seek a means of escape. If unable, some scholars have said—and there is no issue with their statement—that abandoning the supererogatory Hajj and turning back from the path is better than aiding the oppressors, for this is an innovation introduced, and in submitting to it lies what makes it a widespread practice, involving humiliation and degradation for Muslims by paying a tribute. There is no meaning to the claim, "That is taken from me while I am compelled," for if he had stayed at home or turned back from the path, nothing would have been taken from him. Rather, perhaps displays of luxury would become apparent, increasing the demands upon him. Had he been in the guise of the poor, he would not have been demanded; thus, he is the one who drove himself to a state of compulsion. Third: abundance in provisions and a generous spirit in giving and spending, without stinginess or extravagance, but with moderation. By extravagance, I mean indulgence in the finest foods and luxury in drinking their varieties, following the custom of the affluent. As for abundant giving, there is no extravagance in it, for there is no good in extravagance, nor extravagance in good, as it is said. Spending provisions on the Hajj journey is expenditure in the cause of God, the Mighty and Majestic, and a dirham equals seven hundred dirhams. Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said, "Part of a man's nobility is the goodness of his provisions on his journey," and he used to say, "The best pilgrim is the most sincere in intention, the purest in expenditure, and the finest in certainty." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The accepted Hajj has no reward except Paradise." It was said, "O Messenger of God, what constitutes an accepted Hajj?" He said, "Good speech and feeding food." Fourth: abandoning obscenity, immorality, and disputation, as articulated by the Qur'an. Obscenity is a comprehensive term for all idle talk, indecency, and foul speech, including flirting with women, jesting with them, and discussing intercourse and its preliminaries, for that stirs the urge for forbidden intercourse, and urging toward the forbidden is forbidden. Immorality is a comprehensive term for all deviation from obedience to God, the Mighty and Majestic. Disputation is excessive contention and argumentation that breeds grudges, disperses present resolve, and contradicts good character. Sufyan said, "Whoever engages in obscenity, his Hajj is corrupted." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, made good speech along with feeding food part of an accepted Hajj, and argumentation contradicts good speech. Thus, one should not frequently object to his companion, his camel driver, or others among his fellows. Rather, he should soften his side and lower his wing to those walking to the House of God, the Mighty and Majestic, and adhere to good character. Good character is not merely refraining from harm but enduring harm. It is said travel is called travel because it reveals the character of men. Hence, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said to one who claimed to know a man, "Have you accompanied him on a journey that demonstrates noble character?" He said, "No." He said, "I do not think you know him." Fifth: to perform Hajj on foot if able, for that is superior. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, advised his sons upon his death, saying, "O my sons, perform Hajj on foot, for the walking pilgrim receives with every step he takes seven hundred good deeds from the good deeds of the Sanctuary." It was said, "What are the good deeds of the Sanctuary?" He said, "A good deed equals one hundred thousand." The recommendation for walking in the rites and moving between Mecca, the standing place, and Mina is more emphasized than on the journey. If one adds to walking the assumption of ihram from his family's dwelling, it is said that is part of perfecting the Hajj. 'Umar, 'Ali, and Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with them, said this regarding the meaning of His word, the Mighty and Majestic, "And complete the Hajj and 'Umrah for God." Some scholars said riding is better due to the expenditure and provision involved, and because it is further from vexing the soul, less harmful, and closer to its safety and the completion of his Hajj. Upon scrutiny, this does not contradict the first; rather, it should be detailed by saying: for whom walking is easy, it is better. If he weakens and it leads to bad character and deficiency in action, then riding is better for him, just as fasting is better for the traveler and for the sick unless it leads to weakness and bad character. Some scholars were asked about 'Umrah: should one walk or hire a donkey for a dirham? He said, "If the weight of the dirham is heavier upon him, hiring is better than walking. If walking is heavier upon him, as with the wealthy, walking is better for him." Thus, he inclined toward the path of struggling against the self, and it has merit, but it is better for him to walk and spend that dirham on good, which is more worthy than spending it on the donkey driver in exchange for using the mount, if his soul does not accommodate combining both.

Between the hardship upon the soul and the diminishment of wealth, what he mentioned is not far-fetched therein. The sixth: that he should ride only a pack-animal (zāmilah), but as for the howdah (maḥmal), let him avoid it except if he fears that he will not be able to stay firmly seated upon the pack-animal due to an excuse. In this are two meanings: one is lightening the burden upon the camel, for the howdah harms it; and the second is avoiding the attire of the extravagant and the arrogant. (The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, performed Hajj upon a riding beast, and beneath him was a worn saddle and a tattered cloak worth four dirhams, and he performed the circumambulation upon the riding beast so that people could observe his guidance and characteristics.) And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Take your rites from me.) It is said that these howdahs were introduced by al-Ḥajjāj, and the scholars in his time used to denounce them. Sufyān al-Thawrī narrated from his father that he said: I set out from Kufa to al-Qādisiyyah for Hajj and I met the companions from various towns, and I saw all the pilgrims upon pack-animals, saddlebags, and riding beasts, and I did not see among all of them except two howdahs. And when Ibn ʿUmar would look at what al-Ḥajjāj had introduced in terms of attire and howdahs, he would say: The pilgrims are few and the riders are many. Then he looked at a poor man of shabby appearance with a saddlebag beneath him and said: This is an excellent pilgrim. The seventh: that he be of shabby appearance, disheveled and dust-covered, not seeking abundance of adornment nor inclining towards means of boasting and rivalry, lest he be recorded in the register of the arrogant and extravagant and depart from the party of the weak and the poor, especially the righteous. For he, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded dishevelment and concealment and forbade luxury and comfort in the ḥadīth of Fuḍālah ibn ʿUbayd. And in the ḥadīth: (The pilgrim is but the disheveled, the dusty.) And God Almighty says: Look at the visitors of My House; they have come to Me disheveled and dust-covered from every deep valley. And He Almighty says: Then let them complete their rites (tafath). And tafath is dishevelment and becoming dust-covered, and its completion is by shaving, trimming the mustache, and clipping the nails. And ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, may God be pleased with him, wrote to the commanders of the armies: Wear worn garments and adopt roughness, meaning wear old clothes and employ roughness in things. And it has been said: The adornment of the pilgrims are the people of Yemen because they are in the state of humility and weakness and the way of the predecessors. Thus, one should particularly avoid redness in his attire and avoid fame in general, however it may be. For it has been narrated: (That he, peace and blessings be upon him, was on a journey and his companions alighted at a stopping place, and the camels were sent to graze. He looked at red blankets on the saddles and said, peace and blessings be upon him: I see that this redness has overcome you. They said: So we rose to them and removed them from their backs until some of the camels bolted.) The eighth: that he be gentle with the mount and not burden it with what it cannot bear, for the howdah is beyond the limit of its capacity, and sleeping upon it harms it and weighs heavily upon it. The people of scrupulousness would not sleep upon mounts except for a brief nap while seated, and they would not stand upon them for a long time. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: (Do not take the backs of your mounts as chairs.) And it is recommended that he dismount from his mount in the morning and evening to refresh it thereby, for it is a Sunnah, and there are reports from the predecessors about it. And some of the predecessors would hire a mount on the condition that he would not dismount and would pay the fee in full, then he would dismount from it so as to be kind to the mount, so that it would be among his good deeds and placed in his scale, not in the scale of the hirer. And whoever harms an animal and burdens it with what it cannot bear will be held accountable for it on the Day of Resurrection. Abū al-Dardāʾ said to his camel at the time of death: O camel, do not dispute with me before your Lord, for I did not burden you beyond your capacity. And in sum, for every living being there is a reward, so let the right of the mount and the right of the hirer both be observed. And in his dismounting for an hour is the refreshment of the mount and the gladdening of the hirer’s heart. A man said to Ibn al-Mubārak: Carry this book with you to deliver it. He said: Until I seek permission from the camel driver, for I have hired. See how he exercises scrupulousness in carrying a book that has no weight, and it is the path of caution in scrupulousness, for if the door of the little is opened, it leads to much, little by little. The ninth: that he draw near by shedding blood (sacrificing) even if it is not obligatory upon him, and strive that it be from the fat and precious of the livestock. And let him eat from it if it is a voluntary offering, and not eat from it if it is obligatory. It is said in the interpretation of His Almighty saying: That, and whoever honors the rites of God, that it is improving it and fattening it. And driving the sacrificial animal from the miqāt is better if it does not exhaust him nor strain him. And let him avoid haggling in its purchase, for they used to be extravagant in three things and disliked haggling in them: the sacrificial animal, the udḥiyah, and the slave. For the best of that is the most expensive in price and the most precious to its owner. (And Ibn ʿUmar narrated that ʿUmar, may God be pleased with them both, offered a she-camel as a sacrifice, and it was sought from him for three hundred dinars, so he asked the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, to sell it and buy camels with its price, but he forbade him from that and said: Rather, offer it.) That is because the little that is good is better than the much that is inferior, and in three hundred dinars is the value of thirty camels, and in that is multiplication of meat, but the aim is not the meat; rather, the aim is...

Purifying the soul and cleansing it from the trait of miserliness, adorning it with the beauty of magnifying God, Mighty and Majestic, for neither their flesh nor their blood will reach God, but it is piety from you that reaches Him. This is attained by observing the preciousness in value, whether the number is great or small. (The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked: "What constitutes a righteous Hajj?" He said: "The 'ajj and the thajj.") The 'ajj is raising the voice with the talbiyah, and the thajj is the slaughtering of the sacrificial animal. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "No deed performed by a human on the Day of Sacrifice is more beloved to God, Mighty and Majestic, than the shedding of blood. Verily, it will come on the Day of Resurrection with its horns and hooves, and the blood falls with God, Mighty and Majestic, in a place before it falls upon the earth, so purify your souls with it." And in the report: "For you, for every strand of wool from its hide is a good deed, and every drop of its blood is a good deed, and verily it will be placed in the Balance, so receive glad tidings." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Seek the aid of your sacrificial animals, for they are your mounts on the Day of Resurrection."

The tenth: That one's soul be content with what he has spent in expenditure and sacrifice, and with whatever loss or affliction befalls him in wealth or body, if that befalls him. For that is among the indications of the acceptance of his Hajj, for affliction on the path of Hajj is equivalent to expenditure in the cause of God, Mighty and Majestic—a dirham being equal to seven hundred dirhams—in the manner of hardships on the path of jihad. Thus, for every harm he endures and loss he incurs, there is reward, so nothing of it is lost with God, Mighty and Majestic. And it is said that among the signs of the acceptance of Hajj is also abandoning the sins he used to commit, and that he exchanges his idle companions for righteous companions, and exchanges gatherings of amusement and heedlessness for gatherings of remembrance and wakefulness.

(Clarification of the Inner Actions and the Aspect of Sincerity in Intention, and the Path of Taking Lesson from the Noble Sites, and the Manner of Reflecting Upon Them and Remembering Their Secrets and Meanings from the Beginning of Hajj to Its End)

Know that the first of Hajj is understanding—I mean understanding the position of Hajj in the religion—then longing for it, then resolve upon it, then severing the attachments that prevent from it, then purchasing the garment of ihram, then purchasing provisions, then hiring a mount, then departing, then journeying in the wilderness, then entering into ihram from the miqat with the talbiyah, then entering Makkah, then completing the actions as previously mentioned. And in each one of these matters is a reminder for the one who remembers, a lesson for the one who takes heed, an alert for the sincere seeker, and a recognition and indication for the discerning. So we shall point to their keys, so that when its door is opened and its causes are known, there will be unveiled to every pilgrim from its secrets what is necessitated by the purity of his heart, the cleanliness of his inner self, and the abundance of his understanding.

As for understanding: Know that there is no reaching God, Glorified and Exalted, except by abstaining from desires, restraining from pleasures, limiting oneself to necessities therein, and devoting oneself exclusively to God, Glorified and Exalted, in all movements and stillness. For this reason, the monastic ones in past religious communities isolated themselves from creation and withdrew to mountain peaks, preferring solitude from creation in seeking intimacy with God, Mighty and Majestic. So they abandoned, for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic, present pleasures and imposed upon themselves strenuous strivings, hoping for the Hereafter. And God, Mighty and Majestic, praised them in His Book, saying: "That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant." When that faded and people turned to following desires and abandoned devotion to the worship of God, Mighty and Majestic, and became negligent of it, God, Mighty and Majestic, sent His Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to revive the path of the Hereafter and renew the practice of the messengers in traversing it. So the people of the religious communities asked him about monasticism and wandering in his religion. He, peace be upon him, said: "God has replaced it for us with jihad and takbir upon every elevated place," meaning Hajj. (And he, peace be upon him, was asked about the wanderers, and he said: "They are the fasting ones.") So God, Mighty and Majestic, bestowed favor upon this nation by making Hajj a monastic practice for them. Thus, He honored the Ancient House by attributing it to His own Self, Exalted, and established it as a destination for His servants, and made what surrounds it a sanctuary for His House, magnifying its affair. And He made 'Arafat like a spout upon the courtyard of His basin, and emphasized the sanctity of the place by prohibiting its game and its trees. And He placed it as an example of the court of kings, which visitors seek from every deep distant pass and from every far returning journey, disheveled, dusty, humbling themselves to the Lord of the House and submitting to Him, in humility to His majesty and submission to His might, while acknowledging His transcendence above being contained by a house or encompassed by a land, so that this may be more profound in their servitude and bondage, and more complete in their submission and compliance. And for that reason, He prescribed for them therein actions that souls find no comfort in and intellects do not discern the meanings of, such as stoning the pillars with pebbles and going back and forth between Safa and Marwah in a manner of repetition. And by such actions, the perfection of servitude and bondage becomes manifest. For zakah is a form of kindness and its rationale is understood, and the intellect inclines toward it. And fasting is breaking the desire which is the instrument of the enemy of God, and freeing oneself for worship by abstaining from distractions. And bowing and prostrating in prayer...

Prayer is humility before God, exalted and majestic, through actions that embody the posture of humility, and for the souls it brings intimacy through glorifying God, exalted and majestic. As for the comings and goings of the Sa‘y, the casting of the pebbles, and similar acts, the souls find no share, no intimacy, nor does the intellect find guidance to their meanings. Thus, the only motive for undertaking them is the sheer command and the intent to comply with the order solely because it is an obligation to be followed. Herein lies a detachment of the intellect from its own reasoning, and a diversion of the soul and natural disposition from their place of comfort. For everything whose meaning the intellect grasps, the natural inclination leans toward it to some degree, and that inclination assists the command and acts as a motive alongside it. Thereby, the perfection of servitude and submission hardly becomes fully apparent. Therefore, He—glory to Him—said specifically concerning Hajj: "At Your service for a Hajj in truth, as worship and servitude," and did not say this regarding prayer or other acts. Since the wisdom of God, blessed and exalted, necessitated linking the salvation of creation to their actions being contrary to their natural desires, and that their reins be in the hand of the Sacred Law, so they proceed in their actions according to the pattern of submission and the requirement of enslavement, that whose meanings are not grasped becomes the most profound form of worship in purifying souls and diverting them from the demands of natural disposition and character toward the demand of servitude. When you reflect upon this, you understand that the souls' astonishment at these wondrous actions stems from obliviousness to the secrets of worship. This much suffices for comprehending the foundation of Hajj, if God, exalted, wills.

As for longing: it only arises after understanding and realizing that the House is the House of God, exalted and majestic, and that it is established as a likeness to the presence of kings, so its visitor is one who visits God, exalted and majestic. And whoever intends the House in this world is worthy of not having his visit wasted, so he is granted the objective of the visit at its appointed time: gazing upon the Noble Countenance of God in the Abode of Permanence. For the limited, perishable eye in the abode of this world is not prepared to receive the vision of the Countenance of God, exalted and majestic, nor can it endure it, nor is it ready to be gladdened by it due to its limitation. But if it is granted permanence in the Hereafter and purified from causes of change and perishability, it becomes ready for vision and sight. Yet, by intending the House and gazing upon it, it earns the meeting with the Lord of the House by the decree of the Noble Promise. Thus, longing to meet God, exalted and majestic, inevitably inspires longing for the means of meeting. This, despite the lover longing for everything connected to the Beloved, and the House is attributed to God, exalted and majestic, so it is all the more fitting to long for it merely due to this attribution, let alone seeking the immense reward promised for it.

As for resolve: let him know that with his resolve he intends to depart from family and homeland, forsake passions and pleasures, and turn toward visiting the House of God, exalted and majestic. Let him magnify in himself the status of the House and the status of the Lord of the House. Let him know that he has resolved upon a matter of lofty stature and weighty import, and that whoever seeks something great risks something great. Let him make his resolve purely for the sake of God, blessed be He, far from the taints of ostentation and reputation. Let him realize that nothing is accepted from his intention and action except the sincere, and that among the gravest abominations is to intend the House of God and His Sanctuary while intending other than Him. So let him rectify his resolve with himself, and its rectification lies in his sincerity, and his sincerity in avoiding all that involves ostentation and reputation. Let him beware of exchanging what is better for what is inferior.

As for severing attachments: its meaning is to redress wrongs and repent sincerely to God, exalted, from all sins collectively. Every wrong is an attachment, and every attachment is like a present creditor clinging to his collar, calling out to him, saying: "Where are you heading? Do you intend the House of the King of Kings while you are neglectful of His command in this abode of yours, belittling and disregarding it? Or do you not feel ashamed to present yourself as a disobedient servant, so He turns you back and does not accept you? If you desire your visit to be accepted, then fulfill His commands, redress the wrongs, and repent to Him first from all sins. Sever your heart's attachment from turning toward what is behind you, so that you may turn to Him with the face of your heart, just as you turn to His House with your outward face. If you do not do this, you will gain from your journey initially only fatigue and misery, and ultimately only rejection and repulsion." Let him sever attachments to his homeland as one severed from it, and reckon that he will not return to it. Let him write his will for his children and family, for the traveler and his wealth are in peril except whom God, blessed be He, protects. Let him remember, when severing attachments for the journey of Hajj, the severing of attachments for the journey of the Hereafter, for that lies close before him. What he advances in this journey is in hope of facilitating that journey, for it is the final abode and to it is the return. He should not neglect that journey when preparing for this one.

As for provision: let him seek it from a lawful source. If he feels within himself eagerness to amass much and seek what will last the length of the journey without spoiling or changing...

If one's provisions spoil before reaching the destination, let him remember that the journey of the Hereafter is longer than this journey, and that his provision is piety, and that whatever else he supposes to be his provision will desert him at death and betray him, so it will not remain with him—like fresh food that spoils at the first stages of the journey, leaving him bewildered and needy at the time of need, with no recourse. Let him beware lest his deeds, which are his provision for the Hereafter, do not accompany him after death, but are corrupted by the taints of ostentation and the impurities of negligence.

As for the mount: when he procures it, let him thank God in his heart for God Almighty's subjugation of the beasts to carry his burdens and alleviate his hardship. And let him recall at that moment the vehicle he will ride to the abode of the Hereafter—the bier upon which he will be carried. For the matter of pilgrimage is, in one respect, analogous to the matter of the journey to the Hereafter. Let him consider: is his journey on this vehicle suitable to be a provision for him for that journey, on that mount? How near that is to him! And how can he know? Perhaps death is near, and his riding the bier may come before his riding the camel. Riding the bier is certain, while the facilitation of the journey's means is uncertain. So how can he take precautions for the uncertain means of travel, and be diligent about his provision and mount, yet neglect the matter of the certain journey?

As for purchasing the two garments of *ihram*: let him recall at that moment the shroud and being wrapped in it, for in it he will be clad. He will don the two garments of *ihram* when drawing near to the House of God Almighty, and perhaps his journey to it will not be completed, and he will meet God Almighty wrapped in the garments of the shroud, without fail. Just as he does not meet the House of God Almighty except by opposing his customs in dress and appearance, so he will not meet God Almighty after death except in an attire different from the attire of this world. And this garment is close to that garment, for it contains no stitching, as is the case with the shroud.

As for departing from his town: let him know at that moment that he has left his family and homeland, setting out for God Almighty on a journey that bears no resemblance to the journeys of this world. Let him hold in his heart: what does he desire, and where is he heading, and whom does he intend to visit? He is setting out for the King of Kings, in the company of those visitors to Him who were called and answered, were inspired with longing and yearned, were roused and arose, severed attachments, parted from creation, and turned to the House of God Almighty—whose affair is majestic, whose status is immense, whose rank is exalted—finding solace in meeting the House in anticipation of meeting the Lord of the House, until they are granted the utmost of their hopes and are blessed with the vision of their Master. Let him hold in his heart the hope of arrival and acceptance, not relying on his deeds of traveling and leaving family and wealth, but trusting in the grace of God Almighty and hoping for the fulfillment of His promise to whoever visits His House. And let him hope that if he does not reach it and death overtakes him on the way, he will meet God Almighty as one coming to Him, for He, majestic is His glory, has said: "And whoever leaves his home emigrating to God and His Messenger, and then death overtakes him, his reward has already fallen upon God."

As for entering the wilderness to the *miqat* and witnessing those rugged passes: let him recall therein what lies between departing from the world through death and the appointed time of the Day of Resurrection, and the terrors and demands between them. And let him recall, from the dread of highway robbers, the dread of the questioning by Munkar and Nakir; and from the wild beasts of the wilderness, the scorpions and worms of the grave, and what it contains of vipers and serpents; and from his separation from his family and relatives, the loneliness, distress, and solitude of the grave. And in these fears, let him provision his deeds and words for the terrors of the grave.

As for entering the state of *ihram* and the *talbiyah* from the *miqat*: let him know that its meaning is answering the call of God Almighty. Hope that you may be accepted, and fear lest it be said to you: "No *labbayk* (Here I am at Your service) for you, nor any happiness." Be suspended between hope and fear, disavowing your own power and strength, and relying on the grace and generosity of God Almighty. For the time of the *talbiyah* is the beginning of the affair, and it is a place of peril. Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah said: 'Ali ibn al-Husayn, may God be pleased with them both, performed Hajj. When he entered *ihram* and his mount stood steady, his color changed, he trembled, and a shudder seized him, and he could not make the *talbiyah*. He was asked: "Why do you not say the *talbiyah*?" He said: "I fear it will be said to me: 'No *labbayk* for you, nor any happiness.'" When he finally said the *talbiyah*, he fainted and fell from his mount. This did not cease to afflict him until he completed his Hajj. And Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari said: I was with Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, when he intended to enter *ihram*. He did not say the *talbiyah* until we had traveled a mile. Then he was overcome by a swoon. When he regained consciousness, he said: "O Ahmad, God, glorified be He, revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: 'Tell the wrongdoers of the Children of Israel to reduce their remembrance of Me, for I remember those of them who remember Me with a curse.' Woe to you, O Ahmad! It has reached me that whoever performs Hajj without being in a state of purity and then says the *talbiyah*, God Almighty says: 'No *labbayk* for you, nor any happiness, until you return what is in your hands.' So we are not safe from that being said to us." And let the one making the *talbiyah* recall, when raising his voice with the *talbiyah* at the *miqat*, his answering the call of God.

When the Almighty said, "And proclaim to the people the Hajj," and the call to creation at the blowing of the Trumpet, and their gathering from the graves, and their crowding in the plains of Resurrection, responding to the call of God, glorified be He, and divided into those brought near, those detested, those accepted, those rejected, and those wavering at the outset between fear and hope—like the pilgrim's wavering at the Miqat where they do not know whether the completion and acceptance of their Hajj will be facilitated or not. As for entering Mecca: let him then remember that he has reached the Sanctuary of God, the Exalted, in safety, and let him hope at that moment to attain safety from the punishment of God, the Mighty and Majestic, by his entry. And let him fear that he may not be worthy of nearness, so that by entering the Sanctuary he becomes disappointed and deserving of wrath. Yet let his hope in all times be predominant, for generosity is vast, the Lord is Merciful, the honor of the House is immense, the right of the visitor is observed, and the protection of the one seeking refuge and sanctuary is not forsaken. As for the eye falling upon the House: he should bring to heart at that moment the majesty of the House and imagine as if he is beholding the Lord of the House due to the intensity of his reverence for it. And hope that God, the Exalted, grants you the vision of His Noble Countenance just as He granted you the vision of His Great House. And thank God, the Exalted, for enabling you to reach this rank and joining you to the company of those who come to Him. And remember at that the pouring forth of people on the Day of Resurrection towards the direction of Paradise, all hoping to enter it, then their division into those permitted to enter and those turned away—like the division of pilgrims into those accepted and those rejected. And do not neglect to recall the affairs of the Hereafter in anything you see, for every state of the pilgrim is an indication of the states of the Hereafter. As for circumambulating the House: know that it is a prayer, so bring to your heart within it the reverence, fear, hope, and love that we detailed in the Book of Prayer. And know that by circumambulating you are resembling the angels brought near, those encircling around the Throne, circumambulating it. And do not think that the intended purpose is the circumambulation of your body around the House; rather, the intended purpose is the circumambulation of your heart with the remembrance of the Lord of the House, such that you do not begin the remembrance except from Him and do not conclude it except with Him, just as you begin the circumambulation from the House and conclude at the House. And know that the noble circumambulation is the circumambulation of the heart in the presence of Lordship, and that the House is an outward example in the visible world of that Presence which is not beheld by sight, which is the world of the unseen dominion; just as the body is an outward example in the witnessed world of the heart which is not beheld by sight, which is in the world of the unseen. And the world of the visible and the witnessed is a gateway to the world of the unseen and the dominion for whom God opens the door. To this correspondence points the allusion that the Frequented House in the heavens is opposite the Kaaba, for the angels' circumambulation of it is like mankind's circumambulation of this House. And since the rank of most of creation falls short of such circumambulation, they were commanded to resemble them as much as possible, and they were promised that "whoever resembles a people is among them." And the one capable of such circumambulation is he of whom it is said that the Kaaba visits him and circumambulates him, as some of the unveilers saw for some of the saints of God, glorified and exalted be He. As for touching the Black Stone: believe at that moment that you are pledging allegiance to God, the Mighty and Majestic, upon obedience to Him, so resolve your determination to fulfill your pledge, for whoever betrays in a pledge deserves wrath. It has been narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he said: "The Black Stone is the right hand of God, the Mighty and Majestic, on earth; He greets His creation with it as a man greets his brother." As for clinging to the coverings of the Kaaba and adhering to the Multazam: let your intention in the adherence be the seeking of nearness out of love and longing for the House and the Lord of the House, and seeking blessing through contact, and hoping for protection from the Fire in every part of your body, not merely in the House. And let your intention in clinging to the covering be importunity in seeking forgiveness and asking for safety, like a wrongdoer clinging to the garments of the one he has wronged, beseeching him for his pardon, showing him that he has no refuge from Him except with Him, and no escape except His generosity and pardon, and that he will not leave the hem of His garment except with pardon and the granting of safety for the future. As for the Sa'i between Safa and Marwah in the courtyard of the House: it resembles the servant's going back and forth in the courtyard of the king's abode, coming and going time after time, displaying sincerity in service and hoping for observation with the eye of mercy—like one who entered upon the king and left not knowing what the king will decree concerning him, acceptance or rejection, so he continues to go back and forth in the courtyard of the abode time after time, hoping for mercy the second time if he was not shown mercy the first. And let him remember during his going between Safa and Marwah his going between the two scales on the plains of Resurrection. And let him imagine Safa as the scale of good deeds and Marwah as the scale of bad deeds. And let him remember his going between the two scales, looking at which is preponderant and which is deficient, wavering between punishment and forgiveness. As for standing at Arafah: remember...

You witness the thronging of creation, the rising of voices, and the diversity of tongues, with each sect following its leaders in the comings and goings upon the sacred sites, emulating them and moving with their movement—scenes of the Resurrection and the gathering of nations with the prophets and leaders, each nation following its prophet, their hope fixed upon their intercession, their bewilderment upon that single plain between rejection and acceptance. When you remember this, then bind your heart to humble supplication and earnest entreaty to God, Mighty and Majestic, so that you may be gathered in the company of the successful, the recipients of mercy, and so that your hope for acceptance may be realized. For the standing is noble, and mercy only reaches from the Presence of Majesty to all of creation through the intermediary of those precious hearts who are the stakes of the earth. Nor is the standing devoid of a rank from the Substitutes and the Stakes, and a rank from the righteous and the possessors of hearts. So when their resolves unite, and their hearts become devoted to humble supplication and entreaty, and their hands are raised to God, the Exalted, and stretch towards their necks, and their gazes are fixed towards the heavens, gathered with a single resolve in seeking mercy—then do not think that their hope will be disappointed, their striving wasted, or that a mercy which envelops them will be withheld from them. For this reason it is said that among the greatest sins is to be present at ‘Arafat and to think that God, Exalted is He, has not forgiven him. It is as if the unification of resolves and seeking strength through the proximity of the Substitutes and the Stakes, gathered from the corners of the lands, is the secret of the Hajj and the ultimate aim of its purpose. For there is no path to drawing forth the mercy of God, the Exalted, like the unification of resolves and the cooperation of hearts in a single time upon a single plain.

As for the stoning of the pillars: intend by it compliance with the command, as a display of servitude and bondage, and a rising up for the sake of pure obedience, with no share for the intellect or the self therein. Then intend by it resemblance to Abraham, peace be upon him, when Satan—may God curse him—confronted him in that place to cast doubt upon his pilgrimage or tempt him to disobedience, so God, Mighty and Majestic, commanded him to stone him to drive him away and cut off his hope. If it occurs to you that Satan confronted him and he saw him, and that is why he stoned him, but as for me, Satan does not confront me—then know that this thought is from Satan, and that it is he who cast it into your heart to weaken your resolve in the stoning and make it seem to you an action with no benefit, resembling play, so that you would not occupy yourself with it. Therefore, drive it away from yourself with earnestness and exertion in the stoning, to spite Satan. And know that outwardly you are throwing pebbles at the pillar, but in reality you are throwing them at the face of Satan and breaking his back with them, for his nose is only rubbed in the dust through your obedience to the command of God, the Exalted and Majestic, honoring Him through the command alone, with no share for the self or intellect therein.

As for the sacrifice of the offering: know that it is drawing near to God, Exalted is He, by the ruling of obedience. So perfect the offering and hope that God will ransom with every part of it a part of you from the Fire. Thus the promise has been conveyed. So whenever the offering is larger and its parts more abundant, your ransom from the Fire is more comprehensive.

As for visiting Medina: when your sight falls upon its walls, remember that it is the city which God, Mighty and Majestic, chose for His Prophet (peace be upon him) and made the destination of his emigration; that it is his home where he established the obligations of his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, and his Sunnah, fought his enemy, and manifested his religion therein until God, Mighty and Majestic, took him; then He placed his pure earth therein, and the earth of his two viziers who upheld the truth after him (may God be pleased with them both). Then picture in your mind the places of the footsteps of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) during his comings and goings there, and that there is no place your foot treads except that it is a place of his noble footsteps. So do not place your foot upon it except with tranquility and awe, and remember his walking and his stepping in its pathways, and imagine his humility and tranquility in walking, and what God, the Exalted, deposited in his heart of tremendous knowledge and exalted remembrance, along with the remembrance of the Exalted, such that He coupled it with the remembrance of Himself, and His nullification of the deed of whoever violates its sanctity, even by raising his voice above his voice. Then remember what God, Exalted is He, bestowed upon those who attained his companionship and were blessed with seeing him and hearing his speech, and let your regret be immense for what you missed of his companionship and the companionship of his Companions (may God be pleased with them). Then remind yourself that you have missed seeing him in this world, and that your seeing him in the Hereafter is at risk, and that you may only see him with regret, and a barrier has been placed between you and his acceptance of you due to your evil deeds, as he (peace be upon him) said: "God will raise some people to me and they will say, 'O Muhammad, O Muhammad!' I will say, 'O Lord, my companions!' He will say, 'You do not know what they innovated after you.' I will say, 'Be away, be banished!'" If you violate the sanctity of his law, even in a minute detail, then do not feel secure that a barrier will be placed between you and him afterward, and keep away from his path. Yet, let your hope be great that God, Exalted is He, will not place a barrier between you and him after He has granted you faith and directed you from your homeland for the sake of visiting him, not for trade nor any worldly gain, but purely out of your love for him and your longing to look upon his traces and upon the wall of his grave, since your soul consented to travel for that reason alone, due to having missed seeing him.

How worthy you are that God the Exalted should look upon you with the eye of mercy. When you reach the mosque, remember that it is the courtyard which God, glorified and exalted, chose for His Prophet ﷺ and for the first and most excellent company of Muslims, and that the obligations of God, glorified and exalted, were first established in that courtyard, and that it gathered the best of God's creation, both living and dead. So let your hope in God, glorified and exalted, be great that He may show you mercy by your entering it. Enter it humbly, with reverence.

And how worthy this place is to summon humility from the heart of every believer, as is related from Abu Sulayman, who said: "Uways al-Qarani, may God be pleased with him, performed the pilgrimage and entered Medina. When he stood at the gate of the mosque, it was said to him, 'This is the grave of the Prophet ﷺ,' and he fell unconscious. When he revived, he said, 'Take me out, for no land is sweet to me in which Muhammad ﷺ is buried.'"

As for visiting the Messenger of God ﷺ: you should stand before him as we have described, and visit him in death as you would visit him in life. Do not approach his grave except as you would have approached his noble person were he alive, and just as you would have considered it forbidden to touch his person or kiss him, but would have stood at a distance, presenting yourself before him, so should you do. For touching and kissing shrines is the custom of the Christians and Jews.

Know that he is aware of your presence, your standing, and your visit, and that your greetings and prayers reach him. Picture his noble form in your imagination, placed in the grave before you, and hold the greatness of his station in your heart. For it has been related from him ﷺ: "God the Exalted has appointed an angel at his grave who conveys to him the greetings of peace from anyone of his community who greets him." This is for one who is not present at his grave, so what of one who has left his homeland and crossed the deserts out of longing to meet him, and is content with seeing his noble sanctuary, having missed seeing his noble countenance? And he ﷺ has said: "Whoever prays for blessings upon me once, God will pray for blessings upon him ten times." This is his reward for praying for blessings upon him with his tongue, so what of being physically present to visit him?

Then come to the pulpit of the Messenger ﷺ and imagine the Prophet ﷺ ascending the pulpit. Picture in your heart his radiant appearance as if he were upon the pulpit, with the Emigrants and the Helpers, may God be pleased with them, gathered around him, while he ﷺ exhorts them to obey God, Mighty and Majestic, in his sermon. Ask God, Mighty and Majestic, not to separate you from him on the Day of Resurrection.

This is the duty of the heart in the rites of the pilgrimage. When it has completed them all, the heart should cling to sorrow, concern, and fear, not knowing whether its pilgrimage has been accepted and it has been recorded among the company of the beloved, or its pilgrimage has been rejected and it has been joined to the company of the rejected. Let it discern this from its own state and its works. If it finds its heart has increased in turning away from the abode of delusion and turning toward the abode of intimacy with God the Exalted, and finds its works have been weighed in the balance of the Sacred Law, then let it be confident of acceptance. For God the Exalted accepts only from those He loves, and whom He loves, He takes charge of, manifests upon him the marks of His love, and restrains from him the assault of his enemy Iblis, may God curse him. If this becomes manifest upon him, it indicates acceptance. But if the matter is otherwise, then it is likely his portion from his journey will be hardship and toil—we seek refuge in God, glorified and exalted, from that.

Here ends the Book of the Secrets of the Pilgrimage. It will be followed, God the Exalted willing, by the Book of the Etiquettes of Reciting the Quran.

[8] The hadith: "The person with the greatest sin is the one who stands at 'Arafah and thinks that Allah has not forgiven him," was reported by Al-Khatib in Al-Muttafaq wal-Muftaraq, and by Abu Manshur Shahrdar ibn Shiruyah al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[9] The hadith: "One hundred and twenty mercies descend upon this House every day," was reported by Ibn Hibban in Ad-Du'afa' and Al-Bayhaqi in Ash-Shu'ab, from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a good chain. Abu Hatim said it is a rejected (munkar) hadith.

[10] The hadith: "Perform much Tawaf around the House..." was reported by Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Derive benefit from this House, for it has been destroyed twice and will be raised up a third time." Al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[11] The hadith: "Whoever performs Tawaf for seven circuits barefoot and bareheaded, it is as if he has freed a slave; and whoever performs Tawaf for seven circuits in the rain, his past sins are forgiven," I have not found it exactly like this. In At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever performs Tawaf around this House for seven circuits and completes them, it is as if he has freed a slave," are the words of At-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good (hasan).

[12] The hadith: "Whoever performs Tawaf for seven circuits barefoot and bareheaded, it is as if he has freed a slave; and whoever performs Tawaf for seven circuits in the rain, his past sins are forgiven," I have not found it exactly like this. In At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever performs Tawaf around this House for seven circuits and completes them, it is as if he has freed a slave," are the words of At-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good (hasan).

[13] The hadith: "O Allah, forgive the pilgrim and the one for whom the pilgrim seeks forgiveness," was reported by Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is authentic according to the condition of Muslim.

[14] The hadith: "Allah has promised this House that six hundred thousand will perform Hajj to it every year..." I have not found any basis for it.

[15] The hadith: "The Black Stone is a ruby from the rubies of Paradise, and on the Day of Resurrection it will be given two eyes..." was reported by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i authenticated it, from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Black Stone is from Paradise," are the words of An-Nasa'i. The remainder of the hadith was reported by At-Tirmidhi who graded it as good (hasan), and by Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim who authenticated its chain, also from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Hakim has from the narration of Anas: "The Corner (al-Rukn) and the Station (al-Maqam) are two rubies from the rubies of Paradise," and he authenticated its chain. It was also reported by An-Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

[16] The hadith that he (peace be upon him) used to kiss it often, was reported by the two (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of 'Umar, without the word "often." An-Nasa'i reported that he would kiss it three times each time if he found it uncrowded.

[17] The hadith that he used to prostrate upon it, was reported by Al-Bazzar and Al-Hakim from the narration of 'Umar, and he authenticated its chain.

[18] The hadith: "'Umar kissed it and said, 'I know that you are a stone...'" was reported by the two (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) without the addition narrated by 'Ali. Al-Hakim reported it with that addition and said it does not meet the conditions of the two Shaykhs.

[19] The hadith: "An 'Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to a Hajj with me," was reported by the two (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas without the words "with me." In Muslim it is with doubt: "It atones for a Hajj or a Hajj with me." Al-Hakim reported it with the addition without doubt.

[20] The hadith: "I am the first from whom the earth will split open, then I will come to the people of Al-Baqi' and they will be gathered with me..." was reported by At-Tirmidhi who graded it as good (hasan), and Ibn Hibban, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[21] The hadith: "When Adam completed his rites, the angels met him and said, 'May your Hajj be accepted, O Adam...'" was reported by Al-Mufaddal al-Ju'fi, and through his chain Ibn al-Jawzi in Al-'Ilal, from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, and he said it is not authentic. Al-Azraqi reported it in *Tarikh Makkah* as a statement (mawquf) of Ibn 'Abbas.

[22] The hadith: "Perform much Tawaf around this House..." was reported by Al-Bazzar, Ibn Hibban, and Al-Hakim who authenticated it, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Derive benefit from this House, for it has been destroyed twice and will be raised up a third time."

[23] The hadith: "Allah said, 'When I wish to destroy the world, I begin with My House and destroy it, then I destroy the world after it,'" has no basis.

[24] The hadith: "You are the best land of Allah and the most beloved country to Allah, and were it not that I was expelled from you, I would not have left," was reported by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i authenticated it in *Al-Kubra*, and by Ibn Majah and Ibn Hibban, from the narration of 'Abd...

[25] A prayer in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in any other, except the Sacred Mosque. Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, and Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.

[26] A hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: A prayer in the mosque of Madinah is equal to ten thousand prayers, a prayer in the Aqsa Mosque is equal to a thousand prayers, and a prayer in the Sacred Mosque is equal to one hundred thousand prayers. This is a rare narration; I have not found it in its entirety like this. Ibn Majah transmitted it from the hadith of Maimunah with a good chain regarding Bayt al-Maqdis: "Go to it and pray therein, for prayer there is like a thousand prayers elsewhere." And Ibn Majah has from the hadith of Anas: "A prayer in the Aqsa Mosque is equal to fifty thousand prayers, and a prayer in my mosque is equal to fifty thousand prayers." There is no weak narrator in its chain, but al-Dhahabi said it is rejected.

[27] A hadith: "No one endures its hardships and severity except that I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection." From the hadith of Abu Hurairah, Ibn 'Umar, and Abu Sa'id.

[28] A hadith: "Whoever is able to die in Madinah, then let him die there." The hadith was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Hasan Sahih."

[29] A hadith: "Journeys should not be undertaken except to three mosques..." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa'id.

[30] A hadith: "I had forbidden you from visiting graves, but now visit them." Transmitted by Muslim from the hadith of Buraidah ibn al-Husaib.

[31] A hadith: "The lands are the lands of Allah, and the servants are the servants of Allah. So wherever you find comfort, settle." Transmitted by Ahmad and al-Tabarani from the hadith of al-Zubair with a weak chain.

[32] A hadith: "Whoever is provided sustenance in something, let him adhere to it. And whoever has his livelihood in something, let him not leave it until it changes for him." Ibn Majah transmitted it from the hadith of Anas with the first phrase with a good chain, and from the hadith of 'A'ishah with a chain containing an unknown narrator with the wording: "When Allah provides sustenance for one of you from a source, let him not abandon it until it changes or becomes distasteful to him."

[33] A hadith: "I entrust to Allah your religion, your trust, and the final outcome of your deeds." Transmitted by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar that he would say to a man when he intended to travel: "Come near so I may bid you farewell as the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to bid us farewell."

[34] A hadith: "He, peace be upon him, would say to one who intended to travel: 'In the protection of Allah and His care, may Allah provision you with piety, forgive your sin, and direct you to goodness wherever you go.'" Al-Tabarani transmitted it in *al-Du'a* from the hadith of Anas, and it is found in al-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan, without the phrase "in the protection of Allah and His care."

[35] A hadith: "You should travel by night, for the earth is traversed at night in a way it is not traversed by day." Abu Dawud transmitted it from the hadith of Anas without the phrase "in a way it is not traversed by day." This addition is in *al-Muwatta* from the hadith of Khalid ibn Ma'dan as a *mursal* narration.

[36] A hadith: "When he slept in the early part of the night, he would lay his forearm down, and when he slept in the latter part of the night, he would prop his forearm upright and place his palm under his cheek." Transmitted by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi in *al-Shama'il* from the hadith of Abu Qatadah with a sound chain. Abu Mas'ud al-Dimashqi and al-Humaydi attributed it to Muslim, but I did not see it there.

[37] A hadith: "Two companions would take turns keeping watch. When one of them slept, the other would guard." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it via Ibn Ishaq from the hadith of Jabir in a longer narration wherein he said: The Ansari said, "Which part of the night do you prefer that I guard for you, the first or the last?" He said, "Rather, guard the first part for me." So the Muhajir lay down... The hadith is found in Abu Dawud, but it does not contain the statement of the Ansari to the Muhajirin.

[38] A hadith regarding the sight and glisten of musk on the parting of the hair of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, after assuming Ihram. Agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah, who said: "It is as if I am looking at the glisten of musk..." the hadith.

[39] A hadith: "You are not calling upon one who is deaf or absent." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa.

[40] A hadith: "When something pleased him, he would say: 'At Your service, indeed the true life is the life of the Hereafter.'" Al-Shafi'i transmitted it in *al-Musnad* from the hadith of Mujahid as a *mursal* narration with similar wording. Al-Hakim transmitted it and graded it Sahih from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, stood at 'Arafat, and when he said, 'At Your service, O Allah, at Your service,' he said, 'Indeed, the true good is the good of the Hereafter.'"

[41] The hadith of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entering from the pass of Kada' (with the 'kaaf' voweled with a *fathah*) is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, who said: "When the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entered Makkah, he would enter from the upper pass which is at al-Bat-ha'." The hadith.

[42] The hadith concerning the legislation of *ar-Raml* (brisk walking) and *al-Idtiba'* (uncovering the right shoulder) was to cut off the covetousness of the disbelievers, and that Sunnah remains. As for *ar-Raml*, it is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, who said: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his Companions arrived (in Makkah). The polytheists said, 'A people are coming to you who have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib.' So the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered them to perform *ar-Raml* for the first three circuits." The hadith. As for *al-Idtiba'*, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim narrated it and he graded it sound, from the narration of 'Umar, who said: "Why the brisk walking now, and uncovering the shoulders, when God has manifested Islam and expelled disbelief and its people? Nevertheless, we do not abandon anything we used to do during the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)."

[43] The hadith of him (peace be upon him) touching the Yemeni Corner is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, who said: "I saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), when he arrived in Makkah, would touch the Black Corner." The hadith. In both Sahih collections from his narration: "I did not see the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) touch any of the corners except the two Yemeni ones." And Muslim has from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "I did not see him touch other than the two Yemeni corners." And he has from the lengthy narration of Jabir: "...until when I came to the House with him, he touched the Corner."

[44] The hadith of him (peace be upon him) kissing it is agreed upon from the narration of 'Umar, that he kissed the Black Stone and said: "Were it not that I saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you." Al-Bukhari has from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "I saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) touch it and kiss it." And he has in *at-Tarikh* from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "When the Prophet (peace be upon him) touched the Yemeni Corner, he would kiss it."

[45] The hadith of placing the cheek upon it was reported by ad-Daraqutni from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) kissed the Yemeni Corner." The hadith. Al-Hakim said: "Its chain is sound." I (the author) say: In it is 'Abdullah ibn Muslim ibn Hurmuz, whom the majority considered weak.

[46] The hadith of az-Zuhri: "The Sunnah has passed that one prays two rak'ahs for every circuit." Al-Bukhari mentioned it as a suspended comment: "The Sunnah is best; the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not perform a circuit except that he prayed two rak'ahs." And in the two Sahih collections from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) arrived, performed seven circuits around the House, and prayed two rak'ahs behind the Station (of Ibrahim)."

[47] The hadith of him (peace be upon him) combining his circuits was narrated by Ibn Abi Hatim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) combined three circuits without prayer between them." And al-'Uqayli narrated it in *ad-Du'afa'* and Ibn Shahin in his *Amali* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, adding: "Then he prayed two rak'ahs for every circuit." In both their chains is 'Abd as-Salam ibn Abi al-Hubub, whose hadith is rejected.

[48] The hadith: "Whoever performs a circuit around the House and prays two rak'ahs, his reward is like freeing a slave." Reported by at-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*, and an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever performs a circuit around the House and prays two rak'ahs, it is like freeing a slave." The wording of Ibn Majah. And the other (narration) says: "Whoever performs a circuit around this House and completes it, it is like freeing a slave." And al-Bayhaqi has in *ash-Shu'ab*: "Whoever performs a circuit and bows for two rak'ahs, it is like freeing a slave."

[49] Muslim reported it from the narration of Jabir: "He began with as-Safa, ascended it until he saw the House." And he has from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "He came to as-Safa and ascended it until he looked down upon the House."

[50] The hadith of him (peace be upon him) having his tent pitched at Namirah was reported by Muslim from the lengthy narration of Jabir: "He ordered a tent of hair to be pitched for him at Namirah." The hadith.

[51] The transmitted supplication on the Day of 'Arafah: "There is no god but God alone, with no partner..." The hadith. At-Tirmidhi reported it from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The best supplication is the supplication on the Day of 'Arafah, and the best thing I and the prophets before me have said is: 'There is no god but God alone, with no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is over all things competent.'" And he said: "*Hasan gharib*." And he has from the narration of 'Ali, who said: "The most frequent supplication of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) on the evening of 'Arafah at the standing place was: 'O God, to You is praise like what You say, and better than what we say. For You is my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death, and to You is my return, and to You, my Lord, is my inheritance. O God, I seek refuge in You from the evil of what the wind brings.'" And he said: "Its chain is not strong." Al-Mustaghfiri reported in *ad-Da'awat* from his narration: "O 'Ali, the most frequent supplication of those before me on the Day of 'Arafah is that I say: 'There is no god but God alone, with no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is over all things competent.'"

O Allah, place light in my chest, light in my hearing, and light in my heart. O Allah, expand my chest for me and make my affair easy for me. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the whisperings of the chest, the scattering of affairs, the trial of the grave, the evil of what enters by night, the evil of what enters by day, the evil of what the winds blow, and from the evil of the calamities of time. Its chain is weak. Al-Tabarani narrated in *al-Mu'jam al-Saghir* from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, who said: Among what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, supplicated with on the eve of 'Arafah was: "O Allah, You see my place, You hear my speech, and You know my secret and my public. Nothing of my affair is hidden from You. I am the wretched, the poor..." He mentioned the hadith up to his saying: "O Best of those asked, O Best of those who give." Its chain is weak. The remainder of the supplication is from the supplication of some of the predecessors, and part of it is elevated in attribution, but it is not specifically tied to the standing at 'Arafah.

[52] The hadith of the Prophet prohibiting the galloping of horses and the overdriving of camels was reported by al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd: "Adopt tranquility and dignity, for righteousness is not in overdriving camels." Al-Hakim said: "Righteousness is not in galloping horses and camels." Al-Bukhari has from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "For righteousness is not in overdriving."

[53] The hadith "The best sacrifice is a ram" was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit, and by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Umamah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "It is *gharib* (uncommon)," and 'Afir is weak in hadith.

[54] The hadith of the sermon on the Day of Sacrifice, which is the Farewell Sermon of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Bakrah: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, delivered a sermon to us on the Day of Sacrifice." He also has from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "He addressed the people on the Day of Sacrifice." In the hadith of 'Alqamah in al-Bukhari, and Ibn Majah connected it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, stood on the Day of Sacrifice between the Jamarat during the Hajj in which he performed Hajj and said, 'Which day is this?'" The hadith includes: "Then he bade farewell to the people, and they said, 'This is the Farewell Hajj.'"

[55] The hadith of visiting the House during the nights of Mina and staying overnight in Mina was reported by Abu Dawud in *al-Marasil* from the hadith of Tawus, who said: "I bear witness that Ibn 'Abbas said: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to visit the House during the days of Mina.'" In it is 'Amr ibn Rabah, who is weak, but the *mursal* report has a sound chain. Abu Dawud has from the hadith of 'A'ishah that the Prophet, peace be upon him, stayed in Mina during the nights of the Days of Tashriq.

[56] The hadith of alighting at al-Muhassab and praying the 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha' prayers there, and taking a brief rest there, was reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Anas: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha' at al-Batha', then he took a short nap." The hadith.

[57] The hadith "The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for" was reported by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Jabir with a weak chain. Al-Daraqutni and al-Hakim in *al-Mustadrak* reported it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Hakim said: "Its chain is sound, provided it is safe from Muhammad ibn Habib al-Jalarudi." Ibn al-Qattan said: "It is safe from him, for al-Khatib said about him: 'He was truthful.'" Ibn al-Qattan said: "But the narrator from him is unknown, and he is Muhammad ibn Hisham al-Marwazi."

[58] The hadith "Whoever visits me after my death, it is as if he visited me in my life" was reported by al-Tabarani and al-Daraqutni from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.

[59] The hadith "Whoever has the means and does not come to me as a pilgrim has been uncivil to me" was reported by Ibn 'Adi, al-Daraqutni in *Ghara'ib Malik*, Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa'*, and al-Khatib in *al-Ruwat 'an Malik* from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever performs Hajj and does not visit me has been uncivil to me." Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned it in *al-Mawdu'at*. Ibn al-Najjar reported in *Tarikh al-Madinah* from the hadith of Anas: "There is no one from my community who has the means and then does not visit me but that he has no excuse."

[60] The hadith "Whoever comes to me as a visitor, having no concern but my visitation, it is a right upon Allah that I be an intercessor for him" was reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and Ibn al-Sakan authenticated it.

[61] The hadith "What is between my grave and my pulpit is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, and my pulpit is upon my cistern" is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and 'Abdullah ibn Zayd.

[62] The hadith of him, peace be upon him, placing his hand during the sermon on the pommel of the pulpit—I have not found an original source for it. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Zabalah mentioned in *Tarikh al-Madinah* that the length of the two pommels of the pulpit which he, peace be upon him, would hold with his noble hands when he sat was a span and two fingers.

[63] The hadith "Whoever leaves his house until he comes to the Mosque of Quba' and prays in it, it will be equivalent to an 'Umrah" was reported by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Sahl ibn Hunayf with a sound chain.

[64] The narration that the Prophet (peace be upon him) spat into the well of Aris—I have not found a sound basis for it. It is only reported that he spat into the well of Al-Basah and the well of Ghars, as will come when they are mentioned.

[65] The narration concerning the wells from which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed ablution, bathed, and drank, and they are seven wells. I say: They are the well of Aris, the well of Ha', the well of Rumah, the well of Ghars, the well of Buda'ah, the well of Al-Basah, and the well of As-Saqya, or Al-'Uhn, or the well of Jamal. The narration concerning the well of Aris was reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, in a narration containing: "...until he entered the well of Aris." He said: "So I sat by its door, and its door was of iron, until the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) relieved himself and performed ablution..." The narration concerning the well of Ha' is agreed upon (by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of Anas, who said: "Abu Talhah was the Ansari with the most palm trees in Medina, and the most beloved of his possessions to him was the well of Ha', and it was facing the mosque. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) would enter it and drink from its good water..." The narration concerning the well of Rumah was reported by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i from the narration of 'Uthman, who said: "I adjure you by God and Islam, do you know that when the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) arrived in Medina, there was no sweet water in it except the well of Rumah? He said: 'Who will buy the well of Rumah and place his bucket alongside the buckets of the Muslims?'..." At-Tirmidhi said: "A good (hasan) narration." In a narration of both: "Do you know that Rumah—no one drank from it except for a price—so I bought it and made it for the rich, the poor, and the wayfarer..." and he said: "Good and sound (hasan sahih)." Al-Baghawi and At-Tabarani reported from the narration of Bashir Al-Aslami, who said: "When the Emigrants arrived in Medina, they found the water disagreeable. A man from Banu Ghifar had a spring called Rumah, and he would sell a waterskin from it for a *mudd*..." The narration concerning the well of Ghars was reported by Ibn Hibban in *Ath-Thiqat* from the narration of Anas, who said: "Bring me water from the well of Ghars, for I saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) drink from it and perform ablution." And in Ibn Majah with a good chain, raised to the Prophet: "When I die, wash me with seven waterskins from my well, the well of Ghars." And we reported in *The History of Medina* by Ibn An-Najjar with a weak chain, interrupted, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed ablution from it, spat into it, and was washed from it when he passed away. The narration concerning the well of Buda'ah was reported by the authors of the *Sunan* from the narration of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, that it was said to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him): "Do you perform ablution from the well of Buda'ah?" and in a narration: "Water is drawn for you from the well of Buda'ah..." Yahya ibn Ma'in said: "Its chain is good." And At-Tirmidhi said: "Good (hasan)." And in At-Tabarani from the narration of Abu Usayd: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) spat into the well of Buda'ah." And we also reported it in the *History* of Ibn An-Najjar from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd. The narration concerning the well of Al-Basah was reported by Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to him one day and said: "Do you have any lotus leaves so I may wash my head with them, for today is Friday?" He said: "Yes." So he brought out lotus leaves for him and went out with him to Al-Basah. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) washed his head and poured the wash water from his head and the runoff from his hair into Al-Basah. In its chain is Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan ibn Zubalah, who is weak. The narration concerning the well of As-Saqya was reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of 'A'ishah, that "The Prophet (peace be upon him) would have sweet water brought for him from the houses of As-Saqya." Al-Bazzar added in his *Musnad*: "or from the well of As-Saqya." And in Ahmad from the narration of 'Ali: "We went out with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) until when we were at As-Saqya, which belonged to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: 'Bring me water for ablution.' When he performed ablution, he stood..." As for the well of Jamal, it is in the two *Sahihs* from the narration of Abu Al-Jahm: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) came towards the well of Jamal..." Al-Bukhari connected it, and Muslim cited it incompletely. It is well-known that the traces (or wells) in Medina are seven. Ad-Darimi reported from the narration of 'A'ishah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said during his illness: "Pour over me seven waterskins from various wells..." It is in Al-Bukhari without his saying "from various wells."

[66] The narration: "No one endures its hardships and its severity except that I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Resurrection"—it preceded in the previous chapter.

[67] The narration: "Whoever is able to die in Medina, let him die there"—it preceded in the previous chapter.

[68] The narration: "When the Prophet (peace be upon him) returned from a campaign, or Hajj, or 'Umrah, he would proclaim God's greatness on every elevated piece of land..." It is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. And what he added at its end in some narrations from his saying: "...and everything will perish except His Face. To Him belongs the judgment, and to Him you will be returned"—it was reported by Al-Mahamili in *Ad-Du'a* with a good chain.

[69] The narration concerning a traveler sending someone to his family to inform them of his arrival, so that he does not come upon them suddenly—I did not find in it a mention of sending. In the two *Sahihs* from the narration of Jabir: "We were with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) on a campaign. When we arrived in Medina, we went to enter. They said: 'Wait until we enter at night—if it is evening—so that the disheveled may comb their hair...'"

[70] The hadith about praying two rak'ahs in the mosque upon arrival from a journey has preceded in the section on prayer.

[71] The hadith: "At the end of time, people will go out for Hajj in four categories: their rulers for leisure, their wealthy for trade, their poor for begging, and their reciters for reputation." Al-Khatib transmitted it from the narration of Anas with an unknown chain, and it does not contain mention of the rulers. Abu 'Uthman al-Sabuni narrated it in the book "Al-Ma'iatayn," saying: "The wealthy of my community perform Hajj for leisure, their middle class for trade, their poor for begging, and their reciters for ostentation and reputation."

[72] The hadith: "Three will enter Paradise by a single Hajj: the one who bequeathed it, the one who executed it, and the one who performed it on behalf of his brother." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it from the narration of Jabir with a weak chain.

[73] The hadith: "The likeness of one who fights and takes a wage is like the mother of Moses, who nursed her child and took her wage." Ibn 'Adi transmitted it from the narration of Mu'adh and said: "Its chain is consistent but its text is rejected."

[74] The hadith: "The accepted Hajj has no reward except Paradise." It was said to him: "What constitutes an accepted Hajj?" He said: "Kind speech and feeding food." Ahmad transmitted it from the narration of Jabir with a lenient chain, and Al-Hakim transmitted it in an abbreviated form and said: "Its chain is sound."

[75] The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, performed Hajj on his mount, and beneath him was a worn-out saddlecloth and a tattered cloak worth four dirhams." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it in "Al-Shama'il" and Ibn Majah from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

[76] The hadith about his circumambulation, peace be upon him, on his mount has preceded.

[77] The hadith: "Take your rites from me." Muslim and Al-Nasa'i transmitted it, and the wording is his, from the narration of Jabir.

[78] The hadith about the command to be disheveled and inconspicuous. Al-Baghawi and Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Abi Hadrad, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Adopt roughness, be austere, wear sandals, and walk barefoot." There is discrepancy in it. Ibn 'Adi transmitted it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and both are weak.

[79] The hadith of Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd concerning the prohibition of luxury and comfort, and that the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to forbid much soft living. Ahmad has from the narration of Mu'adh: "Beware of luxury..." the hadith.

[80] The hadith: "The pilgrim is but the disheveled, unkempt one." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar and said it is rare.

[81] The hadith: "God Almighty says: 'Look at the visitors of My House; they have come disheveled, dusty, from every deep distant pass.'" Al-Hakim transmitted it and declared it sound from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, without the phrase "from every deep distant pass." Similarly, Ahmad transmitted it from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar.

[82] The hadith: "He, peace be upon him, was on a journey, and his companions dismounted at a stopping place. The camels were sent to graze. He looked at red blankets on the saddles and said: 'I see this redness has overcome you...'" the hadith. Abu Dawud transmitted it from the narration of Rafi' ibn Khadij, and in it is an unnamed man.

[83] The hadith: "Do not make the backs of your mounts like chairs." Ahmad transmitted it from the narration of Sahl ibn Mu'adh with a weak chain, and Al-Hakim transmitted it and declared it sound from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas from his father.

[84] The hadith: "Dismounting from the mount morning and evening gives it rest thereby." Al-Tabarani transmitted it in "Al-Awsat" from the narration of Anas with a sound chain: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, when he prayed Fajr on a journey, would walk." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in "Al-Adab" and said: "He walked a little while his she-camel was led."

[85] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Umar offered a she-camel as a sacrificial animal. It was sought from him for three hundred dinars, so he asked the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to sell it and buy sacrificial camels with its price. He forbade him from that and said: 'Rather, offer it.'" Abu Dawud transmitted it and said: "Sacrifice it."

[86] The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked: 'What constitutes an accepted Hajj?' He said: 'The loud vocalization and the shedding of blood.'" Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and considered it strange, as did Ibn Majah. Al-Hakim transmitted it and declared it sound, and Al-Bazzar, whose wording this is, from the narration of Abu Bakr. Al-Baqullani said: "Meaning, which Hajj is best?"

[87] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "No deed of the son of Adam on the Day of Sacrifice is more beloved to God than the shedding of blood..." the hadith. Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and Ibn Majah graded it good. Ibn Hibban weakened it. Al-Bukhari said it is interrupted, and Ibn Khuzaymah connected its chain.

[88] A hadith states: For every strand of wool from its hide, you receive a good deed, and for every drop of its blood, a good deed. Verily, it will be placed in the Scale, so receive glad tidings. Ibn Majah recorded it, and al-Bayhaqi authenticated it from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam, in a version stating: for every hair, a good deed. They asked, "What about the wool?" He said, "For every strand of wool, a good deed." In another narration by al-Bayhaqi: for every drop, a good deed. Al-Bukhari said it is not authentic. Abu al-Shaykh recorded in his book *Al-Dhahaya*, from the narration of 'Ali: "Indeed, it will be brought on the Day of Resurrection with its flesh and blood until it is placed in your scale," saying it to Fatimah.

[89] He was asked about monasticism and wandering (in devotion). He said, "Allah has replaced them for us with jihad and proclaiming 'Allahu Akbar' on every elevated place." Abu Dawud recorded it from the narration of Abu Umamah: A man said, "O Messenger of Allah, permit me to wander (in devotion)." He said, "The wandering of my community is jihad in the cause of Allah." Al-Tabarani recorded it with the wording: "Every community has a form of wandering, and the wandering of my community is jihad in the cause of Allah. Every community has a form of monasticism, and the monasticism of my community is maintaining posts in the chest of the enemy." Al-Bayhaqi recorded in *Al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Anas: "The monasticism of my community is jihad in the cause of Allah." Both are weak. Al-Tirmidhi graded it as good, and al-Nasa'i in *Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and Ibn Majah recorded from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: A man said, "O Messenger of Allah, I wish to travel, so advise me." He said, "Upon you is the fear of Allah and proclaiming 'Allahu Akbar' on every elevated place."

[90] He was asked about the wanderers (al-sa'ihun). He said, "They are the fasters." Al-Bayhaqi recorded it in *Al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and said the preserved report is from 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr, from 'Umar, as a *mursal* narration.

[91] The hadith: "At Your service for a Hajj in truth, worship, and servitude" has preceded in the chapter on Zakat.

[92] The hadith: "Whoever imitates a people is one of them" was recorded by Abu Dawud from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain.

[93] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Black Stone is the right hand of Allah on earth, with which He greets His creation" has preceded in the chapter on Knowledge from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

[94] The hadith: "For every part of the sacrificial animal, a part of the sacrificer is freed from the Fire" – I have not found an original source for it. In the book *Al-Dhahaya* by Abu al-Shaykh, from the narration of Abu Sa'id: "For you, with the first drop that falls from its blood, your previous sins are forgiven," saying it to Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, and its chain is weak.

[95] The hadith: "People will be brought forward and they will say, 'O Muhammad, O Muhammad!' I will say, 'My Lord, my companions!' He will say, 'You do not know what they innovated after you.' I will say, 'Be away, be banished!'" Agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud and Anas, among others, without the phrase "O Muhammad, O Muhammad."

[96] The hadith: "Allah has appointed an angel to his grave who conveys to him the greetings of peace from anyone of his community who sends greetings upon him." Al-Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim recorded it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with the wording: "Allah has angels who roam the earth, conveying to me the greetings of peace from my community."

[97] The hadith: "Whoever sends blessings upon me once, Allah sends blessings upon him ten times" was recorded by Muslim from the narrations of Abu Hurayrah and 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.
