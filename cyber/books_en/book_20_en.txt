The Book of the Etiquettes of Livelihood and the Morals of Prophethood
This is the tenth book of the second quarter of the customary acts, from the books of *The Revival of the Religious Sciences*.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, who created everything and perfected its creation and arrangement, and who educated His Prophet Muhammad—may God bless him and grant him peace—and perfected his education, purified his attributes and morals, then took him as His intimate friend and beloved, and granted success in emulating him to whom He willed to refine, and barred from being characterized by his morals whom He willed to ruin. And may God bless our master Muhammad, the master of the messengers, and upon his good and pure family, and grant them abundant peace.

Now then, the etiquettes of outward conduct are the title for the etiquettes of the inward states. The movements of the limbs are the fruits of thoughts, and actions are the result of morals. Etiquettes are the exudation of spiritual knowledge, and the secret recesses of the hearts are the planting grounds and sources of deeds. The lights of the innermost secrets are what shine upon outward conduct, thereby adorning it, revealing it, and replacing its repugnant and ugly aspects with beauties. Whoever's heart is not humble, his limbs will not be humble. Whoever's breast is not a niche for divine lights, the beauty of prophetic etiquettes will not flow upon his outward state.

I had resolved to conclude the quarter of customary acts in this book with a comprehensive book on the etiquettes of livelihood, lest it be burdensome for the seeker to extract them from all these books. Then I saw that every book in the quarter of customary acts had already covered a number of etiquettes, and I found it cumbersome to repeat and reiterate them, for seeking repetition is heavy, and souls are naturally disposed to dislike repetition. Therefore, I decided to confine myself in this book to mentioning the etiquettes of the Messenger of God—may God bless him and grant him peace—and his morals transmitted from him with chains of narration. I will present them collected together, section by section, with the chains omitted, so that in it may be gathered, along with all the etiquettes, a renewal and confirmation of faith through witnessing his noble morals, each single one of which testifies decisively that he is the noblest of God's creation—Exalted is He—the highest in rank, and the greatest in stature; so how about all of them combined? Then I will add to the mention of his morals a mention of his physical description, then a mention of his miracles which have been established by reports, so that this may be expressive of noble morals and traits, and may extract from the ears of those who deny his prophethood the stopper of deafness. And God, Exalted is He, is the patron of success in emulating the master of the messengers in morals, states, and all the landmarks of religion, for he is the guide of the perplexed and the answerer of the call of the distressed.

Let us mention in it, first: an exposition of how God, Exalted is He, educated him with the Quran; then an exposition of comprehensive examples of his beautiful morals; then an exposition of a collection of his etiquettes and morals; then an exposition of his speech and his laughter; then an exposition of his morals and etiquettes concerning food; then an exposition of his morals and etiquettes concerning clothing; then an exposition of his pardon despite having power; then an exposition of his overlooking what he disliked; then an exposition of his generosity and munificence; then an exposition of his courage and might; then an exposition of his humility; then an exposition of his form and physical description; then an exposition of comprehensive examples of his miracles and signs—may God bless him and grant him peace.

**An Exposition of How God, Exalted is He, Educated His Beloved and Intimate Friend Muhammad—may God bless him and grant him peace—with the Quran**

The Messenger of God—may God bless him and grant him peace—was frequent in supplication and entreaty, constantly asking God, Exalted is He, to adorn him with beautiful etiquettes and noble morals. He would say in his supplication: "O God, make my character and my creation good." *Hadith*: He would say in his supplication: "O God, make my character and my creation good." Ahmad transmitted it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud and from the narration of 'A'ishah, and their wording is: "O God, You have made my creation good, so make my character good." Their chain is sound. The narration of Ibn Mas'ud was related by Ibn Hibban. And he would say: "O God, keep me away from reprehensible morals." *Hadith*: "O God, keep me away from reprehensible morals." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and graded it as *hasan* (good), and al-Hakim graded it as *sahih* (sound)—the wording is his—from the narration of Qutbah ibn Malik. Al-Tirmidhi said: "O God, I seek refuge in You..."

So God, Exalted is He, answered his supplication, fulfilling His saying—Mighty and Majestic is He—"Call upon Me; I will respond to you." He revealed the Quran to him and educated him with it, so his character was the Quran. Sa'd ibn Hisham said: "I entered upon 'A'ishah—may God be pleased with her and her father—and asked her about the morals of the Messenger of God—may God bless him and grant him peace. She said: 'Do you not read the Quran?' I said: 'Yes.' She said: 'The character of the Messenger of God—may God bless him and grant him peace—was the Quran.'" *Hadith*: Sa'd ibn Hisham said: "I entered upon 'A'ishah and asked her about the morals of the Messenger of God—may God bless him and grant him peace. She said: 'His character was the Quran.'" Muslim related it. Al-Hakim erred in saying they did not transmit it. Indeed, the Quran educated him with verses such as His saying—Exalted is He—"Take what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant," and His saying—"Indeed, God commands justice, excellence, and giving to relatives, and forbids indecency, wrong, and oppression," and His saying—"And be patient over what befalls you; indeed, that is among the matters of resolve," and His saying—"But for one who is patient and forgives, indeed, that is among the matters of resolve," and His saying—"So pardon them and overlook; indeed, God loves the doers of good," and His saying—"Let them pardon and overlook. Do you not love..."

That God may forgive you, and His saying: "Repel evil with that which is better, then indeed the one between whom and you was enmity will become as though he were a devoted friend." And His saying: "And those who restrain anger and pardon people—and God loves the doers of good." And His saying: "Avoid much suspicion, for indeed some suspicion is sin. And do not spy, nor backbite one another." And when his incisor was broken and he was wounded on the day of Uhud, and the blood began to flow over his face while he was wiping the blood and saying: "How can a people prosper who have stained the face of their Prophet with blood while he is calling them to their Lord?" The hadith of his incisor being broken, peace and blessings be upon him, on the day of Uhud—the hadith concerning the revelation of "Not for you is the decision"—Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Anas, and Bukhari mentioned it in a suspended form. So God Most High revealed: "Not for you is the decision," as an admonition to him for that. And such admonishments in the Quran are countless, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, is the foremost intended recipient of discipline and refinement; then from him, light radiates upon all creation. For he was disciplined by the Quran, and creation was disciplined by him. And for that reason he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "I was sent to perfect noble character." The hadith "I was sent to perfect noble character" was narrated by Ahmad, al-Hakim, and al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. It has preceded in the chapter on the manners of companionship. Then he encouraged creation toward the beauties of character with what we have presented in the Book of Disciplining the Soul and Refining Character, so we shall not repeat it. Then when God Most High perfected his creation, He praised him, saying: "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." So glory be to Him, how magnificent is His affair and how perfect His favor! Then observe the vastness of His gentleness and the greatness of His grace—how He gave and then praised. For He is the One who adorned him with noble character, then attributed that to him, saying: "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, made clear to creation that God loves noble character and detests base character. The hadith "Indeed, God loves lofty character and detests base character" was narrated by al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd with a connected chain, and from the narration of Talhah ibn 'Ubayd ibn Kuraz with a broken chain, and their narrators are trustworthy. 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "How astonishing is a Muslim man whose Muslim brother comes to him with a need, yet he does not consider himself worthy of good! Even if he did not hope for reward nor fear punishment, it would still be incumbent upon him to hasten to noble character, for they are among the things that indicate the path of salvation." A man said to him: "Did you hear this from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him?" He said: "Yes, and what is better than it." When captives from Tayy were brought, a young woman among the captives stood and said: "O Muhammad, if you see fit to release me and not let the Arabs gloat over me, for I am the daughter of the chief of my people. My father used to protect the inviolable, ransom the captive, satisfy the hungry, feed food, and spread peace, and he never turned away a seeker of need. I am the daughter of Hatim al-Ta'i." He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O young woman, these are truly the qualities of the believers. Had your father been a Muslim, we would have sought mercy for him. Release her, for her father loved noble character, and God loves noble character." Abu Burdah ibn Niyar stood and said: "O Messenger of God, does God love noble character?" He said: "By the One in whose hand is my soul, none shall enter Paradise except one of good character." The hadith regarding his saying "How astonishing is a Muslim man..." and in it is raised: "When captives from Tayy were brought, a young woman among the captives stood and said: 'O Muhammad, if you see fit to release me...'" al-Tirmidhi al-Hakim narrated it in Nawadir al-Usul with a chain containing weakness. And from Mu'adh ibn Jabal from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said: "Indeed, God has adorned Islam with noble character and beautiful deeds." The hadith of Mu'adh "Islam has been adorned with noble character and beautiful deeds"—its full version—I have not found a source for it, but the following hadith of Mu'adh suffices in its place. And among these are: good companionship, gracious treatment, gentleness of manner, bestowing kindness, feeding food, spreading peace, visiting the sick Muslim whether righteous or wicked, accompanying the funeral of a Muslim, good neighborliness to whomever you neighbor whether Muslim or disbeliever, honoring the elderly Muslim, accepting food invitations and supplicating for the host, forgiveness, reconciliation between people, generosity, magnanimity, forbearance, initiating the greeting, restraining anger, pardoning people, avoiding what Islam has forbidden of amusement and falsehood, singing and musical instruments altogether, every stringed instrument, every means of idle play, overpowering others, lying, stinginess, greed, harshness, deceit, trickery, tale-bearing, sowing discord, severing kinship ties, bad character, arrogance, pride, strutting, overbearing behavior, extravagance, obscenity, vulgarity, rancor, envy, ill omens, transgression, aggression, and oppression. Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "He did not leave any beautiful exhortation except that he called us to it and commanded us with it."

He left no veil, or said no fault, or said no blemish except that he warned us and forbade us from it. The hadith of Anas: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not leave a single beautiful counsel except that he called us to it and commanded us with it. I will pause here to consider its chain of transmission, and it is authentic in reality. Sufficient from all of this is this verse: "Indeed, Allah commands justice and good conduct..." (Quran 16:90). And Mu'adh said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, advised me, saying: "O Mu'adh, I advise you to fear Allah, speak truthfully, fulfill the covenant, discharge the trust, abandon treachery, protect the neighbor, show mercy to the orphan, speak gently, offer greetings generously, perform good deeds, shorten your hopes, cling to faith, seek understanding in the Quran, love the Hereafter, be in awe of the Reckoning, lower your wing (be humble), and I forbid you from insulting a wise person, lying to a truthful one, obeying a sinner, disobeying a just leader, or corrupting the land. And I advise you to fear Allah at every stone, tree, and clod of earth, and to repent for every sin, the secret for the secret and the public for the public." The hadith: "O Mu'adh, I advise you to fear Allah and speak truthfully..." was narrated by Abu Nu'aym in *Al-Hilyah* and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Zuhd*. It has preceded in the chapter on the Etiquettes of Companionship. Thus is the manner of the servants of Allah, and He called them to noble character and beautiful etiquettes.

An exposition of a collection of his beautiful character traits, which some scholars gathered and extracted from the reports: He was, peace and blessings be upon him, the most forbearing of people. The hadith: "He was the most forbearing of people" was narrated by Abu al-Shaykh in *The Character of the Messenger of Allah*, peace and blessings be upon him, from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was among the most forbearing of people." This is a *mursal* report. Abu Hatim ibn Hibban narrated from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Salam in the story of the Islam of Zayd ibn Su'nah, one of the Jewish rabbis, and Zayd's statement to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: "O 'Umar, I recognized all the signs of prophethood in the face of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when I looked at him, except for two which I had not verified from him: that his forbearance would precede his ignorance, and that increased ignorance from others would only increase him in forbearance. Then I tested them." The hadith: "The most courageous of people" – that he was the most courageous of people is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas. "The most just of people" – the hadith: "He was the most just of people" was narrated by Al-Tirmidhi in *Al-Shama'il* from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib in the long hadith describing him, peace and blessings be upon him: "He did not fall short of the truth nor exceed it." And in it: "His expansiveness and character encompassed the people, so he became a father to them, and they became equal before him in truth." The hadith, from an unnamed narrator: "The most chaste of people – his hand never touched the hand of a woman unless he owned her as a slave, or she was under his marital bond, or she was a mahram relative to him." The hadith: "He was the most chaste of people; his hand never touched the hand of a woman unless he owned her as a slave, or she was under his marital bond, or she was a mahram relative to him" was narrated by the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "The hand of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, never touched the hand of a woman except a woman he owned." And he was the most generous of people. The hadith: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most generous of people" was narrated by Al-Tabarani in *Al-Awsat* from the hadith of Anas: "I have been favored over people with four traits: generosity, courage..." The hadith, and its narrators are trustworthy. The author of *Al-Mizan* said it is *munkar*. In the two *Sahihs* from his hadith: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most generous of people," and they both agreed upon it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas. It preceded in the chapter on Zakah: "He would not let a dinar or dirham spend the night with him. If something remained and he did not find someone to give it to, and night surprised him, he would not return to his home until he was free of it by giving it to someone in need." The hadith: "He would never let a dinar or dirham spend the night with him. If something remained and he did not find someone to give it to, and night surprised him, he would not return to his home until he was free of it by giving it to someone in need" was narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Bilal in a long hadith in which it mentions: "The owner of Fadak gifted the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, four riding animals with clothing and food upon them. Bilal sold that and paid off his debt while the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting alone in the mosque." And in it he said: "Is anything left?" I said: "Yes, two dinars." He said: "See that you relieve me of them, for I will not enter upon any of my family until you relieve me of them." No one came to us, so he spent the night in the mosque until morning and remained in the mosque the next day until late in the day when two riders came. I went with them, clothed them, and fed them. When he prayed the 'Isha' prayer, he called me and said: "What have you done with what was with you?" I said: "Allah has relieved you of it." He glorified Allah and praised Him, fearing that death would overtake him while it was with him. Then I followed him until he came to his wives." Al-Bukhari has from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn al-Harith: "I remembered while I was in prayer, and I disliked that it become evening and spend the night with us, so I ordered it to be distributed." Abu 'Ubayd has in his *Gharib* from the hadith of al-Hasan ibn Muhammad, a *mursal* report: "He would not accept wealth to stay with him nor let it spend the night. He would not take from what came to him..."

He would take from what God granted him only the provision for a year, from the simplest dates and barley he could find, and place the rest in the path of God. A hadith states: He would not take from what God gave him except the provision for a year, only from the simplest dates and barley he could find, and he would place the rest in the path of God. This is agreed upon in a similar narration from the hadith of Umar ibn al-Khattab, and it has been mentioned earlier in the chapter on Zakat. He would never be asked for anything but he gave it. A hadith states: He would never be asked for anything but he gave it. This was reported by al-Tayalisi and al-Darimi from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd, and by al-Bukhari from his hadith regarding the man who asked him for a garment. It was said to him, "You asked him for it, knowing that he never turns away a petitioner." The hadith is also in Muslim from the hadith of Anas: He was never asked for anything in Islam but he gave it. In the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Jabir: He was never asked for anything but he said 'No,' then he would return to his annual provision and give from it, to the extent that he might be in need before the year's end if nothing came to him. A hadith states: He would give from what he stored for his family until he might be in need before the year's end. This is well-known, and it is indicated by what al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah reported from the hadith of Ibn Abbas: The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed away while his armor was pawned for twenty sa' of food he took for his family. Ibn Majah said: for thirty sa' of barley, and its chain is sound. Al-Bukhari reported from the hadith of Aisha: He passed away and his armor was pawned with a Jew for thirty (sa'). In a narration of al-Bayhaqi: for thirty sa' of barley. He would mend sandals, patch garments, and help with the chores of his household. A hadith states: The Prophet, peace be upon him, would mend sandals, patch garments, and help with the chores of his household. This was reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Aisha: He would mend his sandal, sew his garment, and work in his house as any one of you works in his house, and its narrators are narrators of Sahih. Abu al-Shaykh reported it with the wording: and patch the garment. Al-Bukhari reported from the hadith of Aisha: He would be engaged in the chores of his family and cut meat with them. A hadith states: He would cut meat. This was reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Aisha: The family of Abu Bakr sent us a leg of mutton at night, so I held it and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, cut it—or she said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, held it and I cut. In the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr in the course of a hadith: By God, from the one hundred and thirty, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, cut for him from the dark part of its belly. He was the most modest of people, never fixing his gaze on anyone's face. A hadith states: He was the most modest of people, never fixing his gaze on anyone's face. This was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was more modest than a virgin in her seclusion. He would accept the invitation of a slave and a free man. A hadith states: He would accept the invitation of a slave and a free man. This was reported by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim from the hadith of Anas: He would accept the invitation of a slave. Al-Hakim said: Its chain is sound. I say: Rather, it is weak. Al-Daraqutni reported it in the rare narrations of Malik and deemed it weak, and al-Khatib in the names of those who narrated from Malik from the hadith of Abu Hurayra: He would accept the invitation of a slave to any food he was invited to, and he would say: If I were invited to a trotter, I would accept. This, in its generality, indicates accepting the invitation of a free man. This last segment is in al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayra, and it has been mentioned earlier. Ibn Sa'd reported from the narration of Hamzah ibn Abdullah ibn Utbah: No one, red or black among the people, would invite him but he would accept. The hadith is mursal. He would accept a gift, even if it were a sip of milk or a rabbit's thigh, and he would reciprocate for it. A hadith states: He would accept a gift, even if it were a sip of milk or a rabbit's thigh, and he would reciprocate for it. This was reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Aisha, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would accept a gift and give something in return. As for the mention of a sip of milk and a rabbit's thigh, it is in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Umm al-Fadl: She sent a cup of milk to the Prophet, peace be upon him, while he was standing at Arafat, and he drank it. Ahmad reported from the hadith of Aisha: Umm Salamah gifted the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, some milk. The hadith is also in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Anas: Abu Talhah sent a haunch of rabbit or its thigh to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he accepted it. He would eat it, but he would not eat charity. A hadith states: He would eat a gift but would not eat charity. This is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayra, and it has been mentioned earlier. He would not be too proud to respond to a slave woman or a poor person. A hadith states: He would not be too proud to walk with a poor man. This was reported by al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa with a sound chain, and it has been mentioned earlier in the second chapter of the Etiquette of Companionship. Al-Hakim also reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri and said: It is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. He would become angry for his Lord's sake, but not for his own sake. A hadith states: He would become angry for his Lord's sake, but not for his own sake. This was reported by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Hala, and in it: And worldly matters would not anger him.

And among His attributes, when justice is transgressed, nothing can withstand His wrath until He exacts retribution for it—yet He does not become angry for Himself, nor does He seek vengeance for His own sake. Within Him is one who is not named, and He executes justice even if that results in harm to Himself or to His companions. He was offered the opportunity to seek victory through polytheists against polytheists while He was in a state of fewness and in need of even a single person to increase the number of those with Him, but He refused and said, “I do not seek victory through a polytheist.” This is narrated by Muslim from the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, set out, and when he reached Ḥarrat al-Wabrah, a man caught up with him who was known for his boldness and prowess. The companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, rejoiced when they saw him. When he caught up, he said, “I have come to follow you and gain with you.” He said to him, “Do you believe in God and His Messenger?” The man said, “No.” He said, “Then go back, for I will not seek the aid of a polytheist.” This ḥadīth is found among the accounts of his noble and chosen companions: a slain man was found among the Jews, yet he did not treat them harshly nor go beyond the bounds of justice; rather, he paid blood-money for him with one hundred camels, even though his companions were in need of a single camel to strengthen themselves. This ḥadīth is agreed upon from the narration of Sahl ibn Abī Ḥathmah and Rāfiʿ ibn Khadīj. The man found slain was ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sahl al-Anṣārī, who would tie a stone to his stomach out of hunger. This ḥadīth is agreed upon from the narration of Jābir in the story of digging the trench, in which it states that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, tied a stone to his stomach. Ibn Ḥibbān took an uncommon view and said in his Ṣaḥīḥ that it was “al-ḥujuz” with a ḍammah on the ḥāʾ and a zāʾ at the end, meaning a collection of belts, but he is not supported in this. This is contradicted by what al-Tirmidhī narrated from the ḥadīth of Abī Ṭalḥah: “We complained to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, of hunger and we showed him stone upon stone from our bellies, so the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, showed two stones.” All its narrators are trustworthy. At times, he would eat what was present and not refuse what he found, nor would he abstain from lawful food. If he found dates without bread, he ate them. This ḥadīth states that he would eat what was present and not refuse what he found, nor would he abstain from lawful food. If he found dates without bread, he ate them; if he found bread of wheat or barley, he ate it; if he found something sweet or honey, he ate it; if he found milk without bread, he contented himself with it; if he found melon or fresh dates, he ate them. All of this is well-known from his character. In al-Tirmidhī from the ḥadīth of Umm Hānī: “The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon me and said, ‘Do you have anything?’ I said, ‘No, except dry bread and vinegar.’ He said, ‘Bring it.’” Al-Tirmidhī said the ḥadīth is ḥasan gharīb. In the book al-Shamāʾil of Abī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḍaḥḥāk ibn al-Maqrī from the narration of al-Awzāʿī, he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “I do not care with what I repel hunger.” This is muʿḍal. Muslim narrates from the ḥadīth of Jābir that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked his family for condiment, and they said, “We have nothing but vinegar,” so he called for it. Muslim also narrates from the ḥadīth of Anas: “I saw him squatting and eating dates.” Al-Tirmidhī authenticated it from the ḥadīth of Umm Salamah that she brought him roasted meat, and he ate from it. The two Shaykhs narrate from the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: “The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not eat his fill of wheat bread for three consecutive days until he passed away.” In another narration of his: “He did not eat his fill of barley bread for two consecutive days.” Al-Tirmidhī authenticated it, and Ibn Mājah from the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās: “Most of their bread was barley.” The two Shaykhs narrate from the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: “He loved sweets and honey.” Both narrate from the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, drank milk and then called for water to rinse his mouth. Al-Nasāʾī from the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: “He would eat fresh dates with melon,” and its chain is sound. If he found roasted meat, he ate it; if he found bread of wheat or barley, he ate it; if he found something sweet or honey, he ate it; if he found milk without bread, he contented himself with it; if he found melon or fresh dates, he ate them. He would not eat while reclining. The ḥadīth that he would not eat while reclining has preceded in the manners of eating from the first chapter. Nor would he eat on a dining cloth. The ḥadīth that he would not eat on a dining cloth has preceded in the mentioned chapter. His napkin was the sole of his foot. The ḥadīth that his napkin was the sole of his foot is not known to me from his actions; what is well-known regarding it is what Ibn Mājah narrated from the ḥadīth of Jābir: “During the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, we rarely found food, and when we found it, we had no napkins except our palms and forearms.” This has preceded in the chapter on purification. He did not eat his fill of wheat bread for three consecutive days. The ḥadīth that he did not eat his fill of wheat bread for three consecutive days until he met God has preceded among the collection of ḥadīths.

He met Allah Almighty three hadiths prior, preferring others over himself—neither out of poverty nor stinginess. He would accept wedding feast invitations—a known practice—and his saying, "If invited to a sheep's trotter, I would accept," has been mentioned. In Al-Awsat by Al-Tabarani, from Ibn Abbas: A man from the people of Al-Awali would invite the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, at midnight for barley bread, and he would accept—though its chain is weak. He would visit the sick—a hadith states he visited the sick and attended funerals, reported by Al-Tirmidhi and weakened by Ibn Majah and Al-Hakim, but authenticated from Anas's narration; Al-Hakim also reported it from Sahl ibn Hanif, calling its chain sound. In the two Sahihs are several hadiths about his visiting the sick and attending funerals. He would attend funerals and walk alone among his enemies without a guard—a hadith states he walked alone among his enemies without a guard, reported by Al-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim from Aisha: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to be guarded until this verse was revealed: 'And Allah will protect you from the people.' Then he showed his head from the tent and said, 'Depart, for Allah has protected me.'" Al-Tirmidhi called it rare, and Al-Hakim said its chain is sound. He was the most humble of people and the most serene without arrogance—a hadith states he was the most humble of people and the most serene without arrogance, reported by Abu Al-Hasan ibn Al-Dahhak in Al-Shama'il from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri in his description, peace be upon him: "Gentle in expense, soft in nature, noble in disposition, beautiful in companionship, cheerful in face... humble without humiliation," with a weak chain. The authentic hadiths indicating his profound humility suffice, such as in Al-Nasa'i from Ibn Abi Awfa: "He did not disdain or act arrogantly to walk with a widow or a poor person"—already mentioned—and in Abu Dawud from Al-Bara': "He sat and we sat as if birds were on our heads." In the Sunan compilers from Usamah ibn Sharik: "I came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his companions were as if birds were on their heads." He was the most eloquent without prolixity—a hadith states he was the most eloquent of people without prolixity, reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Aisha: "He would narrate a hadith that if counted, one could enumerate it." In both from her: "He did not narrate hadiths in rapid succession as you do." Al-Bukhari mentioned it briefly, and Muslim connected it. Al-Tirmidhi added: "But he spoke with clear, distinct speech that those sitting with him would memorize." In Al-Shama'il from Ibn Abi Halah: "He spoke with concise words, distinct without excess or deficiency." He had the best countenance—a hadith states he had the best countenance, reported by Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Shama'il from Ali ibn Abi Talib: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was always cheerful, easy in nature." In Al-Jami' from Abdullah ibn Al-Harith ibn Juz': "I never saw anyone smile more than the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him," called rare. I say: It contains Ibn Lahi'ah. Nothing of worldly matters alarmed him—a hadith states nothing of worldly matters alarmed him, reported by Ahmad from Aisha: "Nothing of the world amazed the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and no one amazed him except a person of piety." In another wording: "Nothing of the world amazed the Prophet, peace be upon him, except if it contained a person of piety." It contains Ibn Lahi'ah. He wore what he found—sometimes a cloak, sometimes a Yemeni striped garment, sometimes a woolen robe—whatever permissible clothing he found. A hadith states he wore what he found—sometimes a cloak, sometimes a striped garment, sometimes a woolen robe—whatever permissible clothing he found, reported by Al-Bukhari from Sahl ibn Sa'd: "A woman brought a burdah." Sahl said, "Do you know what a burdah is? It is a cloak with woven edges." In it: "He came out to us, and it was his waist-wrapper." In Ibn Majah from Ubadah ibn Al-Samit: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prayed in a cloak tied with a knot." It contains Al-Ahwas ibn Hakim, disputed. In the two Sheikhs from Anas: "The most beloved garment to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, to wear was the striped garment." In both from Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah: "He wore a woolen robe." His ring was silver—agreed upon from Anas: "He took a silver ring, wearing it on his right little finger." A hadith on wearing the ring on his right little finger, reported by Muslim from Anas: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, wore a silver ring on his right hand." In Al-Bukhari from him: "I still see its shine on his little finger." The left—a hadith on wearing it on the left, reported by Muslim from Anas: "The Prophet's ring, peace be upon him, was on this," pointing to the little finger of his left hand. He would seat his servant or another behind him—a hadith on seating his servant or another behind him: "He seated Usamah ibn Zaid behind him from Arafah," as established in the two Sahihs from Ibn Abbas and others.

The hadith of Usama, and he seated him behind him again on a donkey, and it is also in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Usama, who was his freed slave and the son of his freed slave. And he seated al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas behind him from al-Muzdalifah, and it is also in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Usama and from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas and al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas. And he seated Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Ibn 'Umar, and others among the Companions behind him. He would ride whatever was available: sometimes a horse, sometimes a camel, sometimes a white mule, sometimes a donkey, and sometimes he would walk on foot, barefoot, without a cloak, turban, or cap, visiting the sick in the farthest parts of Medina. The hadith states he would ride whatever was available: sometimes a horse, sometimes a camel, sometimes a white mule, sometimes a donkey, and sometimes on foot, sometimes barefoot, without a cloak, turban, or cap, visiting the sick in the farthest parts of Medina. Thus, in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Anas is his riding, peace be upon him, a horse belonging to Abu Talhah; and in Muslim from the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah is his riding a horse bareback when returning from the funeral of Ibn al-Dahdah; and in Muslim from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd, the Prophet, peace be upon him, had a horse called al-Lahif; and in both from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, the Prophet, peace be upon him, performed the Tawaf during the Farewell Pilgrimage on a camel; and in both from the hadith of al-Bara', "I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, on his white mule on the day of Hunayn"; and in both from the hadith of Usama that he, peace be upon him, rode on a donkey with a packsaddle"; and in both from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, "He would come to Quba riding and walking"; and in Muslim from his hadith concerning his visit, peace be upon him, to Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah, "He stood up and we stood with him, and we were about ten, wearing no sandals, no boots, no caps, and no shirts, walking on the muddy ground." He loved pleasant scents and disliked foul odors. The hadith states he loved perfume and pleasant scents and disliked foul odors, narrated by al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Anas, "I was made to love women and perfume"; and Abu Dawud and al-Hakim from the hadith of 'A'ishah that she made for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, a woolen cloak, and he wore it, but when he perspired he noticed the smell of the wool and removed it, and he liked pleasant fragrances—the wording is al-Hakim's, who said it is sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs; and Ibn 'Adi from the hadith of 'A'ishah, "He disliked that anything but a pleasant fragrance be noticed from him." And he would sit with the poor. The hadith states he would sit with the poor, narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, "I was sitting in a group of poor Emigrants, and some of them would cover the nakedness of others..." and in it, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sat among us so that he would be equal with us"; and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Khabbab, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would sit with us..." concerning the revelation of the verse, 'And do not turn away those who call upon their Lord...' Their chains are hasan. And he would eat with the needy. The hadith of his eating with the needy is narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah who said, "And the People of the Suffah were the guests of Islam; they had no family or wealth to turn to. When charity came to him, he would send it to them and not take any of it; and when a gift came to him, he would send for them and take a portion and share it with them." And he would honor people of virtue for their character and win over people of nobility by being good to them. The hadith states he would honor people of virtue for their character and win over people of nobility by being good to them, narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the long hadith of 'Ali concerning his description, peace be upon him, "And it was from his conduct to prefer people of virtue with his permission and his distribution according to their rank in religion," and in it, "And he would win them over, not repel them, and honor the noble of every tribe and appoint him over them." And al-Tabarani from the hadith of Jarir concerning the story of his Islam, "Then he threw his cloak to me, then turned to his companions and said, 'When a noble person from a people comes to you, honor him.'" Its chain is good, and al-Hakim narrated it from the hadith of Ma'bad ibn Khalid al-Ansari from his father similarly and said its chain is sahih. And he would maintain ties with his relatives without preferring them over those who were better than them. The hadith states he would maintain ties with his relatives without preferring them over those who were better than them, narrated by al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, "He would honor al-'Abbas with the honor due to a father and mother"; and he has from the hadith of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas that he expelled his uncle al-'Abbas and others from the mosque, so al-'Abbas said to him, 'You expel us, and we are your kin and your uncles, and you let 'Ali stay?' He said, 'It is not I who expel you and let him stay, but God expelled you and let him stay.'" He said concerning the first, "Its chain is sahih," and was silent about the second, and in it is Muslim al-Mula'i, who is weak. So he preferred 'Ali for his virtue due to his precedence in Islam and his presence at Badr, and God knows best. And in the two Sahih collections from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, "Let no door remain in the mosque except that it be closed, except the door of Abu Bakr." He would not be harsh with anyone. The hadith states he would not be harsh with anyone, narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il, and al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah from the hadith of Anas, "He would rarely confront a man with something he disliked."

A man sought permission to enter upon the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he said, “What a poor member of the clan.” But when the man entered, he softened his speech for him. He accepts the excuse of the one who offers an excuse to him—a hadith agreed upon from the narration of Ka‘b ibn Mālik concerning the story of the three who stayed behind, in which the laggards began offering their excuses to him, and he accepted their public excuses. He jokes but says nothing but the truth—a hadith reported by Aḥmad from the narration of Abū Hurayrah, and in the version of al-Tirmidhī: They said, “You jest with us.” He said, “Yes, but I say nothing but the truth,” and he graded it ḥasan. He laughs without loud guffawing—a hadith reported by the two Shaykhs from the narration of ‘Ā’ishah: “I never saw the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) laughing fully so that I could see his uvula; he would only smile.” And al-Tirmidhī from the narration of ‘Abd Allāh ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Juz’: “The laughter of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was nothing but a smile,” he said: ṣaḥīḥ gharīb. And in al-Shamā’il from the narration of Hind ibn Abī Hālah: “Most of his laughter was a smile.” He sees permissible play and does not disapprove of it—a hadith reported by the two Shaykhs from the narration of ‘Ā’ishah concerning the Abyssinians playing before him in the mosque, and he said to them, “Carry on, O sons of Arfadah,” and it has preceded in the Book of Listening. He races with his family—a hadith reported by Abū Dāwūd, al-Nasā’ī in al-Kubrā, and Ibn Mājah from the narration of ‘Ā’ishah concerning his racing with her, and it has preceded in the third chapter of Marriage. Voices are raised before him, and he is patient—a hadith reported by al-Bukhārī from the narration of ‘Abd Allāh ibn al-Zubayr: A delegation from Banū Tamīm came to the Prophet (peace be upon him), so Abū Bakr said, “Appoint al-Qa‘qā‘ ibn Ma‘bad,” and ‘Umar said, “Rather, appoint al-Aqra‘ ibn Ḥābis.” So Abū Bakr said, “You only intended to oppose me,” and ‘Umar said, “I did not intend to oppose you,” and they argued until their voices were raised, and then was revealed: “O you who believe, do not put yourselves forward before God and His Messenger.” He had milch camels and sheep from whose milk he and his family would sustain themselves—a hadith reported by Muḥammad ibn Sa‘d in al-Ṭabaqāt from the narration of Umm Salamah: “Our sustenance with the Prophet (peace be upon him) was milk,” or she said, “Most of our sustenance.” The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) had milch camels at al-Ghābah—the hadith—and in another narration of his: “We had seven goats, and the shepherd would take them sometimes to al-Ḥamā and sometimes to Uḥud, and bring them back to us in the evening. And he had milch camels at Dhū al-Ḥabl, and their milk would come to us at night”—the hadith—and in the chains of both is Muḥammad ibn ‘Umar al-Wāqidī, who is weak in hadith. And in the two Ṣaḥīḥs from the narration of Salamah ibn al-Akwa‘: “The milch camels of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) used to graze at Dhū Qarad”—the hadith. And for Abū Dāwūd from the narration of Laqīṭ ibn Ṣabrah: “We have a hundred sheep, and we do not wish them to increase; when the shepherd’s ewe gives birth to a lamb, we slaughter a sheep in its place”—the hadith. He had male and female servants, and he did not elevate himself above them in food or clothing—a hadith reported by Muḥammad ibn Sa‘d in al-Ṭabaqāt from the narration of Salmā, who said: “The servants of the Prophet (peace be upon him) were me, Khuḍrah, Ruḍwā, and Maymūnah bint Sa‘d; he freed all of them,” and its chain is weak. And it is also narrated that Abū Bakr ibn Ḥazm wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz with the names of the servants of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), and he mentioned Barakah Umm Ayman, Zayd ibn Ḥārithah, Abū Kabshah, Anasah, Shuqrān, Safīnah, Thawbān, Rabāḥ, Yasār, Abū Rāfi‘, and I am Muwayhimah, and Rāfi‘; he freed all of them, and Fuḍālah, Mud‘am, and Karkarah. And Abū Bakr ibn al-Ḍaḥḥāk narrated in al-Shamā’il from the narration of Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī with a weak chain: “He (peace be upon him) would eat with his servant.” And Muslim from the narration of Abū al-Yusr: “Feed them from what you eat and clothe them from what you wear”—the hadith. No time passes for him except in an act for God Almighty or in what is necessary for the betterment of his own self—a hadith reported by al-Tirmidhī in al-Shamā’il from the narration of ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib: “When he retired to his home, he divided his entry into three parts: a part for God, a part for his family, and a part for himself, then he divided his part between himself and the people.” He extends that from the specific to the general—the hadith. He goes out to the gardens of his companions—a hadith that has preceded in the third chapter of the Etiquettes of Eating: his going out (peace be upon him) to the garden of Abū al-Haytham ibn al-Tayyihān and Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī and others. He does not despise a poor person for his poverty and wretchedness, nor does he stand in awe of a king for his kingship; he calls both this one and that to God with an equal call—a hadith.

Let no one despise a poor man for his poverty and lowliness, nor fear a king for his kingship. He calls both this one and that to God with a single call. Al-Bukhari narrated from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd: A man passed by the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he said, "What do you say about this man?" They said, "He is worthy; if he proposes marriage, he should not be refused." Then a man from the poor Muslims passed by, and he said, "What do you say about this man?" They said, "He is worthy; if he proposes marriage, he should not be refused." In it is: "This one is better than the earth filled with the likes of that one." And Muslim from the hadith of Anas: The Prophet, peace be upon him, wrote to Khosrau, Caesar, and the Negus, and to every tyrant, calling them to God, the Mighty and Majestic. God Almighty had gathered for him the virtuous character and perfect governance, while he was unlettered, neither reading nor writing. He grew up in the land of ignorance and deserts, in poverty, and in tending sheep, an orphan with neither father nor mother. Yet God taught him all the beauties of character, the praiseworthy ways, the stories of the former and later peoples, and that in which lies salvation and triumph in the Hereafter, and bliss and deliverance in this world, and adherence to the obligatory and abandonment of the superfluous. This is all well-known and established. Al-Tirmidhi narrated in Al-Shama'il from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib in his long hadith concerning his description, and among his conduct with his community was preferring the people of virtue with his permission and his division. In it: "I asked him about his conduct with his companions, and he said, 'He was constantly cheerful, easy in disposition, gentle in manner.'" In it: "He restrained his tongue except concerning what mattered to him." In it: "He had refrained from three things: argumentation, excess, and what did not concern him." Some of this has preceded. Ibn Mardawayh narrated from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas concerning His saying, "You did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand" [Qur'an 29:48]. He said: "The Prophet of God, peace be upon him, was unlettered, neither reading nor writing." This has preceded in the chapter on knowledge. Al-Bukhari has from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: He said, "If you wish to know the ignorance of the Arabs, read what is above one hundred and thirty in Surah Al-An'am: 'Lost indeed are they who have killed their children in folly, without knowledge'" [Qur'an 6:140]. Ahmad and Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Umm Salamah in the story of the Abyssinian migration, that Ja'far said to the Negus, "O King, we were a people of ignorance, worshiping idols and eating carrion..." Ahmad from the hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b: "I was in the desert at the age of ten years and some months, when I heard speech above my head..." Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "I used to tend them," meaning the sheep, "for a few qirats for the people of Mecca." Abu Ya'la and Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Halimah: "We only hoped for the honor of nursing from the child's parent, and he was an orphan..." The hadith "I was sent to perfect noble character" has preceded. May God grant us success in obeying Him in His command and in emulating His Prophet in his action. Amen, O Lord of the worlds.

Explanation of another set of his manners and character, from what Abu al-Bahtari narrated: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, never reviled any of the believers with a revilement except that he made it an expiation and a mercy." The hadith: "He never reviled any of the believers except that God made it an expiation and a mercy," agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in the course of a hadith in which is: "Whichever believer I curse, revile, or whip, make it for him a prayer, charity, and a means of nearness." In one narration: "Make it charity and mercy." In another: "Make it an expiation and a means of nearness." In another: "Make that an expiation for him on the Day of Resurrection." And he never cursed a woman or a servant with a curse. The well-known hadith: "He never cursed a woman or a servant." It is agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah. Al-Bukhari has from the hadith of Anas: "He was not foul-mouthed nor a curser." The hadith which follows will contain this meaning. It was said to him while in battle, "If only you would curse them, O Messenger of God." He said, "I was only sent as a mercy, and I was not sent as a curser." The hadith: "I was only sent as a mercy, and I was not sent as a curser," was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. And when he was asked to invoke against anyone, Muslim or disbeliever, general or specific, he would turn from invoking against him to invoking for him. The hadith: "When he was asked to invoke against anyone, Muslim or disbeliever, general or specific, he would turn from invoking against him and invoke for him," was narrated by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. They said, "O Messenger of God, the tribe of Daws has disbelieved and refused, so invoke against them." It was said, "Daws is destroyed." He said, "O God, guide Daws and bring them." And he never struck anyone with his hand ever, except that he would strike with it in the cause of God, the Exalted. And he never took revenge for anything done to him personally, except that...

He would never violate the sanctity of God. Whenever he was presented with two choices, he would always choose the easier one, unless it involved sin or severing family ties, in which case he would be the farthest from it. It is reported that he never struck anyone with his hand except in the cause of God, nor did he seek revenge for anything done to him, unless the sanctity of God was violated. This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Aisha, with some variations, and it has been mentioned earlier in the third chapter on the Etiquettes of Companionship.

Whenever anyone—whether free, a male slave, or a female slave—came to him with a need, he would rise to assist them. It is reported that whenever anyone—free, a male slave, or a female slave—came to him, he would rise to assist them in their need. Al-Bukhari cited it discontinuously from the narration of Anas: "Indeed, a female slave from among the slave-girls of Medina would take the hand of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and lead him wherever she wished." Ibn Majah connected it, adding: "And he would not withdraw his hand from hers until she had taken him wherever she wished in Medina for her need." This has been mentioned earlier. It is also previously mentioned from the narration of Ibn Abi Awfa that he would not disdain or be too proud to walk with a widow or a poor person to fulfill their need for them.

Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "By the One who sent him with the truth, he never said to me regarding anything I did that he disliked, 'Why did you do that?' nor did his wives reproach me except that he would say, 'Leave him, for this was only by decree and destiny.'" It is reported from Anas: "By the One who sent him with the truth, he never said regarding anything he disliked, 'Why did you do that?' nor did anyone from his household reproach me except that he would say, 'Leave him, for this was only by decree and destiny.'" The two Sheikhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) reported it from Anas: "He never said about something I did, 'Why did you do it?' nor about something I omitted, 'Why did you omit it?'" Abu al-Sheikh reported in his book "The Morals of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him," from his narration: "And he never commanded me to do something wherein I was sluggish, then reproached me for it. If anyone from his household reproached me, he would say, 'Leave him, for if anything was decreed, it would have happened.'" In another narration of his: "Thus it was decreed." They said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, never found fault with a resting place; if they spread something for him, he would lie down, and if they did not spread anything for him, he would lie down on the ground." It is reported: "He never found fault with a resting place; if they spread something for him, he would lie down, and if they did not spread anything for him, he would lie down on the ground." I have not found it with this exact wording, but the well-known report is: "He never found fault with food." This is understood from the general narration of Ali ibn Abi Talib: "He was not harsh..." until he said: "...nor fault-finding." Al-Tirmidhi reported it in "Al-Shama'il," as did Al-Tabarani and Abu Nu'aym in "Dala'il al-Nubuwwah." Ibn Abi 'Asim reported in "Kitab al-Sunnah" from the narration of Anas: "I do not know him to have ever found fault with anything." In the two Sahih collections, from the narration of Umar: "He lay down on a mat." Al-Tirmidhi authenticated it from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud: "He slept on a mat and arose with its marks on his side."

God described him in the Torah before He sent him, in the first line: "Muhammad is the Messenger of God, My chosen servant; he is neither harsh nor rough, nor loud in the markets. He does not repay evil with evil, but forgives and pardons. His birthplace is Mecca, his migration is to Taybah (Medina), and his kingdom is in Syria. He girds himself at his waist, he and those with him, callers to the Quran and knowledge. He performs ablution on his extremities." Such was his description in the Gospel.

Among his character traits was that he would initiate the greeting of peace to whomever he met. It is reported: "Among his character traits was that he would initiate the greeting of peace to whomever he met." Al-Tirmidhi reported it in "Al-Shama'il" from the narration of Hind ibn Abi Halah. If someone contended with him for a need, he would be patient with them until they were the ones to turn away. It is reported: "If someone contended with him for a need, he would be patient with them until they were the ones to turn away." Al-Tabarani reported it, and through his chain Abu Nu'aym in "Dala'il al-Nubuwwah" from the narration of Ali ibn Abi Talib. It is also from the narration of Anas: "When he met a man and spoke to him, he would not turn his face away until the man was the one to turn away." Al-Tirmidhi reported something similar and said it is rare. No one took his hand but that he would not release it until the other released it. It is reported: "No one took his hand but that he would not release it until the other released it." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported it from the preceding narration of Anas: "When he faced a man and shook hands with him, he would not withdraw his hand from his until the man withdrew his." These are the words of Al-Tirmidhi, who said it is rare. When he met any of his companions, he would begin with shaking hands, then take his hand and interlace fingers, then firmly grip it. It is reported: "When he met any of his companions, he would begin with shaking hands, then take his hand and interlace fingers, then firmly grip it." Abu Dawud reported it from the narration of Abu Dharr. A man from the tribe of 'Anazah asked him: "Did the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, shake your hands when you met him?" He said: "I never met him but that he shook my hand." The hadith includes the man from 'Anazah, unnamed; Al-Bayhaqi named him Abdullah in "Al-Adab." We have reported in "Ulum al-Hadith" by Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Abu al-Qasim, peace be upon him, interlaced his fingers with mine." In Muslim's wording: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, took his hand."

He would not stand or sit except in remembrance of God. It is reported: "He would not stand or sit except in remembrance of God, the Almighty." Al-Tirmidhi reported it in "Al-Shama'il" from the narration of Ali in his long description of him: "He was in constant remembrance." And he would not sit with him...

He would shorten his prayer and turn to him, saying, "Do you have a need?" When he had finished his need, he would return to his prayer. A hadith: "No one would sit with him while he was praying except that he would shorten his prayer and turn to him, saying, 'Do you have a need?' When he had finished his need, he would return to his prayer." I did not find a basis for it. And his most common manner of sitting was to extend both his shanks and hold them with his hands, resembling a squatting position. A hadith: "His most common manner of sitting was to extend both his shanks and hold them with his hands, resembling a squatting position." Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, when he sat in a gathering, would squat with his hands." Its chain is weak. And al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in the courtyard of the Ka'bah squatting with his hands." And his seat was not distinguished from the seats of his companions. A hadith: "His seat was not distinguished from the seats of his companions." Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Abu Dharr, who said: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would sit among his companions, and a stranger would come and not know which one he was until he asked." Because he would sit wherever the gathering ended. A hadith: "He would sit wherever the gathering ended." Al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il reported it in the long hadith of 'Ali. And he was never seen stretching his legs among his companions so as to cause discomfort to anyone, unless the place was spacious with no constraint. And he most often sat facing the qiblah. A hadith: "He was never seen stretching his legs among his companions so as to cause discomfort to anyone, unless the place was spacious with no constraint." Al-Daraqutni in Gharib Malik reported it from the hadith of Anas and said it is baseless. Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah: "He was not seen placing his knees before a sitting companion." Ibn Majah added "ever," and its chain is weak. And he would honor whoever entered upon him, to the extent that he would sometimes spread his garment for one with whom he had no kinship or foster relation, seating him upon it. A hadith: "He would honor whoever entered upon him, to the extent that he would sometimes spread his garment for one with whom he had no kinship or foster relation, seating him upon it." Al-Hakim reported it with a sound chain from the hadith of Anas: "Jarir ibn 'Abd Allah entered upon the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he took his cloak and spread it for him, saying, 'Sit upon it, O Jarir.'" The hadith includes: "When a noble person from a people comes to you, honor him." It has preceded in the third chapter on the etiquette of companionship. Al-Tabarani in al-Kabir from the hadith of Jarir: "He threw a covering to me." And Abu Nu'aym in al-Hilyah: "He spread his cloak for me." And he would offer the cushion beneath him to the one entering upon him. If he refused to accept it, he would insist until he did. A hadith: "He would offer the cushion beneath him to the one entering." The hadith has preceded in the third chapter on the etiquette of companionship. And no one was singled out by him except that he thought he was the most honored of people to him. A hadith: "No one was singled out by him except that he thought he was the most honored of people to him." He would give each one sitting with him his share of his attention, such that his sitting, his listening, his speech, and his focus were for the one sitting with him, and his gathering was nonetheless a gathering of modesty, humility, and trustworthiness. Al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il reported it from the long hadith of 'Ali, and in it: "He gave each of his sitting companions his share; his companion would not think that anyone was more honored to him than him. His gathering was a gathering of forbearance, modesty, patience, and trustworthiness." He would give each one sitting with him his share of his attention, such that his sitting, his listening, his speech, the subtlety of his virtues, and his focus were for the one sitting with him, and his gathering was nonetheless a gathering of modesty, humility, and trustworthiness. God Almighty said, by a mercy from God: "You were gentle with them. Had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you." And he would call his companions by their kunyas to honor them and win their hearts. A hadith: "He would call his companions by their kunyas to honor them and win their hearts." In the two Sahihs in the story of the cave from the hadith of Abu Bakr: "O Abu Bakr, what do you think of two, with God as their third?" And al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas that he said to 'Umar: "O Abu Hafs, have you seen the face of the uncle of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him?" 'Umar said: "That was the first day he called me by my kunya, Abu Hafs." And he said it is sound according to the conditions of Muslim. In the two Sahihs, he said to 'Ali: "Rise, O Abu Turab." And al-Hakim from the hadith of Rifa'ah ibn Malik: "Abu Hasan had a stomach ache, so I stayed behind with him," meaning 'Ali. And Abu Ya'la al-Mawsili from the hadith of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: "He said, 'Who is this? Abu Ishaq?' I said, 'Yes.'" And al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, gave him the kunya Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, though he had no son. And he would give a kunya to one who had none, and he would be called by what he gave him as a kunya. A hadith: "He would give a kunya to one who had none, and he would be called by what he gave him as a kunya." Al-Tirmidhi reported it from the hadith of Anas, who said: "He gave me the kunya, peace and blessings be upon him, by a vegetable I used to pick," meaning Abu Hamzah. He said it is a rare hadith. And Ibn Majah: "'Umar said to Suhayb ibn Malik, 'You take a kunya, and you have no...'"

When he had a son, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, gave him the kunya Abu Yahya. Al-Tabarani narrated from the hadith of Abu Bakrah: I descended from a pulley in Ta’if, so the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me, “Then you are Abu Bakrah.” Women who have children and those who have not given birth are also given kunyas, beginning with them. There is a hadith: He used to give kunyas to women who had children and those who had not given birth, beginning with them. Al-Hakim narrated it from the hadith of Umm Ayman in the story of her drinking the urine of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, “O Umm Ayman, go to that earthenware pot,” the hadith. And Ibn Majah from the hadith of ‘A’ishah that she said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, “All your wives have kunyas except me.” He said, “You are Umm ‘Abd Allah.” And Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Umm Khalid that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to her, “O Umm Khalid, this is its brightness,” and she was young. In it is a freed slave of Al-Zubayr who is not named. And Abu Dawud with a sound chain that she said, “O Messenger of God, all my companions have kunyas.” He said, “Take a kunya from your son ‘Abd Allah ibn Al-Zubayr.” And he would give kunyas to young boys to soften their hearts with it. There is a hadith: He used to give kunyas to young boys. In the two Sahihs from the hadith of Anas that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to a young brother of his, “O Abu ‘Umayr, what has the little bird done?” He was the farthest of people from anger and the quickest of them to be pleased. There is a hadith: He was the farthest of people from anger and the quickest of them to be pleased. This is known and indicated by his report, peace and blessings be upon him, that the best of the children of Adam are those slow to anger and quick to reconcile. Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri and said it is a hasan hadith. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, is the best of the children of Adam and their master. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, would not become angry for himself nor seek vengeance for himself. Al-Tirmidhi narrated it in Al-Shama’il from the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Halah. And he was the most compassionate of people toward people, the best of people to people, and the most beneficial of people to people. There is a hadith: He was the most compassionate of people toward people, the best of people to people, and the most beneficial of people to people. This is known, and we narrated it in the first part of the Fawa’id of Abu Al-Dahdah from the hadith of ‘Ali in the description of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: He was the most merciful of people toward people, the hadith at length. And voices were not raised in his gathering. There is a hadith: Voices were not raised in his gathering. Al-Tirmidhi narrated it in Al-Shama’il from the long hadith of ‘Ali. And when he rose from his gathering, he would say, “Glory to You, O God, and praise to You. I bear witness that there is no god but You. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You.” Then he would say, “Gabriel, peace be upon him, taught them to me.” There is a hadith: When he rose from his gathering, he would say, “Glory to You, O God, and praise to You,” the hadith. Al-Nasa’i narrated it in Al-Yawm wa Al-Laylah and Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak from the hadith of Rafi‘ ibn Khadij. The explanation of his speech and his laughter, peace and blessings be upon him, has preceded in the section on remembrances and supplications. He, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most eloquent of people in speech and the sweetest in conversation. And it is said: There is a hadith: He was the most eloquent of people in speech and the sweetest in conversation. Abu Al-Hasan ibn Al-Dahhak narrated it in the book Al-Shama’il and Ibn Al-Jawzi in Al-Wafa’ with a weak chain from the hadith of Buraydah: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was among the most eloquent of the Arabs, and he would speak words they did not understand until he informed them. “I am the most eloquent of the Arabs.” There is a hadith: I am the most eloquent of the Arabs. Al-Tabarani narrated it in Al-Kabir from the hadith of Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri: I am the most articulate of the Arabs, and its chain is weak. And Al-Hakim from the hadith of ‘Umar: I said, “O Messenger of God, why are you the most eloquent of us, and you did not emerge from among us?” the hadith. And in the book Al-Ra‘d wa Al-Matar of Ibn Abi Al-Dunya from a mursal hadith: A Bedouin said to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, “I have not seen anyone more eloquent than you.” And indeed, the people of Paradise will speak therein with the language of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. There is a hadith: The people of Paradise will speak with the language of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Al-Hakim narrated it from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas and authenticated it. The speech of the people of Paradise is Arabic. And he was sparing in speech, gracious in utterance. When he spoke, he was not garrulous. And his speech was like strung pearls. There is a hadith: He was sparing in speech, gracious in utterance. When he spoke, he was not garrulous, and his speech was like strung pearls. Al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of Umm Ma‘bad. And his speech was strung pearls descending, sweet in speech, neither scant nor excessive. It has preceded and will come in the hadith of ‘A’ishah after it: When he spoke, he spoke sparingly. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of ‘A’ishah: He would narrate to us a narration such that if a counter were to count it, he would enumerate it. ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: He would not string speech together as you string it. His speech was sparing, and you scatter speech scattering. There is a hadith of ‘A’ishah: He would not string together as you string together. His speech was sparing, and you scatter it scattering. The two Shaykhs agreed on the first part of the hadith. As for the last two sentences, Al-Khala‘i narrated them in his Fawa’id with an interrupted chain. They said: And he was the most concise of people in speech.

And thus came to him Gabriel, and with conciseness he encompassed all he intended, whether a hadith or the most succinct of speech among people.
And thereby came to him Gabriel, and with conciseness he encompassed all he intended. This was narrated by 'Ubayd ibn Humaid from the hadith of 'Umar with an interrupted chain, and by al-Daraqutni from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a sound chain: "I have been granted the comprehensive words, and speech has been made concise for me." The first half is agreed upon, as will come. Al-Bukhari said: It reached me regarding the comprehensive words that Allah gathered for him many matters in one command, or two, and the like. And al-Hakim has from the aforementioned hadith of 'Umar: "The language of Isma'il had become effaced, so Gabriel came with it and taught it to me." And he would speak with comprehensive words, neither excessive nor deficient, as if one part followed another. Between his speech was a pause, so that the listener could memorize and comprehend it. A hadith: He would speak with comprehensive words, neither excessive nor deficient; speech whose parts follow one another. Between his speech was a pause, so that the listener could memorize and comprehend it. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Hala. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "I have been sent with comprehensive words." And Abu Dawud has from the hadith of Jabir: "In the speech of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, there was measured deliberation." And in it is an unnamed elder. And for him and for al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "The speech of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was distinct speech, understood by everyone who heard it." And al-Tirmidhi said: "Whoever sat with him would memorize it." And al-Tirmidhi said in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah: "Whoever heard it would memorize it, and its chain is good." And he had a resonant voice, the most beautiful of people in tone. A hadith: He had a resonant voice, the most beautiful of people in tone. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra from the hadith of Safwan ibn 'Assal, who said: We were with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, on a journey. While we were with him, a Bedouin called to him with a loud voice: "O Muhammad!" So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, answered him in a manner similar to his voice: "Here I am." The hadith. And Ahmad said in his Musnad: "And he answered him similarly to how he had spoken." The hadith. And it may be understood from this that he, peace and blessings be upon him, had a resonant voice, but he did not raise it constantly. And it may be said he did not have a resonant voice, but rather raised his voice gently for the Bedouin so that his voice would not be louder than his. And this is the apparent meaning for the two Shaykhs from the hadith of al-Bara': "I never heard anyone with a more beautiful voice than his." And he was long in silence, not speaking except when necessary. A hadith: He was long in silence, not speaking except when necessary. Narrated in al-Shama'il from the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Hala. And he would not say what is disapproved, nor would he say in pleasure and anger except the truth. A hadith: He would not say what is disapproved, nor would he say in pleasure and anger except the truth. Narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, who said: I used to write everything I heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, wanting to memorize it. But Quraysh forbade me, saying: "Do you write everything? The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, is a human who speaks in anger and pleasure." So I refrained from writing. I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he pointed with his finger to his mouth and said: "Write, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it except truth." Narrated by al-Hakim who authenticated it. And he would turn away from one who spoke unbecomingly. A hadith: He would turn away from one who spoke unbecomingly. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the long hadith of 'Ali. He would feign ignorance of what he did not desire, and he would use indirect expression for what speech compelled him to, concerning what he disliked. A hadith: He would use indirect expression for what speech compelled him to concerning what he disliked. From that is his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, to the wife of Rifa'ah: "Until you taste his sweetness and he tastes your sweetness." Narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'A'ishah. And from that is what the two agreed upon from her hadith concerning the woman who asked him about washing from menstruation: "Take a piece of cloth scented with musk and purify yourself with it." The hadith. And when he fell silent, his companions would speak, and they would not contend in his presence. A hadith: When he fell silent, his companions would speak, and they would not contend in his presence in speech. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il in the long hadith of 'Ali in the hadith. And he would admonish with seriousness and sincere counsel. A hadith: He would admonish with seriousness and sincere counsel. Narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Jabir: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when he delivered a sermon, his eyes would redden, his voice would rise, and his anger would intensify, as if he were warning an army, saying: "The morning has overtaken you and the evening..." The hadith. And he would say: "Do not set parts of the Qur'an against each other, for it was revealed in various aspects." A hadith: "Do not set parts of the Qur'an against each other, and it was revealed in various aspects." Narrated by al-Tabarani from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with a good chain: "The Qur'an verifies some parts with others, so do not falsify some parts with others." And in a narration of al-Harawi in dispraising disputation: "The Qur'an was not revealed for you to set its parts against each other." And in a narration of his: "Were you commanded to set the Book of Allah against itself?" And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: "This Qur'an was revealed in seven modes." And he was the most smiling and laughing of people towards his companions, and marveling at what they related.

He mingled his own soul with theirs in conversation. He was among the people the most frequent in smiling and laughing in the faces of his companions, and in marveling at what they spoke of. He mingled his own soul with them. Al-Tirmidhi transmitted from the narration of ‘Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn Juz’: "I have not seen anyone who smiled more than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." In the two Sahih collections, from the narration of Jarir: "He never saw me except that he smiled." And al-Tirmidhi in *Al-Shama'il* from the narration of ‘Ali: "He would laugh at what you laughed at and marvel at what you marveled at." And Muslim from the narration of Jabir ibn Samurah: "They would converse about matters of the Age of Ignorance, and he would laugh and smile." And sometimes he would laugh until his molars became visible. The hadith: "And sometimes he would laugh until his molars became visible" is agreed upon from the narration of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas'ud in the story of the last person to emerge from the Fire, and in the story of the Jewish scholar who said, 'God places the heavens upon a finger,' and from the narration of Abu Hurayrah in the story of the one who has intercourse during Ramadan, and other instances. The laughter of his companions in his presence was smiling, in emulation of him and out of reverence for him. The hadith: "The laughter of his companions in his presence was smiling, in emulation of him and out of reverence for him," was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi in *Al-Shama'il* from the narration of Hind ibn Abi Halah in the course of his lengthy description: "Most of his laughter was smiling." They said: A Bedouin came to him one day while he, peace and blessings be upon him, was of altered complexion, which his companions found strange. The Bedouin wished to ask him something. They said, "Do not do it, O Bedouin, for we find his complexion strange." He said, "Leave me. By Him who sent him with the truth as a prophet, I will not leave him until he smiles." He then said, "O Messenger of God, we have been informed that the False Messiah—meaning the Dajjal—will come to the people with tharid (a dish of bread and broth) while they are perishing from hunger. Do you think—may my father and mother be sacrificed for you—that I should abstain from his tharid out of self-restraint and purity, and thus perish in hunger, or should I partake of his tharid until, when I am fully satiated, I believe in God and disbelieve in Him?" They said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, laughed until his molars became visible. Then he said, "No, rather God will suffice you as He suffices the believers." The hadith: "A Bedouin came to him one day while he was of altered complexion, which his companions found strange. He wished to ask him something. They said, 'Do not do it, O Bedouin, for we find his complexion strange.' He said, 'Leave me. By Him who sent him with the truth as a prophet, I will not leave him until he smiles.' He then said, 'O Messenger of God, we have been informed that the False Messiah will come to the people with tharid while they are perishing from hunger...'" This is a rejected (munkar) hadith for which I have not found a basis. It is refuted by his statement, peace and blessings be upon him, in the agreed-upon hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah, when he was asked about them saying that with him (the Dajjal) is a mountain of bread and a river of water. He said, "He is more insignificant to God than that." And in a narration of Muslim: "They say that with him are mountains of bread and meat..." Indeed, in the hadith of Hudhayfah and Abu Mas'ud, agreed upon by both, "With him is water and fire..." They said: He was among the people the most frequent in smiling and the most pleasant in spirit, unless revelation was descending upon him, or the Hour was mentioned, or he was delivering a sermon of admonition. The hadith: "He was among the people the most frequent in smiling and the most pleasant in spirit, unless the Qur'an was being revealed to him, or the Hour was mentioned, or he was delivering a sermon of admonition." The hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn al-Harith has preceded: "I have not seen anyone who smiled more than him." And al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* from the narration of Jabir: "When revelation descended upon him, you would think him a warner to his people. But when it lifted from him, he was the most laughing of people..." And Ahmad from the narration of ‘Ali or al-Zubayr: "He would deliver a sermon, reminding of God's days, until that could be recognized in his face, as if he were a warner to his people alerting them to a matter in the morning." And when he had recently been with Gabriel, he would not smile or laugh until he (the state) lifted from him. Abu Ya'la narrated it from the narration of al-Zubayr without doubt. And al-Hakim from the narration of Jabir: "When the Hour was mentioned, his cheeks would redden and his anger would intensify." In Muslim with the wording: "When he delivered a sermon... and when he was pleased and content, he was the most excellent of people in contentment. If he admonished, he admonished earnestly. If he became angry—and he only became angry for God's sake—nothing could withstand his anger. And thus he was in all his affairs." The hadith: "When he was pleased and content, he was the most excellent of people in contentment. If he admonished, he admonished earnestly. If he became angry—and he only became angry for God's sake—nothing could withstand his anger. And thus he was in all his affairs," was transmitted by Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban in *The Book of the Character of the Prophet*, peace and blessings be upon him, from the narration of Ibn ‘Umar: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, could be known by his anger and his pleasure in his face. When he was pleased, his face was as if you were polishing a wall." Its chain is weak. The meaning is a mirror placed in the sun, so its light is seen on the wall. And in the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of Ka'b ibn Malik, he said: "And his face would shine from joy." And in it: "When he was pleased, his face would become radiant as if it were a piece of the moon, and we would recognize that in him..." And Muslim: "When he delivered a sermon, his eyes would redden, his voice would rise, and his anger would intensify..." This has preceded. And al-Tirmidhi in *Al-Shama'il* in the hadith of Hind ibn Abi Halah: "The worldly life did not anger him, nor anything pertaining to it. But if a transgression against the truth occurred, nothing could withstand his anger until he secured victory for it. He did not become angry for himself, nor did he seek victory for himself." This has preceded. And when revelation descended...

So he surrenders the matter to God and disavows any power or strength, seeking guidance by saying: O Allah, show me truth as truth and grant me to follow it, and show me falsehood as falsehood and grant me to avoid it. Protect me from confusion, lest I follow my own desire without guidance from You. Make my desire in accordance with Your obedience, and take Your pleasure from my soul in well-being. Guide me to the truth in matters of disagreement, by Your leave. Indeed, You guide whom You will to a straight path.

A hadith: He would say: O Allah, show me truth as truth and grant me to follow it, and show me falsehood as falsehood and grant me to avoid it. Protect me from confusion, lest I follow my own desire without guidance from You. Make my desire in accordance with Your obedience, and take Your pleasure from my soul in well-being. Guide me to the truth in matters of disagreement, by Your leave. Indeed, You guide whom You will to a straight path. I have not found a source for its beginning. Al-Mustaghfiri narrated in "Al-Da'awat" from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would supplicate saying: O Allah, You have asked of our souls what we cannot possess except through You, so grant us from them what pleases You concerning us. Muslim narrates from the hadith of 'A'ishah regarding what he would begin his night prayer with: "Guide me to the truth in matters of disagreement..." to the end of the hadith.

An exposition of his character and manners regarding food: He, peace and blessings be upon him, would eat what he found. A hadith: He would eat what was presented. This has preceded. His most beloved food was that which had many hands partaking of it. A hadith: His most beloved food was that which was on a *dafaf* (i.e., that which many hands reached for). Abu Ya'la, Al-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat," and Ibn 'Adi in "Al-Kamil" narrated it from the hadith of Jabir with a good chain. The food most beloved to Allah is that over which many hands gather. Abu Ya'la narrates from the hadith of Anas: He never had lunch and dinner of bread and meat together except on a *dafaf*, but its chain is weak. *Al-Dafaf* is that which many hands reach for. When the dining cloth was spread, he would say: "In the name of Allah. O Allah, make it a blessed provision for which thanks are given, and through it connect us to the bliss of Paradise." A hadith: When the dining cloth was spread, he would say: "In the name of Allah. O Allah, make it a blessed provision for which thanks are given, and through it connect us to the bliss of Paradise." As for the mention of Allah's name, Al-Nasa'i narrates from one who served the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, for eight years, that he heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when food was brought to him, say: "In the name of Allah..." The hadith, and its chain is sound. As for the remainder of the hadith, I have not found it.

Often, when he sat to eat, he would draw his knees and feet together as one sits in prayer, except that one knee would be over the other and one foot over the other, and he would say: "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats, and I sit as a servant sits." A hadith: Often, when he sat to eat, he would draw his knees and feet together as one does in prayer, except that one knee would be over the other and one foot over the other, and he would say: "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats, and I sit as a servant sits." 'Abd al-Razzaq narrates in "Al-Musannaf" from the report of Ayyub, disconnected, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he ate, would squat and say: "I eat as a servant eats..." the hadith. Ibn al-Dahhak narrates in "Al-Shama'il" from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain: When he sat for food, he would squat on his left knee and keep his right upright, then say: "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats, and I do as a servant does." Abu al-Shaykh narrates in "The Character of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him," with a good chain from the hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b, that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would kneel on his knees and would not recline. He cited it in the description of the eating of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. Al-Bazzar narrates from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats." Abu Ya'la narrates from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "I eat as a servant eats, and I sit as a servant sits." Both their chains are weak.

He would not eat hot food, saying: "It has no blessing. Indeed, Allah has not fed us fire, so cool it." A hadith: He would not eat hot food, saying: "It has no blessing. Indeed, Allah has not fed us fire." Al-Bayhaqi narrates it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was brought hot food one day and said: "No hot food has entered my belly since such and such time before today." Ahmad narrates with a good chain, and Al-Tabarani and Al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" from the hadith of Khawlah bint Qays: She presented him with a hot dish, and he put his hand in it, felt its heat, and withdrew it—the wording of Al-Tabarani and Al-Bayhaqi. Ahmad said: It burned his fingers, and he said, "Ouch." Al-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" narrates from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Cool the food, for hot food has no blessing." He also narrates in it and in "Al-Saghir" from his hadith: A steaming platter was brought, and he raised his hand from it and said: "Indeed, Allah has not fed us fire." Both are weak.

He would eat from what was nearest to him. A hadith: He would eat from what was nearest to him. Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban narrates it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and in its chain is a man who is not named, but he named him in one of his narrations. Similarly, Al-Bayhaqi in his narration in "Al-Shu'ab" names him 'Ubayd ibn al-Qasim, a relative.

Sufyan al-Thawri said, and al-Bayhaqi reported it uniquely through 'Ubayd, though Ibn Ma'in accused him of falsehood. Abu al-Shaykh has a similar narration from 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far. "He ate with three fingers" — the hadith about him eating with three fingers is reported by Muslim from the narration of Ka'b ibn Malik. "And he would sometimes use the fourth" — the hadith about him using the fourth is narrated by us in al-Ghaylaniyat from the narration of 'Amir ibn Rabi'ah. And regarding al-Qasim ibn 'Abdullah al-'Umari, he is unreliable. In the Musannaf of Ibn Abi Shaybah from the mursal narration of al-Zuhri: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, ate with five [fingers] and did not eat with two, saying, 'That is the eating of Satan.'" The hadith "He did not eat with two fingers, saying, 'That is the eating of Satan'" is reported by al-Daraqutni in al-Afrad from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain. "Do not eat with one finger, for that is the eating of kings, nor with two fingers, for that is the eating of devils" — the hadith. 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, may God be pleased with him, brought him faludhaj, and he ate from it and said, "What is this, O 'Abdullah?" He replied, "May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, we put ghee and honey in a pot and place it on the fire, then boil it, then we take wheat starch when it is ground and fry it with the ghee and honey in the pot, then we stir it until it is cooked, and it comes out as you see." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "This is a good food." The hadith " 'Uthman ibn 'Affan brought him faludhaj" — I say: The well-known is that what 'Uthman made was khabis. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in al-Shu'ab from the narration of Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, who said, "The first to make khabis was 'Uthman ibn 'Affan. A caravan came to him carrying dates and honey" — the hadith. And he said this is interrupted. Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab reported from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Salam: " 'Uthman came forward with a camel carrying two bags" — and in it was flour, ghee, and honey — and in it, then he said to his companions, "Eat this, which the Persians call khabis." As for the report of faludhaj, Ibn Majah reported it with a weak chain from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, who said, "The first we heard of faludhaj was when Gabriel came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said, 'Your community will conquer the earth for them, and worldly things will be poured upon them until they eat faludhaj.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'And what is faludhaj?' He said, 'They mix ghee and honey together.'" Ibn al-Jawzi said in al-Mawdu'at: "This hadith is false, without basis." "And he ate barley bread unsifted" — the hadith "He ate barley bread unsifted" is reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd. "And he ate cucumber with fresh dates" — the hadith "He ate cucumber with fresh dates" is agreed upon from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far. "And with salt" — the hadith "He ate cucumber with salt" is reported by Abu al-Shaykh from the narration of 'A'ishah, and in it is Yahya ibn Hashim, whom Ibn Ma'in and others accused of falsehood. Ibn 'Adi reported it, and in it is 'Abbad ibn Kathir, who is abandoned. "And the fresh fruits he loved most were watermelon and grapes" — the hadith "The fresh fruits he loved most were watermelon and grapes" is reported by Abu Nu'aym in al-Tibb al-Nabawi from the narration of Umayyah ibn Zayd al-'Absi that the Prophet, peace be upon him, loved from fruits grapes and watermelon. Abu al-Shaykh, Ibn 'Adi in al-Kamil, al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab reported from the narration of Anas: "He would take fresh dates with his right hand and watermelon with his left, and eat the fresh dates with the watermelon, and the fruits he loved most were..." In it is Yusuf ibn 'Atiyyah al-Saffar, unanimously considered weak. Ibn 'Adi reported from the narration of 'A'ishah: "The fruits most beloved to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, were fresh dates and watermelon." And he has from another narration of hers: "For the best of fruits is grapes" — both are weak. "And he ate watermelon with bread and with sugar" — the hadith "He ate watermelon with bread and sugar." As for eating watermelon with bread, I have not seen it; rather, I found eating grapes with bread in what Ibn 'Adi reported from the narration of 'A'ishah, marfu': "Upon you is al-marazimah." It was said, "O Messenger of God, what is al-marazimah?" He said, "Eating bread with grapes, for the best of fruits is grapes and the best of food is bread" — and its chain is weak. As for eating watermelon with sugar, if by sugar is meant a type of date or fresh date, it is well-known, then it is the following hadith. But if it is meant as sugar which is tabarizad, I have not found a basis for it except in a rejected, interrupted hadith reported by Abu 'Umar al-Nawqani in Kitab al-Battiikh from the narration of Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn al-Husayn that the Prophet, peace be upon him, ate watermelon with kaser, and in it is Musa ibn Ibrahim al-Marwazi, whom Yahya ibn Ma'in accused of falsehood. "And sometimes he ate it with fresh dates" — the hadith "He ate watermelon with fresh dates" is reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i from the narration of 'A'ishah, and al-Tirmidhi graded it good. Ibn Majah reported from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "He ate fresh dates with watermelon" — and in al-Darimi with the wording "watermelon with fresh dates" — "and he would use both hands together. And one day he ate fresh dates in..."

He would eat dates with his right hand while saving the pits in his left. A sheep passed by, and he gestured to it with the pits, so it began eating from his left palm while he ate with his right until he finished and the sheep departed. Regarding his using both hands together: Ahmad narrated from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Ja'far, who said, "The last thing I saw of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was that he had dates in one hand and cucumbers in the other, eating from these and biting from those." The hadith of Anas about him eating with both hands was mentioned three hadiths earlier. As for the story with the sheep, we narrated it in the "Benefits" of Abu Bakr al-Shafi'i from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain.

He would sometimes eat grapes in clusters, with their seeds seen on his beard like pearls. This hadith about eating grapes in clusters was reported by Ibn 'Adi in "Al-Kamil" from the hadith of Al-'Abbas and by Al-'Uqayli in "Al-Du'afa'" from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, both briefly and both weak. His most common food was water and dates. The hadith that his most common food was water and dates was reported by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed away while we were satisfied with the two black things: dates and water." He would combine milk with dates and call them the two most delicious things. The hadith that he would combine milk with dates and call them the two most delicious things was reported by Ahmad from the narration of Isma'il ibn Abi Khalid from his father, who said, "I entered upon a man while he was combining milk with dates, and he said, 'Come closer, for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, called them the two most delicious things.'" Its narrators are trustworthy, and its ambiguity is not harmful.

His favorite food was meat, and he would say, "It enhances hearing, and it is the master of food in this world and the Hereafter. If I asked my Lord to feed it to me every day, He would do so." The hadith that his favorite food was meat and he would say it enhances hearing and is the master of food in this world and the Hereafter was reported by Abu al-Shaykh from the narration of Ibn Sam'an, who said, "I heard from our scholars saying, 'The favorite food of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was meat.'" Al-Tirmidhi in "Al-Shama'il" from the hadith of Jabir: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, came to our house, so we slaughtered a sheep for him. He said, 'It is as if they knew that we love meat.'" Its chain is sound. Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu al-Darda' with a weak chain: "The master of food for the people of this world and the people of Paradise is meat." He would eat tharid with meat and squash. The hadith that he would eat tharid with meat and squash was reported by Muslim from the hadith of Anas. He loved squash and said, "It is the tree of my brother Yunus, peace be upon him." The hadith that he loved squash and said it is the tree of my brother Yunus was reported by Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Anas: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, loved squash." Al-Nasa'i said "pumpkin," and in Muslim it is worded as "it pleased him." Ibn Mardawayh reported in his tafsir from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah in the story of Yunus: "It cast him at the base of a tree, which was the pumpkin." 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said, "He would say, 'O 'A'ishah, when you cook a pot, increase the pumpkin in it, for it strengthens the heart of the sorrowful.'" We narrated this in the "Benefits" of Abu Bakr al-Shafi'i.

He would eat the meat of hunted birds. The hadith that he would eat the meat of hunted birds was reported by Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas, who said, "There was a bird with the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, 'O God, bring me the most beloved of creation to You to eat this bird with me.' Then 'Ali came and ate with him." He said it is a rare hadith. I say: all its chains are weak. Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi reported and considered it rare from the hadith of Safinah, who said, "I ate bustard meat with the Prophet, peace be upon him." He would not follow game nor hunt, but he loved that it be hunted for him and brought to him so he could eat it. The hadith that he would not follow it nor hunt it, but loved that it be hunted for him and brought to him so he could eat it. I say: this is the apparent from his states, for he said, "Whoever follows game becomes heedless." Reported by Abu Dawud, Al-Nasa'i, and Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and he said it is good and rare. As for the hadith of Safwan ibn Umayyah in Al-Tabarani: "Before me, God had messengers, all of whom would hunt and seek game," it is very weak.

When he ate meat, he would not lower his head to it but would raise it to his mouth, then tear it vigorously. The hadith that when he ate meat, he would not lower his head to it but raise it to his mouth, then tear it, was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Safwan ibn Umayyah, who said, "I was eating with the Prophet, peace be upon him, and I would take meat from the bone. He said, 'Bring the meat closer to your mouth, for it is more wholesome and pleasant.'" Al-Tirmidhi from his hadith: "tear it."

He would eat meat by taking small bites, for that is more wholesome and pleasant, and it is a separate narration, as is the one preceding it. In the narration of the two Sheikhs from Abu Hurairah, he reached for the foreleg and took a small bite from it. There is a narration that he would eat bread and clarified butter. The narration that he would eat bread and clarified butter is agreed upon from the narration of Anas in a long story wherein it was brought, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, ordered it to be broken, and Umm Sulaym squeezed a skin of clarified butter and moistened it with it. The narration includes that then the Prophet, peace be upon him, ate. In the narration of Ibn Majah: "She made something with clarified butter in it," but it is not authentic. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "I wish I had a white loaf of brown wheat smeared with clarified butter." Abu Dawud said it is anomalous. He loved from the sheep the foreleg and the shoulder blade; from the cooking pot, the gourd; from the condiment, vinegar; and from dates, the 'Ajwah. There is a narration: He loved from the sheep the foreleg and the shoulder blade; from the cooking pot, the gourd; from the condiment, vinegar; and from dates, the 'Ajwah. The two Sheikhs narrated from Abu Hurairah who said: "A bowl of tharid and meat was placed before the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he reached for the foreleg, and it was the most beloved part of the sheep to him." Abu al-Sheikh narrated from Ibn 'Abbas: "The most beloved meat to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was the shoulder blade," but its chain is weak. And from the narration of Abu Hurairah: "Nothing from the sheep pleased him except the shoulder blade." The narration of Anas that he loved gourd precedes this by six narrations. Abu al-Sheikh has from the narration of Anas: "The most beloved food to him was gourd." And he has from Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain: "The most beloved condiment to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was vinegar." And he has with the mentioned chain: "The most beloved dates to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, were the 'Ajwah, and he supplicated for blessing in the 'Ajwah and said it is from Paradise and a cure for poison and magic." There is a narration: "He supplicated for blessing in the 'Ajwah and said it is from Paradise and a cure for poison and magic." Al-Bazzar and Al-Tabarani in Al-Kabir narrated it from 'Abdullah bin Al-Aswad who said: "We were with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in a delegation from Sadus, and we presented him with dates, and in it... until we mentioned the dates of our people, this Judhami (type), so he said: 'May Allah bless the Judhami and the garden from which this came.'" Abu Musa Al-Madini said it is said to be a red date. Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah from Abu Hurairah: "The 'Ajwah is from Paradise, and it is a cure for poison." In the two Sahihs from Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas: "Whoever eats seven 'Ajwah dates in the morning will not be harmed by poison or magic that day." He loved from vegetables the chicory, the bādharūj, and the foolish vegetable called purslane. There is a narration: "He loved from vegetables the chicory, the bādharūj, and the foolish vegetable called purslane." Abu Nu'aym in Al-Tibb al-Nabawi from Ibn 'Abbas: "You should take chicory, for there is not a day except that a drop from the drops of Paradise falls upon it." And he has from Al-Hasan bin 'Ali and Anas bin Malik similarly, but all are weak. As for bādharūj, I did not find a narration concerning it. As for purslane, Abu Nu'aym narrated from Thawrir who said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed by purslane while he had a sore on his leg, so they treated him with it and he recovered. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: 'May Allah bless you; grow wherever you wish, for you are a cure for seventy ailments, the least of which is headache.'" This is a disconnected weak narration. He disliked the two kidneys because of their place near urine. There is a narration: "He disliked the two kidneys because of their place near urine." We narrated it in a part from the narration of Abu Bakr Muhammad bin 'Abdullah bin Al-Shakhir from Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain containing Abu Sa'id Al-Hasan bin 'Ali Al-'Adawi, one of the liars. He would not eat from the sheep seven things: the male organ, the two testicles, the bladder, the gallbladder, the glands, the placenta, and the blood, and he disliked that. There is a narration: "He would not eat from the sheep the male organ, the two testicles, the bladder, the gallbladder, the gland, the placenta, and the blood." Ibn 'Adi and through him Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain, and Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from Mujahid as a disconnected narration. He would not eat garlic, onions, or leeks. There is a narration: "He would not eat garlic, onions, or leeks." Malik narrated it in Al-Muwatta' from Al-Zuhri from Sulayman bin Yasar as a disconnected narration, and Al-Daraqutni connected it in Gharā'ib Malik from Al-Zuhri from Anas. In the two Sahihs from Jabir: "A pot containing green vegetables was brought, and he detected its smell..." The narration includes: "He said: 'For I converse with One whom you do not converse with.'" Muslim has from Abu Ayyub in the story of him sending him food containing garlic, so he did not eat from it and said: "I dislike it because of its smell." He never criticized food; if he liked it, he ate it, and if he disliked it, he left it. If he found it distasteful, he did not make others dislike it. There is a narration: "He never criticized food; if he liked it, he ate it, and if he disliked it, he left it."

He would leave it, and even if he disliked it, he would not cause others to hate it. The beginning of the Hadith has preceded. In the two Sahih collections, from the narration of Ibn 'Umar regarding the story of the dabb (spiny-tailed lizard), he said: "Eat it, for it is not unlawful, and there is no harm in it, but it is not from the food of my people." And he used to dislike the dabb and the spleen, but he did not prohibit them. A Hadith: He used to dislike the dabb and the spleen, but he did not prohibit them. As for the dabb, in the two Sahih collections from Ibn 'Abbas: "It was not in the land of my people, so I find myself disliking it." And for both of them from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Two dead things and two bloods have been made lawful for us," and in it: "As for the two bloods, they are the liver and the spleen." And Al-Bayhaqi has it as a statement attributed to Zayd ibn Thabit: "I eat the spleen, and I have no need for it, except to let my family know that there is no harm in it." And he would lick the platter with his fingers and say: "The last of the food has more blessing." A Hadith: He would lick the platter and say: "The last of the food has more blessing." Al-Bayhaqi reported it in *Shu'ab al-Iman* from the narration of Jabir, in a Hadith where he said: "And do not raise the bowl until you lick it, or you lick it, for indeed the last of the food contains blessing." And Muslim from the narration of Anas: "We were commanded to wipe the platter," and he said: "For one of you does not know in which part of his food the blessing lies for him." And he would lick his fingers from the food until they became red. A Hadith: He would lick his fingers from the food until they became red. He reported it from the narration of Ka'b ibn Malik without the phrase "until they became red," so I did not find a reliable source for it. And he would not wipe his hand with a towel until he had licked his fingers one by one, and he would say: "For he does not know in which food the blessing lies." A Hadith: He would not wipe his hand with a towel until he had licked his fingers one by one, and he would say: "He does not know on which of his fingers the blessing lies." Muslim reported it from the narration of Ka'b ibn Malik that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would not wipe his hand until he had licked it. And he has from the narration of Jabir: "When he finishes, let him lick his fingers, for he does not know in which part of his food the blessing lies." And Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* from his narration: "Let none of you wipe his hand with a towel until he licks his hand, for a man does not know in which part of his food he has been blessed." And when he finished, he would say: "Praise be to Allah. O Allah, to You is praise. You have fed and satisfied, and You have given drink and quenched. To You is praise, unthwarted, unrelinquished, and not dispensed with." A Hadith: "And when he finished, he would say: 'O Allah, to You is praise. You have fed and satisfied, and You have given drink and quenched. To You is praise, unthwarted, unrelinquished, and not dispensed with.'" Al-Tabarani reported it from the narration of Al-Harith ibn Al-Harith with a weak chain. And Al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Umamah: "When he finished his food, he would say: 'Praise be to Allah who has sufficed us and given us shelter, not insufficient nor thwarted.'" And he said once: "Praise be to Allah, our Lord, not insufficient, nor relinquished, nor dispensed with, our Lord." And when he ate bread and meat specifically, he would wash his hands thoroughly, then wipe his face with the leftover water. A Hadith: "When he ate bread and meat specifically, he would wash his hands thoroughly, then wipe his face with the leftover water." Abu Ya'la reported it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain. "Whoever eats anything from these meats, let him wash his hand from its smell and harm, so as not to harm those sitting near him." And he would drink in three sips, and for them were three mentions of Allah's name, and at their end three praises. A Hadith: "He would drink in three sips; for them were three mentions of Allah's name, and at their end three praises." Al-Tabarani reported it in *Al-Awsat* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and its narrators are reliable. And Muslim from the narration of Anas: "When he drank, he would breathe three times." And he would sip water, sipping, and would not gulp it down hastily. A Hadith: "He would sip water, sipping, and would not gulp it down hastily." Al-Baghawi, Al-Tabarani, Ibn 'Adi, Ibn Qani', Ibn Mandah, and Abu Nu'aym reported it from the Companions from the narration of Bahz: "He would use the siwak crosswise and drink by sipping." And Al-Tabarani from the narration of Umm Salamah: "He would not gulp." And Abu al-Shaykh from the narration of Maymunah: "He would not gulp nor pant." All are weak. And he would give the leftover of his drink to the one on his right. A Hadith: "He would give the leftover of his drink to the one on his right." Agreed upon from the narration of Anas. If the one on his left was of higher rank, he would say to the one on his right: "The Sunnah is that you be given, but if you wish, you may give them preference." A Hadith: "He would seek permission from the one on his right if the one on his left was of higher rank." Agreed upon from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd. And sometimes he would drink in one breath until he finished. A Hadith: "A drink in one breath." Abu al-Shaykh reported it from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam with a weak chain. And Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Qatadah, and he authenticated it: "When one of you drinks, let him drink in one breath." Perhaps the interpretation of these two Hadiths is regarding refraining from breathing into the vessel, and Allah knows best. And he would not breathe into the vessel, but would turn away from it. A Hadith: "He would not breathe into the vessel until he turned away from it." Al-Hakim reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. "And let none of you breathe into the vessel when he drinks from it, but if he wishes to breathe, let him remove it from himself, then breathe." And he said: "A Hadith with a sound chain." And he was brought a vessel containing honey and milk, but he refused to drink it and said: "Two drinks in one drink."

And the continuous dipping in one vessel: a hadith came with a vessel containing honey and milk, and he refused to drink it, saying, "Two drinks in one drinking, and two condiments in one vessel." The hadith was narrated by Al-Bazzar from the hadith of Talhah ibn 'Ubayd Allah, without his saying "two drinks in one drinking" to the end, and its chain is weak. Then he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "I do not forbid it, but I dislike pride and being accounted for the excesses of the world tomorrow, and I love humility. For whoever humbles himself for God, God will elevate him." And in his home, he was more modest than a virgin in her chamber; he would not ask them for food nor crave it from them. If they fed him, he ate, and whatever they gave him, he accepted, and whatever they gave him to drink, he drank. The hadith: "In his home, he was more modest than a virgin in her chamber; he would not ask them for food nor crave it from them. If they fed him, he ate, and whatever they gave him, he accepted, and whatever they gave him to drink, he drank," was narrated by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "He was more modest than a virgin in her chamber." The hadith has preceded. As for his not asking them for food, he meant any specific food, from the hadith of 'A'ishah: that he said one day, "O 'A'ishah, do you have anything?" She said, "I said, 'We have nothing.'" The hadith includes: So when he returned, I said, "A gift was given to us." He said, "What is it?" I said, "Hays." He said, "Bring it." And in a narration, "Serve it." And in a narration of Al-Nasa'i: "Is there anything with you to feed me?" And for Abu Dawud: "Do you have food?" And Al-Tirmidhi: "Do you have lunch?" And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of 'A'ishah: He called for food, and bread and a condiment from the household condiments were brought. He said, "Did I not see a pot on the fire containing meat?" The hadith. And in a narration of Muslim: "If you prepared for us from this meat." So in the story of Barrah, there is only inquiry, contentment, and the wisdom in it is to clarify the ruling, not craving. And God knows best. And from the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Umm al-Fadl: that she sent him a cup of milk while he was standing on his camel, and he drank it. And for Abu Dawud from the hadith of Umm Hani': The servant girl came with a vessel containing a drink, and he took it and drank from it, and its chain is good. And he would sometimes stand and take what he eats or drinks by himself. The hadith: "And he would sometimes stand and take what he eats or drinks by himself," was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Umm al-Mundhir bint Qays: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered and drank, and with him were 'Ali and a she-camel, and we had hanging clusters of dates. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood and ate from them. The hadith, and its chain is good. And for Al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Kabshah: He entered upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and drank from a hanging waterskin while standing. The hadith. He, peace and blessings be upon him, would wear from the garments whatever he found, whether an izar, a robe, a shirt, a jubba, or other than that. The hadith: "He would wear from the garments whatever he found, whether an izar, a robe, a shirt, a jubba, or other than that," was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of 'A'ishah: that she brought out an izar made in Yemen and a woolen cloak, and she said, "In this, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away." And in a narration: "A coarse izar." And from both of them from the hadith of Anas: "I was walking with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he was wearing a Najrani robe with a coarse edge." The hadith, the wording of Muslim. And Al-Bukhari said: "A Najrani garment." And Ibn Majah with a weak chain from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would wear a shirt with short sleeves and length." And Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, and Al-Nasa'i from the hadith of Umm Salamah: "The most beloved garment to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was the shirt." And for Abu Dawud from the hadith of Asma' bint Yazid: "The sleeve of the shirt of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, reached the wrist." And in it is Shuhr ibn Hawshab, who is disputed. And before this hadith, the hadith of the jubba, the shawl, and the silk garment has preceded. And he liked green garments. The hadith: "Most of his clothing was white, and he would say, 'Wear them in your life and shroud your dead in them.'" Reported by Ibn Majah and Al-Hakim from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The best of your garments are white, so wear them in your life and shroud your dead in them." Al-Hakim said: "Its chain is sound." And from him and the authors of the Sunan from the hadith of Samurah: "Upon you are these white garments, so let your living wear them and shroud your dead in them." The wording of Al-Hakim, and he said: "Sound according to the condition of the two Shaykhs." And Al-Tirmidhi said: "Good, sound." And most of his clothing was white, and he would say, "Wear them in your life and shroud your dead in them." And he would wear the padded coat for war and other than war. The hadith: "He would wear the padded coat for war and other than war," was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah: that cloaks of brocade embroidered with gold were presented to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. The hadith, and in the paths of the hadith, he wore it only in the path that Al-Bukhari linked: "He went out wearing a cloak of brocade embroidered with gold." The hadith. And Muslim from the hadith of Jabir: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wore one day a cloak of brocade given to him as a gift, then he removed it." The hadith. And he would...

He had a green silk cloak which he would wear, and its verdant hue would beautifully contrast with the fairness of his complexion. The hadith: He had a green silk cloak which he would wear. Ahmad narrated from Anas that Aqeedir of Dumah gifted the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, a silk or brocade robe before the prohibition of silk, and he wore it. The hadith is in the two Sahih collections, but it does not state he wore it; rather, it says he used to forbid silk. According to Tirmidhi, and Nasai authenticated it, he did wear it, but he mentioned it was a brocade robe woven with gold. All his garments were above the ankles, and the waist-wrapper would be above that, reaching mid-calf. The hadith: All his garments were above the ankles, and the waist-wrapper would be above that, reaching mid-calf. Abu al-Fadl Muhammad ibn Tahir narrated it in his book "Safwat al-Tasawwuf" from Abdullah ibn Yasar: The garments of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, were his waist-wrapper above the ankles, his shirt above that, and his cloak above that, but its chain is weak. Al-Hakim authenticated it from Ibn Abbas: He would wear a shirt above the ankles. The hadith, in his version, states: a shirt with short sleeves and length. According to them and Tirmidhi in "Al-Shama'il" from the narration of Al-Ash'ath: I heard my aunt narrate from her uncle, mentioning the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and in it: His waist-wrapper reached mid-calf. Nasai narrated it and named the Companion Ubaid ibn Khalid, and the name of his uncle was Al-Ash'ath; they are from the house of Al-Aswad, unknown. His shirt had fastened buttons, and sometimes he would unfasten the buttons during prayer and otherwise. The hadith: His shirt had fastened buttons, and sometimes he would unfasten the buttons during prayer and otherwise. Abu Dawud, Al-Bayhaqi, and Tirmidhi in "Al-Shama'il" from Muawiyah ibn Qurrah ibn Iyas from his father: I came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, with a group from Muzaynah, and we pledged allegiance to him, and his shirt had unfastened buttons. Al-Bayhaqi from Zaid ibn Aslam: I saw Ibn Umar praying with his buttons unfastened, so I asked him about that, and he said: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, do it. In "Al-'Ilal" of Tirmidhi, he asked Al-Bukhari about this hadith, and he said: I am wary of this sheikh, as if his hadith is fabricated, meaning Zuhair ibn Muhammad, its narrator from Zaid ibn Aslam. I said: Al-Walid ibn Muslim followed him from Zaid; Ibn Khuzaymah narrated it in his Sahih. Al-Tabarani from Ibn Abbas with a weak chain: I entered upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was praying, sitting with his buttons unfastened. He had a cloak dyed with saffron, and sometimes he would lead the people in prayer wearing it alone. The hadith: He had a cloak dyed with saffron, and sometimes he would lead the people in prayer wearing it. Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi narrated from Qaylah bint Makhramah: I saw the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wearing two garments dyed with saffron. Tirmidhi said: We do not know it except from Abdullah ibn Hassan. I said: Its narrators are trustworthy. Abu Dawud from Qays ibn Sa'd: He bathed, then my father Sa'd handed him a cloak dyed with saffron or wars, and he wrapped himself in it. The hadith, and its narrators are reliable. Sometimes he would wear only a single garment, with nothing else over it. The hadith: Sometimes he would wear only a single garment, with nothing else over it. Ibn Majah and Ibn Khuzaymah narrated from Thabit ibn Al-Samit: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, prayed in Banu Abdul-Ashhal wearing a cloak wrapped around him. In the narration of Al-Bazzar: in a cloak. He had a patched cloak which he would wear, saying: I am but a servant; I wear as a servant wears. The hadith: He had a patched cloak which he would wear, saying: I am a servant; I wear as a servant wears. The two Sheikhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) narrated from Abu Burdah: Aisha brought out to us a patched cloak and a coarse waist-wrapper, and said: In these two, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away. Al-Bukhari from Umar: I am but a servant. For Abd al-Razzaq in "Al-Musannaf" from Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani, raised but interrupted: I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats, and I sit as a servant sits. Previously from the hadith of Anas, Ibn Umar, and Aisha, connected: He had two garments specifically for Friday, other than his garments on non-Fridays. The hadith: He had two garments specifically for Friday. Al-Tabarani narrated in "Al-Saghir" and "Al-Awsat" from Aisha with a weak chain, adding: When he finished, we would fold them for another time. This is contradicted by the hadith of Aisha in Ibn Majah: I never saw him curse anyone, nor was a garment folded for him. Sometimes he would wear a single waist-wrapper with nothing else over it, and tie its ends between his shoulders. The hadith: Sometimes he would wear a single waist-wrapper with nothing else over it, and tie its ends between his shoulders. The two Sheikhs narrated from Umar in the hadith of his seclusion from his family: He had on his waist-wrapper and nothing else over it. Al-Bukhari from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir: Jabir led us in prayer wearing a waist-wrapper which he had tied from behind his neck, and his garments were placed on the peg. In another narration of his: He was praying in a single garment.

Wrapped in it with his cloak laid aside, and therein I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, praying thus. And sometimes he would lead the people in funeral prayers. The hadith "sometimes he would lead the people in funeral prayers" I have not found. And sometimes he would pray in his house in a single waist-wrapper, wrapped in it, tying its two ends together, and that would be the waist-wrapper in which he had had intercourse that day. The hadith "sometimes he would pray in his house in a single waist-wrapper, wrapped in it, tying its two ends together, and that would be the waist-wrapper in which he had had intercourse that day" was reported by Abu Ya'la with a good chain from the hadith of Mu'awiyah. He said: I entered upon Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, in a single garment. I said: O Umm Habibah, does the Prophet, peace be upon him, pray in a single garment? She said: Yes, and it was the one in which he had been when there was what there was—meaning intercourse. And Al-Tabarani reported it in Al-Awsat. And he would sometimes pray at night in a waist-wrapper, draping himself with part of the garment near its fringe and throwing the remainder over one of his wives, and pray like that. The hadith "sometimes he would pray at night, draping himself with part of the garment near its fringe and throwing the remainder over one of his wives" was reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of 'A'ishah that the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed in a garment, part of it being upon me. And in Muslim: He would pray at night while I was beside him, and I was menstruating, and upon him was a woolen sheet, part of it on the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. And in Al-Tabarani's Al-Awsat from the hadith of Abu 'Abd al-Rahman, the caretaker of 'A'ishah: I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, and 'A'ishah praying in a single garment, half of it on the Prophet, peace be upon him, and half on 'A'ishah—its chain is weak. And he had a cloak which he gave away, so Umm Salamah said to him: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what happened to that black cloak? He said: I clothed someone with it. She said: I have never seen anything more beautiful than your whiteness against its blackness. The hadith "He had a black cloak which he gave away, so Umm Salamah said to him: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what happened to that black cloak..." I have not found from the hadith of Umm Salamah. And in Muslim from the hadith of 'A'ishah: The Prophet, peace be upon him, went out wearing a black, embroidered woolen sheet. And in Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i: I made for the Prophet, peace be upon him, a black cloak of wool, and he wore it... And Ibn Sa'd added in Al-Tabaqat: So I mentioned the whiteness of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and its blackness. And Al-Hakim reported it with the wording "a jubba" and said it is sound according to the condition of the two Shaykhs. And Anas said: And sometimes I saw him leading us in the noon prayer in a shawl, tying its two ends together. The hadith of Anas: "Sometimes I saw him leading us in the noon prayer in a shawl, tying its two ends together" was reported by Al-Bazzar and Abu Ya'la with the wording "He prayed in a single garment, having tied its two ends together." And in Al-Bazzar: He went out during the illness from which he died, wearing a cotton garment, and led the people in prayer—its chain is sound. And Ibn Majah from the hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: He prayed in a shawl upon which he had tied a knot. And in Kamil Ibn 'Adi: He tied it thus—and Sufyan pointed to the back of his neck. And in Juz' al-Ghatrif: He tied it around his neck, having nothing else on—its chain is weak. And he wore a ring. The hadith "He wore a ring" was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar and Anas. And sometimes he would go out with a thread tied to his ring to remind him of something. The hadith "Sometimes he would go out with a thread tied to his ring to remind him of something" was reported by Ibn 'Adi from the hadith of Wathilah with a weak chain: When he wanted to relieve himself, he would tie a thread to his ring. And Al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah added in his Musnad from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: to remind him by it—its chain is weak. And he would seal letters with it and say: The seal on the letter is better than suspicion. The hadith "He would seal letters with it and say: The seal on the letter is better than suspicion" was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Anas: When the Prophet, peace be upon him, wanted to write to the Romans, they said: They only read a sealed letter, so he took a ring of silver... And Al-Nasa'i and Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Shama'il from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: He took a ring of silver which he would seal with and not wear—its chain is sound. As for his saying "The seal on the letter is better than suspicion," I have not found a source for it. And he would wear caps under turbans and without a turban, and sometimes he would remove his cap from his head and place it as a screen in front of him, then pray towards it. The hadith "He would wear caps under turbans and without a turban, and sometimes he would remove his cap from his head and place it as a screen in front of him, then pray towards it" was reported by Al-Tabarani, Abu al-Shaykh, and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would wear a white cap. And in Abu al-Shaykh from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had three caps: a white, lined cap; a cap of fine striped Yemeni cloth; and a cap with ear-flaps which he would wear on journeys, and sometimes he would place it in front of him when he prayed—their chains are...

Weak, and in Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi from the hadith of Rukanah: "What distinguishes between us and the polytheists is the turbans over the caps." Tirmidhi said it is ghareeb (uncommon) and its chain is not established. And perhaps the turban was not available, so he would tie a headband on his head and on his forehead. The hadith: "Perhaps the turban was not available, so he would tie a headband on his head and on his forehead" was reported from the hadith of Ibn Abbas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, ascended the pulpit while he had bound his head with a dark headband." And he had a turban called Al-Sahab (the Cloud), which he gave to Ali. So sometimes Ali would appear wearing it, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would say, "Ali has come to you in the Cloud." The hadith: "He had a turban called Al-Sahab, which he gave to Ali. So sometimes Ali would appear wearing it, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would say, 'Ali has come to you in the Cloud,'" was reported by Ibn Adi and Abu al-Shaykh from the hadith of Ja'far ibn Muhammad from his father from his grandfather, and it is mursal (broken chain) and very weak. And Abu Nu'aym in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah from the hadith of Umar, within the narration of his turban Al-Sahab. And when he wore a garment, he would wear it from the right side. The hadith: "When he wore a garment, he would wear it from the right side," was reported by Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and its narrators are narrators of Sahih, though there is disagreement regarding its being marfu' (attributed to the Prophet). And he would say, "Praise be to God who has clothed me with that which covers my nakedness and with which I beautify myself among people." The hadith: "Praise be to God who has clothed me with that which covers my nakedness and with which I beautify myself among people," was reported by Tirmidhi, who said it is ghareeb, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the hadith of Umar ibn al-Khattab. And when he removed his garment, he would remove it from the left side. The hadith: "When he removed his garment, he would remove it from the left side," was reported by Abu al-Shaykh from the hadith of Ibn Umar: "When he wore any garment, he began with the right, and when he removed it, he began with the left." And he has from the hadith of Anas: "When he put on a garment, combed his hair, or wore shoes, he began with his right, and when he removed them, he began with his left." Their chains are weak, but regarding wearing shoes, it is in the two Sahihs from the saying of Abu Hurayrah, not from his action. And when he wore a new garment, he would give his old garment to a poor person, then say, "No Muslim who clothes a Muslim from the worn-out state of his garments, clothing him only for God's sake, but that he is under the protection, safeguard, and goodness of God as long as that garment covers him, alive or dead." The hadith: "When he wore a new garment, he would give his old garment to a poor person, then say, 'No Muslim who clothes a Muslim...'" was reported by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Umar: "I saw the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, call for his garments and put them on. When they reached his throat, he said, 'Praise be to God who has clothed me with that which I beautify myself with in my life and which covers my nakedness.' Then he said, 'No Muslim who wears a new garment...'" without mention of his giving charity with his garment. And it is in Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah without mention of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wearing his garment, and it is more sound, as previously mentioned. Al-Bayhaqi said, "And it is not strong." And he had a bed of leather stuffed with palm fiber, its length two cubits or so, and its width a cubit and a span or so. The hadith: "He had a bed of leather stuffed with palm fiber..." is agreed upon from the hadith of Aisha, limited to this without mention of its width and length. And Abu al-Shaykh from the hadith of Umm Salamah: "The bed of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was like what a person is placed on in his grave," and in it is one unnamed. And he had a cloak that was spread for him wherever he moved, folded twice beneath him. The hadith: "He had a cloak that was spread for him wherever he moved, folded twice beneath him," was reported by Ibn Sa'd in al-Tabaqat and Abu al-Shaykh from the hadith of Aisha: "I entered upon a woman from the Ansar and she saw the bed of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, a cloak folded..." And Abu Sa'id from her that she would spread for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, a cloak folded in two, and both are not sound. And Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il from the hadith of Hafsa, and she was asked, "What was his bed?" She said, "A coarse cloth folded in two, and he would sleep on it," and it is interrupted. And he would sleep on a mat with nothing beneath it. The hadith: "He would sleep on a mat with nothing beneath it," is agreed upon from the hadith of Umar in the story of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, withdrawing from his wives. And it was from his character to name his mounts, his weapons, and his belongings. The name of his banner was Al-Uqab (the Eagle), and the name of his sword with which he witnessed battles was Dhu al-Fiqar. And he had a sword called Al-Makhdam, another called Al-Rasub, and another called Al-Qadib. And the hilt of his sword was adorned with silver. The hadith: "It was from his character to name his mounts, his weapons, and his belongings. The name of his banner was Al-Uqab, and the name of his sword with which he witnessed battles was Dhu al-Fiqar. And he had a sword called Al-Makhdam, another called Al-Rasub, and another called Al-Qadib. And the hilt of his sword was adorned with silver," was reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn Abbas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had a sword whose pommel was of silver and its guard was of silver, and it was called Dha..."

He had a bow called As-Sidad, a quiver named Al-Jam', a coat of mail laced with brass known as Dhat al-Fudul, a spear named An-Nab'ah, a shield called Ad-Dafan, a white buckler known as Muwajjaz, a black horse named As-Sakb, a saddle called Ad-Dajj al-Mu'akhkhar, a gray mule known as Ad-Duldul, a she-camel named Al-Qaswa', a donkey called Ya'fur, a mat known as As-Sakr, a she-goat named Ath-Thamar with a water-skin called As-Sadir, a mirror known as Al-Mir'ah, a pair of scissors named Al-Jami', and a staff of shuhut wood called Al-Mamshuq. Regarding this, Ali ibn Ghurrah ad-Dimashqi is attributed with fabricating hadith, and Ibn 'Adi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

The banner of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was black and was called Al-'Uqab. Abu ash-Shaykh narrated it from the hadith of Al-Hasan as a mursal report. And from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib: The name of the sword of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was Dhu al-Fiqar. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas that he, peace and blessings be upon him, wielded his sword Dhu al-Fiqar on the day of Badr. And Al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Ali within a narration: "and his sword was Dhu al-Fiqar," but it is weak. Ibn Sa'd in At-Tabaqat reported from the narration of Marwan ibn Abi Sa'id ibn al-Mu'alla as a mursal report: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, acquired from the weapons of Banu Qaynuqa' three swords: a sword called Qala'i, a sword named Batar, and a sword named Al-Hatf. He later had Al-Makhdham and Rasub, which he acquired from the Qalas. In its chain is Al-Waqidi. Ibn Abi Khaythamah mentioned in his history that it is said he, peace and blessings be upon him, entered Medina with two swords, one of which was called Al-'Adhb, with which he fought at Badr.

For Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan, and An-Nasa'i, who said it is munkar, from the hadith of Anas: The pommel of the sword of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was of silver, and he used to wear a leather belt with three rings of silver. The hadith "he used to wear a leather belt with three rings of silver" – I have not found an original source for it. For Ibn Sa'd in At-Tabaqat and Abu ash-Shaykh from the narration of Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn al-Husayn as a mursal report: There were two rings of silver on the coat of mail of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and the name of his bow was Al-Katum and his quiver Al-Kafur. The hadith "the name of his bow was Al-Katum and his quiver Al-Kafur" – I have not found an original source for it. It was previously mentioned in the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas that he had a bow called As-Sidad and a quiver named Al-Jam'. Ibn Abi Khaythamah said in his history: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, took from the weapons of Banu Qaynuqa' on the day of Uhud three bows: a bow named Ar-Rawha', a bow of shuhut wood called Al-Bayda', and a yellow bow named As-Safra' from Sab'. The name of his she-camel was Al-Qaswa', which is also called Al-'Adhba', the name of his mule was Ad-Duldul, the name of his donkey was Ya'fur, and the name of his sheep from which he drank milk was 'Uyaynah. The hadith "the name of his she-camel was Al-Qaswa', which is also called Al-'Adhba', the name of his mule was Ad-Duldul, the name of his donkey was Ya'fur, and the name of his sheep from which he drank milk was 'Uyaynah" – part of it was previously mentioned from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas in At-Tabarani. For Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Anas: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had a she-camel called Al-'Adhba'. For Muslim from the hadith of Jabir in the Farewell Pilgrimage: Then he mounted Al-Qaswa'. And Al-Hakim from the hadith of 'Ali: His she-camel Al-Qaswa', his mule Duldul, and his donkey 'Ufayr – the hadith. We narrated it in Fawa'id Ibn ad-Dahdah, where he said: his donkey Ya'fur, and in it: his sheep Barakah. Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Mu'adh: I was riding behind the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, on a donkey called 'Ufayr. For Ibn Sa'd in At-Tabaqat from the narration of Ibrahim ibn 'Abdullah from the offspring of 'Utbah ibn Ghazwan: The milking sheep of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, were seven: 'Ajwah, Zamzam, Saqya, Barakah, Warsah, Ihlam, and Atraf. In its chain is Al-Waqidi. And from the narration of Makhul as a mursal report: He had a sheep named Qamar, and he had an earthenware vessel from which he performed ablution and drank. The hadith "he had an earthenware vessel from which he performed ablution and drank" – I have not found an original source for it. People would send their young children who had understanding to enter upon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and they would not be prevented from him. If they found water in the vessel, they would drink from it and wipe it over their faces and bodies, seeking blessing thereby. A demonstration of his forbearance, peace and blessings be upon him, despite his capability: He, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most forbearing of people – the hadith "he was the most forbearing of people" was previously mentioned – and the most desirous of pardon despite having the capability, until he was brought necklaces of gold and silver and distributed them among his companions. A Bedouin man stood up and said, "O Muhammad, by Allah, if Allah commanded you to be just, I do not see you being just." He said...

Woe unto you! Who will be just if I am not just? If I am not just, then I have indeed failed and lost. When a man said to him, "O Messenger of God, be just," he replied, "Woe unto you! Who will be just if I am not just? If I am not just, then I have indeed failed and lost." Umar stood and said, "Shall I strike his neck, for he is a hypocrite?" He said, "God forbid that people should say I kill my companions." It is narrated from Jabir that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was distributing silver to the people on the day of Khaybar from a cloth held by Bilal. A man said to him, "O Messenger of God, be just." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Woe unto you! Who will be just if I am not just? If I am not just, then I have indeed failed and lost." Umar stood and said, "Shall I strike his neck, for he is a hypocrite?" He said, "God forbid that people should say I kill my companions." Jabir narrated that he was distributing silver to the people on the day of Hunayn from a cloth held by Bilal. A man said, "O Prophet of God, be just." The hadith is narrated by Muslim.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was in a battle when the Muslims were caught off guard. A man came and stood over the head of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, with a sword and said, "Who will protect you from me?" He said, "God." The sword then fell from his hand. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, took the sword and said, "Who will protect you from me?" He said, "Be the best of captors." He said, "Say, 'I bear witness that there is no god but God and that I am the Messenger of God.'" He said, "No, but I will not fight you, nor will I be with you, nor will I be with a people who fight you." He released him. The man came to his companions and said, "I have come to you from the best of people." The hadith states that during a battle, the Muslims were caught off guard. A man came and stood over the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, with a sword. The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Jabir in a similar manner, and it is in the Musnad of Ahmad closer to the wording of the author, naming the man as Ghawrath ibn al-Harith.

Anas narrated that a Jewish woman brought the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, a poisoned sheep for him to eat from. She was brought to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he asked her about that. She said, "I intended to kill you." He said, "God would not give you power over that." They said, "Shall we not kill her?" He said, "No." The hadith of Anas that a Jewish woman brought the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, a poisoned sheep is narrated by Muslim, and it is in Bukhari from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

A man from the Jews bewitched him, and Gabriel, upon him be the best of prayers and peace, informed him of it until he extracted it and untied the knots, and he felt lightness from that. He did not mention that to the Jew nor ever reveal it against him. The hadith that a man from the Jews bewitched him, and Gabriel informed him of it until he extracted it, is narrated by al-Nasa'i with a sound chain from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam. The story of his bewitchment is in the two Sahih collections from the narration of A'ishah with different wording.

Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent me, al-Zubayr, and al-Miqdad and said, "Go until you reach the meadow of Khakh, for there is a woman with a letter. Take it from her." We went until we reached the meadow of Khakh and said, "Bring out the letter." She said, "I have no letter." We said, "You will bring out the letter, or we will strip off your clothes." She brought it out from her hair braid. We brought it to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and it contained from Hatib ibn Abi Balta'ah to some of the polytheists in Mecca, informing them of a matter concerning the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. He said, "O Hatib, what is this?" He said, "O Messenger of God, do not be hasty with me. I was a man attached to my people, and those with you from the emigrants have relatives in Mecca who protect their families. I loved, since I lacked that lineage among them, to have a hand among them by which they would protect my relatives. I did not do this out of disbelief, nor contentment with disbelief after Islam, nor apostasy from my religion." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "He has spoken truthfully to you." Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "Let me strike the neck of this hypocrite." He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "He witnessed Badr. What do you know? Perhaps God, the Exalted, has looked upon the people of Badr and said, 'Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you.'" The hadith of Ali: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent me, al-Zubayr, and al-Miqdad and said, "Go until you reach the meadow of Khakh." The hadith is agreed upon.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, made a distribution, and a man from the Ansar said, "This is a distribution by which the Face of God is not intended." This was mentioned to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and his face reddened. He said, "May God have mercy on my brother Moses; he was harmed with more than this, yet he was patient." The hadith: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, made a distribution, and a man from the Ansar said, "This is a distribution by which the Face of God is not intended." The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.

He, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say, "Let none of you bring me news about any of my companions, for I love to come out to you with a sound heart." The hadith: "Let none of you bring me news about any of my companions, for I love to come out to you with a sound heart," is narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud, who said it is singular from this chain. This clarifies his overlooking, peace and blessings be upon him, of what occurred.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had a delicate complexion and a gentle outward and inward disposition; his anger and his pleasure were known from his face. A hadith states he had a delicate complexion and a gentle outward disposition; his anger was known from his face. Abu al-Shaykh transmitted it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was known by his pleasure and his anger from his face." This has preceded. And when his emotion intensified, he would frequently stroke his noble beard. A hadith states: "When his emotion intensified, he would frequently stroke his noble beard." This has preceded. Abu al-Shaykh transmitted it from the narration of 'A'ishah with a good chain.

He would not confront anyone with what they disliked. A man entered upon him wearing yellow, and he disliked it, but he did not say anything to him until he left. Then he said to some of the people, "If only you were to tell this man to leave off this." A hadith states: "He would not confront anyone with what they disliked. A man entered upon him wearing yellow, and he disliked it, but he did not say anything until he left. Then he said to some of the people, 'If only you were to tell this man to leave off this,' meaning the yellow." Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi in *al-Shama'il*, and al-Nasa'i in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* transmitted it from the narration of Anas, and its chain is weak.

A Bedouin urinated in the mosque in his presence, and the Companions moved to intervene. But he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not interrupt him," meaning do not cut off his urination. Then he said to him, "Verily, these mosques are not suitable for any filth, urine, or excrement." A hadith: "A Bedouin urinated in the mosque in his presence, and the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Do not interrupt him.'" This is agreed upon from the narration of Anas. In one narration: "Make things easy and do not make them difficult."

A Bedouin came to him one day asking him for something, and he, peace and blessings be upon him, gave it to him. Then he said to him, "Have I been good to you?" The Bedouin said, "No, and you have not done well." The Muslims became angry and rose toward him, but he gestured to them to hold back. Then he arose, entered his house, and sent for the Bedouin, giving him something more. Then he said, "Have I been good to you?" He said, "Yes, so may God reward you well from family and clan." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, "You said what you said, and in the hearts of my companions is something from that. If you wish, then say before them what you said before me, so that what is in their hearts against you may depart." He said, "Yes." Then when it was the next day or evening, he came. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "This Bedouin said what he said, so we increased for him, and he claims he is pleased. Is it so?" The Bedouin said, "Yes, so may God reward you well from family and clan." He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "My parable and the parable of this Bedouin is like a man whose she-camel bolted from him. The people followed it, but they only increased it in flight. The owner of the she-camel called out to them, 'Leave me and my she-camel, for I am gentler with her and know better.' The owner went before her, picked for her some plants from the ground, and gently turned her until she came and knelt. Then he put on her saddle and mounted her. Had I left you when the man said what he said, and you had killed him, he would have entered the Fire." A hadith: "A Bedouin came one day asking him for something, and the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, gave it to him. Then he said, 'Have I been good to you?' The Bedouin said, 'No, and you have not done well.'" The lengthy hadith was transmitted by al-Bazzar and Abu al-Shaykh from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.

A clarification of his generosity and munificence, peace and blessings be upon him: He, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most generous of people and the most open-handed. In the month of Ramadan, he was like the sent wind, withholding nothing. A hadith: "He was the most generous of people and the most open-handed, and in the month of Ramadan he was like the sent wind." The two Shaykhs transmitted it from the narration of Anas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was the best of people and the most generous of people." Both of them have from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "He was the most generous of people with good, and he was at his most generous in the month of Ramadan." In it: "When Gabriel met him, he was more generous with good than the sent wind." And when 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, described the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said, "He was the most generous of people in hand, the broadest of people in chest, the most truthful of people in speech, the most faithful in trust, the gentlest in nature, and the noblest of lineage. Whoever saw him suddenly was in awe of him, and whoever associated with him knowing him loved him." His describer says, "I have not seen the like of him before him or after him." A hadith: "When 'Ali described the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, he said, 'He was the most generous of people in hand and the broadest of people in chest...'" Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and said its chain is not continuous.

He was never asked for anything for the sake of Islam except that he gave it. A hadith: "He was never asked for anything for the sake of Islam except that he gave it." This is agreed upon from the narration of Anas. A man came to him and asked him, and he gave him sheep filling the space between two mountains. He returned to his people and said, "Embrace Islam, for Muhammad gives a gift like one who fears no poverty." And he was never asked for anything and said, "No." A hadith: "He was never asked for anything and said, 'No.'" This is agreed upon from the narration of Jabir. Ninety thousand dirhams were brought to him, and he placed them on a mat. Then he stood and distributed them, not turning away any asker until he had finished with them. A hadith: "Ninety thousand dirhams were brought to him, and he placed them on a mat..."

A mat was spread, then he stood to distribute it, and he did not turn away any beggar until he had finished with it. Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Dahhak reported in "Al-Shama'il" from a mursal narration of al-Hasan that when wealth from Bahrain—eighty thousand—was brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, no greater amount of wealth had ever come to him. That day, no one asked him for anything but he gave it, and he did not refuse any beggar, nor did he give to a resident. Al-'Abbas said to him... Al-Bukhari has a ta'liq from a narration of Anas: Wealth from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and it was the greatest wealth ever brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him... In it: He did not see anyone but he gave to him, when al-'Abbas came to him... 'Umar ibn Muhammad al-Bahri connected it in his Sahih. A man came and asked him, and he said, "I have nothing, but purchase on credit for me, and when something comes to us, we will settle it." 'Umar said, "O Messenger of God, God has not burdened you with what you cannot bear." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, disliked that. The man said, "Spend and do not fear diminishment from the Throne." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, smiled and joy was recognized on his face. A narration: A man came to him and asked him, and he said, "I have nothing, but purchase on credit for me, and when something comes to us, we will settle it." 'Umar said, "O Messenger of God, God has not burdened you..." Al-Tirmidhi reported it in "Al-Shama'il" from a narration of 'Umar, in which is Musa ibn 'Alqamah al-Qurwi; none narrated it except his son Harun. When he returned from Hunayn, the Bedouins came asking him until they pressed him against a tree and snatched his cloak. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stood and said, "Give me back my cloak. If I had livestock equal to the number of these thorny trees, I would distribute them among you. Then you would not find me stingy, nor a liar, nor a coward." A narration: When he returned from Hunayn, the Bedouins came asking him until they pressed him against a tree and snatched his cloak... Al-Bukhari reported it from a narration of Jubayr ibn Mut'im.

Clarification of his courage, peace and blessings be upon him: He was the most vigorous and courageous of people. A narration: He was the most vigorous and courageous of people. Al-Darimi reported it from a narration of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain. I have not seen anyone more vigorous, more generous, more courageous, or a better archer than the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. And in the two Shaykhs from a narration of Anas: He was the most courageous of people and the best of people... 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "I saw myself on the day of Badr, and we were taking refuge with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he was the closest of us to the enemy, and he was the most severe in battle that day." A narration of 'Ali: "I saw myself on the day of Badr, and we were taking refuge with the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him..." Abu al-Shaykh reported it in "Akhlaq al-Nabi," peace and blessings be upon him, with a good chain. And he also said, "When the battle grew fierce and the two sides met, we would seek protection with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and no one was closer to the enemy than him." A narration of 'Ali also: "When the battle grew hot and the two sides met, we would seek protection with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him..." Al-Nasa'i reported it with a sound chain, and Muslim has something similar from a narration of al-Bara'. It was said that he, peace and blessings be upon him, spoke little and conversed little, but when he commanded people to fight, he would gird himself and was among the most severe in battle. A narration: He spoke little and conversed little, but when he commanded fighting, he would gird himself... Abu al-Shaykh reported it from a mursal narration of Sa'd ibn 'Iyad al-Thamali. The courageous one was he who was close to him in war due to his proximity to the enemy. A narration: The courageous one was he who was close to him in war... Muslim reported it from a narration of al-Bara': "By God, when the battle grew intense, we would seek protection with him, and the courageous among us was he who aligned with him." And 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, never met a battalion except that he was the first to strike." A narration of 'Imran ibn Husayn: "He never met a battalion except that he was the first to strike." Abu al-Shaykh also reported it, and in it is one I do not know. And they said he was strong in grip. A narration: He was strong in grip. Abu al-Shaykh also reported it from a disconnected narration of Abu Ja'far. And al-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" from a narration of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr: "I was given the strength of forty in grip and intercourse," but its chain is weak. When the polytheists overwhelmed him, he dismounted from his mule and began saying, "I am the Prophet, no lie; I am the son of 'Abd al-Muttalib." No one was seen that day more severe than him. A narration: When the polytheists overwhelmed him, he dismounted and began saying, "I am the Prophet, no lie..." It is agreed upon from a narration of al-Bara', without his saying, "No one was seen that day more severe than him." This addition is from Abu al-Shaykh. And he has from a narration of 'Ali in the story of Badr: "And he was the most severe of people in battle that day."

Clarification of his humility, peace and blessings be upon him: He was the most humble of people despite the loftiness of his station. A narration: He was the most humble of people despite the loftiness of his station. Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Dahhak reported it in "Al-Shama'il" from a narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri in a long description of his attributes, in which he said...

Humble without humiliation, and its chain is weak. Ibn ‘Amir said: I saw him throwing pebbles at the Jamrah upon a grayish-white she-camel, without striking or driving [her], nor saying “Move on, move on.” The hadith: Ibn ‘Amir said: I saw him throwing pebbles at the Jamrah upon a grayish-white she-camel, without striking or driving, nor saying “Move on, move on.” Reported by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa’i, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Qudamah ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Ammar. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan sahih. And in the book of Abu al-Shaykh: Qudamah ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Amir, as mentioned by the author. And he would ride a donkey with a cloak draped over it, and despite that, he would take someone behind him. The hadith: He would ride a donkey with a cloak draped over it, and despite that, he would take someone behind him. Muttafaqun ‘alayh from the hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd. And he would visit the sick, follow funeral processions, and accept the invitation of a slave. The hadith: He would visit the sick, follow funeral processions, and accept the invitation of a slave. Reported by al-Tirmidhi and he deemed it weak, and al-Hakim authenticated its chain from the hadith of Anas, and it has been previously mentioned with an interrupted chain. And he would mend sandals, patch garments, and would work in his house with his family for their needs. The hadith: He would mend sandals, patch garments, and would work in his house with his family for their needs. It is in the Musnad from the hadith of ‘A’ishah, and it has been previously mentioned in the beginning of the Etiquettes of Living. And his Companions would not stand up for him because they knew of his dislike for that. The hadith: His Companions would not stand up for him because they knew of his dislike for that. It is in al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas, and he authenticated it, and it has been previously mentioned in the Etiquettes of Companionship. And he would pass by children and greet them. The hadith: He would pass by children and greet them. Muttafaqun ‘alayh from the hadith of Anas, and it has been previously mentioned in the Etiquettes of Companionship. And a man was brought to him, peace and blessings be upon him, and he trembled out of awe for him, so he said to him: Take it easy, for I am not a king; I am only the son of a woman from Quraysh who eats dried meat. The hadith: A man was brought and he trembled out of awe for him, so he said: Take it easy, for I am not a king; I am only the son of a woman from Quraysh who eats dried meat. Reported by al-Hakim from the hadith of Jarir, and he said: Sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. And he would sit among his Companions, mingling with them as if he were one of them, so a stranger would come and not know which one he was until he asked about him, until they requested of him to sit in a place where the stranger would recognize him, so they built for him a platform of clay, and he would sit on it. The hadith: He would sit with his Companions, mingling with them as if he were one of them, so a stranger would come and not know which one he was. The hadith reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa’i from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Abu Dharr, and it has been previously mentioned. And ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said to him: Eat, may God make me your ransom, while reclining, for it is easier for you. He said: Then he inclined his head until his forehead nearly touched the ground, then said: Rather, I eat as a slave eats, and I sit as a slave sits. The hadith: ‘A’ishah said: Eat, may God make me your ransom, while reclining, for it is easier for you. The hadith reported by Abu al-Shaykh from the narration of ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr from her with a weak chain. And he would not eat on a dining table nor from a small bowl until he met God, the Exalted. The hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, would not eat on a dining table nor from a small bowl until he met God. Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Anas, and it has been previously mentioned in the Etiquettes of Eating. And none of his Companions or others would call him but he would say: At your service. The hadith: And he, peace and blessings be upon him, none of his Companions nor others would call him but he would say: At your service. Reported by Abu Nu’aym in Dala’il al-Nubuwwah from the hadith of ‘A’ishah, and in it is Husayn ibn ‘Alwan, accused of lying. And al-Tabarani in al-Kabir with a good chain from the hadith of Muhammad ibn Hatib in the course of a hadith that a slave woman said: O Messenger of God, so he said: At your service and at your aid. The hadith. And when he sat with people, if they spoke about matters of the Hereafter, he would join them; if they conversed about food or drink, he would converse with them; and if they spoke about worldly matters, he would speak with them, out of kindness to them and humility toward them. The hadith: He, peace and blessings be upon him, when he sat with people, if they spoke about matters of the Hereafter, he would join them; if they conversed about food or drink, he would converse with them. The hadith reported by al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama’il from the hadith of Zayd ibn Thabit without mention of drink, and in it is Sulayman ibn Kharajah, uniquely reported from him by al-Walid ibn Abi al-Walid, and Ibn Hibban mentioned him among the trustworthy. And they would sometimes recite poetry in his presence, and mention things from the affairs of the pre-Islamic era, and they would laugh, so he would smile when they laughed, and he would not rebuke them except from what is forbidden. The hadith: They would sometimes recite poetry in his presence, and mention things from the affairs of the pre-Islamic era. The hadith reported by Muslim from the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah without his saying: And he would not rebuke them except from what is forbidden. A description of his form and character, peace and blessings be upon him. And from the description of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, is that he was not exceedingly tall nor short and stocky, but rather he was of medium stature when he walked alone, and despite that, no one who was considered tall would walk with him except...

The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was of medium height. Sometimes two tall men would stand beside him and he would appear taller than them, yet when they moved away, they would be considered tall while he, peace and blessings be upon him, would be described as of medium stature. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, would say, "All good is placed in the medium stature." A hadith describing the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, states that he was neither exceedingly tall nor short of stature. Abu Nu'aym narrated the full hadith in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* from the narration of 'A'ishah, with additions and omissions, excluding the poetry of Abu Talib that follows, and excluding the statement, "Sometimes he would let his hair fall to his earlobes, making his temples appear radiant," and excluding the statement, "Sometimes he had a broad forehead..." up to "...and he had smooth cheeks." In its chain is Subayh ibn 'Abd Allah al-Farghani, whose hadith is rejected, as al-Khatib said. In the two Sahih collections, from the narration of al-Bara', it states he had hair that reached his earlobes. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi (who graded it *hasan*), and Ibn Majah narrate from the narration of Umm Hani' that he came to Mecca with four braids. Al-Tirmidhi narrates from the narration of 'Ali regarding his description, peace and blessings be upon him: "He had large, intensely black eyes with long eyelashes..." and he said its chain is not continuous. In *al-Shama'il*, from the narration of Ibn Abi Halah: "He had a radiant complexion, a broad forehead, long, arched eyebrows that nearly met without joining, with a vein between them that swelled when he was angry, an aquiline nose, a light upon him that one who did not observe him closely might think he was handsome, with a thick beard, smooth cheeks, a wide mouth, and teeth with slight gaps..." As for his color, he had a radiant complexion, neither dark nor intensely white. Al-*azhar* is a pure white, untinged by yellowness, redness, or any other color. His uncle Abu Talib described him, saying: "And white-faced, one for whom rain is sought by his countenance, a support for orphans, a protection for widows." Ibn Ishaq mentioned it in *al-Sirah*, and in *al-Musnad* from 'A'ishah that she recited this verse while Abu Bakr was judging, and Abu Bakr said, "That is the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him." In its chain is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an, about whom there is differing opinion. Al-Bukhari cited it discontinuously from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Sometimes I would recall the poet's words while looking at the face of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when rain was sought, and it would not descend until every spout overflowed," and he recited it with a sound connected chain. Some described him as having a tinge of redness, saying the tinge of redness was only on what was exposed to the sun and wind, like the face and neck, while the pure radiant part was what was beneath his garments. His sweat, peace and blessings be upon him, on his face was like pearls, more fragrant than the finest musk. As for his hair, it was of medium texture and beauty, neither straight nor tightly curled. When he combed it, it would become as if patterned like sand. It is said his hair reached his shoulders, but the predominant report is that it reached his earlobes. Sometimes he would make it into four braids, each ear emerging between two braids. Sometimes he would let his hair fall to his ears, making his temples appear radiant. His grey hairs on his head and beard were seventeen, never more than that. He, peace and blessings be upon him, was the most handsome of people and the most radiant. No one described him except by likening him to the full moon. His pleasure and anger could be seen in his face due to the clarity of his skin. They would say he was as his companion Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, described him when he said: "Trustworthy, chosen, calling to good, like the light of the moon when darkness departs." He, peace and blessings be upon him, had a broad forehead, with long, arched eyebrows that nearly met. He had a clear space between his eyebrows, as if it were pure silver. His eyes were large and intensely black, with a touch of redness in them. He had such long eyelashes they almost intermingled due to their abundance. He had an aquiline nose, meaning it was straight. He had teeth with slight gaps. When he smiled broadly, his teeth gleamed like lightning. He had the most beautiful lips and the most delicate mouth of Allah's servants. He had smooth, firm cheeks, neither long-faced nor round-faced. He had a thick beard, which he would leave full, and he would trim his mustache. He had the most beautiful neck of Allah's servants, not considered long nor short. The part of his neck exposed to sun and wind was like a silver pitcher tinged with gold, gleaming with the whiteness of silver and the redness of gold. He, peace and blessings be upon him, had a broad chest. The flesh of his body did not protrude unevenly; it was like a mirror in its evenness and the moon in its whiteness. From his chest to his navel was connected by a line of hair, straight like a reed; there was no other hair on his chest or stomach. He had three folds of flesh; his waist-wrapper would cover one and two would show. He had broad shoulders, with hair on them, and large joints, meaning the bone ends of his shoulders, elbows, and hips. He had a broad back between his shoulder blades.

The Seal of Prophethood, located near his right shoulder, bore a dark mole tinged with yellow, surrounded by fine hairs in succession, resembling the forelock of a horse. His upper arms and forearms were robust, with long ulnas and broad palms; his extremities were delicate, his fingers like silver rods. His hand was softer than silk, as if the hand of a perfumer, fragrant whether touched by perfume or not—when someone shook hands with him, the scent lingered throughout the day. Placing his hand on a child’s head, that child would be distinguished among others by the fragrance on his head. His thighs and calves beneath the garment were full, and his physique was balanced, with a fullness of body in his later years. His flesh was firm, nearly as if in its original form, unaffected by the fullness. As for his walk, peace be upon him, he walked as if stepping firmly from rock or descending a slope, taking measured strides, walking with calmness without arrogance—the calmness being a closeness in steps. He, peace be upon him, said, "I am the most similar of people to Adam, peace be upon him, and my father Abraham, peace be upon him, is the most similar to me in form and character." He also said, "I have ten names with my Lord: I am Muhammad, I am Ahmad, I am the Eraser through whom Allah erases disbelief, I am the Final after whom there is none, I am the Gatherer at whose feet Allah will gather the servants, I am the Messenger of Mercy, the Messenger of Repentance, the Messenger of Battles, and the Last in succession—I have followed all people, and I am Qutham." This hadith—"I have ten names with my Lord"—was narrated by Ibn ‘Adi from the narrations of ‘Ali, Jabir, Usamah ibn Zayd, Ibn ‘Abbas, and ‘A’ishah with a weak chain. Abu Nu‘aym in "Al-Dala’il" also narrated from Abu al-Tufayl: "I have ten names with my Lord." Abu al-Tufayl said, "I memorized eight of them," mentioning them with additions and omissions. Sayf ibn Wahb reported that Abu Ja‘far said the two names are Ta-Ha and Ya-Sin, with a weak chain. In the two Sahih collections, from the narration of Jubayr ibn Mut‘im: "I have names: I am Ahmad, I am Muhammad, I am the Gatherer, I am the Eraser, I am the Final." In Muslim, from Abu Musa: "and the Last in succession, the Prophet of Repentance, the Prophet of Mercy." In Ahmad, from Hudhayfah: "and the Prophet of Battles," with a sound chain. Abu al-Bahtari said, "Al-Qutham means the perfect, the comprehensive." Allah knows best.

Explanation of his miracles and signs indicating his truthfulness: Know that whoever witnessed his states, peace be upon him, and listened attentively to reports encompassing his morals, actions, conditions, habits, innate qualities, his governance of various people, his guidance in managing them, his uniting of diverse people, and his leading them to obedience—along with what is recounted of wondrous answers in difficult questions, ingenious arrangements for people’s welfare, and beautiful indications in detailing the apparent aspects of the Shari‘ah, whose subtle intricacies jurists and wise men cannot grasp in their entire lifetimes—would have no doubt that this was not acquired through human capability, but is only conceivable through support from heavenly aid and divine power. All this is inconceivable for a liar or deceiver; rather, his characteristics and states were decisive witnesses to his truthfulness, such that a pure Arab upon seeing him would say, "By Allah, this is not the face of a liar," testifying to his truthfulness merely by his traits—how much more so for one who observed his morals and interacted with him in all his affairs? We have mentioned some of his qualities to recognize the beauty of noble character and to awaken to his truthfulness, peace be upon him, and the loftiness of his station and great status with Allah, for Allah granted him all this while he was an unlettered man who did not engage in learning, read books, travel in pursuit of knowledge, and remained among ignorant Bedouins, an orphan, weak and oppressed. From where, then, did he acquire the beauties of morals and manners, and knowledge of jurisprudential benefits, for example, let alone other sciences, much less knowledge of Allah Almighty, His angels, His books, and other specifics of prophethood, were it not for explicit revelation? And how could human strength independently achieve this? If he had only these apparent matters, it would suffice, yet there appeared from his signs and miracles what leaves no doubt for the discerning. Let us mention from among them what reports have widely conveyed and sound books have contained, indicating their collective aspects without lengthy detail, for Allah broke custom through him on multiple occasions: He split the moon for him in Mecca when Quraysh asked for a sign—the hadith of the splitting of the moon is agreed upon from Ibn Mas‘ud, Ibn ‘Abbas, and Anas. He fed many people in the house of Jabir—the hadith of feeding many in Jabir’s house is agreed upon from his narration—and in the house of Abu Talhah and during the Trench. The hadith of feeding many in Abu Talhah’s house is agreed upon from Anas. Once, he fed eighty people from four mudds of barley and a young goat—the hadith...

He fed eighty men from four mudd measures of barley and a young she-goat, as narrated by al-Isma'ili in his Sahih, and through his chain by al-Bayhaqi in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah from the hadith of Jabir, which mentions they were eight hundred or three hundred. In al-Bukhari's version, the number is not specified. In a narration by Abu Nu'aym in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah, they were a thousand. This refers to a kid goat older than a weanling but not yet mature. Another instance: he fed more than eighty men from barley loaves carried by Anas in his hand, as narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Anas, stating he did so for eighty men, after which the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his household ate and left leftovers. In Abu Nu'aym's narration in Dala'il, about eighty men ate from it, and it is agreed upon that the wording indicates seventy or eighty men. Another time, he fed the entire army from a small amount of dates brought by the daughter of Bashir in her hand, and they all ate until satisfied, with some remaining. The hadith of feeding the army from a small amount of dates brought by the daughter of Bashir in her hand is narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah through Ibn Ishaq from Sa'id ibn Maynah from the daughter of Bashir ibn Sa'd, with a sound chain. Water gushed from between his fingers, peace be upon him, and all the thirsty soldiers drank and performed ablution from a small vessel too narrow for his hand to spread in. The hadith of water gushing from between his fingers, from which the thirsty army drank and performed ablution, is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas, mentioning only ablution. Abu Nu'aym narrates from his hadith: he went to Quba' and was brought a small vessel from one of their houses, then said, "Come and drink." Anas said, "My eyes saw water gushing from between his fingers," and the vessel did not return until they had quenched their thirst, with a sound chain. Al-Bazzar and al-Tabarani in al-Kabir narrate from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: during a journey, his companions complained of thirst, so he asked for water. They brought a container with water, and he placed his hand in it, causing water to gush from between his fingers. He poured his ablution water into the dry spring of Tabuk and another time into the well of Hudaybiyyah, causing both to overflow. From the spring of Tabuk, thousands of soldiers drank until satisfied, and from the well of Hudaybiyyah, one thousand five hundred drank, though it previously had no water. The hadith of him pouring his ablution water into the dry spring of Tabuk and into the well of Hudaybiyyah, causing them to overflow, is narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Mu'adh regarding Tabuk and from the hadith of Salamah ibn al-Akwa' regarding Hudaybiyyah, mentioning he either supplicated or spat into it, causing it to overflow. Al-Bukhari narrates from the hadith of al-Bara' that he performed ablution and poured it in. Both hadiths mention they were fourteen hundred, as in al-Bukhari from the hadith of al-Bara', and similarly from the hadith of Jabir. Al-Bayhaqi states this is more accurate. Both also narrate from his hadith one thousand five hundred, and Muslim from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa one thousand three hundred. He ordered 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, to provision four hundred riders from dates gathered like a camel's kneeling place, and he provisioned them all, with some remaining stored. The hadith of ordering 'Umar to provision four hundred riders from dates like a camel's kneeling place is narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of al-Nu'man ibn Muqarrin and Dukayn ibn Sa'id with two sound chains; the original hadith of Dukayn in Abu Dawud is abbreviated without specifying their number. He threw a handful of dust at the army, blinding their eyes, and the Quran was revealed regarding this: "You did not throw when you threw, but God threw." The hadith of him throwing a handful of dust at the army, blinding their eyes, is narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Salamah ibn al-Akwa' without mention of the verse's revelation; Ibn Mardawayh narrates it in his tafsir from the hadith of Jabir and Ibn 'Abbas. God Almighty nullified soothsaying with his mission, peace be upon him, causing it to cease, though it had been prevalent. The hadith of nullifying soothsaying with his mission is narrated by al-Khara'iti from the hadith of Mirdas ibn Qays al-Dusi, who said he was present with the Prophet, peace be upon him, and soothsaying was mentioned, along with its change at his emergence. Abu Nu'aym in Dala'il narrates from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas about the jinn eavesdropping and relaying to their allies, but when Muhammad, peace be upon him, was sent, they were pelted with stars; its origin is in al-Bukhari without this context. The palm trunk he used to preach from groaned when the pulpit was made for him, heard by all his companions like the sound of camels, and he embraced it until it quieted. The hadith of the groaning trunk is narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Jabir and Sahl ibn Sa'd. He challenged the Jews to wish for death, informing them they would not do so, and they were prevented from uttering it, failing in the attempt. The hadith of challenging the Jews to wish for death.

And He informed them that they would not wish for death—a hadith narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas: “If the Jews had wished for death, they would have died.” Another hadith is reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Dala’il from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas: “No man among you would say it except that his saliva would choke him and he would die on the spot.” Yet they refused to do so—though its chain is weak. This is mentioned in a surah recited in all mosques of Islam, from the east of the earth to its west, on Friday aloud, honoring the verse within it.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, informed of unseen matters and warned ‘Uthman that a trial would befall him, after which Paradise awaits—a hadith of his informing that ‘Uthman would be afflicted by a trial, after which is Paradise, agreed upon from the narration of Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari. And that ‘Ammar would be killed by the rebellious faction—a hadith of his informing that ‘Ammar would be killed by the rebellious faction, narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Qatadah and Umm Salamah, and by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Sa‘id. And that al-Hasan would reconcile two great Muslim factions through him—a hadith of his informing that al-Hasan would reconcile two great Muslim factions through him, narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Bakrah.

And He, peace and blessings be upon him, informed about a man who fought in the path of God that he is among the people of Hell—a hadith of his informing about a man who fought in the path of God that he is among the people of Hell, agreed upon from the narrations of Abu Hurayrah and Sahl ibn Sa‘d. Thus it became clear that the man had killed himself.

All these are divine matters that cannot be known at all by any means of prior knowledge—not by stars, nor by unveiling, nor by divination, nor by omen, but only by God Almighty informing him and revealing to him.

And Suraqah ibn Malik followed him, and his horse’s forelegs sank into the earth, and smoke followed him until he cried for help, so he prayed for him and the horse was freed. And He warned him that bracelets of Chosroes would be placed on his arms—a hadith of Suraqah ibn Malik following him in the story of the migration, where his horse’s forelegs sank into the earth, agreed upon from the narration of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq. And so it came to pass.

And He informed of the killing of al-Aswad al-‘Ansi, the impostor, on the night he was killed while he was in Sana‘a, Yemen, and informed of who killed him—a hadith of his informing of the killing of al-Aswad al-‘Ansi on the night he was killed while he was in Sana‘a, Yemen, and who killed him, mentioned in the biographies. The one who killed him was Fayruz al-Daylami. And in the two Sahihs from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: “While I was sleeping, I saw on my hands two bracelets of gold, and I was concerned about them, so it was revealed to me in the dream to blow on them, so I blew and they flew away. I interpreted them as two impostors who would appear after me.” One of them was al-‘Ansi, the ruler of Sana‘a.

And He went out to a hundred men of Quraysh waiting for him and placed dust on their heads without them seeing him—a hadith of his going out to a hundred men of Quraysh waiting for him, placing dust on their heads without them seeing him, narrated by Ibn Mardawayh with a weak chain from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas, though it does not mention they were a hundred. Similarly, Ibn Ishaq narrated it from the narration of Muhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi as mursal.

And the camel complained to him in the presence of his companions and submitted to him—a hadith of the camel complaining to him and submitting to him, narrated by Abu Dawud from the narration of ‘Abdullah ibn Ja‘far within a longer hadith: “It complained to me that you starve it and exhaust it.” The beginning of the hadith is in Muslim without mention of the camel story.

And He said to a group of his companions gathered together: “One of you has a molar in Hell like Uhud.” They all died upright except one who apostatized and was killed as an apostate—a hadith of his saying to a group of his companions: “One of you has a molar in Hell like Uhud,” mentioned by al-Daraqutni in al-Mu’talif wa al-Mukhtalif from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without a chain, in the biography of Rijal ibn ‘Unfurah—he is the one who apostatized. ‘Abd al-Ghani mentioned it with the letter jim, and al-Waqidi and al-Mada’ini preceded him in that. The first is more accurate and widespread, as mentioned by al-Daraqutni and Ibn Makula. Al-Tabarani connected it from the narration of Rafi‘ ibn Khadij with the wording: “One of these men is in Hell,” and in it is al-Waqidi from ‘Abdullah ibn Nuh, who is abandoned.

And He said to others among them: “The last of you to die is in Hell.” So the last of them to die fell into Hell and was burned therein and died—a hadith of his saying to others among them: “The last of you to die is in Hell,” so the last of them to die fell into a fire, was burned, and died, narrated by al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi in al-Dala’il from the narration of Ibn Mahdurah. In al-Bayhaqi’s version, the last of them to die was Samurah ibn Jundub, without mention of burning. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah similarly, and its narrators are trustworthy. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said he fell into a pot full of hot water and died, narrating that with a connected chain except that it contains Dawud ibn al-Mukhabbir, whom the majority consider weak.

And He called two trees and they came to him and joined together, then He commanded them and they separated. And He, peace and blessings be upon him, was of medium height, yet when He walked with tall people, He matched them—a hadith of his calling two trees and they came to him and joined, then He commanded them and they separated, narrated by Ahmad from the narration of ‘Ali ibn Murrah with a sound chain. And He, peace and blessings be upon him, called...

The Christians were called to the mutual imprecation, but they refrained. The Prophet, peace be upon him, made known to them that if they were to do that, they would perish. Thus they recognized the truth of his statement and held back. A hadith: He called the Christians to the mutual imprecation and informed them that if they did that they would perish, so they refrained. Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas within a longer narration: "Had those who challenged the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to the imprecation gone forth, they would have returned finding neither property nor family."

'Amir ibn al-Tufayl ibn Malik and Arbad ibn Qays came to him—they were the knights of the Arabs and their most treacherous, intent on killing him, peace be upon him—but they were prevented from that.

A hadith: 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl ibn Malik and Arbad ibn Qays came to him, they being the knights of the Arabs and their most treacherous, intent on killing him, but they were prevented from that. Al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Awsat* and *al-Akbar* from the lengthy hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain.

And he, peace be upon him, informed that he would kill Ubayy ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi. He scratched him a slight scratch on the day of Uhud, and it became the cause of his death. A hadith concerning his informing that he would kill Ubayy ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi: he scratched him a slight scratch on the day of Uhud and it became the cause of his death. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* from the narration of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and from the narration of 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr as a *mursal* report.

Poisoned food was presented to him, peace be upon him. The one who ate it with him died, while he, peace be upon him, lived for four years after it, and the poisoned foreleg spoke to him. A hadith: Poisoned food was presented to him; the one who ate it with him died, and he lived for four years after it, and the poisoned foreleg spoke to him. Abu Dawud narrated it from the hadith of Jabir in a *mursal* narration of his stating that the one who died was Bishr ibn al-Bara'. In the two *Sahih* collections, from the hadith of Anas: "A Jewish woman brought a poisoned sheep to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he ate from it..." The hadith includes: "I continued to recognize it in the molars of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him."

And he, peace be upon him, informed on the day of Badr of the places where the chieftains of Quraysh would fall, and he pointed out their specific places, man by man. Not one of them deviated from that spot. A hadith concerning his informing, peace be upon him, on the day of Badr of the places where the chieftains of Quraysh would fall. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab.

And the earth was folded up for him so that he saw its eastern and western regions, and he informed that the dominion of his community would reach what had been folded up for him of it. And so it was, for their dominion reached from the farthest east in the lands of the Turks to the farthest west at the sea of al-Andalus and the lands of the Berbers. They did not expand in the south or the north exactly as he, peace be upon him, had informed, precisely so. A hadith: The earth was folded up for him, its eastern and western regions, and he informed that the dominion of his community would reach what had been folded up for him of it. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah and Fatimah as well.

And he informed his daughter Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, that she would be the first of his family to join him.

A hadith: He informed his wives that the one with the longest hands would be the quickest to join him, and it was Zaynab... Muslim narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

And he wiped the udder of a dry sheep that had no milk, and it flowed with milk. A hadith: He wiped the udder of a dry sheep that had no milk, and it flowed. That was the cause of Ibn Mas'ud's acceptance of Islam.

He did that another time in the tent of Umm Ma'bad al-Khuza'iyyah.

Abu Nu'aym and al-Bayhaqi both narrated it in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* from the hadith of Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man, who was the one whose eye fell out. In a narration of al-Bayhaqi, it was at Badr; in a narration of Abu Nu'aym, it was at Uhud, and there is inconsistency in its chain. Similarly, al-Bayhaqi narrated it therein from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.

The tasbīḥ of food before him was narrated by al-Bukhārī from the ḥadīth of Ibn Masʿūd. And the leg of one of his Companions (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) was injured, so he wiped it with his hand and it was healed instantly—a ḥadīth. The leg of one of his Companions was injured, so he wiped it with his hand and it was healed instantly, narrated by al-Bukhārī in the story of the killing of Abū Rāfiʿ. And when the army’s provisions were scarce while he (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) was with them, he called for all that remained, and a very small amount was gathered. He invoked blessings upon it, then commanded them to take from it, and there was no vessel in the camp that was not filled from that—a ḥadīth. When the army’s provisions were scarce with him, he called for what remained, and a small amount was gathered, so he invoked blessings upon it—a ḥadīth agreed upon from the ḥadīth of Salama ibn al-Akwaʿ. And al-Ḥakam ibn al-ʿĀṣ ibn Wāʾil narrated his saying—al-Ḥakam ibn al-ʿĀṣ ibn Wāʾil, thus in the copies, and the correct version as in the commentator is al-Ḥakam ibn al-ʿĀṣ ibn Umayya ibn ʿAbd Shams, note—mocking his gait (may Allah bless him and grant him peace), so he (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) said, “Be like that,” and he continued to stumble until he died—a ḥadīth. Al-Ḥakam ibn al-ʿĀṣ narrated mocking his gait, so he said, “Be like that”—the ḥadīth narrated by al-Bayhaqī in al-Dalāʾil from the ḥadīth of Hind ibn Khudayj with a sound chain, and al-Ḥākim in al-Mustadrak from the ḥadīth of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr similarly, though he did not name al-Ḥakam and said the chain is sound. And he (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) proposed to a woman, so her father said to him, “She has leprosy,” as a refusal of his proposal and an excuse, though she did not have leprosy. So he (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) said, “Let it be so,” and the woman became leprous—a ḥadīth. He proposed to a woman, so her father said, “She has leprosy,” as a refusal of his proposal and an excuse, though she did not have leprosy, so he said, “Let it be so,” and she became leprous. Ibn al-Jawzī mentioned her in al-Talqīḥ and named her Jamra bint al-Ḥārith ibn ʿAwf al-Muzanī, and al-Dimyāṭī followed him in that. She became leprous, and she is the mother of Shaybān ibn al-Barṣāʾ al-Shāʿir, among other such signs and miracles of his (may Allah bless him and grant him peace). We have only limited ourselves to what is widely transmitted. And whoever doubts the breaking of norms at his hand and claims that these individual incidents were not transmitted through mass transmission—indeed, only the Qurʾān is mass-transmitted—is like one who doubts the bravery of ʿAlī (may Allah be pleased with him) and the generosity of Ḥātim al-Ṭāʾī. It is known that the individual incidents of their lives are not mass-transmitted, but the totality of incidents yields necessary knowledge. Then there is no dispute regarding the mass transmission of the Qurʾān, which is the greatest, enduring miracle among creation, and no prophet has an enduring miracle besides it (may Allah bless him and grant him peace), since the Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) challenged with it the most eloquent of creation and the most articulate Arabs, and the Arabian Peninsula at that time was filled with thousands of them, and eloquence was their craft, their arena of competition, and their pride. He proclaimed among them to bring the like of it, even if they aided one another, and he said this to incapacitate them, so they were incapable of that and turned away from it, even exposing themselves to killing and their women and children to captivity, yet they could not produce a match nor find fault in its weight and beauty. Then it spread after him across the regions of the world, east and west, century after century, and era after era, and today nearly five hundred years have passed since its revelation, yet no one has been able to match it. How great is the foolishness of one who reflects upon his states, then his words, then his actions, then his character, then his miracles, then the continuity of his law until now, then its spread across the regions of the world, then the submission of the kings of the earth to it in his time and after his time despite his weakness and orphanhood, yet still doubts in his truthfulness. And how great is the success of one who believed in him, affirmed his truth, and followed him in all that came from him and went to him. So we ask Allah the Exalted to grant us success in emulating him in character, actions, states, and words, by His grace and the vastness of His bounty. The second part of the book is completed, and the third part follows, containing the quarter of the destructive matters.
