The Book of the Secrets of Zakat  
Being the Fifth Book of the Quarter of Worship  
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful  

Praise be to God, who gives happiness and misery, who causes death and life, who makes laugh and weep, who brings into existence and annihilates, who impoverishes and enriches, who harms and grants sufficiency; who created living beings from a drop of fluid, then distinguished Himself from creation by the attribute of self-sufficiency; then favored some of His servants with excellence, showering upon them from His bounty what He wills—enriching whom He pleases and making independent, while making needy whom He deprives of provision and leaves wanting—as a manifestation of trial and testing. Then He made Zakat a foundation and structure for the religion, and made clear that by His grace, those among His servants who purify themselves are purified, and from His abundance, the wealth of those who give is purified. And blessings upon Muhammad, the Chosen, master of mankind and sun of guidance, and upon his family and companions, those distinguished with knowledge and piety.  

Now then: God Almighty has made Zakat one of the pillars of Islam and coupled its mention with prayer, which is the highest of signs, saying, “And establish prayer and give Zakat” (Quran 2:83). And He said, “Islam is built upon five: testifying that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger, establishing prayer, giving Zakat…” And He emphasized the warning for those negligent in it, saying, “And those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of God—give them tidings of a painful punishment” (Quran 9:34). The meaning of spending in the way of God is discharging the due of Zakat. Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays said: I was with a group of Quraysh when Abu Dharr passed by and said, “Give glad tidings to the hoarders: a branding iron heated in fire will be placed on their backs until it emerges from their chests, and placed on their chests until it emerges from their backs.” In another narration: It will be placed on the nipple of one of them until it emerges from the top of his shoulder, and placed on the top of his shoulder until it emerges from his nipple, and he will tremble. And Abu Dharr said: I came to the Messenger of God while he was sitting in the shade of the Kaaba, and when he saw me he said, “They are the greatest losers, by the Lord of the Kaaba.” I said, “Who are they?” He said, “Those with the most wealth, except for those who say like this and like this”—meaning in front, behind, to the right, and to the left—“and few are they. There is no owner of camels, cattle, or sheep who does not pay their Zakat, except that they will come on the Day of Resurrection as large and fat as they ever were, butting him with their horns and trampling him with their hooves. Whenever the last of them passes, the first returns, until judgment is passed among people.”  

Since this severity is established in the two Sahih collections, it has become among the important matters of the religion to uncover the secrets of Zakat, its apparent and hidden conditions, and its outward and inward meanings—while limiting ourselves to what one cannot do without knowing: the payer of Zakat and the receiver. This will be clarified in four chapters.  

Chapter One: On the types of Zakat and the causes of its obligation.  
Chapter Two: Its manners and its outward and inward conditions.  
Chapter Three: On the receiver and the conditions of his eligibility and the manners of receiving.  
Chapter Four: On voluntary charity and its merit.  

(Chapter One: On the types of Zakat and the causes of its obligation)  

Zakat, with regard to its objects, is of six types: Zakat on livestock, on gold and silver, on trade goods, on treasure troves and minerals, on agricultural produce, and the Zakat of breaking the fast (Fitr).  

(The First Type: Zakat on Livestock)  

This Zakat, and others, are only obligatory upon a free Muslim. Puberty is not a condition; rather, it is obligatory on the wealth of a child and an insane person—this is a condition regarding the one upon whom it is due. As for the wealth, its conditions are five: that it be grazing livestock, remaining for a full year, reaching the minimum threshold (nisab), and owned completely.  

The first condition: that it be livestock. Thus, Zakat is only due on camels, cattle, and sheep. As for horses, mules, donkeys, and crossbreeds between gazelles and sheep, there is no Zakat on them.  

The second condition: grazing. There is no Zakat on animals fed by hand. If they graze at one time and are fed at another, such that their expense becomes apparent, then there is no Zakat on them.  

The third condition: the passage of a year. The Messenger of God said, “There is no Zakat on wealth until a year has passed over it.” Excepted from this is the offspring of the wealth, for it follows the ruling of the original wealth, and Zakat becomes due on it based on the year of the original. If one sells the wealth during the year or gives it away, the year is interrupted.  

The fourth condition: complete ownership and control. Thus, Zakat is due on mortgaged livestock, because the owner has restricted himself in it. It is not due on lost or usurped property, unless it is returned with all its growth; then Zakat for the past period becomes due upon its return. If one has a debt that consumes all his wealth, there is no Zakat upon him, for he is not wealthy with it, since wealth is what exceeds one’s need.  

The fifth condition: reaching the full nisab. As for camels, there is nothing due until they reach five; then for five, a one-year-old sheep is due. A one-year-old is that which is in its second year. Or a two-year-old goat, which is that in its third year. And for ten…

For two hundred (camels), there are four sheep. In fifteen (camels), there are three sheep. In twenty, four sheep. In twenty-five, a *bint makhāḍ* (a she-camel that has entered its second year). If there is no *bint makhāḍ* in his wealth, then a *ibn labūn* (a male camel in its third year) is taken, provided he is capable of purchasing it. In thirty-six, a *bint labūn* (a she-camel in its third year). Then, when it reaches forty-six, a *ḥiqqah* (a she-camel in its fourth year) is due. When it reaches sixty-one, a *jadhaʿah* (a she-camel in its fifth year) is due. When it reaches seventy-six, two *bint labūn* are due. When it reaches ninety-one, two *ḥiqqah* are due. When it reaches one hundred and twenty-one, three *bint labūn* are due. When it reaches one hundred and thirty, the calculation becomes fixed: for every fifty, a *ḥiqqah*, and for every forty, a *bint labūn*.

As for cattle, there is nothing due until they reach thirty, then a *tabīʿ* (a bull in its second year) is due. Then, in forty, a *musinnah* (a cow in its third year) is due. Then, in sixty, two *tabīʿ* are due. After that, the calculation becomes fixed: for every forty, a *musinnah*, and for every thirty, a *tabīʿ*.

As for sheep, there is no zakah due until they reach forty, then one *jadhaʿah* from the sheep (meaning a ewe in its first year) or a *thaniyyah* from the goats (meaning a goat in its second year) is due. Then, nothing is due until they reach one hundred and twenty-one, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred and one. In that, three sheep are due, up to four hundred. In that, four sheep are due. Then the calculation becomes fixed: for every hundred, one sheep.

The charity for partners is like the charity of a single owner regarding the minimum threshold (niṣāb). If there are forty sheep between two men, one sheep is due. If there are one hundred and twenty sheep between three individuals, one sheep is due upon all of them. Partnership of proximity is like partnership of joint ownership, but it is stipulated that they pasture together, water together, milk together, graze together, have the pasture together, have the mating of the stud together, and that they are both from those liable for zakah. There is no ruling for partnership with a *dhimmi* or a *mukātab*. Whenever the due for camels is reduced from one age category to a lower one, it is permissible as long as it does not go below a *bint makhāḍ* in the reduction. However, compensation for the age for one year is added to it: two sheep or twenty dirhams; and for two years: four sheep or forty dirhams. And he may go up in the age category as long as he does not exceed a *jadhaʿah* in the increase, and he takes the compensation from the collectors from the public treasury. A sick animal is not taken in zakah if some of the wealth is healthy, even if only one. The best is taken from the best, and the worst from the worst. The *akūlah* (animal kept for slaughter), the *mākhiḍ* (pregnant animal), the stud, and the *ghirā' al-māl* (the main breeding animal) are not taken.

(The Second Category: Zakah on Tithed Produce)

A tenth is obligatory on every cultivated, edible crop that reaches eight hundred *mann*. There is nothing on less than that, nor on fruits and cotton, but on grains that are edible, and on dates and raisins. It is considered that they be eight hundred *mann* of dates or raisins, not fresh dates and grapes. That is given out after drying. The wealth of one partner is completed by the wealth of the other in a partnership of joint ownership, like an orchard shared between heirs; if they collectively have eight hundred *mann* of raisins, eighty *mann* of raisins are obligatory upon all of them according to their shares. Partnership of proximity is not considered in this. The minimum threshold for wheat is not completed by barley, but the minimum threshold for barley is completed by *salt* (a type of barley), for it is a type of it. This is the measure of the obligation if it is irrigated by flowing water or a canal. If it is irrigated by drawing water or a waterwheel, half of the tenth is obligatory. If both methods are combined, the predominant one is considered. As for the description of what is due: dry dates, dry raisins, and dry grain after purification. Grapes and fresh dates are not taken except if a blight befalls the trees and the interest lies in cutting them before full ripening; then the fresh dates are measured, nine for the owner and one for the poor. Our saying that division is a sale does not prevent this division; rather, concession is given in such a case due to need. The time of obligation is when goodness appears in the fruits and the grain hardens. The time of payment is after drying.

(The Third Category: Zakah on the Two Currencies)

When a full lunar year has passed upon a weight of two hundred dirhams of pure silver by the weight of Mecca, five dirhams are due, which is one-fortieth of the total. Whatever exceeds that is according to its calculation, even if one dirham. The minimum threshold for gold is twenty *mithqāl* of pure gold by the weight of Mecca; one-fortieth of it is due, and whatever exceeds that is according to its calculation. If it falls short of the minimum threshold by a single grain, no zakah is due. It is obligatory upon one who has adulterated dirhams if they contain this amount of pure silver. Zakah is obligatory on raw gold and silver, and on prohibited ornaments like vessels of gold and silver, and gold mounts for men. It is not obligatory on permissible ornaments. It is obligatory on a debt owed by a solvent debtor, but it becomes obligatory upon collection. If it is deferred, it is not obligatory except when the term falls due.

(The Fourth Category: Zakah on Trade Goods)

It is like zakah on the two currencies. The lunar year begins from the time of possessing the currency with which the purchase was made.

If the merchandise itself constitutes the full zakat threshold, then [the calculation proceeds]. If it is less than the threshold, or if one purchases goods with the intention of trade, the zakat year begins from the time of purchase. Zakat is paid based on the prevalent currency of the land, by which the goods are valued. However, if the medium used for the purchase was itself currency and it constituted a full threshold, then valuation by that medium is preferable to using the local currency. As for one who intends trade from wealth originally meant for personal use, the zakat year does not commence merely by his intention until he actually purchases something with it. Whenever one abandons the intention of trade before the completion of the zakat year, the obligation of zakat lapses. It is preferable to pay the zakat for that year. Any profit accruing to the merchandise at the end of the zakat year is subject to zakat according to the cycle of the principal capital; a new cycle is not initiated for it, similar to the ruling for offspring [of livestock]. The wealth of money-changers does not have its cycle broken by the ongoing exchanges between them, as with other trades. The zakat on the profit from a *qirad* (commenda) capital is upon the agent, even if before division. This is the most analytically sound opinion.
                        (The Fifth Category: Treasure Trove and Minerals)
   Treasure trove (*rikaz*) is wealth buried in the pre-Islamic period and found in land over which Islamic ownership has not been established. The finder must pay one-fifth of any gold or silver therein, and the zakat year is not a condition. It is also preferable not to consider the minimum threshold (*nisab*), because the obligation of the fifth strengthens its resemblance to spoils of war. However, considering the threshold is also not far-fetched, because its expenditure is that of zakat, and therefore, according to the correct view, it is specifically for gold and silver. As for minerals (*ma'adin*), there is no zakat on what is extracted from them except for gold and silver. For these, after smelting and purification, one-quarter of one-tenth (i.e., 2.5%) is due according to the sounder of two opinions. Based on this, the threshold is considered, and concerning the zakat year there are two opinions. According to one opinion, one-fifth is obligatory, and based on this the year is not considered, and concerning the threshold there are two opinions. The more analogous view—and God knows best—is to align the amount due with the zakat on trade goods, for it is a type of acquisition. Concerning the zakat year for tithed crops (*'ushur*), it is not considered because it is the actual produce itself. The threshold is considered as with tithed crops. The cautious approach is to give one-fifth from the little and the much, and from the actual gold and silver as well, to depart from the ambiguity of these differences, for they are probabilities close to contradiction, and issuing a definitive legal verdict therein is perilous due to the conflict of uncertainties.
                        (The Sixth Category: The Charity of Breaking the Fast)
   It is obligatory by the declaration of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) upon every Muslim who has surplus beyond his sustenance and the sustenance of those he supports on the day of *Eid al-Fitr* and its night: one *sa'* of that which is staple food, according to the *sa'* of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), which is two and one-third *mann*. He gives it from the type of his staple food or from what is better than it. If his staple is wheat, barley is not permissible. If his staple consists of different grains, he chooses the best of them, and whichever of them he gives suffices. Its distribution is like the distribution of wealth zakat: it necessitates encompassing the categories [of eligible recipients], and it is not permissible to give flour or parched barley flour. It is obligatory upon a Muslim man to give the *fitrah* for his wife, his slaves, his children, and every relative whom he supports—meaning those whose maintenance is obligatory upon him, such as parents and children. He (peace be upon him) said: "Give the charity of breaking the fast for those whom you support." The charity for a jointly owned slave is obligatory upon both partners. The charity for a disbelieving slave is not obligatory. If a wife volunteers to give on her own behalf, it suffices her. The husband may give on her behalf without her permission. If he has surplus enough to give for some of them, he gives for some of them, and the most deserving of priority is the one whose maintenance is most pressing. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) gave priority to the maintenance of a child over the maintenance of a wife, and her maintenance over the maintenance of a servant. These are legal rulings which the well-off must know. Rare occurrences outside of this may confront him, so he may rely therein on seeking a formal legal opinion (*istifta'*) when the incident occurs, after having encompassed this amount [of knowledge].
              (The Second Chapter: On Payment and Its Internal and External Conditions)
   Know that five matters are obligatory upon the one paying zakat: The First: Intention (*niyyah*). It is that he intends in his heart the obligatory zakat. It is recommended (*mustahabb*) for him to specify the wealth. If he has absent wealth and says, "This is from my absent wealth, if it is safe, otherwise it is a voluntary charity," it is permissible, because if he does not specify it, it is likewise upon its general designation. The intention of a guardian stands in place of the intention of an insane person or a child. The intention of the ruler stands in place of the intention of an owner who refuses to pay zakat, but in the apparent ruling of this world—meaning in cutting off legal claim against him—not in the Hereafter. Rather, his liability remains encumbered until he recommences the zakat. If he appoints an agent to pay the zakat and he intends at the time of appointment, or he appoints the agent to form the intention, it suffices him, because appointing him for the intention *is* the intention. The Second: Promptness immediately after the completion of the zakat year. For the *zakat al-fitr*, one must not delay it beyond the day of *Eid al-Fitr*. The time of its obligation begins at sunset on the last day of Ramadan, and the time for advancing it is the entire month of Ramadan. Whoever delays the zakat on his wealth while able sins, and it is not waived from him by the loss of his wealth and his ability to hand it to an eligible recipient. If he delayed due to the absence of an eligible recipient and his wealth perished, the zakat is waived from him. Advancing zakat is permissible on the condition that it occurs after the completeness of the threshold and the commencement of the zakat year. It is permissible to advance the zakat for two years. Whenever one advances it and then dies...

If the poor person dies before the year's completion, apostatizes, or becomes wealthy through means other than what was advanced to him, or if the owner's wealth perishes or he dies, then what was given is not considered zakah, and its recovery is not possible unless the payment was stipulated with a condition of recovery. Therefore, let the one who advances payment be mindful of the final outcomes and the safety of the consequence. Third: He must not give an equivalent in value, but rather give what is explicitly stipulated. Thus, it is not valid to give silver in place of gold, nor gold in place of silver, even if it exceeds it in value. Perhaps some who do not grasp the intent of al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, are lenient in this and consider the objective of alleviating need, but how far this is from attainment! For alleviating need is an objective, but it is not the sole objective. Rather, the obligations of the Sacred Law are of three categories: One category is pure devotion, with no room for personal interests or purposes therein, such as the stoning of the pillars, for instance, as there is no interest of the pillar in the pebbles reaching it. Thus, the aim of the Sacred Law therein is testing through action, so that the servant manifests his servitude and bondage by doing what has no rational meaning to him. For what has a rational meaning may be assisted by natural inclination and called to by it, and thus pure servitude and bondage would not be manifested by it, since bondage is manifested by movement being solely for the sake of obeying the command of the One worshipped, not for another meaning. Most acts of Hajj are likewise, and for this reason he, peace be upon him, said in his state of consecration: "At Your service for a Hajj in truth, devotion, and servitude," indicating that this is a manifestation of bondage through submission to the mere command and compliance as commanded, without the intellect finding familiarity in what inclines toward it and urges it. The second category: Among the obligations of the Sacred Law is that whose objective is a rational interest, and devotion is not intended from it, such as repaying the debts of people and returning usurped property. Thus, no fault is considered in its performance and intention; whenever the right reaches its rightful claimant, whether by the claimant taking it or by a substitute with his consent, the obligation is fulfilled and the address of the Sacred Law ceases. These are two categories with no complexity, which all people can comprehend. The third category is the composite, which intends both matters: the interest of the servants and testing the obligated person through enslavement. Thus, it combines the devotion of stoning the pillars and the interest of restoring rights. This is a category that is in itself rational. If the Sacred Law comes with it, combining both meanings is obligatory, and the more subtle of the two meanings—devotion and enslavement—should not be forgotten due to the more apparent one. Perhaps the more subtle is the more important. Zakāh is of this kind, and none other than al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, paid attention to it. The interest of the poor person is intended in alleviating need, and this is clear and foremost in understandings. The right of devotion in following the details is intended by the Sacred Law, and by considering it, zakāh became paired with prayer and Hajj in being among the pillars of Islam. There is no doubt that the obligated person faces toil in distinguishing the categories of his wealth, giving the due portion from each type, kind, and description of his wealth, then distributing it among the eight categories as will come. Leniency in this does not harm the interest of the poor person, but it harms the devotion. It indicates that devotion is intended by specifying the types; matters we have mentioned in the books of juristic differences among the legal rulings. Among the clearest is that the Sacred Law obligated a sheep for five camels, shifting from camels to a sheep, and did not shift to the two forms of currency or valuation. Even if it is presumed that this was due to the scarcity of currency in the hands of the Arabs, it is invalidated by His mentioning twenty dirhams in compensation along with two sheep. He did not mention in the compensation the amount of deficiency in value, but valued it at twenty dirhams and two sheep, even though garments and all chattels are in the same meaning. This and similar specifications indicate that zakāh was not left devoid of devotional acts as in Hajj, but combined both meanings. Weak minds fall short of comprehending composites, and this is the nature of error therein. Fourth: He must not transfer the charity to another town, for the needy in every town extend to its wealth, and in transfer there is disappointment of expectations. If he does so, it suffices him according to one opinion, but avoiding the semblance of disagreement is preferable. So let him give the zakāh of each wealth in that town. Then there is no harm in giving it to strangers in that town. Fifth: He must divide his wealth according to the number of categories present in his town, for encompassing the categories is obligatory, as indicated by the apparent meaning of His saying, exalted is He: "Alms are only for the poor and the needy..." (Qur'an 9:60). This resembles the statement of a sick person: "Only a third of my wealth is for the poor and the needy," which necessitates sharing in ownership. In acts of worship, one should be cautious of rushing to apparent meanings. Among the eight, two categories are absent in most lands: those whose hearts are to be reconciled and those employed to collect zakāh. In all lands, four categories are found: the poor, the needy, those in debt, and the wayfarer—meaning the travelers. Two categories are found in some lands and not others: those fighting in the cause of God and those in bondage seeking freedom. If five categories are found, for example, he divides...

The purification of one's wealth is distributed among five equal or approximate categories, with a designated portion for each type. Each portion is then divided into three shares or more, whether equal or varied, and there is no obligation to equalize among individuals within a category, for one may divide it among ten or twenty, thereby reducing each person's share. However, the categories themselves do not tolerate increase or decrease; it is not advisable to reduce any category below three, if possible. Then, if only a *sa'* is obligatory for *fitrah* and five categories are found, one must distribute it to fifteen individuals. If one person is omitted when possible, the share of that individual must be compensated. If this becomes difficult due to the small amount obligatory, let a group among those liable for *zakat* participate, mixing their wealth with one's own, gathering the deserving recipients, and delivering it to them so they may share it among themselves, for this is indispensable.

(Clarifying the Subtleties of Inner Etiquettes in *Zakat*)

Know that the seeker of the path to the Hereafter has duties regarding his *zakat*.

The first duty: understanding the obligation of *zakat*, its meaning, the aspect of trial within it, and why it was established as a pillar of Islam despite being a financial expenditure and not a bodily worship. This contains three meanings.

First: Uttering the two testimonies of faith is a commitment to monotheism and a testimony to the oneness of the Worshipped. The condition for fulfilling this commitment completely is that nothing remains beloved to the monotheist except the One, the Unique, for love does not accept partnership. Monotheism by tongue is of little benefit; rather, the degree of the lover is tested by parting with the beloved. Wealth is beloved to creatures because it is the means of their enjoyment in this world, and because of it they find comfort in this realm and shrink from death, even though in death lies the meeting with the Beloved. Thus, they are tested to verify their claim of love, and they are asked to relinquish the wealth that is their aspiration and beloved. For this reason, God Almighty said: "Indeed, God has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for Paradise for them" (Quran 9:111). This is through jihad, which is sacrificing one's life out of longing to meet God, Almighty and Majestic, and sacrificing wealth is easier. When this meaning regarding spending wealth was understood, people divided into three categories:

A category who verified monotheism and fulfilled their covenant, relinquishing all their wealth, not hoarding a single dinar or dirham, to the point they refused to be subject to the obligation of *zakat* upon them. It was said to one of them: "How much *zakat* is due on two hundred dirhams?" He replied: "As for the common people, by the ruling of the Sacred Law, it is five dirhams. But as for us, we are obliged to give all of it." For this reason, Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, gave in charity all his wealth, and 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, gave half of his wealth. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to 'Umar: "What have you left for your family?" He replied: "The same as you said." And to Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, he said: "What have you left for your family?" He replied: "God and His Messenger." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The difference between you is the difference between your two statements." Thus, the Truthful One fulfilled complete truthfulness, holding back nothing except what was beloved to him: God and His Messenger.

The second category, their rank is below this one. They are those who hold onto their wealth, observing the times of needs and seasons of good deeds. Their intention in saving is to spend according to need, not for luxury, and to direct the surplus beyond need to various avenues of righteousness whenever they appear. These do not limit themselves to the amount of *zakat*. A group of the Successors held that there are rights in wealth besides *zakat*, such as al-Nakha'i, al-Sha'bi, 'Ata', and Mujahid. Al-Sha'bi, after being asked, "Is there a right in wealth besides *zakat*?" said: "Yes. Have you not heard His word, Almighty: 'And give the relative his right, and the needy, and the traveler' (Quran 30:38)?" They argued with His word, Almighty: "And from what We have provided them, they spend" (Quran 2:3), and His word, Exalted: "And spend from what We have provided for you" (Quran 2:254). They claimed this is not abrogated by the verse of *zakat*; rather, it is included in the right of one Muslim upon another. Its meaning is that it is obligatory upon the affluent, whenever they find a needy person, to remove his need, beyond the wealth of *zakat*. What is correct in jurisprudence from this topic is that whenever his need overwhelms him, its removal becomes a collective obligation (*fard kifayah*), for it is not permissible to neglect a Muslim. However, it may be said that the affluent is only obliged to hand over what removes the need as an obligation, and he is not required to give it after having discharged *zakat* from himself. Or it may be said he is obliged to give it immediately, and it is not permissible for him to lend—meaning, it is not permissible to oblige the poor person to accept a loan. This is a matter of disagreement, and borrowing descends to the lowest degree of the common people, which is the degree of...

The third category: those who limit themselves to fulfilling the obligation, neither increasing nor decreasing from it. This is the lowest rank, and all the common people have limited themselves to it due to their stinginess with wealth, their inclination toward it, and the weakness of their love for the Hereafter. God Almighty said: "If He were to ask you for it and press you, you would withhold" (Quran 47:37). *Yuhiffakum* means He would demand it fully from you. So what a difference between a servant from whom His wealth and soul were purchased in exchange for Paradise, and...

A servant whose miserliness is not fully eradicated—this is one meaning of God Almighty's command to worship through spending wealth. The second meaning is purification from the trait of miserliness, for it is among the destructive qualities. He (peace be upon him) said: "Three things are destructive: obeyed greed, followed desire, and a person's admiration of himself." And the Almighty said: "And whoever is protected from the greed of his soul—it is they who are the successful." The explanation of its destructiveness and how to eradicate it will come in the Quarter of Destructive Qualities. The trait of miserliness only vanishes by accustoming oneself to spending wealth, for love of something is not severed except by compelling the soul to part with it until that becomes habitual. Thus, zakah in this sense is a purification—it purifies its possessor from the filth of destructive miserliness. Its purification is according to the extent of his spending and according to his joy in giving it out and his gladness in directing it to God Almighty. The third meaning is gratitude for blessings, for God Almighty has blessings upon His servant in his self and in his wealth. Physical acts of worship are gratitude for the blessing of the body, and financial acts are gratitude for the blessing of wealth. How base is one who looks upon the poor person—whose provision has been constrained and who is in need—yet his soul does not permit him to render thanks to God Almighty for enriching him from begging and making others in need of him, by giving a quarter of a tenth or a tenth of his wealth.

The second duty: regarding the time of payment. Among the manners of the people of faith is hastening from the time of obligation, showing eagerness to comply by bringing joy to the hearts of the poor, and preempting obstacles of time that may hinder him from good deeds, knowing that in delay there are harms, along with what the servant is exposed to of disobedience if he delays beyond the time of obligation. Whenever an impulse for good appears from within, it should be seized, for that is the prompting of the angel. The heart of the believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the Merciful—how swiftly it changes! Satan threatens poverty and commands indecency and wrong, and he has a prompting following the prompting of the angel. So let him seize the opportunity in it and allocate a specific month for his zakah if he pays it all at once, and strive for it to be among the best times so that may be a cause for the growth of his crop and the multiplication of his zakah. That is like the month of Muharram, for it is the first of the year and among the sacred months, or Ramadan, for he (peace be upon him) was the most generous of creation, and in Ramadan he was like the sent wind, withholding nothing. Ramadan has the virtue of the Night of Decree and that the Quran was revealed in it. Mujahid used to say: Do not say 'Ramadan,' for it is one of the names of God Almighty, but say 'the month of Ramadan.' Dhu al-Hijjah is also among the months of abundant virtue, for it is a sacred month and in it is the greater pilgrimage, and in it are the known days—the first ten—and the numbered days—the days of Tashriq. The best days of the month of Ramadan are the last ten, and the best days of Dhu al-Hijjah are the first ten.

The third duty: secrecy, for that is farther from ostentation and reputation-seeking. He (peace be upon him) said: "The best charity is the effort of the poor given to a needy person in secret." Some scholars said: "Three are among the treasures of righteousness, among them hiding charity." It has also been narrated with a chain: He (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, a servant performs a deed in secret, so God records it for him secretly. If he reveals it, it is transferred from secrecy and written openly. If he speaks of it, it is transferred from secrecy and openness and recorded as ostentation." In the famous hadith: "Seven whom God will shade on a day when there is no shade except His shade: one of them is a man who gave charity and his left hand did not know what his right hand gave." In the report: "Secret charity extinguishes the Lord's anger." And the Almighty said: "And if you conceal it and give it to the poor, it is better for you." The benefit of concealment is deliverance from the harms of ostentation and reputation-seeking, for he (peace be upon him) said: "God does not accept from one who makes heard, nor from one who shows off, nor from a reproacher. The one who speaks of his charity seeks reputation, and the giver in a gathering of people seeks ostentation. Concealment and silence are the deliverance from it." A group emphasized the virtue of concealment to the extent that they strove for the recipient not to know the giver. Some would place it in the hand of a blind person, some would place it in the path of the poor person or in his sitting place where he would see it but not see the giver, some would tuck it into the garment of the poor person while he slept, and some would deliver it to the hand of the poor person through another such that the giver is not known, and he would enjoin secrecy upon the intermediary and instruct him not to disclose it—all that to attain the extinguishing of the Lord's anger and to guard against ostentation and reputation-seeking. If it is only possible by one person knowing, then handing it to an agent to deliver to the needy, and the needy does not know, is preferable, for in the needy knowing lies both ostentation and obligation, whereas in the intermediary knowing lies only ostentation. If fame is intended, his deed is nullified, because zakah is the removal of miserliness and the weakening of love for wealth, and love for status has a stronger grip on the soul than love for wealth. Each of them is destructive in the Hereafter, but the trait of miserliness transforms in the grave, in the realm of similitude, into a scorpion.

The description of hypocrisy is that it transforms into a serpent in the grave from among the serpents, and one is commanded to weaken it or kill them to repel their harm or lessen their harm. So whenever one intends hypocrisy and ostentation, it is as if he has made some of the scorpion's limbs strengthen the serpent. Thus, to the extent he weakens the scorpion, he increases the strength of the serpent. Had he left the matter as it was, it would have been easier for him. The strength of these attributes, by which the strength of the action lies in acting according to their demands, and these attributes weaken through striving against them and opposing them and acting contrary to their demands. So what benefit is there in opposing the urges of miserliness and answering the urges of hypocrisy, thereby weakening the lesser and strengthening the stronger? The secrets of these meanings will come in the Quarter of the Destroyers.

The fourth duty: to manifest where he knows that in his manifestation there is encouragement for people to emulate, and to guard his secret from the incitement of hypocrisy by the method we will mention in treating hypocrisy in the Book of Hypocrisy. For Allah, the Exalted, has said: "If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good." That is where the situation necessitates disclosure, either for emulation or because the asker only asked in public view, so one should not abandon giving charity for fear of hypocrisy in manifestation. Rather, he should give charity and guard his secret from hypocrisy as much as possible. This is because in manifestation there is a third danger besides reminding of favor and hypocrisy, which is exposing the veil of the poor person. For he may be harmed by being seen in the guise of one in need. So whoever manifests the asking is the one who has exposed his own veil. One should not be wary of this meaning in his manifestation, and it is like manifesting immorality for one who concealed it, for it is forbidden, and spying into it and habitual mention of it is prohibited. As for the one who manifests it, establishing the prescribed punishment upon him is publicizing, but he is the cause of it. By a meaning like this, he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever casts off the garment of modesty, there is no backbiting for him." And Allah, the Exalted, has said: "And spend from what We have provided for you, secretly and publicly." He encouraged public giving also for the benefit of encouragement it contains. So let the servant be precise in contemplation, weighing this benefit against the danger in it, for that differs according to circumstances and individuals. Indeed, public declaration in some circumstances for some individuals may be better. And whoever knows the benefits and perils and does not look with the eye of desire, what is foremost and most fitting in every situation becomes clear to him.

The fifth duty: not to spoil his charity with reminding of favor and harm. Allah, the Exalted, has said: "Do not invalidate your charities with reminders of favor or harm." They differed regarding the reality of reminding of favor and harm. It was said: reminding of favor is to mention it, and harm is to manifest it. Sufyan said: Whoever reminds of favor, his charity is spoiled. He was asked: How is reminding of favor? He said: That he mentions it and talks about it. And it was said: reminding of favor is to make him serve due to the gift, and harm is to reproach him for poverty. And it was said: reminding of favor is to act arrogantly toward him because of his gift, and harm is to rebuke him or scold him for asking. And he (peace be upon him) said: "Allah does not accept the charity of one who reminds of favor." In my view, reminding of favor has an origin and a root, which is from the states and attributes of the heart, then manifest states branch from it upon the tongue and limbs. Its origin is that he sees himself as a benefactor to him and a bestower of favor upon him, while his right is to see the poor person as a benefactor to him by accepting the right of Allah, the Exalted, from him, which is his purification and salvation from the Fire, and that if he did not accept it, he would remain indebted by it. So his right is that the poor person undertakes from him, since he made his hand a deputy for Allah, the Exalted, in receiving the right of Allah, the Exalted. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Charity falls into the hand of Allah, the Exalted, before it falls into the hand of the asker." So let him realize that he is delivering to Allah, the Exalted, His right, and the poor person is taking from Allah, the Exalted, his provision after it has reached Allah, the Exalted. If he owed a debt to a person and he assigned his slave or servant, who is responsible for his provision, to receive it, believing the receiver of the debt to be under his favor would be foolishness and ignorance. For the benefactor to him is the one responsible for his provision. As for him, he is only discharging what is incumbent upon him by purchasing what he loved; he is striving for his own right, so he does not remind of favor to another. Whenever he knows the three meanings we mentioned in understanding the obligation of zakah, or one of them, he does not see himself as a benefactor except to himself—either by spending his wealth manifesting love for Allah, the Exalted, or purifying himself from the vice of miserliness, or giving thanks for the blessing of wealth seeking increase. However it may be, there is no transaction between him and the poor person such that he sees himself as a benefactor to him. Whenever this ignorance occurs, that he sees himself as a benefactor to him, what is mentioned in the meaning of reminding of favor branches from it upon his outward state: talking about it and manifesting it, and seeking recompense from him through thanks, supplication, service, respect, veneration, fulfilling rights, precedence in gatherings, and following in matters. All these are the fruits of reminding of favor. The meaning of reminding of favor inwardly is what we mentioned. As for harm, its outward form is scolding, reproaching, harsh speech, frowning, exposing the veil by manifestation, and various kinds.

Contempt and its inner reality, which is its source, are two matters: The first is his aversion to parting with wealth and the intensity of that feeling within his soul, for this inevitably constricts one's disposition. The second is his perception that he is better than the poor person, and that the poor person, due to his need, is inferior to him. Both originate in ignorance.

As for the aversion to surrendering wealth, it is foolishness, for whoever dislikes giving a dirham in exchange for what is worth a thousand is profoundly foolish. It is known that he gives wealth seeking the pleasure of God, Mighty and Majestic, and reward in the Abode of the Hereafter, and that is nobler than what he gives or would give to purify himself from the vice of miserliness, or in gratitude seeking increase. However one considers it, aversion has no justification.

As for the second, it is also ignorance, for if he knew the virtue of poverty over wealth and understood the peril of the wealthy, he would not hold the poor in contempt. Rather, he would seek blessing through them and wish for their station. For the righteous among the wealthy enter Paradise five hundred years after the poor. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "They are the greatest losers, by the Lord of the Ka'bah." Abu Dharr asked, "Who are they?" He said: "Those with abundant wealth," the hadith. So how can one hold the poor in contempt when God, Exalted is He, has made them His trading post? For you earn wealth through your toil, amass it, and strive to preserve it according to need, yet He has obligated that you surrender to the poor person the amount of his need and withhold the surplus which would harm him if given to him. Thus, the wealthy person is employed in striving for the provision of the poor, and is distinguished over him by being entrusted with injustices, undertaking hardships, and guarding surplus until he dies, whereupon his enemies consume it.

If aversion is removed and replaced with joy and happiness by God's enabling him to fulfill the obligation and favor the poor person—to the point of relieving him of his responsibility by accepting from him—then harm, reproach, frowning, and scowling cease and are replaced with gladness, praise, and acceptance of the favor. This is the origin of obligation and harm.

If you say: His seeing himself in the station of the benefactor is an ambiguous matter. Is there a sign by which he may test his heart and thereby know that he did not see himself as a benefactor? Know that there is a subtle, clear sign for it: He should consider if the poor person were to commit an offense against him or, for example, owed him a debt—would his sense of outrage and disdain for him increase beyond what it was before giving charity? If it increases, then his charity is not free from a taint of obligation, because he expected due to it what he did not expect before.

If you say: This is an ambiguous matter, and no one's heart is free from it. What is its remedy? Know that it has an inward remedy and an outward remedy. As for the inward, it is knowledge of the realities we mentioned in understanding the obligation and that the poor person is the one who benefits him by purifying him through acceptance. As for the outward, it is the actions he undertakes while assuming the obligation. For actions that issue from character traits dye the heart with those traits, as its secrets will come in the latter part of the book. For this reason, some of them would place the charity before the poor person and stand before him as if a petitioner until he asked him to accept it, so that he would be in the guise of one asking, while feeling within himself aversion if he were to refuse. Some of them would extend their palm so the poor person could take from their hand, making the poor person's hand the higher one. Aisha and Umm Salamah (may God be pleased with them), when they sent a kindness to a poor person, would say to the messenger, "Remember what he prays for," then they would return to him the like of his supplication and say, "This for that," until our charity was purified for us. They did not anticipate supplication because it resembles a recompense, and they would meet supplication with its like. This is what Umar ibn al-Khattab and his son Abdullah (may God be pleased with them) did. Thus, the possessors of hearts would treat their hearts, and there is no remedy from the outward aspect except these actions indicating humility, lowliness, and acceptance of the obligation, and from the inward aspect, the knowledges we mentioned. This is from the aspect of action, and that from the aspect of knowledge. The heart is only treated with the compound of knowledge and action. This condition for alms operates similarly to humility in prayer, and that is established by His saying (peace be upon him): "A person only gets from his prayer what he comprehends of it." This is like His saying (peace be upon him): "God does not accept the charity of one who reminds of his favor," and like His saying, Mighty and Majestic: "Do not invalidate your charities with obligation and harm." As for the jurist's legal verdict that it fulfills its place and absolves his responsibility without this condition, that is another discussion, and we have alluded to its meaning in the Book of Prayer.

The Sixth Duty: To consider the gift small, for if he considers it great, he will become proud of it, and pride is among the destroyers; it nullifies deeds. God, Exalted is He, said: "And on the Day of Hunayn, when your great number impressed you, but it availed you nothing." It is said that obedience, the smaller you consider it, the greater it is with God, Mighty and Majestic, and disobedience, the greater you consider it, the smaller it is with God, Mighty and Majestic. It is said: Kindness is not complete except with three matters: considering it small, hastening it, and concealing it. Considering it great is not the same as obligation and harm, for if he directed his wealth to...

The construction of a mosque or a hospice where one can feel self-importance, yet where boasting and harm are impossible—indeed, wonder and self-importance run through all acts of worship, and their remedy is knowledge and action. As for knowledge, it is to know that a tenth or a quarter of a tenth is little from much, and that one has contented oneself with the lowest degrees of giving, as we mentioned in understanding obligation; thus, one is worthy of feeling ashamed of it, so how can one feel self-important about it? If one ascends to the highest degree and gives all or most of one's wealth, then let one reflect: from where does the wealth come to him, and to what does he spend it? For wealth belongs to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and His favor is upon him since He gave it and enabled him to give it. So let him not feel self-important regarding what is rightfully God's, the very essence of God's right, Blessed and Exalted is He. Even if his station requires that he look to the Hereafter and that he gives it for reward, then let him not feel self-important about giving what he expects multiples in return for. As for action, it is to give it with the giving of one ashamed of being miserly by withholding the rest of his wealth from God, Mighty and Majestic is He, so that his state is one of humility and shame, like the state of one who is demanded to return a trust and withholds some of it and returns some, because all wealth belongs to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and giving all of it is most beloved to God, Blessed and Exalted is He. He only did not command His servant to do so because it is difficult for him due to his miserliness, as God, Mighty and Majestic is He, said: "Lest He should make you miserly."

The seventh duty: to select from his wealth the best of it, what is most beloved to him, most noble, and purest, for God, Exalted is He, is Pure and accepts only what is pure. If what is given is from something dubious, perhaps it is not absolutely his property, so it does not achieve its proper place. In the hadith of Aban from Anas ibn Malik: "Blessed is the servant who spends from wealth he earned without disobedience." If what is given is not from the good of his wealth, it is from bad manners, for he may keep the good for himself, his servant, or his family, thus having preferred other than God, Mighty and Majestic is He, over Him. If he did this with a guest and presented to him the worst food in his house, it would fill his chest with resentment—this is if his view is toward God, Mighty and Majestic is He. If his view is toward himself and his reward in the Hereafter, then he is not rational who prefers other than himself over himself, and he has nothing of his wealth except what he gives in charity and thus preserves, or eats and thus consumes. What he eats is the satisfaction of a need in the moment, so it is not from rationality to limit one's view to the immediate and neglect saving. God, Exalted is He, has said: "O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth. And do not aim toward the bad therefrom, spending while you would not take it except with closed eyes." That is, you would not take it except with dislike and shame, which is the meaning of closing the eyes, so do not prefer it for your Lord. In the report: "A dirham surpassed a hundred thousand dirhams." That is when a person gives it while it is from the most lawful and best of his wealth, issuing from contentment and joy in giving. He may give a hundred thousand dirhams from what he dislikes of his wealth, indicating that he does not prefer God, Mighty and Majestic is He, with anything he loves. For this, God, Exalted is He, censured a people who assigned to God what they dislike, saying: "And they assign to God what they dislike, and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best. No!" Some readers stopped at the negation to refute them, then began and said: "Assuredly, for them is the Fire." That is, their act of assigning to God what they dislike has earned them the Fire.

The eighth duty: to seek for his charity one by whom the charity is purified, and not to be satisfied with him being from the general eight categories, for within their generality are specific qualities. So let him observe the specificity of those qualities, and they are six: The first is to seek the God-fearing who turn away from the world and devote themselves to the trade of the Hereafter. He (peace be upon him) said: "Eat only the food of a God-fearing person, and let only a God-fearing person eat your food." This is because the God-fearing person is aided by it in God-consciousness, so you become a partner in his obedience by aiding him. And he (peace be upon him) said: "Feed your food to the God-fearing, and confer your kindness upon the believers." In another wording: "Host with your food whom you love for the sake of God, Exalted is He." Some scholars would prefer with food the poor Sufis over others. He was asked: "If you generalized your kindness to all the poor, it would be better." He said: "No, these are a people whose concern is for God, Blessed and Exalted is He. If poverty befalls them, the concern of one of them becomes scattered, so to return the concern of one to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is more beloved to me than giving to a thousand whose concern is the world." This speech was mentioned to al-Junayd, and he approved of it and said: "This is a saint from the saints of God, Exalted is He." And he said: "I have not heard speech more beautiful than this in a long time." Then he related that this man's situation changed and he intended to leave his shop, so al-Junayd sent him money and said: "Make it your merchandise and do not leave the shop, for trade does not harm the likes of you." This man was a grocer who did not take payment from the poor for what they bought from him. The second quality: that he be from the people of knowledge specifically, for that is aiding him in knowledge, and knowledge is the noblest of acts of worship when sound in it.

The Intention: Ibn al-Mubarak used to restrict his charitable giving to the people of knowledge. When asked, "Why not make it general?" he replied, "I know of no station after the station of Prophethood superior to the station of the scholars. If the heart of one of them becomes preoccupied with his need, he will not have the leisure for knowledge, nor will he turn his attention to learning. Therefore, freeing them for knowledge is superior."

The Third Attribute: That he be truthful in his God-consciousness and his knowledge of Divine Oneness. His Oneness is such that when he receives a gift, he praises God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and thanks Him, seeing that the favor is from Him alone, not looking to any intermediary. This is the most grateful of servants to God, Glorified is He—that he sees all favor as being from Him. In the counsel of Luqman to his son: "Do not place between yourself and God any benefactor, and consider the favor of anyone other than Him as a liability." Whoever thanks other than God, Glorified is He, it is as if he has not recognized the true Bestower and has not become certain that the intermediary is subdued and compelled by the compelling of God, Mighty and Majestic is He. For God, Exalted is He, subjugated upon him the motives for action and facilitated the means for him, so he gave while being compelled. Had he wished to withhold it, he would not have been able after God, Mighty and Majestic is He, cast into his heart that the rectification of his religion and his worldly life lay in his action. Thus, whenever the motive becomes strong, it necessitates a resolute will and the arousal of capability, and the servant cannot oppose a strong motive in which there is no hesitation. God, Mighty and Majestic is He, is the Creator of motives and their Arouser, the Remover of weakness and hesitation from them, and the Subjugator of capability to be aroused in accordance with the motives. Whoever is certain of this has no regard except for the Causer of Causes. The certainty of such a servant is more beneficial to the giver than the praise and thanks of others, for that is but a movement of the tongue whose benefit is, for the most part, little. The aid of such a monotheistic servant is not wasted. As for the one who praises for the gift and invokes good, he will blame for withholding and invoke evil when harmed, and his states vary. It has been narrated that he (the Prophet, peace be upon him) sent a gift to one of the poor and said to the messenger, "Remember what he says." When he took it, he said, "Praise be to God who does not forget those who remember Him and does not waste the reward of those who thank Him." Then he said, "O God, You have not forgotten so-and-so"—meaning himself—"so make so-and-so not forget You"—meaning by 'so-and-so' himself. The messenger of God (peace be upon him) informed him of that, and he (peace be upon him) was pleased and said, "I knew he would say that." Observe how he restricted his attention to God alone. And he (peace be upon him) said to a man, "Repent." He said, "I repent to God alone, and I do not repent to Muhammad." He (peace be upon him) said, "He recognized the truth for its people." And when the verse concerning 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her) in the story of the slander was revealed, Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with him) said, "Get up and kiss the head of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)." She said, "By God, I will not do it, and I praise none but God." He (peace be upon him) said, "Leave her, O Abu Bakr." In another wording, she (may God be pleased with her) said to Abu Bakr (may God be pleased with him), "I praise God, not you, nor your companion." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) did not disapprove of that from her, even though the revelation reached her through the tongue of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). Seeing things as from other than God, Glorified is He, is a description of the disbelievers. God, Exalted is He, said: "And when God alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when those other than Him are mentioned, immediately they rejoice." Whoever does not purify his inward self from seeing intermediaries except inasmuch as they are intermediaries, it is as if he has not been freed from the hidden secret of shirk (associating partners with God). So let him fear God, Glorified is He, in purifying his monotheism from the impurities and stains of shirk.

The Fourth Attribute: That he be concealed, hiding his need, not frequently divulging and complaining; or that he be from the people of moral excellence whose blessing has gone but whose habit remains, so he lives in the garb of maintaining appearances. God, Exalted is He, said: "The ignorant suppose them wealthy because of their restraint. You recognize them by their mark; they do not ask people persistently." That is, they are not importunate in asking because they are rich through their certainty, dignified through their patience. This should be sought by investigating the people of religion in every locality and uncovering the inner states of the people of goodness and those who maintain appearances, for the reward of directing kindness to them is multiples of what is directed to those who openly beg.

The Fifth Attribute: That he be in need, or confined by illness, or due to some cause, so that the meaning of His word, Mighty and Majestic is He, is found in him: "For the poor who have been restricted for the cause of God." That is, they are confined on the path of the Hereafter by need, straitened circumstances, or the preoccupation of a heart rectifying itself, unable to travel the land because their wings are clipped and their limbs are bound. For these reasons, 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) used to give the household a flock of sheep, ten and above, and he (peace be upon him) used to give according to the measure of need. 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) was asked about the utmost of tribulation, and he said, "Numerous dependents and little wealth."

The Sixth Attribute: That he be from the relatives and kin, so it becomes charity and upholding family ties. In upholding family ties is a reward that cannot be enumerated. 'Ali (may God be pleased with him) said, "That I uphold a brother from my brothers with a dirham is more beloved to me than that I give twenty in charity."

A dirham whose principal is twenty dirhams is more beloved to me than giving a hundred dirhams in charity, and a dirham whose principal is a hundred dirhams is more beloved to me than emancipating a slave. Likewise, truthful friends and brothers in goodness take precedence over acquaintances, just as relatives take precedence over strangers. One must observe these subtleties, for these are the required qualities, and within each quality are degrees; thus, one should seek the highest of them. If one is found who combines a number of these qualities, he is the greatest treasure and the supreme booty. However much one strives in this and succeeds, he has two rewards; but if he errs, he has one reward. One of his two immediate rewards is the purification of his soul from the trait of miserliness, the strengthening of love for God—Exalted is He—in his heart, and his striving in obedience to Him. These are the qualities that grow strong in his heart, making him yearn for the meeting with God—Exalted is He. The second reward is the benefit that returns to him from the supplication and zeal of the recipient, for the hearts of the righteous have effects in the immediate and the ultimate. If he succeeds, he attains both rewards; if he errs, he attains the first without the second. Thus, the reward of the one who strives correctly is multiplied here and in all other matters—and God knows best.

(Chapter Three: On the Recipient, the Reasons for His Eligibility, and the Duties of Receiving)
(Clarification of the Reasons for Eligibility)

Know that none is eligible for zakah except a free Muslim who is neither Hashemite nor Muttalibi, and who is characterized by one of the qualities of the eight categories mentioned in the Book of God—Exalted is He. Zakāh is not to be given to an unbeliever, nor to a slave, nor to a Hashemite, nor to a Muttalibi. As for a child and an insane person, it is permissible to give to them if their guardian receives it on their behalf. Now let us mention the qualities of the eight categories.

The first category: The Poor (al-fuqarā’). The poor person is one who has no wealth and no ability to earn. If he has his daily sustenance and clothing suitable to his condition, he is not poor but rather indigent (miskīn). If he has half his daily sustenance, he is poor. If he has a shirt but no handkerchief, no shoes, no trousers, and the value of the shirt is not sufficient to cover all that is fitting for the poor, he is poor, because at present he lacks what he needs and is unable to acquire it. It should not be stipulated for the poor person that he have no clothing except what covers his private parts, for this is exaggeration, and generally such a person is not found. Nor does his being accustomed to begging remove him from poverty, for begging is not considered a means of earning, unlike if he were capable of earning, which would remove him from poverty. If he is capable of earning with a tool, he is poor, and it is permissible to buy a tool for him. If he is capable of earning in a manner unbefitting his dignity and his like, he is poor. If he is a student of jurisprudence and earning would prevent him from studying jurisprudence, he is poor, and his capability is not considered. If he is a worshipper and earning would prevent him from the duties of worship and the litanies of the times, let him earn, for earning is more important than that. It is said: “Seeking the lawful is an obligation after the obligatory [prayer],” meaning striving to earn. And ‘Umar—may God be pleased with him—said: “Earning in ambiguity is better than begging.” If he is sustained by the expenditure of his father or one whose expenditure is obligatory upon him, this is easier than earning, so he is not poor.

The second category: The Indigent (al-masākīn). The indigent person is one whose income does not cover his expenses. He may possess a thousand dirhams and be indigent, or he may possess only an axe and a rope and be rich. The small house he inhabits and the garment that covers him according to his condition do not strip him of the name “indigent.” Likewise, the furnishings of the house—meaning what he needs and what is fitting for him—and likewise books of jurisprudence do not remove him from indigence. If he owns nothing but books, he is not obligated for the zakah al-fitr, and the ruling on the book is like that of the garment and house furnishings, for he needs it. However, one should be cautious in determining need regarding the book. A book is needed for three purposes: teaching, benefiting, and enjoyment through reading. As for the need for enjoyment, it is not considered, such as acquiring books of poetry, histories of reports, and the like, which bring no benefit in the Hereafter and in this world are only for enjoyment and companionship; these are to be sold for expiation and zakah al-fitr, and they prevent the name “indigent.” As for the need for teaching, if it is for the sake of earning, like a tutor, teacher, or instructor for a fee, this is his tool and is not to be sold for zakah al-fitr, like the tools of a tailor and other craftsmen. If he studies to fulfill a communal obligation (farḍ kifāyah), it is not to be sold, nor does it strip him of the name “indigent,” for it is an important need. As for the need for benefiting and learning from the book, such as keeping medical books to treat himself with, or a book of admonition to read and take heed from, if there is a doctor and a preacher in the town, he is not in need; if not, he is in need. Sometimes he may not need to read the book except after a period, so the duration of need should be determined. The closest opinion is to say that what he does not need...

As for what pertains to the year, one is independent of it; for whoever has surplus beyond his daily sustenance is obligated to pay the Zakāh. When we estimate sustenance by the day, the need for household furnishings and bodily garments should be estimated by the year. Thus, summer garments should not be sold in winter, nor books for garments; furnishings are more akin. One may possess two copies of a book, yet have no need for one of them. If he says, "One is more accurate and the other is finer, so I need both," we say: Be content with the more accurate, sell the finer, and abandon ostentation and luxury. If there are two copies of the same knowledge, one detailed and the other concise, if his aim is personal benefit, let him be content with the detailed one; if his aim is teaching, he needs both, for each contains benefits not found in the other. Such scenarios are innumerable and are not addressed in the discipline of jurisprudence; we have mentioned them due to the widespread nature of the predicament and to alert, through the excellence of this consideration, to other matters. Exhausting these scenarios is impossible, for such consideration extends to household furnishings in their quantity, number, and type, to bodily garments, and to the dwelling in its spaciousness or constriction. These matters have no fixed limits, but the jurist exerts his independent reasoning in them, approximates in determinations based on his judgment, and ventures into the peril of ambiguities. The scrupulous takes the more cautious path and leaves what causes him doubt for what does not. The intermediate, problematic degrees between clear, opposing extremes are many, and nothing saves from them except precaution. And God knows best.

The third category: The workers. They are the agents who collect the Zakāh, apart from the Caliph and the judge. This includes the overseer, the scribe, the accountant, the keeper, and the transporter. None of them is to be given more than a fair wage. If anything remains from the price beyond their fair wage, it is returned to the remaining categories; if it falls short, it is completed from the public treasury.

The fourth category: Those whose hearts are to be reconciled to Islam. They are the nobles who have embraced Islam and are obeyed among their people. Giving to them confirms them in Islam and encourages their peers and followers.

The fifth category: Those in a contract of manumission. The share for the enslaved person striving for freedom is given to the master. If given directly to the enslaved person, it is permissible, but a master may not give his own Zakāh to his own enslaved person striving for freedom, for he is considered his slave.

The sixth category: Those in debt. The indebted is one who has borrowed for an act of obedience or something permissible and is poor. If he borrowed for an act of disobedience, he is not given unless he repents. If he is wealthy, his debt is not settled unless he borrowed for a public benefit or to extinguish strife.

The seventh category: Those fighting in the cause of God. They are those who have no stipend in the register of the army. A share is expended for them, even if they are wealthy, as an aid to them in fighting.

The eighth category: The wayfarer. He is one who has left his homeland to travel for a purpose other than disobedience, or who passes through. He is given if he is poor. If he has wealth in another land, he is given according to what suffices for his journey.

If you ask: "How are these attributes known?" We say: As for poverty and destitution, by the statement of the recipient. He is not required to produce evidence nor to take an oath; rather, reliance on his word is permissible if his falsehood is not known. As for fighting and travel, they are future matters, so he is given based on his statement, "I am going to fight." If he does not fulfill it, it is reclaimed. As for the remaining categories, evidence is necessary. These are the conditions of entitlement. As for the amount expended to each individual, it will come later.

(Explanation of the Duties of the Collector)

They are five: The first: That he knows God Almighty has obligated the expenditure of Zakāh to him so that his concerns may be sufficed and his many concerns made into a single concern. Indeed, God Almighty has decreed worship such that the concern of His creation should be one: He, glorified be He, and the Final Day. This is the meaning of His saying, exalted is He: "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." Yet, since wisdom decreed that passions and needs, which scatter one's concern, be imposed upon the servant, generosity decreed the outpouring of a blessing that suffices needs. He multiplied wealth and poured it into the hands of His servants to be a means for them to repel their needs and a vehicle for their freedom to devote themselves to their acts of obedience. Among them are those whose abundant wealth becomes a trial and affliction, plunging them into peril. Among them are those whom He loves, so He protects them from the world as a compassionate one protects his sick, withholding its superfluities from them and directing to them the measure of their need through the hands of the wealthy, so that the ease of acquisition and the toil of gathering and preserving fall upon them, and its benefit flows to the poor, who then devote themselves purely to the worship of God and preparation for what is after death. Thus, the superfluities of the world do not divert them, nor does need distract them from preparation. This is the ultimate blessing. It is incumbent upon the poor person to recognize the worth of the blessing of poverty and to realize that God's favor upon him in what He has withheld is greater than His favor in what He has given, as will come, God willing, in the Book of Poverty, its verification and explanation. So let him take what he takes as sustenance from God, glorified be He.

and as an aid to him in obedience. Let his intention therein be to gain strength through it for obeying God. If he is unable to do so, then let him divert it to what God, Mighty and Majestic, has made permissible. For if he seeks aid through it in disobeying God, he is ungrateful for the blessings of God, Mighty and Majestic, deserving of distance and wrath from God, Glorified be He.

The second: that he thank the giver, pray for him, and praise him. His thanks and supplication should be such that they do not remove him from seeing the giver as a means, but rather as a path and conduit for the arrival of God's blessing to him. The path has a right by virtue of God making it a path and a means, and this does not contradict seeing the blessing as from God, Glorified be He, for He has said, "Whoever is not grateful to people is not grateful to God." God, Mighty and Majestic, has praised His servants in various places for their deeds, while He is the Creator of them and the Originator of the ability for them, such as His saying, "Excellent is the servant. Indeed, he is one who repeatedly turns [to God]." and the like. And let the recipient say in his supplication: "May God purify your heart among the hearts of the righteous, make your deeds wholesome among the deeds of the virtuous, and include your spirit among the spirits of the martyrs." And He has said, "Whoever does you a kindness, then repay him. If you are unable, then pray for him until you know you have repaid him." Among the completions of gratitude is to conceal the faults of the gift if it has a fault, not to belittle it, not to disparage it, and not to reproach him for withholding if he withholds. He should magnify his act in his own sight and in the sight of people. The duty of the giver is to deem his gift small, and the duty of the recipient is to assume the obligation of the favor and deem it great. It is incumbent upon every servant to fulfill his right, and there is no contradiction in this, for the causes for belittling and magnifying are opposed. What benefits the giver is observing the causes for belittling, and what harms him is the opposite. For the taker, it is the reverse. All of this does not contradict seeing the blessing as from God, Mighty and Majestic. For whoever does not see the means as a means is ignorant. The objectionable thing is to see the means as the origin.

The third: that he examine what he takes. If it is not from lawful sources, let him abstain from it out of scrupulousness. "And whoever fears God, He will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he does not expect." The one who scrupulously avoids the unlawful will not lack openings from the lawful. Therefore, he should not take from the wealth of the Turks, soldiers, and the agents of rulers, nor from one whose earnings are mostly unlawful, except when the matter becomes straitened for him and what is given to him has no known, specific owner. Then he may take according to his need. The legal ruling in such a case is that he should give it in charity, as will be explained in the Book of the Lawful and Unlawful. This is when he is incapable of obtaining the lawful. If he takes it, his taking is not considered taking Zakat, for Zakat cannot be discharged by something unlawful from the one fulfilling it.

The fourth: that he be wary of ambiguous and doubtful situations regarding the amount he takes. He should take only the permissible amount and only when he is certain he is described with the quality of deserving it. If he takes it due to a written obligation or a penalty, he should not exceed the amount of the debt. If he takes it for work, he should not exceed the wage of the like. If he is given more, he should refuse and abstain, for the wealth does not belong to the giver such that he can give it freely. If he is a traveler, he should not exceed provisions and the hire of a mount to his destination. If he is a warrior, he should take only what he specifically needs for fighting: horse, weapon, and expenses. Estimating that is by personal judgment, and it has no fixed limit. Likewise for travel provisions. Scrupulousness is to leave what causes him doubt for what does not cause him doubt. If he takes due to poverty, let him first look at the furnishings of his house, his clothes, and his books. Are there things he can do without in themselves, or can do without their finery, so they can be exchanged for what suffices, with some of their value left over? All of this is according to his personal judgment. In it, there is an obvious extreme where it is confirmed he is deserving, and another opposite extreme where it is confirmed he is not deserving, and between them are ambiguous middles. "Whoever hovers around a forbidden area is likely to fall into it." Reliance in this is outwardly on the statement of the taker. The needy person has various stations in restricting and expanding when estimating needs; its levels cannot be enumerated. The inclination of the scrupulous is toward restriction, and the inclination of the lax is toward expansion until he sees himself in need of various kinds of expansion, and this is detested in the Law. Then, when his need is confirmed, let him not take a large amount of wealth, but only what completes his sufficiency from the time he takes it to a year. This is the utmost that is permitted, on the grounds that if the year repeats, the means of income repeat, and on the grounds that the Messenger of God stored provisions for his family for a year. This is the closest thing by which the limit of the poor and needy can be defined. If he restricts himself to the need of his month or the need of his day, it is closer to God-consciousness. The schools of the scholars differ regarding the amount taken under the rule of Zakat and charity. Some go to extremes in reduction to the point of obligating restriction to the amount of sustenance for his day and night, holding to what was narrated from Sahl ibn al-Hanzaliyyah: "He forbade asking while having sufficiency. He was asked about his sufficiency, and he said, 'His lunch and his dinner.'" Others said he may take up to the limit of wealth—the limit of wealth being the Zakat threshold, for God, Exalted be He, only obligated Zakat upon the wealthy. So they said he may take...

For himself and for each of his dependents, a threshold of wealth for zakah. Others said the limit of sufficiency is fifty dirhams or their equivalent in gold, based on what Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever asks while possessing wealth that suffices him will come on the Day of Resurrection with scratches on his face." He was asked, "What suffices him?" He said, "Fifty dirhams or their equivalent in gold." It is said its chain is not strong. Some said forty, based on what 'Ata ibn Yasar reported in a disconnected chain that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever asks while possessing an uqiyah has importuned in asking." Others extended it broadly, saying he may take an amount with which to buy an estate to become self-sufficient for his lifetime, or prepare merchandise to trade with and become self-sufficient for his lifetime, for this is true sufficiency. 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said, "When you give, make (the recipient) self-sufficient." Some even went to the extent that one who becomes poor may take enough to restore him to his former state, even if ten thousand dirhams, unless he exceeds moderation. When Abu Talha was preoccupied by his garden from prayer, he said, "I have made it charity." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Give it to your relatives, it is better for you." So he gave it to Hassan and Abu Qatadah—a palm grove for two men is ample sufficiency. And 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) gave a Bedouin a she-camel with its nursing young. This is what is narrated on the matter. As for reducing it to the day's sustenance or an uqiyah, that is mentioned in the context of disliking begging and frequenting doors, which is reprehensible and has another ruling. Rather, permitting up to buying an estate for sufficiency is closer to plausibility, though it also leans toward extravagance. Closer to moderation is sufficiency for a year; beyond that holds risk, and less than that is constriction. These matters, when not definitively specified by revelation, leave the jurist no choice but to rule based on his understanding. Then it is said to the scrupulous: "Seek the counsel of your heart, even if they give you legal opinions," as he (peace be upon him) said, for sin is what pricks the hearts. If the recipient feels something within himself regarding what he takes, let him fear God concerning it and not seek license by relying on the formal legal opinions of scholars, for their rulings have constraints and absolutions due to necessities, and contain conjectures and ventures into ambiguities. Guarding against ambiguities is the character of the people of religion and the practice of those traversing the path of the Hereafter.

Fifth: To ask the possessor of wealth about the amount obligatory upon him. If what he gives is above the due share, he should not take it from him, for he is not entitled with his partner except the due share. So let him reduce from the due share the amount that goes to two of his kind. This inquiry is obligatory upon most people, for they do not observe this division, either out of ignorance or negligence. It is only permissible to forgo asking about such matters when it is not likely that prohibition is probable. Mention of the occasions for inquiry and the degree of probability will come, God willing, in the Book of the Lawful and the Unlawful.

(The Fourth Chapter: On Voluntary Charity, Its Virtue, and the Etiquettes of Taking and Giving It)
(Explanation of the Virtue of Charity)

Among the reports: His saying (peace be upon him): "Give charity, even if with a date, for it satisfies the hungry and extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Guard yourselves against the Fire, even if with half a date; if you do not find it, then with a good word." And he (peace be upon him) said: "There is no Muslim servant who gives charity from good earnings—and God accepts only what is good—except that God takes it with His right hand and nurtures it, just as one of you nurtures his foal, until the date becomes like Mount Uhud." And he (peace be upon him) said to Abu al-Darda': "When you cook a broth, increase its water, then look to a household among your neighbors and give them from it kindly." And he (peace be upon him) said: "No servant does charity well except that God, Mighty and Majestic, makes the succession to his estate good." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Every person will be in the shade of his charity until judgment is passed among the people." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Charity blocks seventy doors of evil." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Secret charity extinguishes the wrath of the Lord, Mighty and Majestic." And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "No one given from abundance has a greater reward than one who accepts from need." Perhaps the meaning is the one who intends, by fulfilling his need, to devote himself to religion, thus equaling the giver who intends by his giving to build his religion. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was asked, "Which charity is best?" He said: "That you give charity while you are healthy, covetous of life, fearing poverty, and do not delay until when the soul reaches the throat you say, 'For so-and-so this, and for so-and-so that,' when it already belonged to so-and-so." And he (peace be upon him) said one day to his companions, "Give charity." A man said, "I have a dinar." He said, "Spend it on yourself." He said, "I have another." He said, "Spend it on your wife." He said, "I have another." He said, "Spend it on your child." He said, "I have another." He said, "Spend it on your servant." He said, "I have another." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "You know best." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Charity is not lawful for the family of Muhammad; it is but the impurities of people." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Repel the degradation of the beggar, even if with a morsel like a bird's head of food." And he (peace be upon him) said: "If you were truthful..."

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever turns away a disappointed beggar from his house, the angels will not visit that house for seven days." And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would not delegate two habits to anyone else: he would place his ablution water at night and cover it, and he would give to the poor with his own hand. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The poor person is not the one you turn away with a date or two, or a morsel or two. Rather, the poor person is the one who is modest. Read, if you wish: 'They do not beg from people insistently.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no Muslim who clothes a Muslim except that he remains under the protection of God, the Mighty and Majestic, as long as a shred of that clothing remains upon him."

Narrations: 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: "Indeed, 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, gave fifty thousand in charity, while her garment was patched." Mujahid said regarding the statement of God, the Mighty and Majestic, "And they give food, despite their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive," that they desired it themselves. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "O God, place abundance with the best among us, so that they may bestow it upon those in need among us." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: "Prayer brings you halfway, fasting brings you to the gate of the King, and charity admits you to Him." Ibn Abi al-Ja'd said: "Charity indeed repels seventy doors of evil, and its secret giving is seventy times superior to its open giving, and it indeed frees the modest person from seventy devils." Ibn Mas'ud said: "A man worshipped God for seventy years, then he committed an immoral act, so his deeds were nullified. Then he passed by a poor person and gave him a loaf of bread in charity, so God forgave his sin and restored to him the deeds of seventy years." Luqman said to his son: "If you commit a sin, then give charity." Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "I know of no seed that weighs as much as the mountains of the world except a seed of charity." 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Abi Rawad said: "It used to be said: Three things are among the treasures of Paradise: concealing illness, concealing charity, and concealing calamities." And it is narrated with a chain: 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said: "Deeds boasted, and charity said: 'I am the best of you.'" 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar used to give sugar in charity and say: "I heard God say: 'You will never attain righteousness until you spend from what you love.' And God knows that I love sugar." Al-Nakha'i said: "When something is for God, the Mighty and Majestic, it does not please me for it to have a defect." 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr said: "People will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection at the hungriest, thirstiest, and most naked they have ever been. So whoever feeds for the sake of God, God will satiate him; whoever gives drink for the sake of God, God will give him drink; and whoever clothes for the sake of God, God will clothe him." Al-Hasan said: "If God had willed, He could have made you all rich with no poor among you, but He tests some of you with others." Al-Sha'bi said: "Whoever does not see himself more in need of the reward of charity than the poor person is of his charity has invalidated his charity and struck it upon his own face." Malik said: "We see no harm in a believer drinking from the water given as charity and provided in the mosque, for it was placed only for the thirsty, whoever they may be, and was not specifically intended for the needy and destitute." It is said that Al-Hasan passed by a slave trader who had a slave girl. He said to the trader: "Would you be satisfied with a dirham or two for her price?" He said: "No." He said: "Then go, for God, the Mighty and Majestic, is satisfied with a fals and a morsel for the maidens of Paradise."

(Explanation of Concealing and Revealing Charity)
The paths of those seeking sincerity have differed in this matter. Some inclined to the view that concealment is superior, and some inclined to the view that revelation is superior. We will point to the meanings and pitfalls in each, then lift the veil on the truth of the matter.

As for concealment, it contains five meanings: First, it is more preserving of the recipient's concealment, for if he takes it openly, it breaches the veil of honor, exposes need, and departs from the beloved state of modesty and self-restraint, by which the ignorant assume its people are rich due to their modesty. Second, it is safer for people's hearts and tongues, for they may envy him or disapprove of his taking, and think he takes while self-sufficient, or attribute to him taking extra. Envy, ill suspicion, and backbiting are among the major sins, and protecting them from these crimes is more important. Abu Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani said: "I refrain from wearing a new garment for fear that it may generate envy in my neighbors." And some ascetics said: "Sometimes I refrain from using something for the sake of my brothers, for they say: 'Where did he get this from?'" And from Ibrahim al-Taymi, he was seen wearing a new shirt, so one of his brothers said: "Where did you get this?" He said: "My brother Khaythamah clothed me with it, and had I known his family knew about it, I would not have accepted it." Third, it assists the giver in keeping the deed secret, for the superiority of secrecy over openness in giving is greater, and assisting in completing a kindness is itself a kindness. Secrecy is not accomplished except by two. Whenever this one reveals, the matter of the giver is exposed. A man gave something openly to one of the scholars, so he returned it to him. Another gave him something in secret, so he accepted it. He was asked about that, and he said: "This one acted..."

Refinement lies in concealing one's kindness, so I accepted it; whereas that person displayed poor conduct in his action, so I returned it to him. A man gave something to a Sufi in public, and he refused it. The man said, "Why do you reject what God Almighty has given you?" He replied, "You associated others with God the Exalted in what was meant for God alone and were not content with God Almighty, so I returned your act of association to you." A certain gnostic accepted something in private that he had refused publicly. When asked about this, he said, "I disobeyed God by making it public, so I did not assist you in disobedience; and I obeyed Him by keeping it hidden, thus aiding you in your righteousness." Sufyan al-Thawri said, "If I knew that one of you would neither mention his charity nor speak of it, I would accept his charity."

Fourth: Public acceptance entails humiliation and degradation, and a believer must not debase himself. Some scholars would accept in secret but not openly, saying, "Open acceptance demeans knowledge and dishonors its people, and I would not elevate anything worldly by lowering knowledge and humiliating its people." Fifth: Guarding against the suspicion of partnership. The Prophet said, "Whoever is given a gift while in the company of others, they are partners in it." And if it is silver or gold, it remains a gift; the Prophet said, "The best a man can give to his brother is silver or to feed him bread," thus considering silver alone as a gift. What is given publicly is disliked unless all present consent, and it is not free from suspicion; when given privately, one is safe from this suspicion.

As for public giving and speaking of it, it contains four meanings: First, sincerity, truthfulness, and freedom from deceit and ostentation. Second, relinquishing status and rank, displaying servitude and humility, disavowing pride and claims of self-sufficiency, and removing oneself from the eyes of creation. A gnostic said to his disciple, "Always accept openly if you are accepting, for you will not be beyond one of two men: a man whose heart you will fall from if you do so—that is the goal, for it is safer for your religion and reduces the ailments of your soul—or a man whose heart increases in love for you through your display of truthfulness—that is what your brother desires, for his reward increases with his increased love and respect for you, and you are rewarded for being the cause of his increased reward."

Third: The gnostic has no regard except for God Almighty; secrecy and openness are the same to him, and varying one's state is association in divine unity. Some said, "We paid no heed to the supplication of one who accepts in secret and refuses openly, for attention to creation, whether present or absent, is a deficiency in state. Rather, one's regard should be confined to the One, the Unique." It is recounted that a shaykh favored one disciple among many, causing distress to the others. To show them that disciple's virtue, he gave each a chicken and said, "Let each of you take it privately and slaughter it where no one sees you." Each went and slaughtered theirs except that disciple, who returned the chicken. When asked, they said, "We did as the shaykh commanded." The shaykh asked the disciple, "Why did you not slaughter as your companions did?" The disciple replied, "I could not find a place where no one sees me, for God sees me everywhere." The shaykh said, "This is why I favor him, for he pays no heed to other than God Almighty."

Fourth: Public giving establishes the tradition of gratitude, as God said, "And as for the favor of your Lord, proclaim it." Concealment is ingratitude for blessings, and God condemned those who hide what He has given them, coupling it with stinginess: "Those who are stingy and enjoin stinginess upon people and conceal what God has given them of His bounty." The Prophet said, "When God bestows a favor upon a servant, He loves to see His favor upon him." A man gave something to a righteous person in secret, who raised his hand and said, "This is from the worldly life, and openness is better in it, while secrecy is better in matters of the Hereafter." Thus, some said, "If given publicly, accept, then return it in secret, for gratitude is encouraged therein." The Prophet said, "Whoever does not thank people has not thanked God Almighty." Gratitude stands in place of recompense, as the Prophet said, "Whoever does you a favor, recompense him; if you cannot, then praise him well and pray for him until you know you have recompensed him." When the Emigrants spoke of gratitude, saying, "O Messenger of God, we have seen no people better than those we stayed with; they shared their wealth with us until we feared they would take all the reward," the Prophet said, "Whatever you thank them for and praise them with is recompense."

Now, having understood these meanings, know that what is reported of people's differences regarding this is not a difference in the issue itself but a difference in states. Lifting the veil on this, we do not issue an absolute ruling that concealment is always better or openness is always better; rather, it varies with differing intentions, and intentions vary with differing circumstances.

The sincere one must vigilantly guard his soul, lest he descend by the rope of vanity and be deceived by the guile of base nature and the cunning of Satan. For deceit and trickery are more prevalent in the meanings of concealment than in those of disclosure, though Satan has an entry into both.

As for the entry of deception into secrecy, it stems from the inclination of the base nature towards it, due to what it contains of lowering one's standing and rank, causing one's worth to fall from the eyes of people, and causing the creation to look upon him with an eye of contempt while looking upon the giver with the eye of a benefactor and doer of good. This is the hidden malady, lurking within the soul, and through it Satan manifests the meanings of goodness, so that one may find pretext in the five meanings we have mentioned.

The criterion and touchstone for all this is a single matter: that his distress at the exposure of his receiving charity be like his distress at the exposure of charity received by some of his peers and equals. For if he seeks to protect people from backbiting, envy, and ill suspicion, or to guard against the violation of concealment, or to assist the giver in secrecy, or to protect knowledge from being rendered common—all of this is attained by the exposure of his brother's charity. If the exposure of his own affair is heavier upon him than the exposure of another's affair, then his estimation is to beware, for these meanings are gross deceptions and falsehoods from the cunning and tricks of Satan. For the degradation of knowledge is to be avoided because it is knowledge, not because it is the knowledge of Zayd or 'Amr. Backbiting is to be avoided because it exposes a protected honor, not because it exposes the honor of Zayd in particular. Whoever is excellent in observing such matters, perhaps Satan will be powerless against him; otherwise, one's works will remain many but his portion small.

As for the aspect of disclosure, the inclination of the base nature towards it is because it gladdens the heart of the giver, incites him to do the like, and shows others that he is among those who excel in gratitude, so that they may desire to honor him and attend to him. This is a hidden malady within the inner self, and Satan cannot overpower the devout except by promoting this vileness under the guise of the Sunnah, saying to him: "Gratitude is from the Sunnah, and concealment is from ostentation," and presenting to him the meanings we mentioned to compel him to disclose, while his hidden intent is what we have stated.

The criterion and touchstone for this is to look at the inclination of his soul towards gratitude where the news does not reach the giver nor one who desires to give him, and in the presence of a group who dislike the disclosure of the gift and desire its concealment, and whose custom is that they only give to one who conceals and does not give thanks. If these states are equal to him, then let him know that his motivator is the establishment of the Sunnah in gratitude and speaking of the blessing; otherwise, he is deluded.

Then, when he knows that his motivator is the Sunnah in gratitude, he should not neglect fulfilling the right of the giver. Let him consider: if the giver is one who loves gratitude and publicity, then it is fitting to conceal and not give thanks, for fulfilling his right is not to aid him in wrongdoing, and his seeking gratitude is wrongdoing. If he knows from his condition that he does not love gratitude nor intend it, then at that time he should thank him and disclose his charity.

For this reason, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to the man who was praised in his presence: "You have struck his neck; had he heard it, he would not have prospered," even though the Prophet (peace be upon him) would praise some people to their faces, trusting in their certainty and knowing that it would not harm them but rather increase their desire for good. He said to one: "He is the chief of the desert dwellers," and said of another: "When a noble person from a people comes to you, honor him." He heard a man's speech and was pleased with it, so he said: "Indeed, some eloquence is magic." And he said: "When one of you knows of some good in his brother, let him inform him of it, for it increases his desire for good." And he said: "When the believer is praised, faith grows in his heart." And Sufyan al-Thawri said: "Whoever knows himself, the praise of people does not harm him." He also said to Yusuf ibn Asbat: "When I bestow a favor upon you, I am more delighted by it than you, and I see it as a blessing from God Almighty upon me, so give thanks; otherwise, do not give thanks."

The subtleties of these meanings should be observed by one who is mindful of his heart, for the deeds of the limbs, with the neglect of these subtleties, are a cause of laughter and gloating for Satan due to the abundance of toil and the paucity of benefit. Knowledge such as this is that of which it is said: "Learning a single issue from it is better than a year's worship." For through this knowledge, the worship of action comes to life, and through ignorance of it, the worship of all action dies and becomes void.

In summary, taking in public and refusing in private is the best and safest of paths. One should not be swayed by embellishments unless knowledge is perfected to the point where the secret and the public become equal; that is the red sulphur which is spoken of but not seen. We ask God, the Generous, for excellent help and success.

(Clarification of What is Preferable: Taking Charity or Zakat)
Ibrahim al-Khawwas, al-Junayd, and a group held that taking from charity is preferable, for in taking Zakat there is vying with the poor and causing them hardship, and because perhaps the quality of the one taking it is not perfected.

Eligibility is as described in the Noble Book. As for voluntary charity, the matter is broader. Some have held that one may take zakah but not voluntary charity, because it is assistance in fulfilling an obligation. If all the poor were to abandon taking zakah, they would be sinful. This is because there is no sense of favor in zakah; rather, it is a right due to God, Glorified is He, as a provision for the worship of those in need. Moreover, taking zakah is based on need, and a person knows his own need with certainty. Taking voluntary charity, however, is taking based on religion, for it is generally the case that the giver gives to one he believes to be good. Also, keeping company with the poor is more conducive to humility and lowliness and further from arrogance, since a person may take charity under the guise of a gift, and it is not distinguished from it. This is an explicit indication of the humility and need involved in receiving. The correct opinion in this matter varies according to a person's circumstances, what predominates in him, and the intention present in him. If he is in doubt about possessing the attribute of eligibility, he should not take zakah. But if he knows with certainty that he is eligible—if a debt befalls him which he spends for a good purpose and has no means to repay it—then he is certainly eligible. If such a person is given the choice between zakah and voluntary charity, and if the giver of the charity would not give that wealth if this person did not take it, then let him take the charity. For the obligatory zakah, its owner will spend it on those eligible, thus multiplying good and providing more for the poor. If the wealth is presented for charity and taking zakah does not cause hardship for the poor, then he has a choice. The matter differs between the two, and taking zakah is generally more severe in breaking the ego and humbling it. And God knows best.

The Book of the Secrets of Zakah is completed by the praise of God and His help and His gracious facilitation. It will be followed, if God Almighty wills, by the Book of the Secrets of Fasting. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, and may God bless our master Muhammad and all the prophets and messengers, and the angels and those brought near from the inhabitants of the heavens and the earths, and his family and companions, and grant them abundant and perpetual peace until the Day of Judgment. Praise be to God alone, and God suffices us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.

[1] The hadith, "Islam is built upon five," both transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.
[2] The hadith of Abu Dharr: "I came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka'bah. When he saw me, he said, 'They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka'bah...'" Both Muslim and al-Bukhari transmitted it.
[3] The hadith, "There is no zakah on wealth until a year has passed upon it," Abu Dawud transmitted it from the hadith of 'Ali with a good chain, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of 'A'ishah with a weak chain.
[4] The hadith on the obligation of the zakah of al-fitr upon every Muslim, both transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar who said, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, made the zakah of al-fitr from Ramadan obligatory..."
[5] The hadith, "Give the zakah of al-fitr on behalf of those you support," al-Daraqutni and al-Bayhaqi transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded the charity of al-fitr for the young and the old, the free and the slave, among those you support." Al-Bayhaqi said its chain is not strong.
[6] The hadith, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, gave precedence to the maintenance of the child over the maintenance of the wife, and her maintenance over the maintenance of the servant," Abu Dawud transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain, and Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim who graded it sound. Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban narrated it with precedence given to the wife over the child, and it will come later.
[7] The hadith, "At Your service for a Hajj in truth, worship, and servitude," al-Bazzar and al-Daraqutni in 'The Defects' transmitted it from the hadith of Anas.
[8] The hadith, "Abu Bakr came with all his wealth, and 'Umar with half his wealth..." Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim who graded it sound transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and it does not contain his saying, "Between you two is as between my two words."
[9] The hadith, "Three destructive things..." the hadith has preceded.
[10] The hadith, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was the most generous of people, and the most generous he would be was in Ramadan..." both transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas.
[11] The hadith, "The best charity is the effort of one of little means given to a poor person in secret," Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Dharr. And Abu Dawud has from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Which charity is best?" He said, "The effort of one of little means."
[12] The hadith, "Three are among the treasures of righteousness..." among them he mentioned concealing charity. Abu Nu'aym transmitted it in the book 'Al-Ijaz wa Jawami' al-Kalim' from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain.

[13] A hadith states: "Verily, a servant performs a deed in secret, and Allah records it for him as a secret. If he then reveals it, it is transferred from the register of secrets." Al-Khatib transmitted something similar in *Al-Tarikh* from Anas with a weak chain.

[14] The hadith: "Seven whom Allah will shade in His shade..." Both [al-Bukhari and Muslim] transmitted it from Abu Hurayrah.

[15] The hadith: "Secret charity extinguishes the wrath of the Lord." Al-Tabarani transmitted it from Abu Umamah, and Abu al-Shaykh in *Al-Thawab* and al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* transmitted it from Abu Sa'id, both with weak chains. Al-Tirmidhi graded it as *hasan* from Abu Hurayrah: "Charity indeed extinguishes the wrath of the Lord." Ibn Hibban has something similar from Anas, which is also weak.

[16] The hadith: "Allah does not accept [the deed of] one who seeks repute, nor the quarreler, nor the reproacher." I have not found it exactly like this.

[17] The hadith: "Whoever casts off the cloak of modesty has no [protection from] backbiting." Ibn 'Adi and Ibn Hibban in *Al-Du'afa'* transmitted it from Anas with a weak chain.

[18] The hadith: "Allah does not accept the charity of a reproacher." This is like the previous one; I have not found a hadith for it.

[19] The hadith: "Verily, charity falls into the hand of Allah before it falls into the hand of the beggar." Al-Daraqutni transmitted it in *Al-Afrad* from Ibn 'Abbas and said it is *gharib* from 'Ikrimah from him. Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in *Al-Shu'ab* with a weak chain.

[20] The hadith: "A believer has from his prayer only what he comprehends of it." This was mentioned previously in the Book of Prayer.

[21] The hadith of Anas: "Blessed is the servant who spends from wealth he earned without disobedience." Ibn 'Adi and al-Bazzar transmitted it.

[22] The hadith: "A single dirham surpassed a hundred thousand." Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban, who graded it as *sahih*, transmitted it from Abu Hurayrah.

[23] The hadith: "Eat only the food of a pious person, and let only a pious person eat your food." Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from Abu Sa'id with the wording: "Keep company only with a believer, and let only a pious person eat your food."

[24] The hadith: "Feed your food to the pious, and bestow your kindness upon the believers." Ibn al-Mubarak transmitted it in *Al-Birr wa al-Silah* from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Ibn Tahir said it is *gharib* and contains an unknown narrator.

[25] The hadith: "Host with your food one whom Allah loves." Ibn al-Mubarak transmitted it: Juwaybir informed us from al-Dahhak, *mursal*.

[26] The hadith: "He sent a kindness to one of the poor and said to the messenger, 'Remember what he says.' When he took it, he said, 'Praise be to Allah who does not forget one who remembers Him.'" I have not found a sound source for it except in a weak hadith from Ibn 'Umar. Ibn Mandah transmitted the beginning in *Al-Sahabah* but did not cite this portion mentioned by the author, naming the man as Hudayr. It is reported from al-Bayhaqi's path that something reached Hudayr from Abu al-Darda', so he said, "O Allah, You have not forgotten Hudayr, so make Hudayr not forget You." It is said this latter one had no companionship [with the Prophet]; his *kunya* was Abu Jurayrah, and Ibn Hibban mentioned him among the reliable Successors.

[27] The hadith: "He said to a man, 'Repent.' He said, 'I repent to Allah, and I do not repent to Muhammad.'" Ahmad and al-Tabarani transmitted it from al-Aswad ibn Sari' with a weak chain.

[28] The hadith: "When the verse concerning 'A'ishah's innocence was revealed, Abu Bakr said, 'Get up and kiss the head of the Messenger of Allah.'" Abu Dawud transmitted it from 'A'ishah with the wording: "My parents said, 'Get up and kiss the head of the Messenger of Allah.' So I said, 'I praise Allah, not you two.'" Al-Bukhari has it as a *ta'liq*: "My parents said, 'Go to him.' So I said, 'No, by Allah, I will not go to him, nor will I praise you two, but I praise Allah.'" Muslim has: "My mother said to me, 'Go to him.' So I said, 'No, by Allah, I will not go to him, nor will I praise anyone except Allah.'" Al-Tabarani has: "She said, 'With the praise of Allah, not with the praise of your companion.'" And from Ibn 'Abbas: "She said, 'Not with your praise, nor with the praise of your companion.'" And from Ibn 'Umar: "Abu Bakr said, 'Get up and embrace the Messenger of Allah.' She said, 'No, by Allah, I will not draw near to him.'" In it is that she said to the Prophet, "With the praise of Allah, not with your praise."

[29] The hadith: "He used to give gifts according to the measure of need." I have not found a source for it. Abu Dawud has from 'Awf ibn Malik: "When war booty came to the Messenger of Allah, he would distribute it that day, giving the family man two shares and the bachelor one share."

[30] The hadith: "Seeking the lawful is an obligation after the [primary] obligation." Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in *Al-Shu'ab*.

Faith from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.

[31] The hadith: "Whoever does not thank people has not thanked God" was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good, from the narration of Abu Sa'id. Similar versions are found in Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is good and sound.

[32] The hadith: "Whoever does you a favor, repay him" was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain, in the wording: "Whoever does..."

[33] The hadith: "Set aside a year's provision for your family" was reported by both from the narration of 'Umar: "He would allocate his family's expenses for a year." And in al-Tabarani's "al-Awsat" from the narration of Anas: "When he set aside a year's provision for his family, he would give in charity what remained." Al-Dhahabi said it is a rejected hadith.

[34] The hadith of Sahl ibn al-Hanzaliyyah regarding the prohibition of asking while having sufficiency, so he asks for what suffices him, and he said: "His lunch and dinner." Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban reported it with the wording: "Whoever asks while having what suffices him only seeks to increase the coals of Hellfire."

[35] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whoever asks while having what suffices him will come on the Day of Resurrection with scratches on his face." The hadith was reported by the authors of the Sunan; al-Tirmidhi graded it as good, while al-Nasa'i and al-Khattabi considered it weak.

[36] The hadith of 'Ata' ibn Yasar, disconnected: "Whoever asks while having an ounce has importuned in asking." Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported it from the narration of 'Ata' from a man of Banu Asad continuously, not disconnected as mentioned by the author, because the man is a Companion, so not naming him does not harm. And Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban reported it from the narration of Abu Sa'id.

[37] The hadith: "When Abu Talha's garden preoccupied him from prayer, he said: 'I have made it charity.'" Previously mentioned in the chapter on prayer.

[38] The hadith: "Consult your heart, even if they give you a legal opinion." Previously mentioned in the chapter on knowledge.

[39] The hadith: "Give charity, even if with a date, for it satisfies the hungry and extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire." Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in "al-Zuhd" from the narration of 'Ikrimah as mursal. Ahmad reported it from the narration of 'A'ishah with a good chain: "It screens from the Fire, even if with half a date, for it satisfies the hungry as it satisfies the satiated." And Abu Ya'la and al-Bazzar reported it from the narration of Abu Bakr: "Guard against the Fire, even if with half a date, for it straightens the crooked, repels an evil death, and reaches the hungry as it reaches the satiated," but its chain is weak. And al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i in "al-Kubra" and Ibn Majah in the hadith of Mu'adh: "Charity extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire."

[40] The hadith: "Guard against the Fire, even if with half a date; if you do not find it, then with a good word." Both reported it from the narration of 'Adi ibn Hatim.

[41] The hadith: "There is no Muslim servant who gives charity from good earnings—and God only accepts what is good—..." The hadith was reported by al-Bukhari in a suspended form, Muslim, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i in "al-Kubra," and the wording is from Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[42] The hadith: "He said to Abu al-Darda': 'When you cook broth, increase its water.'" It was reported from the narration of Abu Dharr that he said that to him, and what the author mentioned that he said to Abu al-Darda' is a mistake.

[43] The hadith: "No servant gives charity well except that God makes good the succession over his estate." Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in "al-Zuhd" from the narration of Ibn Shihab as mursal with a sound chain. Al-Khatib attributed it to those who narrated from Malik from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, but considered it weak.

[44] The hadith: "Every person is in the shade of his charity until judgment is passed among people." Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim reported it, and he authenticated it according to the conditions of Muslim, from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir.

[45] The hadith: "Charity blocks seventy doors of evil." Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in "al-Birr" from the narration of Anas with a weak chain: "Indeed, God repels by charity seventy doors of an evil death."

[46] The hadith: "The giver from abundance is not more rewarded than one who accepts from need." Ibn Hibban reported it in "al-Du'afa'" and al-Tabarani in "al-Awsat" from the narration of Anas, and he reported it in "al-Kabir" from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[47] The hadith: "He was asked: 'Which charity is best?' He said: 'That you give charity while you are healthy and stingy.'" Both reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[48] He once said to his companions, "Give charity." A man said, "I have a dinar." He said, "Spend it on yourself." This hadith was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i (and this wording is his), Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it was mentioned shortly before.

[49] "Charity is not lawful for the family of Muhammad." This hadith was reported by Muslim from the narration of al-Muttalib ibn Rabi'ah.

[50] "Repel the blame of the beggar, even with something like a bird's head of food." This was reported by al-'Uqayli in *al-Du'afa'* from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[51] "If the beggar were truthful, the one who turns him away would not prosper." This was reported by al-'Uqayli in *al-Du'afa'* and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in *al-Tamhid* from the narration of 'A'ishah. Al-'Uqayli said, "Nothing in this chapter is sound." Al-Tabarani has something similar from the narration of Abu Umamah with a weak chain.

[52] "He would not entrust two traits to anyone else." This hadith was reported by al-Daraqutni from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain, and Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in *al-Birr* as a *mursal* narration.

[53] "The poor person is not the one you turn away with one or two dates." This hadith is agreed upon (by al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[54] "There is no Muslim who clothes another Muslim except that he is under the protection of God." This was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it *hasan*, and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. In its chain is Khalid ibn Tahman, who is weak.

[55] "Whoever is given a gift while he has people with him, they are his partners in it." This was reported by al-'Uqayli, Ibn Hibban in *al-Du'afa'*, al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat*, and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-'Uqayli said, "There is no sound hadith with this text."

[56] "The best thing a man can give to his brother is a piece of paper (money) or give him bread." This was reported by Ibn 'Adi and he weakened it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. "The best deed in the sight of God is to settle a debt for a Muslim, bring him joy, or feed him bread." Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it, reported from the narration of al-Bara': "Whoever gives a gift of paper (money), a gift of milk, or gives thin bread, it is like freeing a soul."

[57] "When God bestows a blessing upon a servant, He loves to see its effect upon him." This was reported by Ahmad from the narration of 'Imran ibn Husayn with a sound chain, and al-Tirmidhi graded it *hasan* from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather.

[58] "Whoever is not grateful to people is not grateful to God." This was mentioned before.

[59] The Emigrants said, "O Messenger of God, we have not seen people better than those with whom we have stayed." This hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who authenticated it, from the narration of Anas. Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i reported it concisely in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah*, as did al-Hakim, who authenticated it, and Ibn Majah.

[60] He said to the man who praised someone in his presence, "You have struck his neck. If he heard it, he would not prosper." This is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Bakrah with the wording, "Woe to you, you have severed the neck of your companion." Al-Tabarani added in his narration, "By God, if he heard it, he would never prosper." In its chain is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an, who is criticized. Ibn Majah has something similar from the narration of Abu Musa.

[61] "He is the master of the desert-dwellers." This was reported by al-'Anbari, al-Tabarani, Ibn Qani' in their compilations, and Ibn Hibban in *al-Thiqat* from the narration of Qays ibn 'Asim al-Minqari that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said that to him.

[62] "When a noble person from a people comes to you, honor him." This was reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. Abu Dawud reported it in *al-Marasil* from the narration of al-Sha'bi as a *mursal* with a sound chain, and he said it was also reported with a connected chain, but it is weak.
