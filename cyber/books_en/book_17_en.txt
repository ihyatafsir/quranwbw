The Book of Travel Etiquette
This is the seventh book of the Quarter of Customs from the books of The Revival of the Religious Sciences.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who opened the insights of His allies with wisdom and lessons, and devoted their concerns to witnessing the wonders of His creation in residence and travel. Thus, they became content with the flow of divine decree, purifying their hearts from turning toward the spectacles of sight except by way of reflection upon what glorifies Him in the pastures of vision and the courses of thought. So, the land and the sea, the plain and the rugged, the desert and the settled became equal to them. And blessings be upon Muhammad, the master of mankind, and upon his companions who followed his traces in character and conduct, abundant peace.

Now then, travel is a means to deliverance from what one flees or to attainment of what is sought and desired. Travel is of two kinds: travel with the outward body from one's abode and homeland to deserts and wastelands, and travel with the journey of the heart from the lowest of the low to the kingdom of the heavens. The more noble of the two journeys is the inward journey. For he who remains in the state upon which he was created after birth, rigid upon what he has imbibed through imitation from fathers and forefathers, remains at the stage of deficiency, content with the rank of imperfection, exchanging the vast expanse of a paradise whose width is the heavens and the earth for the darkness of the prison and the confinement of the cell. Truly, the speaker was truthful: "I have not seen among the faults of people a fault like the deficiency of those capable of completion."

However, since embarking upon this journey involves a grave and serious affair, one cannot do without a guide and a protector. The obscurity of the path, the absence of a protector and guide, and the contentment of the wayfarers with a small, diminished share rather than the abundant portion have caused its paths to become effaced. Thus, companions have been cut off therein, and the resorts of the souls, the kingdom, and the horizons have become empty of those who circumambulate them. To this, God, glorified be He, called with His saying: "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves," and with His saying, exalted be He: "And on the earth are signs for the certain in faith, and within yourselves. Then will you not see?" And regarding remaining seated from this journey, the reproach came with His saying, exalted be He: "And indeed, you pass by them in the morning and by night. Then do you not use reason?" and with His saying, glorified be He: "And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they are therefrom turning away?"

So, for whom this journey is made easy, he is ever, in his journeying, taking recreation in a paradise whose width is the heavens and the earth, while his body is settled and residing in his homeland. This is the journey wherein the watering places and sources do not become constricted, nor is there harm in crowding and converging. Rather, its spoils increase with the multitude of travelers, and its fruits and benefits multiply. Its spoils are perpetual, not forbidden, and its fruits are ever-increasing, not severed—unless a lapse appears for the traveler in his journey and a halt in his movement. For "God does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." And when they deviate, God causes their hearts to deviate, and "God is not unjust to His servants," but "they wrong themselves."

As for him who is not qualified to roam in this arena and circumambulate in the resorts of this garden, perhaps he may travel with his outward body for a long duration over counted leagues, seeking thereby trade for this world or a provision for the Hereafter. If his objective is knowledge and religion, or sufficiency to aid in religion, then he is among the travelers on the path of the Hereafter, and for him in his travel are conditions and etiquettes. If he neglects them, he is among the workers for this world and the followers of Satan. But if he adheres to them, his travel will not be devoid of benefits that attach him to the workers for the Hereafter.

We shall mention its etiquettes and conditions in two chapters, God willing, the Exalted. Chapter One: On the etiquettes from the initial departure to the final return, and concerning the intention and benefit of travel, containing two sections. Chapter Two: On what the traveler must necessarily learn regarding the concessions of travel, the indicators of the prayer direction, and the times.

Chapter One: On the etiquettes from the initial departure to the final return, and concerning the intention and benefit of travel, containing two sections. Section One: On the benefits of travel, its merit, and its intention. Know that travel is a type of movement and mixing, and within it are benefits and it has harms, as we mentioned in the Book of Companionship and Seclusion. The benefits prompting travel are not devoid of either flight or pursuit. For the traveler either has something disturbing him from his place—were it not for which he would have no objective to travel to—or he has an objective and a quest.

That which is fled from is either a matter harmful to worldly affairs, such as plague or epidemic when it appears in a land, or fear due to sedition, dispute, or high prices—this being either general as we mentioned, or specific, such as one targeted for harm in a town who flees from it. Or it is a matter harmful to religion, such as one afflicted in his homeland with status, wealth, and abundant means that prevent him from devoting himself exclusively to God, so he chooses exile and obscurity and avoids affluence and status; or such as one compelled to an innovation or to assuming an official position whose conduct is not lawful, so he seeks to flee from it.

As for that which is sought, it is either...

Worldly travel is for purposes such as wealth and status, or religious, and religious travel is either for knowledge or for action. Knowledge is either knowledge from the religious sciences, or knowledge of one’s own character traits and qualities through experience, or knowledge of the signs and wonders of the earth, like the journey of Dhul-Qarnayn and his travels across the regions of the earth. Action is either worship or visitation. Worship includes Hajj, Umrah, and jihad. Visitation is also among acts of nearness to God; it may be intended for a place, such as Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, or the frontier posts, for guarding them is an act of nearness. Or it may be intended for the saints and scholars, who are either deceased—so their graves are visited—or alive, in which case blessings are sought by seeing them, and observing their conditions strengthens the desire to emulate them. These are the categories of journeys.

Excluded from this division are the categories of the first type: travel in pursuit of knowledge, which is either obligatory or supererogatory, depending on whether the knowledge sought is obligatory or supererogatory. That knowledge is either knowledge of matters of one’s religion, or of one’s own character, or of God’s signs in His earth. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “Whoever leaves his home in pursuit of knowledge is in the cause of God until he returns.” This hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi from Anas, who said it is hasan gharib. In another report: “Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge, God will ease for him a path to Paradise.” This hadith is reported by Muslim and was mentioned earlier in the section on knowledge.

Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab would travel for days to seek a single hadith. Al-Sha‘bi said: “If a man traveled from Syria to the farthest reaches of Yemen for a word that guides him to guidance or turns him away from error, his journey would not be wasted.” Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah traveled from Medina to Egypt with ten Companions, journeying for a month for a hadith they heard that ‘Abdullah ibn Unays al-Ansari narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, until they heard it. This account is reported by al-Khatib in Kitab al-Rihlah with a hasan chain, though he did not name the Companion. Al-Bukhari said in his Sahih: “Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah traveled a month’s journey to ‘Abdullah ibn Unays for a single hadith.” Ahmad also reported it, except he said “to Syria,” with a hasan chain. Ahmad also reported that Abu Ayyub rode to ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir in Egypt for a hadith, and that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir came to Salamah ibn Mukhallad, the governor of Egypt, for another hadith. Both chains are interrupted. Every seeker of knowledge mentioned, from the time of the Companions to our own time, has attained knowledge only through travel and journeyed for its sake.

As for knowledge of oneself and one’s character, this too is important, for the path of the Hereafter cannot be traversed except by refining and purifying one’s character. Whoever is not aware of the secrets of his inner self and the hidden faults of his qualities cannot purify his heart from them. Indeed, travel is what reveals the character of men, and through it God brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth. Travel is called safar because it reveals (yusfiru) character. Thus, ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, said to someone who praised a witness before him: “Have you accompanied him on a journey, through which the nobility of his character is known?” He said no, so ‘Umar said: “I do not think you know him.” Bishr used to say: “O company of reciters, travel so that you may be purified, for when water flows, it becomes pure, but if it remains stagnant in one place, it becomes foul.”

In summary, the soul in its homeland, with the support of familiar means, does not reveal the hidden faults of its character due to its comfort with what agrees with its nature from accustomed habits. But when it bears the hardships of travel, is diverted from its usual customs, and is tested by the difficulties of being a stranger, its hidden flaws are exposed, and one becomes aware of its defects, making it possible to engage in treating them. We have mentioned in the Book of Seclusion the benefits of mixing with people, and travel is a form of mixing with the added engagement and endurance of hardships.

As for the signs of God in His earth, observing them holds benefits for the discerning. In them are contiguous landforms, mountains, deserts, seas, varieties of animals and plants, and there is nothing among them except that it bears witness to God’s oneness and glorifies Him with an eloquent tongue that none perceives except those who lend their hearing and are attentive. As for the deniers, the heedless, and those deceived by the mirage of worldly glitter, they neither see nor hear, for they are veiled from hearing and screened from the signs of their Lord. They know only the outward appearance of the life of this world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter. What is meant by “hearing” is not the outward hearing, for those intended were not veiled from that; rather, it is the inward hearing. With outward hearing, only sounds are perceived, and in this, humans share with other animals. But with inward hearing, one perceives the language of circumstance, which is an utterance beyond the utterance of speech.

It resembles the saying of one who recounts the words of the peg and the wall: The wall said to the peg, "Why do you split me?" It replied, "Ask the one who drives me in and does not leave the stone behind me." And there is not a single particle in the heavens and the earth but that it has various testimonies to God, the Exalted, affirming His Oneness—which is its declaration of His unity—and various testimonies to its Maker, sanctifying Him—which is its glorification. Yet they do not comprehend its glorification because they have not journeyed from the narrowness of outward hearing to the expanse of inward hearing, nor from the coarseness of the tongue of speech to the eloquence of the tongue of state. Were every incapable one able to undertake such a journey, Solomon, peace be upon him, would not have been uniquely endowed with understanding the speech of birds, nor would Moses, peace be upon him, have been uniquely granted hearing the speech of God, the Exalted, which must be sanctified from resemblance to letters and sounds. Whoever travels to seek these testimonies from the lines written with divine script upon the pages of inanimate objects, his journey is not prolonged in body; rather, he settles in one place and empties his heart to delight in hearing the melodies of glorifications from individual particles. So what need has he for wandering in deserts when he has sufficiency in the kingdom of the heavens? Thus, the sun, the moon, and the stars are subservient by His command, and they journey to the sight of those with insight repeatedly in the month and the year—nay, they are ceaseless in movement across successive times. It is among the wonders that one should strive to circumambulate individual mosques when the Kaaba has been commanded to circumambulate him, and it is among the wonders that one should wander the corners of the earth when the regions of the heavens wander around him. Moreover, as long as the traveler remains in need of seeing the world of sovereignty and testimony with the outward eye, he is still at the first station of those journeying to God and traveling to His presence. It is as if he is secluded at the gate of the homeland, not yet having reached the vast expanse through his journey. The only reason for lingering at this station is cowardice and deficiency. Therefore, some masters of the hearts have said, "People say, 'Open your eyes so that you may see,' but I say, 'Close your eyes so that you may see.'" Both statements are true, except that the first informs of the first station, near the homeland, and the second informs of the stations beyond it, far from the homeland, which none treads except those who risk themselves. Those who cross into them may wander therein for years, and perhaps divine guidance takes them by the hand and guides them to the straight path. The perished in the wilderness are the majority of riders on this path, but those who travel by the light of guidance have attained bliss and the abiding kingdom—they are those for whom the best has preceded from God. Compare this kingdom to the kingdom of this world, for its seekers are few relative to the multitude of creation. However great the sought-after may be, the helpers are few, and those who perish are more than those who attain. The incapable coward does not venture to seek the kingdom due to the immense danger and prolonged toil. When souls are great, bodies toil in their desires, and God has deposited honor and dominion in religion and this world only within the realm of danger. Cowardice and deficiency may be called by the names of caution and prudence, as it is said: "The cowards see cowardice as caution, and that is the deception of the base nature." This is the ruling of outward travel when intended for inward travel through contemplating the signs of God on earth. Let us return to the purpose we were pursuing and clarify the second category, which is to travel for the sake of worship, whether for pilgrimage or jihad. We have mentioned the merit of that, its etiquettes, and its outward and inward acts in the book "The Secrets of Hajj." Included within it is visiting the graves of the prophets, peace be upon them, and the graves of the companions, the successors, and all the scholars and saints. Everyone whose sight is sought for blessing in his life, visiting him after his death is also sought for blessing. It is permissible to undertake travel for this purpose, and this is not contradicted by his saying, peace be upon him, "Do not undertake journeys except to three mosques: this mosque of mine, the Sacred Mosque, and the Aqsa Mosque." The hadith "Do not undertake journeys except to three mosques" was previously mentioned in the context of Hajj because that pertains to mosques, as they are equivalent after these three mosques. Otherwise, there is no difference in the fundamental merit of visiting the graves of prophets, saints, and scholars, although they vary greatly in degrees according to the difference in their ranks with God. In summary, visiting the living is preferable to visiting the dead. The benefit of visiting the living is seeking the blessing of their supplication and the blessing of looking upon them, for looking upon the faces of scholars and the righteous is an act of worship. It also stirs the desire to emulate them and adopt their character and manners, aside from the expected scholarly benefits gained from their breaths and actions. How could it be otherwise, when merely visiting brothers for the sake of God holds merit, as we mentioned in the book "Companionship"? And in the Torah, there is a secret of four.

Visit a brother for the sake of God, but as for places, there is no meaning in visiting them except for the three mosques, and except for the frontier posts for guarding them. The hadith is clear that one should not undertake journeys seeking the blessing of places except to the three mosques. We have mentioned the virtues of the two sanctuaries in the Book of Hajj, and Jerusalem also has great merit. Ibn 'Umar left Medina heading for Jerusalem until he prayed the five prayers in it, then returned the next day to Medina. And Solomon, peace be upon him, asked his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, that for whoever intends this mosque, seeking nothing but prayer in it, that You not turn Your gaze from him as long as he remains in it until he leaves, and that You bring him out of his sins like the day his mother bore him. And God granted him that.

The third category is that the journey be to flee from a cause that disturbs one's religion, and that is also good. Fleeing from what cannot be endured is from the ways of the prophets and messengers. Among the things one must flee from are authority, status, and numerous ties and worldly means, for all of that disturbs the emptiness of the heart. Religion is not perfected except with a heart empty of all but God. If its emptiness is not perfected, it is inconceivable that one would be occupied with religion, nor is it conceivable for the heart in this world to be empty of worldly concerns and necessary needs, but it is conceivable to lighten them. Those who travel light have been saved, and those burdened have perished. Praise be to God, who did not make salvation contingent upon absolute emptiness from all burdens and loads, but accepted the one who travels light by His grace and encompassed him with the vastness of His mercy. The one who travels light is he for whom this world is not his greatest concern. That is not easily achieved in one's homeland for one whose status has expanded and whose ties have multiplied. His purpose is not achieved except through exile and obscurity and severing the ties that are unavoidable, until he disciplines his soul for a long period. Then perhaps God will support him with His assistance and bless him with what strengthens his certainty and brings tranquility to his heart, so that residence and travel become equal to him, and the presence or absence of means and ties draws near in his sight, so nothing of them prevents him from what he is intent upon: the remembrance of God. That is something whose existence is very rare. Rather, the prevalent condition of hearts is weakness and inadequacy in expanding for both creation and the Creator. Only the prophets and the saints are blessed with this strength, and reaching it through personal effort is extremely difficult, although striving and effort do have a role in it as well. The example of the disparity in inner strength therein is like the disparity in outward strength of limbs. For there is a strong man of vigor, sound of nerves, firm of build, who can bear a load weighing a thousand pounds, for example. If a weak, sick man wished to attain his rank by practicing bearing loads and gradually increasing it little by little, he would not be able to reach it. But practice and effort do increase his strength somewhat, even if that does not attain his degree. Therefore, one should not abandon effort due to despair of the highest rank, for that is the height of ignorance and the extremity of misguidance.

It was from the practice of the predecessors, may God be pleased with them, to leave their homeland for fear of tribulation. Sufyan al-Thawri said: "This is a time of evil; the obscure person is not safe in it, so how about the well-known? This is a time when a man moves from one land to another; whenever he becomes known in a place, he moves to another." Abu Nu'aym said: "I saw Sufyan al-Thawri with his water-skin in his hand and his bag on his back. I said: 'Where to, O Abu 'Abdillah?' He said: 'It reached me that there is a village where things are inexpensive; I want to reside there.' I said to him: 'And you would do this?' He said: 'Yes, if it reaches you that there is a village where things are inexpensive, then reside there, for it is safer for your religion and less for your worry.'" This was fleeing from high prices. And Sari al-Saqati used to say to the Sufis: "When winter departs, then A'dhar has come, the trees have leafed, and dispersal is pleasant, so disperse." Indeed, the elect would not reside in a town for more than forty days, and it was from the reliant ones, and he considered residing to be reliance on means, a flaw in reliance. The secrets of reliance on means will come, God willing, in the Book of Reliance.

The fourth category is journeying to flee from what harms the body, like plague, or harms wealth, like high prices, or what is similar. There is no blame in that; rather, it may sometimes be obligatory to flee in some situations, and sometimes recommended in others, according to the obligation or recommendation of the benefits that follow from it. However, plague is excepted from this; one should not flee from it due to the prohibition that has come regarding it. Usamah ibn Zaid said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "This disease or ailment is a punishment with which some nations before you were punished, then some of it remained on earth..." The hadith of Usamah ibn Zaid: "This disease or ailment is a punishment with which some nations before you were punished..." is agreed upon, and the wording is Muslim's. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The destruction of my nation will be by piercing and plague." I said: "This piercing we have known, so what is plague?" He said...

A gland like the camel's gland afflicts them in their throats; the Muslim who dies from it is a martyr, and he who remains steadfast in it, seeking reward, is like the one stationed on the frontier in the path of God, while he who flees from it is like one who flees from the battlefield. A narration from 'A'ishah: "The destruction of my community will be by the spear and the plague." The hadith is narrated by Ahmad and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Tamhid with a sound chain. And from Makhul, from Umm Ayman, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, advised one of his Companions: "Do not associate anything with God, even if you are tortured or burned. Obey your parents, even if they command you to leave everything you possess, then leave it. Do not abandon the prayer intentionally, for whoever abandons the prayer intentionally has God's covenant of protection removed from him. Beware of wine, for it is the key to every evil. Beware of disobedience, for it incurs the wrath of God. Do not flee from the battlefield, even if death befalls people while you are among them, remain steadfast among them. Spend from your abundance on your household, and do not raise your staff against them; be gentle with them for the sake of God." A narration from Umm Ayman: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, advised some of his family: "Do not associate anything with God, even if you are burned by fire." Al-Bayhaqi narrated it and mentioned it has an interrupted chain. These narrations indicate that fleeing from the plague is prohibited, as is traveling to it. The explanation of this will come in the Book of Reliance on God. These are the categories of journeys, and it is derived from them that travel is divided into blameworthy, praiseworthy, and permissible. The blameworthy is divided into the forbidden, such as the flight of a slave and the journey of one who is disobedient to parents, and into the disliked, such as leaving a land afflicted by plague. The praiseworthy is divided into the obligatory, such as the Hajj and seeking knowledge which is an obligation upon every Muslim, and into the recommended, such as visiting scholars and visiting their graves. From these causes, the intention in travel becomes clear, for the meaning of intention is the setting forth for the motivating cause and the rising to answer the call. Let his intention in all his journeys be the Hereafter. This is evident in the obligatory and recommended, and impossible in the disliked and forbidden. As for the permissible, its status reverts to the intention. Whenever his aim, for example in seeking wealth, is to become independent from begging, to preserve the covering of personal honor for his family and dependents, and to give in charity what exceeds the measure of his need, then this permissible act, by this intention, becomes among the works of the Hereafter. But if he goes out for Hajj and his motive is ostentation and reputation, it would depart from being among the works of the Hereafter, due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Actions are but by intentions." The hadith "Actions are but by intentions" is agreed upon from the narration of 'Umar, and it has preceded. His saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Actions are but by intentions," is general regarding obligations, recommendations, and permissible matters, but not regarding forbidden matters, for intention does not affect removing them from being forbidden. Some of the predecessors said: "God Almighty has appointed angels over travelers who look at their aims, and He gives each according to the measure of his intention. So whoever's intention is the worldly life, he is given from it and diminished from his Hereafter many times over, his concerns are scattered, and his occupation is increased by greed and desire. And whoever's intention is the Hereafter, he is given insight, wisdom, and understanding, and is opened for him reminders and lessons according to his intention, his concerns are gathered for him, the angels supplicate for him and seek forgiveness for him." As for considering whether travel is superior or residence, that resembles considering whether seclusion is superior or mixing with people. Its method has been mentioned in the Book of Seclusion, so let this be understood from it, for travel is a type of mixing with the added hardship and difficulty that scatters concern and distracts the heart for most people. The superior in this is what is most helpful to the religion, and the ultimate fruit of religion in this world is attaining the knowledge of God Almighty and attaining intimacy through the remembrance of God Almighty. Intimacy is attained through constant remembrance, and knowledge is attained through constant reflection. Whoever does not learn the way of reflection and remembrance cannot master them. Travel is the aid to learning in the beginning, and residence is the aid to acting upon knowledge in the end. As for constant wandering in the land, it is among the things that disturb the heart, except for the strong, for the traveler and his wealth are in a state of anxiety except what God protects. The traveler is constantly preoccupied in heart, sometimes with fear for himself and his wealth, sometimes with separation from what he is accustomed to in his residence. Even if he has no wealth to fear for, he is not free from covetousness and looking expectantly to creation; sometimes his heart weakens due to poverty, sometimes it strengthens by the consolidation of the means of covetousness. Then, the preoccupation with packing and moving disturbs all states. Therefore, the seeker should not travel except in pursuit of knowledge or to see a shaykh to be followed in his conduct and from whose presence the desire for good is gained. If he becomes occupied with himself, gains insight, and the path of reflection or action opens for him, then stillness is better for him. However, most of the Sufis of these times, as their inner selves are empty of subtle reflections and delicate works, and they have not attained intimacy with God Almighty and His remembrance...

In solitude, they were idle, neither practicing a craft nor occupied with work. They had grown accustomed to idleness, found labor burdensome, deemed the path of earning difficult, and found ease in the side of begging and solicitation. They relished the built hospices for them in the lands, and they made servants—who were appointed to serve the people—subservient to themselves. They belittled their own intellects and religions, for their aim in service was nothing but ostentation, reputation, and the spread of fame, and seizing wealth through the means of begging, under the pretext of having many followers. Thus, they had in the Sufi lodges no effective authority, nor discipline for the disciple, nor a restraining power over them. So they wore patched garments and turned the lodges into places of leisure. Perhaps they would catch embellished phrases from people of false claims, then look upon themselves as having resembled those people in their ragged dress, in their wandering, in their speech and expressions, and in apparent manners from their conduct, and they would think well of themselves, supposing they were doing good, believing every black thing to be a date, and imagining that sharing in outward appearance necessitates sharing in realities. How far-fetched! How abundant is the folly of one who cannot distinguish between fat and swelling. These are the ones whom Allah despises, for Allah the Exalted despises the idle youth. Nothing drove them to wandering except youth and leisure—except for one who travels for Hajj or Umrah without ostentation or fame, or travels to observe a shaykh to emulate in his knowledge and conduct. But the lands are now devoid of such, and all religious matters have become corrupt and weakened, except for Sufism, for it has utterly vanished and become null, because the sciences have not yet been lost, and the scholar—even if he is an evil scholar—his corruption is in his conduct, not in his knowledge, so he remains a scholar who does not act upon his knowledge, and action is other than knowledge. As for Sufism, it is an expression of the heart's devotion exclusively to Allah the Exalted and disdain for all besides Allah. Its essence reverts to the action of the heart and limbs. Whenever the action is corrupt, the foundation is lost. In the travels of these people, there is a consideration for the jurists from the perspective that it is a wearying of the soul without benefit. It may be said that this is prohibited, but the correct view according to us is to rule with permissibility, for their gains are amusement from the distress of idleness by viewing different lands. These gains, even if base, the souls of those moved by these gains are also base, and there is no harm in wearying a base animal for a base gain that suits it and returns to it—it is the one harmed and the one pleased. The legal ruling entails dispersing the common folk into permissible matters that have neither benefit nor harm. Those who wander without purpose in religion or worldly affairs, but merely for amusement in the lands, are like beasts roaming in deserts, so there is no harm in their wandering as long as they refrain from harming people and do not confuse the people about their state. Their disobedience lies in deception and begging in the name of Sufism, and consuming from endowments that were dedicated to the Sufis, for a Sufi is an expression of a righteous man, upright in his religion, with other attributes beyond righteousness. Among the least of the conditions of these people is their consumption of the wealth of rulers, and consuming the unlawful is among the major sins, so uprightness and righteousness do not remain with it. If one could imagine a sinful Sufi, one could imagine a disbelieving Sufi and a Jewish jurist. Just as a jurist is an expression of a specific Muslim, a Sufi is an expression of a specific upright person, not limiting himself in his religion to the amount that achieves uprightness. Likewise, one who looks at their outward appearances without knowing their inward states and gives them from his wealth as a means of drawing nearer to Allah the Exalted, it is forbidden for them to take, and what they consumed is unlawful gain. I mean by this if the giver is such that if he knew their inward states, he would not give them. So taking wealth by displaying Sufism without being characterized by its reality is like taking it by claiming lineage to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, through false claim. Whoever claims to be an Alid while lying, and a Muslim gives him wealth out of love for the Household, but if he knew he was lying, he would not give him anything—then his taking on that basis is unlawful. Similarly for the Sufi. For this reason, the cautious abstained from earning through religion, for one who is extremely cautious about his religion is not free inwardly from faults that, if revealed to one desiring to support him, would diminish his desire to support. Thus, they would not purchase anything themselves, fearing they might be given concessions due to their religion, and thus have earned through religion. They would appoint someone to purchase for them and stipulate to the agent not to reveal for whom he is buying. Indeed, it is only permissible to take what is given for the sake of religion if the taking is such that if the giver knew from his inward what Allah the Exalted knows, it would not necessitate a decrease in his opinion of him. The just, rational person knows from himself that this is impossible or rare, and the deluded one ignorant of himself is more likely to be ignorant of the matter of his religion, for the closest thing to his mold is his heart. If the matter of his heart is obscure to him, how can anything else be revealed to him?

This reality necessarily entails that one should eat only from one's own earnings to be safe from this peril, or eat only from the wealth of someone whom he knows with certainty that if the hidden flaws of his inner self were exposed to him, it would not prevent him from sharing with him. If a seeker of the lawful and an aspirant on the path of the Hereafter is compelled to take the wealth of another, he should declare to him and say: "If you are giving to me based on what you believe about me from religion, then I am not deserving of that. If God Almighty were to lift the veil, you would not see me with an eye of reverence; rather, you would believe me to be the worst of creation or among the wicked." If he gives to him despite that, then let him take it, for perhaps he is pleased with him for this trait—his admission against himself of the weakness of his religion and his lack of deserving what he takes. But here lies a clear trick of the soul and deception; he must be alert to it. It is that he may say this while displaying that he is imitating the righteous in blaming themselves, belittling themselves, and looking upon themselves with an eye of contempt and disdain. Thus, the outward form of the speech is the form of censure and disdain, while its inner reality and spirit is precisely praise and commendation. How many are those who blame themselves while they are praising themselves through the very act of blame? Blaming the soul in solitude with the soul is praiseworthy, but blaming in public is the essence of hypocrisy—unless he presents it in a manner that gives the listener certainty that he is a perpetrator of sins and confessing to them. This can be made understood through contextual clues, and it can also be disguised through contextual clues. The truthful one, between himself and God Almighty, knows that deceiving God, Glorified and Exalted is He, or deceiving himself is impossible, so it is not difficult for him to guard against such things. This is the discourse on the categories of travel and the intention of the traveler and its merit.

The Second Chapter: On the Etiquettes of the Traveler from the Beginning of His Departure to the End of His Return. They are eleven etiquettes.

The First: That he begins by restoring wrongfully taken rights, settling debts, preparing provision for those whose maintenance is obligatory upon him, and returning deposits if they are with him. He should take for his provisions only lawful, wholesome sustenance, and let him take an amount with which he can be generous to his companions. Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said: "From a man's nobility is the wholesomeness of his provision on his journey." It is essential in travel to have good speech, feed others, and display noble character during travel, for it brings out the hidden traits of the inner self. Whoever is suitable for companionship in travel is suitable for companionship in residence, and one who may be suitable in residence may not be suitable in travel. Therefore, it is said: "If a man's business associates in residence and his companions in travel praise him, do not doubt his righteousness." Travel is among the causes of vexation. Whoever shows excellent character in vexation is the one of truly good character; otherwise, when matters proceed according to one's purpose, bad character rarely appears. It has been said: "Three are not blamed for vexation: the fasting person, the sick person, and the traveler." The perfection of the traveler's good character is being good to the hired animal handler, assisting the companions with all that is possible, and being gentle with every stranded person by not passing him except with assistance through a mount, provision, or stopping for his sake. The perfection of that with the companions is through jesting and pleasant conversation at times, without obscenity or sin, so that it may be a cure for the vexation and hardships of travel.

The Second: That he chooses a companion and not go out alone, for the companion, then the road. Let his companion be from those who assist him in religion, reminding him when he forgets and helping and supporting him when he remembers, for a person is upon the religion of his close friend, and a man is not known except by his companion. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade a man from traveling alone. The hadith prohibiting a man from traveling alone is reported by Ahmad from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain, and it is in al-Bukhari with the wording: "If people knew what is in solitude, no rider would travel by night alone." And the hadith of the three travelers: We have narrated it from the narration of 'Ali in his famous testament, and it is a fabricated hadith. The well-known hadith is "Three are travelers," reported by Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i graded it as good from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather. And he also said: "If you are three on a journey, appoint one of you as leader." The hadith "If you are three, appoint one of you" is reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with a good chain. They used to do that and say: "This is our leader; the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded it." The hadith "They used to do that and say: 'He is the leader; the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded it'" is reported by al-Bazzar and al-Hakim from 'Umar that he said: "If you are three on a journey, appoint one of you as your leader." The leader whom the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded. Al-Hakim said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. Let them appoint the one with the best character, the gentlest with the companions, and the quickest to prefer others and seek harmony. The need for a leader is because opinions differ regarding determining stopping places, routes, and the interests of the journey. There is no order except in unity, and no corruption except in multiplicity. The affair of the world is organized only because the Manager of the whole is One: "If there were therein gods besides Allah, verily both would have been ruined." Whenever...

When management is entrusted to a single individual, the affairs of governance become orderly. But when managers multiply, matters deteriorate both in settled life and in travel—except that places of residence are not devoid of a general leader, such as the governor of a town, and a specific leader, such as the master of a household. As for travel, no leader is appointed for it except by explicit appointment. Therefore, appointment is obligatory so that scattered opinions may be united. Then, it is incumbent upon the leader to look only to the welfare of the people and to make himself a protective shield for them, as is related from ‘Abdullah al-Marwazi: Abu ‘Ali al-Ribati accompanied him and said, “Either you be the leader or I.” He replied, “Rather, you.” Thereafter, ‘Abdullah continually carried provisions for himself and for Abu ‘Ali on his back. One night it rained, and ‘Abdullah stood the entire night at his companion’s head holding a cloak to shield him from the rain. Whenever Abu ‘Ali said to him, “Do not do this,” he would respond, “Did you not say that leadership was surrendered to me? Then do not command me, nor retract your statement.” Until Abu ‘Ali said, “I wish I had died before telling you, ‘You are the leader.’” Thus should a leader be.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The best of companions are four.” The hadith “The best of companions are four” was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan gharib, and al-Hakim said it is sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. Specifying four among all numbers must have a benefit. What comes to mind is that a traveler is not free from a man who needs to be guarded and from an errand that needs to be run. If they were three, the one running the errand would be alone, leaving the traveler without a companion, thus not free from danger and from distress of heart due to missing the comfort of a companion. If two went on the errand, the one guarding the baggage would be alone, also not free from danger and distress of heart. Therefore, less than four does not suffice for the purpose, and more than four increases, so a single bond does not unite them, and companionship does not solidify among them, because the fifth is an excess beyond need, and one who is superfluous does not receive focused concern, so companionship with him is not complete. Indeed, in numerous companions there is benefit for security from fears, but four is best for specific companionship, not for general companionship. How many a companion on the journey, when companions are many, is not spoken to nor mingled with until the end of the journey because he is superfluous.

Third, he should bid farewell to the companions of his settled life, his family, and friends, and at the farewell he should supplicate with the supplication of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. Some said: I accompanied ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, from Mecca to Medina, may Allah protect it. When I intended to part from him, he escorted me and said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, say: Luqman said, ‘When Allah entrusts something, He preserves it, and I entrust to Allah your religion, your trust, and the final deeds of your life.’” The hadith of Ibn ‘Umar: “Luqman said, ‘When Allah entrusts something, He preserves it, and I entrust to Allah your religion, your trust, and the final deeds of your life.’” Reported by al-Nasa’i in “Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah,” and Abu Dawud reported it concisely with a good chain.

And Zayd ibn Arqam reported from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said, “When one of you intends to travel, let him bid farewell to his brothers, for Allah places blessing in their supplications for him.” The hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam: “When one of you intends to travel, let him bid farewell to his brothers, for Allah places blessing in their supplications for him.” Reported by al-Khara’iti in “Makārim al-Akhlaq” with a weak chain.

And from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when bidding farewell to a man, would say, “May Allah provision you with piety, forgive your sin, and direct you to good wherever you go.” The hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather: “When he bid farewell to a man, he would say, ‘May Allah provision you with piety.’” Reported by al-Khara’iti in “Makārim al-Akhlaq” and al-Mahamili in “Al-Du’a’,” and in it is Ibn Lahi’ah. This is the supplication of the resident for the one departing.

And Musa ibn Wardan said: I came to Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, to bid him farewell for a journey I intended, and he said, “Shall I not teach you, O my nephew, something the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, taught me at farewell?” I said, “Certainly.” He said, “Say: ‘I entrust you to Allah, who does not lose what is entrusted to Him.’” The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “I entrust you to Allah, who does not lose what is entrusted to Him.” Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Nasa’i in “Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah” with a hasan chain.

And from Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that a man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, “I intend to travel, so advise me.” He said to him, “In the protection of Allah and in His care. May Allah provision you with piety, forgive your sin, and direct you to good wherever you are.” The hadith of Anas: “In the protection of Allah and in His care. May Allah provision you with piety...” The hadith preceded in the chapter on Hajj in the second book; the narrator was uncertain about it.

And when entrusting to Allah, may He be exalted, what one leaves behind, one should entrust it to the collective and not specify, for it is related that ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, used to give to the people...

Their gifts when a man came to him with his son. Umar said to him, "I have never seen anyone resemble another as this one resembles you." The man said to him, "Shall I tell you something about him, O Commander of the Faithful? I intended to travel while his mother was pregnant with him. She said, 'Will you depart and leave me in this condition?' I said, 'I entrust to God what is in your womb,' and I left. Then I returned to find she had died. We sat conversing when we saw a fire upon her grave. I asked the people, 'What is this fire?' They said, 'This fire is from the grave of so-and-so; we see it every night.' I said, 'By God, she was one who fasted much and prayed much.' So I took a pickaxe until we reached the grave, and we dug. There was a lamp, and this boy crawling. It was said to me, 'This is your trust. Had you entrusted his mother, you would have found her.'" Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "He resembles you more than one crow resembles another."

The fourth is to pray the prayer of seeking guidance before his journey, as we described it in the Book of Prayer, and at the time of departure to pray for the journey. It has been narrated by Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, that a man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I have vowed a journey and have written my will. To which of the three should I entrust it: my son, my brother, or my father?" The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "No servant leaves behind in his family a deputy more beloved to God than four rak'ahs he prays in his house when he has donned his travel clothes, reciting in them the Opening of the Book and 'Say: He is God, the One,' then saying, 'O God, I draw near to You through these, so appoint them as my deputy in my family and my wealth.' They are his deputy in his family and wealth, and a protection around his home until he returns to his family." The narration of Anas: a man said, "I have vowed a journey and have written my will. To which of the three should I entrust it: my father, my brother, or my wife?" He said, "No servant leaves behind in his family a deputy more beloved to God than four rak'ahs." The hadith was reported by al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq, and it contains unknown narrators.

The fifth: when he reaches the door of the house, let him say, "In the name of God, I have placed my trust in God; there is no power nor strength except with God, the Lord. I seek refuge in You from leading astray or being led astray, from causing to slip or slipping, from oppressing or being oppressed, from acting ignorantly or being treated ignorantly." When he walks, let him say, "O God, by You I set out, in You I trust, to You I cling, and to You I turn. O God, You are my confidence and my hope, so suffice me in what concerns me and what does not concern me, and what You know better than I. Mighty is Your protection and exalted is Your praise; there is no god but You. O God, provision me with piety, forgive me my sin, and guide me to good wherever I turn." And let him supplicate with this prayer at every place he departs from. When he mounts his riding animal, let him say, "In the name of God, and by God, and God is the Greatest. I have placed my trust in God; there is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Most Great. What God wills happens, and what He does not will does not happen. Glory be to Him who has subjected this to us, for we could not have subdued it. And indeed, to our Lord we will return." When the mount stands steady beneath him, let him say, "Praise be to God who has guided us to this, for we would not have been guided had God not guided us. O God, You are the Carrier upon the back, and You are the One sought for help in affairs."

The sixth is to depart from the place in the early morning. Jabir narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, departed on Thursday when he intended Tabuk, and said, "O God, bless my community in their early mornings." The hadith of Jabir that he, peace and blessings be upon him, departed on Thursday intending Tabuk and said, "O God, bless my community in their early mornings," was reported by al-Khara'iti. And in the four Sunan collections from the hadith of Sakhr al-'Amiri: "O God, bless my community in their early mornings." Al-Tirmidhi said it is a good hadith. It is recommended to begin departure on Thursday, for it has been narrated by 'Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik from his father, who said, "Rarely did the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, depart on a journey except on Thursday." The hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik: "Rarely did the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, depart on a journey except on Thursday and Saturday." Al-Bazzar reported it restricted to Thursday, and al-Khara'iti restricted to Saturday; both are weak. And Anas narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "O God, bless my community in their early mornings on Saturday." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, when he dispatched an expedition, would dispatch it at the beginning of the day. The hadith: "When he dispatched an expedition, he would dispatch it at the beginning of the day," was reported by the four from the hadith of Sakhr al-'Amiri, and al-Tirmidhi graded it good. Abu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, narrated that he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "O God, bless my community in their early mornings on their Thursday." The hadith of Abu Hurayra: "O God, bless my community in their early mornings on their Thursday," was reported by Ibn Majah and al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq, with the wording being his. Ibn Majah said "on Thursday," and both chains are weak. And 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas said, "If you have a need with a man, seek it from him by day, not by night, and seek it in the early morning, for I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say, 'O God, bless my community in their early mornings.'"

Ibn Abbas said: When you have a need from a man, seek it from him during the day. The hadith was reported by Al-Bazzar, Al-Tabarani in Al-Kabir, and Al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq, with the wording being his. Its chain is weak. And one should not travel after the dawn of Friday, for he would be disobedient by abandoning the Friday prayer, and the day is attributed to it, so its beginning is from the causes of its obligation. And bidding farewell to the traveler is recommended, and it is a Sunnah. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "For me to bid farewell to a warrior in the path of Allah, escorting him on his mount in the morning or the evening, is more beloved to me than the world and all it contains." The hadith: "For me to bid farewell..." was reported by Ibn Majah with a weak chain from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas. The seventh: That he should not alight until the day grows hot, for that is the Sunnah, and he should do most of his traveling by night. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Take to night journeys, for the earth is folded up at night in a way it is not folded up by day." The hadith "Take to night journeys..." was mentioned previously in the second chapter of Hajj. And whenever he approaches a stopping place, let him say: "O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and what they shade, and Lord of the seven earths and what they carry, and Lord of the devils and whom they mislead, and Lord of the winds and what they scatter, and Lord of the seas and what they drive, I ask You for the good of this stopping place and the good of its inhabitants, and I seek refuge in You from the evil of this stopping place and the evil of what is in it. Turn away from me the evil of the worst among them." Then, when he alights at the stopping place, let him pray two rak'ahs there, then say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah which no righteous or wicked one can surpass, from the evil of what He has created." And when night descends upon him, let him say: "O earth, my Lord and your Lord is Allah. I seek refuge in Allah from your evil and from the evil of what is in you, and the evil of what creeps upon you. I seek refuge in Allah from the evil of every lion, black creature, snake, and scorpion, and from the evil of the inhabitants of the land, and the parent and what is born." And to Him belongs what dwells in the night and the day, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. And whenever he ascends a height of the earth during the time of travel, he should say: "O Allah, to You belongs the loftiness above every loftiness, and to You is praise in every circumstance." And whenever he descends, let him glorify Allah. And whenever he fears loneliness in his journey, let him say: "Glory be to the King, the Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit. You have covered the heavens with might and sovereignty." The eighth: That he should take precaution by day, so he does not walk alone outside the caravan, for perhaps he may be ambushed or become stranded. And he should be vigilant at night during sleep. When the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would sleep at the beginning of the night during travel, he would lay his arms out. And if he slept in the latter part of the night, he would prop his arms up and place his head in his palm. The hadith "When he would sleep..." was mentioned previously in Hajj. The purpose of that is so he is not overcome by deep sleep, and the sun rises while he is asleep unaware, for what he misses of prayer is greater than what he seeks by his travel. And it is recommended at night that the companions take turns in keeping watch, so when one sleeps, another guards. The hadith about taking turns in keeping watch was mentioned previously in Hajj in the second chapter. This is the Sunnah. And whenever an enemy or a predatory beast intends him by night or day, let him recite Ayat al-Kursi, and "Allah bears witness...", and the chapters of Sincerity (Al-Ikhlas) and the two seeking refuge (Al-Falaq and An-Nas), and let him say: "In the name of Allah, what Allah wills. There is no power except with Allah. Allah is sufficient for me. I have put my trust in Allah. What Allah wills, none brings good except Allah. What Allah wills, none averts evil except Allah. Allah is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs. Allah hears whoever calls. There is no limit beyond Allah, and no refuge below Allah. 'Allah has decreed: I will surely prevail, I and My messengers.' Indeed, Allah is All-Strong, Almighty. I have fortified myself with Allah the Almighty, and I have sought help from the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all, who does not die. O Allah, guard us with Your eye that does not sleep, and shelter us with Your pillar that cannot be reached. O Allah, have mercy on us by Your power over us, and do not destroy us while You are our trust and our hope. O Allah, incline towards us the hearts of Your male and female servants with compassion and mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful." The ninth: That he should be gentle with the riding animal if he is mounted. He should not load it with what it cannot bear, nor strike it on its face, for that is prohibited. And he should not sleep upon it, for he becomes heavy with sleep and the animal is harmed by it. The people of scrupulousness would not sleep upon their mounts except for a brief nap. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not make the backs of your mounts like chairs." The hadith "Do not make the backs..." was mentioned previously in the third chapter of Hajj. And it is recommended that he dismount from the animal in the morning and the evening to give it rest. The hadith about dismounting in the morning and evening was mentioned previously, so it is a Sunnah, and there are narrations from the predecessors about it. And some of the predecessors would hire an animal on the condition that he would not dismount, and he would pay the fee, then he would dismount to be kind to the animal, so it would be placed in the scale of his good deeds, not in the scale of the animal owner's good deeds. And whoever harms a beast by striking it or loading it with what it cannot bear will be held accountable for it on the Day of Resurrection, for in every moist liver there is a reward. Abu al-Darda, may Allah be pleased with him, said to his camel at the time of...

O death, O camel, do not contend with me before your Lord, for I did not burden you beyond your capacity. And in dismounting there are two acts of charity: one is giving rest to the mount, and the second is bringing joy to the heart of the camel driver. There is another benefit as well: exercising the body, moving the legs, and guarding against numbness of the limbs from prolonged riding. One should agree with the camel driver on what he loads upon it, little by little, presenting it to him and hiring the mount with a sound contract, lest a dispute arise between them that harms the heart and leads to excessive speech. For there is no word a servant utters except that there is with him a ready observer. So let him beware of excessive speech and obstinacy with the camel driver. It is not fitting to load beyond what was stipulated, even if it is light, for the little draws the much, and whoever hovers around the forbidden is likely to fall into it. A man said to Ibn al-Mubārak while he was upon a mount, "Carry this letter for me to so-and-so." He replied, "Until I seek permission from the camel driver, for I did not stipulate with him regarding this letter." See how he did not heed the saying of the jurists that this is something overlooked, but rather followed the path of scrupulous piety.

The tenth: One should take along six things. ʿĀʾishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, when he traveled, would carry with him five things: the mirror, the kohl container, the scissors, the tooth-stick, and the comb." The ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: "He, when he traveled, would carry with him five things: the mirror, the kohl container, the adze, the tooth-stick, and the comb." In another narration: six things. Al-Ṭabarānī in al-Awsaṭ, al-Bayhaqī in his Sunan, and al-Kharāʾiṭī in Makārim al-Akhlāq reported it, and the wording is his. All its chains are weak. In another narration from her: six things: the mirror, the small bottle, the scissors, the tooth-stick, the kohl container, and the comb. And Umm Saʿd al-Anṣārīyah said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would not be without in travel: the mirror and the kohl container." The ḥadīth of Umm Saʿd al-Anṣārīyah: "He would not be without in travel: the mirror and the kohl container." Al-Kharāʾiṭī reported it, and its chain is weak. And Ṣuhayb said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Use antimony (ithmid) when you go to bed, for it increases vision and makes the hair grow." The ḥadīth of Ṣuhayb: "Use antimony when you go to bed, for it increases vision and makes the hair grow." Al-Kharāʾiṭī reported it in Makārim al-Akhlāq with a weak chain, and it is in al-Tirmidhī, and Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān authenticated it from the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿAbbās, and Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr authenticated it, and al-Khaṭṭābī said its chain is sound. And it is narrated that he would apply kohl three times for each eye. In a narration: he applied kohl for the right eye three times and for the left eye twice. The ḥadīth: "He would apply kohl for the right eye three times and for the left eye twice." Al-Ṭabarānī reported it in al-Awsaṭ from the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿUmar with a lenient chain. The Sufis added the water-skin and the rope. And some Sufis said: "If the poor traveler does not have a water-skin and a rope, it indicates a deficiency in his religion." They only added this because of what they saw of precaution in the purity of water and washing clothes. The water-skin is for preserving pure water, and the rope for drying the washed garment and for drawing water from wells. The early ones would suffice with dry ablution (tayammum) and spare themselves the trouble of carrying water, and they would not mind performing ablution from ponds and from all waters as long as they were not certain of their impurity, to the extent that ʿUmar, may God be pleased with him, performed ablution from water in a Christian woman's jar. They would suffice with the earth and mountains instead of the rope, spreading the washed garments upon them. This is an innovation, but it is a good innovation. For the blameworthy innovation is only what contradicts established sunnahs, whereas what aids in precaution in religion is commendable. We have mentioned the rulings of meticulousness in purifications in the Book of Purification, and that one devoted to the matter of religion should not prefer the path of concession, but rather take precaution in purification, as long as it does not prevent him from a better deed. It is said that the elite among those who rely on God would not be without four things in travel and at home: the water-skin, the rope, the needle with its threads, and the scissors. And he would say: "These are not from the worldly life."

The eleventh: In the etiquettes of returning from travel. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when he returned from an expedition, or pilgrimage, or lesser pilgrimage, or other, would say "Allāhu Akbar" upon every elevated place of land three times and say: "There is no god but God alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise, and He is over all things competent. We are returning, repenting, worshiping, prostrating to our Lord, praising. God has been true to His promise and given victory to His servant and defeated the confederates alone." The ḥadīth: "When he returned from pilgrimage or an expedition or other, he would say 'Allāhu Akbar'..." The ḥadīth has preceded in the Book of Pilgrimage. And when he overlooks his city, let him say: "O God, make for us in it a settlement and good provision." Then let him send to his family someone who gives them glad tidings of his arrival, so that he does not come upon them suddenly and see what he dislikes. And it is not fitting for him to come upon them at night. The ḥadīth prohibiting coming upon the family at night has preceded.

The prohibition concerning this has been transmitted, and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), when he arrived, would first enter the mosque and pray two units of prayer, then enter his home. A narration states: When he arrived from a journey, he would first enter the mosque and pray two units of prayer, then proceed. And when he entered, he would say: "Tawban tawban li-Rabbina awban awban, la yughadiru 'alayna hawban." (We turn in repentance, we turn in repentance to our Lord, returning, returning; may He not leave upon us any sin.) This narration was reported by Ibn al-Sunni in *al-Yawm wa al-Laylah* and by al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas, who said it is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim). And it is fitting that he bring for his household and relatives a gift of food or other, according to his capability, for it is a Sunnah. It has been narrated that if he finds nothing, then let him place a stone in his saddlebag. A narration mentions the expectant gaze of his family upon arrival, even with a stone. This was reported by al-Daraqutni from the narration of 'A'ishah with a weak chain. This seems to be an emphasis on urging towards this kindness, because eyes look expectantly at the one arriving from a journey, and hearts rejoice at him. Thus, the recommendation is emphasized in affirming their joy and showing the heart's attentiveness during the journey to remembering them by what he carries along the way for them. These are a number of the outward etiquettes.

As for the inward etiquettes, a number of them are explained in the first chapter. Their essence is that he should not travel except if there is an increase in his religion through the travel. Whenever he finds his heart inclined towards diminishment, he should stop and turn back. His concern should not exceed his place of lodging; rather, he should alight where his heart alights. And he should intend, upon entering every town, to see its elders and strive to benefit from each one of them with an etiquette or a word from which he may benefit, not to narrate that and show that he met the shaykhs. And he should not reside in a town more than a week or ten days unless the intended shaykh commands him to do so. And during the period of residence, he should not sit except with the sincere poor. If his intention is to visit a brother, he should not exceed three days, for that is the limit of hospitality, unless parting is difficult for his brother. And if he intends to visit a shaykh, he should not stay with him more than a day and a night, and he should not occupy himself with socializing, for that cuts the blessing of his journey. Whenever he enters a town, he should not busy himself with anything other than visiting the shaykh by visiting his home. If he is in his house, he should not knock on his door nor seek permission to enter until he comes out. When he comes out, he should approach him with etiquette, greet him, and not speak before him unless he is asked. If he is asked, he answers according to the question, and he does not ask him about an issue unless he first seeks permission. And if he is on a journey, he should not frequently mention the foods of the towns and their generous people, nor mention his friends therein. Let him mention their shaykhs and their poor. And he should not neglect during his journey visiting the graves of the righteous; rather, he should seek them out in every village and town. And he should not show his need except according to necessity and with one who is capable of removing it. And he should adhere on the way to remembrance and recitation of the Qur'an such that he does not hear other than it. If a person speaks to him, let him leave the remembrance and answer him as long as he is speaking to him, then return to what he was upon. If his soul becomes weary of the journey or of residence, let him oppose it, for blessing is in opposing the soul. And if serving a group of righteous people becomes easy for him, he should not travel out of weariness with the service, for that is ingratitude for a blessing. Whenever he finds himself in a state of diminishment compared to what he was upon in residence, let him know that his journey is flawed, and let him return, for if it were sound, its effect would appear. A man said to Abu 'Uthman al-Maghribi: "So-and-so has departed traveling." He said: "Travel is estrangement, and estrangement is humility, and it is not for a believer to humiliate himself." He indicated by this that whoever does not have an increase in religion through travel has humiliated himself. Otherwise, the honor of religion is not attained except through the humility of estrangement. So let the journey of the seeker be from the homeland of his caprice, his desire, and his nature, until he becomes honored in this estrangement and is not humiliated. For whoever follows his caprice in his journey will inevitably be humiliated, either immediately or eventually.

The Second Chapter: Concerning What the Traveler Must Learn of the Concessions of Travel and the Indicators of the Qiblah and the Times.

Know that the traveler needs at the beginning of his journey to provision himself for his worldly life and his Hereafter. As for worldly provision, it is food, drink, and what he needs of expenses. If he sets out relying [on God] without provision, there is no harm in that if his journey is in a caravan or between connected villages. But if he rides into the desert alone or with people who have no food or drink, then if he is among those who can endure hunger for a week or ten, for example, or is able to suffice with grass, then that is permissible for him. But if he does not have the strength to endure hunger nor the ability to manage with grass, then his setting out without provision is disobedience, for he has cast himself by his hand into destruction. The secret of this will come later in the Book of Reliance. And the meaning of reliance is not to completely distance oneself from means. If it were so, then reliance would be invalidated by seeking the bucket and the rope and drawing water from the well. And it would be obligatory to be patient until God subjugates for him an angel or another person to pour water into his mouth. For...

Preserving the bucket and rope does not invalidate reliance on God, as they are merely tools for obtaining drink. Therefore, carrying food and drink where their availability is not expected is even more deserving of not invalidating it. The true reality of reliance will be addressed in its proper place, for it is a matter that is obscure except to the verified scholars of religion. As for the provision for the Hereafter, it is the knowledge required for one's purification, fasting, prayer, and worship. One must necessarily take provision of it, for travel sometimes lightens certain obligations, requiring knowledge of the concessions granted by travel, such as shortening prayers, combining them, and breaking the fast. At other times, it imposes stricter requirements that were unnecessary while settled, such as knowledge of the prayer direction and prayer times. For in a town, one relies on others through the prayer niches of mosques and the calls of the muezzins, but while traveling one may need to ascertain these matters personally. Therefore, the knowledge one needs to learn is divided into two categories. The first category is knowledge of the concessions of travel. Travel grants two concessions in purification: wiping over leather socks and using dry ablution (tayammum). In obligatory prayer, it grants two concessions: shortening prayers and combining them. In supererogatory prayer, it grants two concessions: performing it while mounted and performing it while walking. In fasting, it grants one concession: breaking the fast. These are seven concessions.

The first concession is wiping over leather socks. Safwan ibn 'Assal reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us, when we were travelers or on a journey, not to remove our leather socks for three days and their nights. This hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sound, and by Ibn Majah, al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra, Ibn Khuzaymah, and Ibn Hibban. Therefore, anyone who wears leather socks in a state of purity that permits prayer, then experiences a minor impurity, may wipe over his socks from the time of his impurity for three days and their nights if he is a traveler, or for one day and night if he is resident. However, this is subject to five conditions:

First, that the socks are worn after the completion of the ablution. If a man washes his right foot and inserts it into the sock, then washes his left foot and inserts it, wiping is not permissible according to Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, until he removes the right sock and puts it back on.

Second, that the sock is sturdy enough for walking. Wiping over the sock is permissible even if it is not soled, as the common practice involves moving about in dwellings with them, for they possess general sturdiness, unlike woolen socks, over which wiping is not permissible. Similarly, a weak leather overshoe is not permissible.

Third, that there is no hole in the place where washing is obligatory. If it is torn such that the area of the obligatory washing is exposed, wiping over it is not permissible. Imam al-Shafi'i has an old opinion that it is permissible as long as it stays on the foot, which is also the school of Malik, may God be pleased with him. There is no harm in this due to the pressing need for it and the difficulty of sewing it while traveling at all times. A woven slipper is permissible to wipe over as long as it is covering, with the skin of the foot not visible through it. Similarly, a split sock that is laced over the split area is permissible, because need necessitates all of that. The only consideration is that it covers above the ankles in any manner. However, if it covers part of the top of the foot and the remainder is covered by a wrapping, wiping over it is not permissible.

Fourth, that one does not remove the sock after wiping over it. If one removes it, it is preferable to renew the ablution. If one confines oneself to washing the feet, it is permissible.

Fifth, that one wipes over the area corresponding to the place of the obligatory washing, not on the shin. The minimum is what can be called wiping on the top of the foot over the sock. If one wipes with three fingers, it suffices. It is preferable to avoid the semblance of disagreement, and the most complete method is to wipe its top and bottom at once without repetition. The hadith about him, peace and blessings be upon him, wiping over the top and bottom of his sock is reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it weak, and Ibn Majah from the narration of al-Mughirah. Al-Bukhari and Abu Zur'ah similarly weakened it. The description of the Prophet's action, peace and blessings be upon him, is to moisten the hands, place the fingertips of the right hand on the toes of the right foot over the sock and wipe it by drawing the fingers toward oneself, and place the fingertips of the left hand on the heel from the bottom of the sock and pass them to the top of the foot.

If one wipes as a resident then travels, or as a traveler then settles, the ruling of residence takes precedence, so one must confine oneself to one day and night. The count of the three days is calculated from the time of the impurity after wiping over the sock. If one wore the socks while settled and wiped while settled, then departed and experienced an impurity while traveling at noon, for example, one may wipe for three days and their nights from that noon to the noon of the fourth day. When the sun passes the zenith on the fourth day, one may not pray except after washing the feet. One washes the feet, puts the socks back on, observes the time of the impurity, and recommences the count from the time of the impurity. If one experienced an impurity after wearing the socks while settled, then departed after the impurity, one may wipe for three...

Days, for custom may dictate wearing footwear before departure, and one cannot guard against impurity. As for when one performs ablution by wiping over footwear while settled and then travels, one limits it to the duration of residents. It is recommended for anyone intending to wear leather socks, whether settled or traveling, to turn the socks inside out and shake out what may be inside, fearing a snake, scorpion, or thorn. It has been narrated from Abu Umamah that he said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, called for his leather socks and put on one of them. A crow came and carried off the other, then dropped it, and a snake came out of it. So he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him not put on his leather socks until he shakes them out." The narration of Abu Umamah: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him not put on his leather socks until he shakes them out," was reported by al-Tabarani. In it is one who does not know the second concession: performing dry ablution with dust instead of water when there is an excuse. Water is only considered unavailable if it is far from the dwelling, a distance such that if one walked to it, the caravan's rescue would not reach him if he shouted or called for help—that is, a distance not customary for the people of the dwelling in their comings and goings to relieve themselves, the frequenting of it. Likewise, if an enemy or a predatory beast descends upon the water, dry ablution is permissible even if the water is near. Likewise, if he needs it for his thirst on that day or after his day due to the loss of water before him, he may perform dry ablution. Likewise, if he needs it for the thirst of one of his companions, he is not permitted to perform ablution and is obliged to offer it, whether for a price or without price. If he needed it to cook broth or meat or to moisten dry crumbs to gather them with it, dry ablution is not permissible for him; rather, he must make do with dry crumbs and refrain from consuming the broth. Whenever water is gifted to him, he must accept it; if its price is gifted to him, he is not obliged to accept it due to the sense of obligation involved. If it is sold for its fair price, he must purchase it; if sold at a loss, he is not obliged. If he has no water and intends to perform dry ablution, the first obligation is to seek water as long as reaching it by seeking is possible, which is by moving around the dwelling, searching the luggage, and seeking remnants in vessels and places of purification. If he forgot water in his luggage or forgot a well near him, he must repeat the prayer due to his negligence in seeking. If he knows he will find water at the end of the time, it is preferable to pray with dry ablution at the beginning of the time, for life cannot be relied upon, and the beginning of the time is God's pleasure. Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, performed dry ablution, and it was said to him: "Do you perform dry ablution while the walls of Medina are looking at you?" He said: "Or should I remain until I enter it?" Whenever he finds water after beginning the prayer, his prayer is not invalidated, and ablution is not obligatory. If he finds it before beginning the prayer, ablution is obligatory. Whenever he seeks and does not find, let him aim for pure earth with dust from which dust rises, and strike it with his palms after joining his fingers, one strike, and wipe his face with it; then strike another strike after removing the ring and separate the fingers, and wipe his hands up to his elbows. If one strike does not cover all of his hands, he strikes another. The method of gentleness in it is what we mentioned in the Book of Purification, so we do not repeat it. Then, if he prays one obligatory prayer with it, he may perform voluntary prayers as he wishes with that dry ablution. If he intends to combine two obligatory prayers, he must renew the dry ablution for the second prayer, so he does not pray two obligatory prayers except with two dry ablutions. One should not perform dry ablution for a prayer before its time enters; if he does, he must repeat the dry ablution. And let him intend, when wiping the face, the permissibility of prayer. If he finds some water sufficient for part of his purification, he uses it, then performs a complete dry ablution afterward. The third concession in obligatory prayer is shortening. One may shorten each of the noon, afternoon, and night prayers to two units, but with three conditions: First, that he performs them in their times; if they become make-up prayers, the apparent ruling is the obligation of completion. Second, that he intends shortening; if he intends completion, completion is obligatory. If he doubts whether he intended shortening or completion, completion is obligatory. Third, that he does not follow a resident or a traveler who is completing; if he does, completion is obligatory. Indeed, if he doubts whether his imam is a resident or a traveler, completion is obligatory, even if he later ascertains that he is a traveler, because the sign of a traveler is not hidden, so let him be certain at the time of intention. If he doubts whether his imam intended shortening or not after knowing he is a traveler, that does not harm him, for intentions are not known. All of this is when on a long, permissible journey. The definition of travel from the perspective of beginning and end is problematic, so it must be known. Travel is moving from a place of residence with the intent tied to a known destination. The wanderer and the rider of aimless journeys do not have the concession; he is one who does not aim for a specific place and does not become a traveler until he leaves the built-up area of the town. It is not required to pass beyond the ruins of the town and its gardens that the people of the town go to for recreation. As for the village, the traveler...

Among these, one should pass by enclosed orchards but not those that are not enclosed. If a traveler returns to a town to retrieve something he forgot, he may not shorten his prayers if that is his hometown, unless he has passed beyond the inhabited area. If it is not his hometown, then he may shorten his prayers, for he becomes a traveler by the disturbance and departure from it. As for the end of the journey, it is determined by one of three matters: first, reaching the inhabited area of the town where he intends to reside; second, intending to stay for three days or more, whether in a town or in the desert; third, the actual act of staying, even without intention, as when one remains in one place for three days excluding the day of arrival—after that, he may not shorten his prayers, even if he did not intend to stay. If he has business and expects to complete it each day, but it is delayed and prolonged, he may shorten his prayers according to the more correct of two opinions, for he is disturbed in his state and a traveler away from home in his situation, and no consideration is given to the mere fact of staying in one place while the heart is unsettled. There is no difference whether this business is fighting or otherwise, nor whether the duration is long or short, nor whether departure is delayed due to rain whose persistence for three days is unknown or for other reasons, since the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, shortened his prayers in some military expeditions for eighteen days in one place—a narration of his shortening, peace and blessings be upon him, in some expeditions for eighteen days in one place is reported by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Imran ibn Husayn in the story of the Conquest, where he stayed in Mecca for eighteen nights praying only two rak'ahs; and by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn Abbas that he stayed in Mecca for nineteen days shortening the prayer; and by Abu Dawud for seventeen days with the sīn advanced, and in another narration of his for fifteen days. The apparent meaning is that if the fighting continued, his shortening would continue, for there is no sense in limiting it to eighteen days, and it is evident that his shortening was due to being a traveler, not because he was a fighter in an expedition. This is the meaning of shortening. As for the meaning of the distance, it is two stages, each stage being eight parasangs, each parasang three miles, each mile four thousand steps, and each step three feet. The meaning of permissibility is that one is not disobeying one's parents or fleeing from them, nor fleeing from one's master, nor is a woman fleeing from her husband, nor is one who owes a debt fleeing from the creditor while having the means, nor is one intending to cut off a road, kill a person, seek unlawful gain from a tyrannical ruler, or spread corruption among Muslims. In summary, a person should not travel except for a purpose, and the purpose is the motivator. If achieving that purpose is unlawful, and were it not for that purpose he would not have embarked on his journey, then his travel is sinful and he may not shorten his prayers. As for immorality during travel, such as drinking wine or other sins, it does not prevent the concession; rather, every travel that the Sacred Law forbids is not aided by the concession. If one has two motivations, one permissible and the other forbidden, and it is such that if the forbidden motivation were absent, the permissible one would independently motivate him and he would inevitably travel for it, then he may shorten his prayers. Regarding the wandering Sufis who travel through lands without a valid purpose other than sightseeing to observe different places, there is disagreement about their shortening of prayers; the preferred opinion is that they may shorten them. The fourth concession is combining the noon and afternoon prayers within their respective times, and the sunset and night prayers within their respective times; this is also permissible in every long, permissible journey, and regarding its permissibility in short journeys, there are two opinions. Then, if one advances the afternoon prayer to the noon prayer, he should intend to combine the noon and afternoon prayers within their times before finishing the noon prayer, and he should give the call to prayer for noon and stand for it; upon finishing, he should give the call to prayer for afternoon and renew the dry ablution first if dry ablution is obligatory for him, and he should not separate them by more than a dry ablution and call to prayer. If he advances the afternoon prayer, it is not permissible; if he intends the combination at the commencement of the afternoon prayer, it is permissible according to al-Muzani, and there is a basis for this in analogy, for there is no evidence requiring the intention to be advanced; rather, the Sacred Law permits combination, and this is a combination, and the concession is for the afternoon prayer, so the intention for it suffices. As for the noon prayer, it proceeds according to the rule. Then, when he finishes the two prayers, he should combine the supererogatory prayers of both; there is no supererogatory prayer after the afternoon prayer, but the supererogatory prayer after noon he should pray after finishing the afternoon prayer, whether mounted or stationary, because if he prayed the regular supererogatory of noon before the afternoon prayer, the continuity would be broken, and it is obligatory in a sense. If he wishes to pray the four supererogatory rak'ahs before noon and the four supererogatory before afternoon, he should combine them before the obligatory prayers, praying the supererogatory of noon first, then the supererogatory of afternoon, then the obligatory noon prayer, then the obligatory afternoon prayer, then the two rak'ahs of the noon supererogatory that are after the obligation. One should not neglect supererogatory prayers during travel, for what he misses of them...

Its gates are more numerous than what one attains from profit, especially since the Law has lightened it for him and permitted him to perform it while mounted, so that he is not hindered from the caravan because of it. If he delays the Zuhr until the 'Asr, he proceeds according to this order and is not concerned about performing the regular Sunnah prayers of Zuhr after 'Asr in the disliked time, because what has a cause is not disliked in this time. Likewise, he does for Maghrib, 'Isha', and Witr. If he advances or delays, then after completing the obligatory prayer, he occupies himself with all the regular Sunnah prayers and concludes them all with Witr. If he remembers the Zuhr before its time has exited, he should resolve to perform it together with 'Asr; this is the intention for combining, for he only becomes devoid of this intention either by an intention to abandon it or by an intention to delay it beyond the time of 'Asr, and that is forbidden, and resolving upon it is forbidden. If he does not remember the Zuhr until its time has exited, whether due to sleep or preoccupation, he may perform Zuhr with 'Asr and is not sinful, for travel can preoccupy one from performing the prayer just as it can preoccupy one from remembering it. It is plausible to say that Zuhr only counts as performed if one resolves to perform it before its time exits, but the more apparent view is that the time for Zuhr and 'Asr becomes shared for the two prayers during travel. Therefore, a menstruating woman is obligated to make up Zuhr if she becomes pure before sunset. Hence, it becomes clear that continuity and order between Zuhr and 'Asr are not stipulated when delaying Zuhr. However, if one advances 'Asr before Zuhr, it is not permissible, because what is after completing Zuhr is what is made the time for 'Asr, since it is unlikely that one would occupy himself with 'Asr who is resolved to abandon Zuhr or to delay it. The excuse of rain permits combining just as the excuse of travel. Abandoning Jumu'ah is also among the concessions of travel, and it is also connected to the obligatory prayers. If one intends to settle after having prayed 'Asr and then catches the time of 'Asr while resident, he must perform 'Asr, and what has passed was only valid on the condition that the excuse remained until the exit of the time of 'Asr.

The fifth concession: Voluntary prayer while riding. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, used to pray on his mount wherever his riding animal turned. A hadith: "He used to pray on his mount wherever his riding animal turned, and he performed Witr on the mount," agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. The one performing voluntary prayer while riding is only required to gesture for the bowing and prostration, and he should make his prostration gesture lower than his bowing gesture. He is not required to bend to a degree that exposes him to danger because of the animal. If he is in a resting place, he should complete the bowing and prostration, for he is capable of it. As for facing the Qiblah, it is not obligatory, neither at the beginning of the prayer nor during its continuance. However, facing the direction of the road indicates the Qiblah, so let him be in all his prayer either facing the Qiblah or facing the direction of the road so that he has a direction in which to remain steady. If he turns his animal away from the road intentionally, his prayer is invalidated, unless he turns it towards the Qiblah. If he turns it forgetfully and the time is short, his prayer is not invalidated; if it is long, there is a difference of opinion. If the animal bolts and swerves, his prayer is not invalidated, because that is something that frequently occurs and is not attributed to him, unlike if he turned it forgetfully, in which case he performs the prostration of forgetfulness by gesture.

The sixth concession: Voluntary prayer for the walker is permissible during travel. He gestures for the bowing and prostration and does not sit for the Tashahhud, because that nullifies the benefit of the concession. Its ruling is the same as that of the rider, but he should begin the prayer facing the Qiblah, because turning momentarily is not difficult for him, unlike the rider, for turning the animal, even if the reins are in his hand, involves some difficulty, and perhaps the prayer becomes lengthy, prolonging that for him. He should not walk intentionally on wet impurity; if he does, his prayer is invalidated, unlike if the rider's animal steps on impurity. He is not required to disturb his walking by avoiding impurities which the road is generally not free from. Anyone fleeing from an enemy, flood, or predatory beast may pray the obligatory prayer while riding or walking, as we mentioned for the voluntary prayer.

The seventh concession: Breaking the fast, which pertains to fasting. The traveler may break the fast, except if he begins the day as a resident and then travels; he must complete that day. If he begins the day as a traveler fasting and then settles, he must complete it. If he settles while having broken the fast, he is not required to abstain for the remainder of the day. If he begins the day as a traveler with the intention to fast, it is not obligatory for him; rather, he may break the fast if he wishes. Fasting is better than breaking the fast, and shortening is better than completing, to avoid the semblance of disagreement and because he is not under the obligation of making it up, unlike the one who breaks the fast, for he is under the obligation of making it up, and perhaps that becomes impossible for him due to an obstacle, so it remains as a debt upon him, unless fasting harms him, in which case breaking the fast is better. These are seven concessions: three pertain to long travel, which are shortening, breaking the fast, and wiping (over footwear) for three days; and two pertain...

Among these are travel, whether long or short, and they are the omission of the Friday prayer and the omission of making up prayers when performing prayer with dry ablution. As for voluntary prayers while walking or riding, there is disagreement, and the most correct opinion is its permissibility in short journeys. Combining two prayers also has disagreement, and the most apparent is its restriction to long journeys. As for obligatory prayer while riding or walking due to fear, it is not related to travel; likewise, eating carrion, and likewise, performing prayer immediately with dry ablution when water is unavailable, but rather both resident and traveler share in it whenever its causes are present.

If you say: "Is knowledge of these concessions obligatory for the traveler to learn before the journey, or is it recommended for him?" Then know that if he intends to forego wiping over footwear, shortening prayers, combining prayers, breaking the fast, and forgoing voluntary prayer while riding or walking, then knowledge of the conditions for taking concessions in that is not obligatory upon him, because taking concessions is not obligatory upon him. However, knowledge of the concession of dry ablution is obligatory upon him, because the unavailability of water is not within his control, unless he travels along the bank of a river he is confident will retain its water, or there is with him on the journey a scholar whom he can ask when needed; then he may delay until the time of need. But if he anticipates the absence of water and has no one with him, then learning it is inevitably obligatory.

If you say: "Dry ablution is needed for a prayer whose time has not yet entered, so how can knowledge of purification be obligatory for a prayer that is not yet obligatory and may never become obligatory?" I say: For one between whom and the Kaaba is a distance that cannot be covered except in a year, it is obligatory upon him to begin the journey before the months of Hajj, and it is inevitably obligatory upon him to learn the rites if he anticipates that he will not find on the way someone to learn from, because the foundation is life and its continuity, and that without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is itself obligatory. And everything whose obligation is anticipated with an apparent likelihood based on presumption, and it has a condition that cannot be attained except by fulfilling that condition before the time of obligation, then fulfilling the learning of that condition is inevitably necessary, like learning the rites before the time of Hajj and before undertaking it. Therefore, it is not permissible for a traveler to embark on a journey without learning this amount of knowledge regarding dry ablution. And if he intends the other concessions, he must also learn the amount we mentioned of the knowledge of dry ablution and the other concessions, for if he does not know the permissible extent of the travel concessions, he cannot limit himself to them.

If you say: "If he does not learn how to perform voluntary prayer while riding or walking, what harm is there? At most, if he prays, his prayer would be invalid, and it is not obligatory, so how can knowledge of it be obligatory?" I say: It is obligatory not to perform voluntary prayer in a manner of corruption, for performing voluntary prayer in a state of minor impurity, impurity, not facing the qibla, and without completing the conditions and pillars of prayer is forbidden. Therefore, he must learn what protects him from invalid voluntary prayer, to avoid falling into prohibitions. This clarifies the knowledge of what is lightened for the traveler in his journey.

The second category is what becomes newly obligatory due to travel, which is knowledge of the qibla and the times. This is also obligatory for the resident, but for the resident there is someone who suffices him—a prayer niche agreed upon spares him seeking the qibla, and a caller to prayer who observes the time spares him seeking knowledge of the times. The traveler may become confused about the qibla and uncertain about the time, so he must have knowledge of the indicators of the qibla and the prayer times.

As for the indicators of the qibla, they are three categories: terrestrial, such as deducing from mountains, villages, and rivers; atmospheric, such as deducing from winds—their north, south, easterly, and westerly; and celestial, which are the stars. As for the terrestrial and atmospheric, they vary with different lands, for perhaps a path has a high mountain known to be to the right of the qibla, or to its left, behind it, or in front of it; let him know and understand that. Likewise, winds may indicate in some lands; let him understand that. We cannot exhaustively detail this, for each land and region has another ruling.

As for the celestial, its indicators are divided into daytime and nighttime. As for the daytime, it is the sun. He must observe before leaving the locality where the sun is at its zenith relative to him—is it between his eyebrows, on his right eye, left eye, or inclined to his forehead more than that? For the sun does not exceed these positions in northern lands. If he memorizes that, then whenever he recognizes the zenith by its indicator, which we will mention, he knows the qibla by it. Likewise, he observes the positions of the sun relative to him at the time of Asr, for in these two times he necessarily needs the qibla. This also, because it varies by lands, cannot be exhaustively detailed.

As for the qibla at Maghrib time, it is apprehended by the place of sunset, which is by noting that the sun sets to the right of the qibla, or is inclined toward his face or his back. And by the twilight, the qibla is known for the last Isha prayer, and by the sunrise, the qibla is known for the Fajr prayer. Thus, it is as if the sun indicates the qibla for the five prayers, but it varies.

That is in winter and summer, for the risings and settings are many, though they are confined to two directions. Yet it is necessary to learn that as well. However, one may pray Maghrib and 'Isha after the disappearance of twilight, so he cannot use it to determine the qiblah. He must then observe the position of the pole, which is the star called al-Jady (the Goat), for it is a fixed star whose movement from its place is not apparent. This is either behind the one facing it, or on his right shoulder from his back, or his left shoulder in the northern lands from Mecca. In the southern lands, like Yemen and its vicinity, it falls opposite the one facing it. Let him learn that, and what he knows in his own land, let him rely upon it for the entire journey, unless the travel is long. For when the distance becomes great, the position of the sun, the position of the pole, and the positions of the risings and settings differ, unless he reaches a town during his journey. Then he should ask people of insight, or observe these stars while facing the mihrab of the town's congregational mosque until it becomes clear to him. Whenever he learns these indicators, he may rely upon them. If it becomes clear to him that he erred from the direction of the qiblah to another of the four directions, he must make it up. But if he deviated from the exact alignment of the qiblah yet did not depart from its general direction, making it up is not obligatory.

The jurists have presented a disagreement regarding whether the requirement is the direction of the Ka'bah or its exact location. The meaning of this became problematic for some people, for they said: If we say the requirement is the exact location, how is this conceivable given the distance of the lands? And if we say the requirement is the direction, then one standing in the mosque who faces the direction of the Ka'bah while his body is outside of alignment with the Ka'bah—there is no disagreement that his prayer is not valid. They elaborated on interpreting the meaning of the disagreement concerning direction and exact location. First, it is necessary to understand the meaning of facing the exact location and facing the direction.

The meaning of facing the exact location is to stand in a position such that if a straight line were drawn from between his eyes to the wall of the Ka'bah, it would reach it, and two equal angles would be formed on either side of the line. This is its illustration. The line extending from the worshipper's position is conceived as coming from between his eyes. This is the illustration of facing the exact location.

As for facing the direction, it is permissible for the end of the line extending from between the eyes to reach the Ka'bah without the two angles on either side of the line being equal. Rather, the two angles are not equal unless the line ends at a specific, single point. If this line were extended straight to other points to its right or left, one of the angles would become narrower, thus departing from facing the exact location, but not from facing the direction. Like the line we have written upon for facing the direction: if the Ka'bah were conceived at the end of that line, the one standing would be facing the direction of the Ka'bah, not its exact location. The limit of that direction is what falls between two lines imagined by the one facing the direction, emanating from the eyes and meeting at their ends inside the head between the eyes at a right angle. Whatever falls between the two lines emanating from the eyes is within the direction. The width between the two lines increases with the length of the lines and the distance from the Ka'bah. This is its illustration, peace be upon him.

Once the meaning of exact location and direction is understood, I say: What is correct according to us in legal opinion is that the requirement is the exact location if the Ka'bah is something that can be seen. If one needs to deduce it due to the impossibility of seeing it, then facing the direction suffices. As for requiring the exact location when it is observable, there is consensus on that. As for sufficing with the direction when observation is impossible, the Book, the Sunnah, the practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and analogy indicate this.

As for the Book, it is His saying, exalted is He: "And wherever you are, turn your faces towards its direction" (2:144), meaning towards it. Whoever faces the direction of the Ka'bah is said to have turned his face towards its direction.

As for the Sunnah, it is what is reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said to the people of Medina: "What is between the west and the east is a qiblah." The hadith "What is between the east and the west is a qiblah" was reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih, and by al-Nasa'i who said it is munkar, and by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. The west is to the right of the people of Medina and the east to their left, so the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) made all that lies between them a qiblah. The area of the Ka'bah does not encompass what is between the east and the west; only its direction encompasses that. This wording was also reported from 'Umar and his son (may Allah be pleased with them both).

As for the practice of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), it is reported that the people of Quba' were in the Fajr prayer in Medina, facing Bayt al-Maqdis with their backs to the Ka'bah, because Medina is between them. It was said to them: "Now the qiblah has been changed to the Ka'bah," so they turned around during the prayer without seeking any indicator. The hadith: "The people of Quba' were in the Fajr prayer facing Bayt al-Maqdis..."

Indeed, the qibla has been changed to the Kaaba, so they turned around. This hadith was reported by Muslim from the narration of Anas, and both agreed upon it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with some variation, and it was not rejected. Their mosque was named "the Mosque of the Two Qiblas." Aligning the eye from Medina to Mecca is not known except through geometric proofs that require lengthy consideration, so how did they perceive that immediately during prayer and in the darkness of night? Their actions also indicate that they built mosques around Mecca and throughout the lands of Islam, and they never brought a geometrician when aligning the prayer niches, for aligning the eye is only perceived through precise geometric observation.

As for the analogy, the need arises to face the qibla and build mosques in all regions of the earth, and aligning the eye is only possible through geometric sciences not mandated by the Sharia to study; indeed, delving deeply into its knowledge may even be discouraged. So how can a matter of the Sharia be built upon it? Therefore, one must suffice with the direction out of necessity. As for the proof of the validity of the form we have described, which confines the directions of the world to four, it is the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, regarding the etiquette of relieving oneself: "Do not face the qibla nor turn your back to it, but face east or west." This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Ayyub. He said this in Medina, where the east is to the left of one facing it and the west to the right. Thus, he prohibited two directions and permitted two, making a total of four directions. It never occurred to anyone that the directions of the world could be assumed as six, seven, or ten, and however it may be, what is the ruling for the remainder? Rather, directions are established in beliefs based on human creation, and he has only four directions: front, back, right, and left. Thus, the directions relative to a person are apparently four, and the Sharia is built only upon such beliefs. So it becomes clear that what is required is the direction, and that eases the effort in striving for it and learning the means of the qibla.

As for aligning the eye, it is known by knowing the latitude of Mecca from the equator and the degrees of its longitude, which is its distance from the first construction in the east. Then that is also known at the prayer site, then one aligns one with the other, requiring lengthy instruments and means, and the Sharia is certainly not built upon that. Therefore, the extent necessary for validity must be learned from the indicators of the qibla: the position of east and west at noon and the position of the sun at 'Asr time. Through this, the obligation is fulfilled.

If you say: If a traveler sets out without learning that, is he sinful? I say: If his path passes through connected villages with prayer niches, or if there is with him on the way someone knowledgeable of the qibla indicators trusted for his integrity and insight whom he can follow, then he is not sinful. But if he has none of that, he sins because he will encounter the obligation of facing the qibla without having acquired its knowledge, making it like the knowledge of tayammum and others. If he learns these indicators and the matter becomes obscure to him due to dark clouds, or he neglects learning and finds no one on the way to follow, then he must pray at the time according to his situation, and then he must make it up whether he was correct or mistaken.

The blind person has no option but to follow, so let him follow someone trusted for his religion and insight if his guide strives regarding the qibla. If the qibla is evident, he may rely on the statement of any just person who informs him of it, whether at home or traveling. It is not permissible for the blind or the ignorant to travel in a caravan that has no one who knows the qibla indicators where proof is needed, just as it is not permissible for a layperson to reside in a town without a jurist knowledgeable in the details of the Sharia; rather, he must emigrate to where he finds someone to teach him his religion. Likewise, if there is only a corrupt jurist in the town, he must also emigrate, for it is not permissible for him to rely on the fatwa of a corrupt person; rather, integrity is a condition for accepting a fatwa, as in narration. If he is known for jurisprudence and his state is concealed regarding integrity or corruption, he may accept it as long as he finds no one with apparent integrity, for a traveler in the lands cannot investigate the integrity of jurists. If he sees him wearing silk or what is predominantly silk, or riding a horse with a golden saddle, his corruption has become apparent, and it becomes impermissible to accept his statement, so he must seek another. Similarly, if he sees him eating at the table of a ruler whose wealth is mostly unlawful, or receiving a stipend or gift from him without knowing that what he takes is from a lawful source, all of that is corruption that undermines integrity and prevents accepting fatwas, narrations, and testimony.

As for knowing the times of the five prayers, it is essential. The time of Dhuhr begins at noon, for every person inevitably has at the beginning of the day a long shadow on the west side, then it does not cease...

It decreases until the time of the sun's meridian passage (zawāl), then begins to increase on the eastern side, and continues increasing until sunset. The traveler should stand in a place or erect a straight stick and mark the tip of the shadow. Then, after an hour, he should look; if he sees it decreasing, the time for the noon prayer (ẓuhr) has not yet entered. The method for knowing this is to observe in a settled town, at the time of the call of a reliable caller to prayer (muʾadhdhin), the shadow of one's own height. If it was, for example, three feet by one's own foot, then whenever it becomes the same during travel and begins to increase, he should pray. If it increases beyond that by six and a half feet by one's own foot, the time for the afternoon prayer (ʿaṣr) has entered, for the shadow of every person by his own foot is approximately six and a half feet. Then, the meridian shadow increases each day if his journey is from the beginning of summer, and if it is from the beginning of winter, it decreases each day. The best means by which to know the meridian shadow is the balance (mīzān, a type of sundial), so the traveler should carry it and learn the variation of the shadow by it at every time. If he knows the position of the sun relative to the direction of the qiblah at the time of the meridian, and he is traveling in a place where the qiblah has become apparent by another indication, he can know the time by the sun, such as when it is between his eyes, if it was so in the settled town. As for the time of the sunset prayer (maghrib), it enters with sunset. But mountains may conceal the sunset from him, so he should look towards the eastern side; whenever darkness appears on the horizon, rising from the earth to the measure of a spear's length, the time for the sunset prayer has entered. As for the night prayer (ʿishāʾ), it is known by the disappearance of the twilight, which is the redness. If it is concealed from him by mountains, he knows it by the appearance of the small stars and their multitude, for that occurs after the disappearance of the redness. As for the dawn prayer (ṣubḥ), it first appears elongated like the tail of the fox, so one should not judge by it until a period passes, then a white light appears transversely, not difficult to perceive with the eye due to its clarity; this is the beginning of the time. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The dawn is not like this," and he joined his palms together. "Rather, the dawn is like this," and he placed one of his index fingers over the other and opened them. The hadith: "The dawn is not like this," and he joined his palm. "Rather, the dawn is like this," and he placed one of his index fingers over the other and opened them, indicating that it is transverse. Ibn Mājah narrated it from the hadith of Ibn Masʿūd with a sound chain, abbreviated without the indication with the palm and index fingers. And Aḥmad narrated from the hadith of Ṭalq ibn ʿAlī: "It is not the elongated dawn on the horizon, but the transverse red one," and its chain is good (ḥasan), and he indicated with it that it is transverse. One may also infer it by the lunar mansions (manāzil), but that is an approximation, not a precise determination. Rather, reliance is upon observing the spread of the whiteness in breadth, for a group of people thought that the dawn rises four mansions before the sun, and this is an error, for that is the false dawn (al-fajr al-kādhib). What the verified scholars have mentioned is that it precedes the sun by two mansions, and this is an approximation, but there is no reliance upon it, for some mansions rise transversely and obliquely, so the time of their rising is short, and some rise upright, so the time of their rising is long, and that differs in different lands, a difference whose mention would be lengthy. Yes, the mansions are suitable for knowing the nearness and remoteness of the time of the dawn prayer, but as for the true beginning of the dawn, it cannot be precisely fixed by two mansions at all. In summary, if four mansions remain until the rising of the horn of the sun by the measure of a mansion, it is certainly the false dawn. If approximately two mansions remain, the rising of the true dawn (al-fajr al-ṣādiq) is confirmed. Between the two dawns remains approximately two-thirds of a mansion, in which there is doubt whether it is from the time of the true dawn or the false dawn; it is the beginning of the appearance of the whiteness and its spread before its breadth expands. From the time of doubt, the fasting person should abandon the pre-dawn meal (sahūr), and the person praying the night prayer (witr) should advance it before the dawn prayer, and he should not pray the dawn prayer until the period of doubt passes. When it is confirmed, he prays. If a seeker wished to determine a specific time for certainty in which to drink his pre-dawn meal, rise immediately after it, and pray the dawn prayer connected to it, he would not be able to do so, for knowledge of that is not within human capability at all. Rather, there must be a period for pause and doubt, and there is no reliance except upon direct observation. And there is no reliance in direct observation except upon the light becoming spread in breadth until the beginnings of yellowness appear. Many groups of people have erred in this, praying before the time. What indicates this is what Abū ʿĪsā al-Tirmidhī narrated in his collection with his chain from Ṭalq ibn ʿAlī that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Eat and drink, and let not the ascending glow alarm you. Eat and drink until the red (light) appears transversely for you." The hadith of Ṭalq ibn ʿAlī: "Eat and drink, and let not the ascending glow alarm you. Eat and drink until the red appears transversely for you." The author said: Abū ʿīsā al-Tirmidhī narrated it in his collection and said it is good (ḥasan) and rare (gharīb), and it is as mentioned. And Abū Dāwūd also narrated it. This is explicit in considering the redness. Abū ʿĪsā said: In the chapter are narrations from ʿAdī ibn Ḥātim, Abū Dharr, and Samurah ibn Jundub, and it is a good, rare hadith. The practice according to this is among the people of knowledge. And he said...

Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Eat and drink as long as the light is shining." The author of the two books on rare words said: meaning, extended. Thus, one should only rely upon the appearance of the yellowness, which is like the beginnings of redness.

The traveler needs to know the prayer times because he may hasten to pray before departure so that dismounting does not become burdensome for him, or before sleep so that he may rest. If he resolves in himself to delay the prayer until he is certain, his soul becomes content with missing the virtue of the prayer's *first* time, and he burdens himself with the hardship of dismounting and the hardship of delaying sleep until certainty, then he has no need to learn the knowledge of the times. For what is problematic are the *beginnings* of the times, not their middles.
