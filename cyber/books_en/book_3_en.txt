The Book of the Secrets of Purification
Being the Third Book of the Quarter of Worship
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, who has shown kindness to His servants by prescribing for them cleanliness, and has poured upon their hearts the illumination and tenderness that purify their innermost selves. He has prepared for their outward forms a purification in water, distinguished by its gentleness and subtlety. And may God send blessings upon the Prophet Muhammad, who was immersed in the light of guidance, encompassing the farthest reaches and corners of the world, and upon his good and pure family, with a prayer whose blessings deliver us on the Day of Fear and erect a protective barrier between us and every affliction.

To proceed: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Religion is built upon cleanliness." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The key to prayer is purification." And God, the Exalted, says: "There is within it men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves." (Quran 9:108) And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Purification is half of faith." And God, the Exalted, says: "O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles..." (Quran 5:6)

Thus, those of insight discern from these outward indications that the most important of matters is the purification of the inner secrets. For it is far-fetched that the meaning of his statement, peace be upon him, "Purification is half of faith," would be the adornment of the outward form through cleaning by pouring water and casting it, while leaving the inner self in ruins, charged with foulness and impurities. Far, far is that from the truth.

Purification has four levels:
The first level: Purifying the outward form from ritual impurities, filth, and waste.
The second level: Purifying the limbs from sins and transgressions.
The third level: Purifying the heart from blameworthy traits and detestable vices.
The fourth level: Purifying the innermost secret from all besides God, the Exalted. This is the purification of the prophets, God's blessings upon them, and the truthful.

Purification in every level is half of the work therein. For the ultimate aim in the work of the secret self is the unveiling to it of the majesty and greatness of God, the Exalted. True knowledge of God, the Exalted, will not settle in the secret self until all besides God departs from it. Therefore, God, Mighty and Majestic, said: "Say, 'Allah.' Then leave them in their [empty] discourse, amusing themselves." (Quran 6:91) For the two cannot coexist in one heart, "And Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior." (Quran 33:4)

As for the work of the heart, its ultimate aim is to adorn it with praiseworthy traits and sound beliefs. It will not be characterized by these until it is cleansed of their opposites—corrupt beliefs and detestable vices. Thus, its purification is one of the two halves, indeed the first half, which is a condition for the second. So purification is half of faith in this sense.

Likewise, purifying the limbs from prohibitions is one of the two halves—the first half, which is a condition for the second. Thus, purifying them is one half, and adorning them with acts of obedience is the second half. These are the stations of faith, and each station has a rank. The servant will not attain the high rank except by passing beyond the lower rank. One will not reach the purification of the secret self from blameworthy attributes and its adornment with praiseworthy ones without first completing the purification of the heart from blameworthy character and its adornment with praiseworthy character. And one will not reach that without first completing the purification of the limbs from prohibitions and their adornment with acts of obedience.

Whenever the objective is noble and exalted, its path becomes difficult, its way long, and its obstacles many. Do not imagine that this matter is attained by mere wishful thinking and obtained with ease. Indeed, one whose inner sight is blinded to the disparity between these ranks understands from the levels of purification only the final degree, which is like the outermost husk in relation to the desired core. Thus, he becomes engrossed in it, exhaustively follows its details, and consumes all his time in cleansing after relieving himself, washing clothes, cleaning the outward form, and seeking abundant flowing water, due to the influence of whispering doubts and the imagination of his mind that the noble, required purification is only this. This is ignorance of the conduct of the early generations and their total absorption of concern and thought in purifying the heart, and their leniency regarding outward matters. So much so that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, despite his high station, performed ablution from water in a Christian jar. And they would not wash their hands from grease and food; rather, they would wipe their fingers with the soles of their feet. They considered washing with lote leaves (al-ushnān) an innovated novelty. They used to pray on the ground in mosques and walk barefoot on the roads. Whoever did not place a barrier between himself and the ground in his sleeping place was among their great ones. They would limit themselves to stones for cleansing after relieving oneself. Abu Hurayrah and others among the People of the Bench said: "We would eat roasted meat, then the prayer would be called, so we would dip our fingers in gravel and then rub them..."

With dust we perform ablution and recite the takbir." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "We did not know of *al-ashnan* (washing powder) in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. Our napkins were the soles of our feet; when we ate fatty food, we would wipe with them." And it is said: "The first innovations to appear after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, were four: sieves, *al-ashnan*, dining tables, and satiety." Thus, their entire concern was with the purity of the inner self, to the point that some said: "Prayer in sandals is superior." (For when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, removed his sandals during prayer upon being informed by Gabriel, upon him be peace, that they were impure, and the people removed their sandals, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Why have you removed your sandals?") And al-Nakha'i said concerning those who remove their sandals: "I wish a needy person would come and take them," disapproving of the removal of sandals. Such was their leniency in these matters. Indeed, they would walk barefoot in the muddy streets, sit upon them, pray in mosques on the ground, and eat from wheat and barley flour that was trodden upon by beasts and urinated upon, and they did not guard against the sweat of camels and horses despite their frequent rolling in impurities. Not a single report has been transmitted from any of them inquiring about the minutiae of impurities. Such was their leniency therein.

Now the turn has come to a group who call recklessness cleanliness, saying it is the foundation of religion. They spend most of their time adorning their outward appearances, like a beautifier adorning a bride, while the inner self is a ruin filled with the filth of arrogance, conceit, ignorance, ostentation, and hypocrisy. They do not find this reprehensible nor are they astonished by it. Yet if someone were to limit himself to cleansing with stones, or walk barefoot on the ground, or pray on the ground or on the mosque's mats without a spread rug, or walk on carpets without a leather foot-covering, or perform ablution from the vessel of an old woman or a man not given to austerity, they would raise a great clamor against him, intensify their censure, meet him with disgust, expel him from their company, and disdain to eat or associate with him. Thus, they call simplicity, which is part of faith, filth, and recklessness, cleanliness. Observe, then, how the reprehensible has become approved and the approved has become reprehensible, and how the form of religion has been effaced just as its reality and knowledge have been effaced.

If you say: "Do you then say that these customs innovated by the Sufis in their attire and cleanliness are prohibitions or reprehensible acts?" I say: God forbid that I make an absolute statement without distinction. But I say: This meticulous cleaning and affectation, preparing vessels and tools, using foot-coverings and veiling garments to ward off dust, and other such means—if considered in themselves, in a state of detachment, they are permissible matters. However, circumstances and intentions may accompany them, sometimes attaching them to approved acts and sometimes to reprehensible ones. As for their being permissible in essence, it is evident that their possessor disposes of his wealth, body, and garments as he wishes, provided there is no waste or extravagance. As for their becoming reprehensible, it is by making this the very foundation of religion and interpreting his saying, peace and blessings be upon him—"Religion is built upon cleanliness"—accordingly, to the point of censuring those who were lenient in it from the earlier generations; or by intending through it to adorn the outward appearance for people and improve their view of one, for that is the prohibited ostentation. Thus it becomes reprehensible due to these two considerations.

As for its being an approved act, it is by intending good through it, not adornment, and by not censuring one who leaves it, nor delaying prayer beyond its earliest times because of it, nor being preoccupied with it over a superior deed, knowledge, or other matter. If nothing of that sort accompanies it, it is permissible and can be made an act of devotion through intention. However, this is not easily achieved except by the idle, who, if they were not occupied with spending their time in it, would be occupied with sleep or idle talk. Thus, their occupation with it becomes preferable, for occupying oneself with purifications renews the remembrance of God Almighty and the remembrance of acts of worship. There is no harm in it if it does not lead to reprehensible acts or extravagance.

As for the people of knowledge and action, they should not devote any of their time to it beyond what is necessary. Exceeding that is reprehensible for them, and a squandering of life, which is the most precious and valuable of jewels for one capable of benefiting from it. Do not be astonished at this, for the good deeds of the righteous are the sins of those brought near. Nor should the idle person abandon cleanliness and censure the Sufis, claiming he is emulating the Companions, for emulating them lies in not being free except for what is more important than it. As it was said to Dawud al-Ta'i: "Why do you not comb your beard?" He said: "I would then be idle." Therefore, I do not consider it fitting for a scholar, a student, or an active worshiper to waste his time washing garments for fear of wearing shortened garments, imagining the tailor shortened them due to insufficient washing. For in the first era, they prayed in tanned fur garments, and none of them is known to have distinguished between shortened and tanned garments in prayer.

Purity and impurity, rather they would avoid impurity when they witnessed it and would not scrutinize their gaze in deducing subtle probabilities. Instead, they would contemplate the subtleties of ostentation and injustice, to the extent that Sufyan al-Thawri said to a companion who was walking with him when he looked at a raised, well-constructed door of a house: "Do not do that, for if people did not look at it, its owner would not engage in this extravagance. The one looking at it is an aider to him in extravagance." Thus, they would devote the vigor of their minds to deducing such subtleties, not to probabilities of impurity. Therefore, if a scholar found a common person undertaking to wash his clothes out of precaution, it is better, for relative to laxity it is good. That common person benefits from his undertaking, as he occupies his soul, which commands evil, with a permissible action for itself, thus refraining from sins in that state. For the soul, if not occupied with something, occupies its owner. And if he intends by it drawing near to the scholar, it becomes for him among the best acts of nearness, for the time of the scholar is more noble than to spend it on the like of this, so it remains preserved for him. And the most noble time of the common person is to busy himself with the like of this, so goodness accrues to him from all sides. Let one be alert with this example to its parallels among deeds and the ranking of their virtues and the manner of preferring some of them over others. Thus, meticulous accounting in preserving the moments of life by spending them on what is best is more important than meticulousness in all worldly matters. And when you know this introduction and it becomes clear to you that purity has four levels, then know that in this book we speak only of the fourth level, which is the cleanliness of the outward, for in the first part of the book we do not intentionally address except the outward aspects. So we say: outward purity is of three divisions: purity from filth, purity from ritual impurity, and purity from bodily residues, which is achieved by trimming the nails, shaving the pubic hair, using depilatory paste, circumcision, and the like.

(The First Division: Purity from Filth, and the discussion concerning it relates to the thing removed, the means of removal, and the removal itself.)
(The First Aspect: The Thing Removed)
It is impurity. Substances are of three kinds: inanimate objects, animals, and parts of animals. As for inanimate objects, they are all pure except wine and every intoxicating fermented drink. Animals are all pure except the dog and the pig and what is born from them or from one of them. If they die, they are all impure except five: the human being, fish, locusts, the apple worm, and in its meaning everything that transforms from foods, and everything that does not have flowing blood, like the fly, beetle, and others. Thus, water is not made impure by the fall of anything from these into it. As for parts of animals, they are of two kinds: The first is what is cut from it, and its ruling is the ruling of the dead. Hair is not made impure by cutting or death, and bone is made impure. The second is the moistures exiting from its interior. Everything that is not transformed and has no fixed abode is pure, like tears, sweat, saliva, and mucus. And what has a fixed abode and is transformed is impure, except what is the substance of the animal, like semen, eggs, pus, blood, dung, and urine. They are impure from all animals. Nothing of these impurities, little or much, is overlooked except five: The first is the trace of feces after cleansing with stones; it is overlooked as long as it does not exceed the exit. The second is the mud of streets and the dust of dung on the road; it is overlooked with certainty of impurity to the extent that avoiding it is difficult, which is that which the one soiled by it is not ascribed to negligence or a slip. The third is what is on the bottom of the leather sock from impurity which the road is not free from; it is overlooked after rubbing due to need. The fourth is the blood of fleas, whether little or much, unless it exceeds the usual limit, whether it is on your garment or on another's garment which you wear. The fifth is the blood of pustules and what separates from them of pus and matter. Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, rubbed a pustule on his face, blood came out from it, and he prayed without performing the major ritual ablution. In its meaning is what oozes from the stains of persistent boils, and likewise the trace of bloodletting, except what occurs rarely from an abscess or other, which is assimilated to the blood of irregular vaginal bleeding and is not in the meaning of pustules which a person is not free from in his conditions. And the Law's leniency regarding these five impurities lets you know that the matter of purity is based on leniency, and what has been innovated in it of scrupulous doubts has no basis.

(The Second Aspect: The Means of Removal)
It is either solid or liquid. As for the solid, it is the stone for cleansing after defecation, and it is a purifier, a purification of alleviation, on the condition that it be hard, pure, absorbent, and not venerated. As for liquids, impurities are not removed by anything from them except water, and not all water, but the pure water whose alteration by admixture with what is dispensable has not become gross. And water ceases to be pure by being changed through contact with impurity in its taste or color or

If its odor does not change, and it is close to two hundred and fifty *manns*—which is five hundred Iraqi *ratls*—it does not become impure, due to His saying, may He be exalted: "When water reaches two *qullahs*, it does not carry impurity." If it is less than that, it becomes impure according to Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him. This is regarding still water. As for flowing water, if it is altered by an impurity, the altered portion of the flow is impure, but not what is above or below it, because the flows of water are distinct. Likewise, if an impurity flows along a watercourse, the impure part is only its location in the water and what is to its right and left, provided it does not reach two *qullahs*. If the flow of water is stronger than the flow of the impurity, what is above the impurity is pure, and what is below it is impure, unless it becomes distant and abundant, except if it gathers in a basin of two *qullahs* capacity. If two *qullahs* of impure water are gathered, they become pure and do not revert to impurity by separation. This is the doctrine of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him.

I had wished his doctrine were like that of Imam Malik, may God be pleased with him, that water, however little, does not become impure except by alteration, since the need for it is pressing, and stipulating two *qullahs* is a source of scrupulous anxiety. For this reason, it became burdensome for people, and indeed, it is the cause of hardship, as known by one who experiences and reflects upon it. I have no doubt that if this were a condition, the places most deserving of difficulty in purification would be Mecca and Medina, for abundant flowing or still water is not plentiful there. From the beginning of the Messenger of God's era, peace be upon him, until the end of his Companions' era, no incident concerning purification or question about how to protect water from impurities has been transmitted. Their water vessels were handled by children and maidservants who did not guard against impurities. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, performed ablution with water from a Christian jar. This is almost explicit that he relied solely on the water not being altered; otherwise, the impurity of a Christian and her vessel is predominant and known with near certainty.

If adhering to this doctrine is difficult, and the absence of questions in those eras is a first proof, the action of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, is a second proof. The third proof is the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, listening to the vessel for the cat and not covering vessels from it after seeing that it eats mice, and there were no basins in their lands where cats would drink, nor did they descend wells. The fourth is that Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, explicitly stated that the wash water of an impurity is pure if not altered, and impure if altered. What difference is there between water meeting the impurity by being poured onto it or the impurity being poured into it? What meaning is there in saying that the force of pouring repels the impurity, when pouring does not prevent mixing with the impurity? If this is attributed to necessity, necessity is also pressing here. There is no difference between pouring water into a basin containing an impure garment or placing the impure garment into the basin containing water, all of which is customary in washing garments and vessels.

The fifth is that they would relieve themselves at the edges of small flowing waters, and there is no disagreement in Imam al-Shafi'i's doctrine, may God be pleased with him, that if urine falls into flowing water and it is not altered, it is permissible to perform ablution with it, even if it is little. What difference is there between flowing and still water? I wonder, is reliance on the absence of alteration more appropriate, or on the strength of the water due to flow? Then, what is the limit of that strength? Does it apply to water flowing in the pipes of bathhouses or not? If it does not apply, what is the difference? If it does apply, what is the difference between what falls into them and what falls into the watercourse from vessels on bodies, which is also flowing? Moreover, urine mixes more strongly with flowing water than a solid, stationary impurity, if it is ruled that what flows over it, even if unaltered, is impure until it gathers in a pool of two *qullahs*. So what difference is there between solid and liquid, when the water is one and mixing is stronger than mere proximity?

The sixth is that if a *ratl* of urine falls into two *qullahs* and then they are separated, every cup dipped from it is pure, and it is known that the urine is dispersed within it, though little. I wonder, is the rationale for its purity due to the absence of alteration more appropriate, or due to the strength of the water after the abundance ceases and disappears, while the presence of particles of impurity in it is confirmed? The seventh is that bathhouses in past eras have always been used for ablution by the ascetically minded, and they would dip hands and vessels into those basins despite the scarcity of water and with the knowledge that impure and pure hands would successively use them. These matters, along with severe necessity, strengthen in the soul that they considered the absence of alteration, relying on His saying, peace be upon him: "Water was created pure; nothing makes it impure except what alters its taste, color, or odor." This contains a verification: the nature of every liquid is to transform into its own quality everything that falls into it and is overwhelmed by it. Just as you see a dog fall into a salt flat and become salt, and it is ruled pure.

When it becomes salt and the attribute of dogness vanishes from it, likewise vinegar falls into water, and similarly milk falls into it when it is little, so its attribute is nullified and it takes on the attribute of water and is imprinted with its nature—unless it becomes abundant and predominates, and its predominance is known by the dominance of its taste, color, or smell. This is the criterion, and the Law has alluded to it regarding water strong enough to remove impurity. It is worthy to be relied upon, thereby averting hardship and manifesting the meaning of its being purifying, as it overcomes it and purifies it, just as it became so in the case of the two qullahs, in the wash water, in flowing water, and in the cat's lapping from a vessel. Do not think this is arbitrary, for if it were so, it would be like the effect of cleansing after relieving oneself and the blood of fleas, until the water that comes into contact with it becomes impure—yet it is not made impure by wash water nor by a cat's drinking from a small amount of water. As for His saying, exalted is He: "It does not carry filth," it is ambiguous in itself, for it does carry if it changes. If it is said that He meant if it does not change, one could say that He meant that it generally does not change due to common impurities. Then it is an adherence to the understood meaning when it does not reach two qullahs, and abandoning the understood meaning due to less than the proofs we have mentioned is possible. And His saying "it does not carry filth" outwardly negates carrying, meaning it transforms it to its own attribute, as is said of a salt flat: it does not carry a dog or other, meaning it transforms. This is because people may relieve themselves in small amounts of water and in stagnant ponds, and dip impure vessels in them, then hesitate whether they have changed with an effective change or not. Thus, it is clarified that if it is two qullahs, it does not change due to these common impurities. If you say: the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "It does not carry filth," and however much filth it carries, this turns against you, for however much it carries, it carries in reality as it carries in small sips. So specification to common impurities is necessary according to both schools. In summary, my inclination in matters of common impurities is toward leniency, following the practice of the early generations and cutting off the source of obsessive doubts. And with that, I have issued fatwas of purity in matters of disagreement in such issues.

(The Third Aspect: On the Manner of Removal)
If the impurity is legal, meaning it has no tangible substance, it suffices to run water over all its places. If it is physical, then removing the substance is necessary, and the persistence of taste indicates the persistence of the substance, as does the persistence of color, except for what adheres to it, which is overlooked after scrubbing and squeezing. As for smell, its persistence indicates the persistence of the substance and is not overlooked unless the thing has a strong odor that is difficult to remove. Rubbing and squeezing repeatedly take the place of scrubbing and squeezing for color. What dispels obsessive doubt is to know that things are created pure with certainty, so what shows no impurity and is not known with certainty to be impure, one may pray with it, and one should not resort to deduction to estimate impurities. The second category: purification from minor impurities, among them ablution, ritual bath, and dry ablution, preceded by cleansing after relieving oneself. So let us present their manner in order, with their etiquettes and practices, beginning with the cause of ablution and the etiquettes of answering the call of nature, if God Almighty wills.

(Chapter on the Etiquettes of Answering the Call of Nature)
One should go far from the sight of onlookers in open land and conceal oneself with something if found, and not expose one's private parts before reaching the sitting place, and not face the sun or the moon, and not face the qiblah nor turn one's back to it unless in a building—and avoiding it in a building is also preferred. If one conceals oneself in open land with one's mount, it is permissible, as with the hem of one's garment. One should avoid sitting where people converse, and not urinate in stagnant water, nor under a fruit-bearing tree, nor in a burrow, and avoid hard ground and windy places when urinating, to guard against splashing. One should lean in sitting on the left foot, and if in a building, enter with the left foot first and exit with the right. One should not urinate standing. Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "Whoever tells you that the Prophet, peace be upon him, urinated standing, do not believe them." And Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw me urinating standing and said: 'O Umar, do not urinate standing.'" Umar said: So I never urinated standing after that. There is a concession in it, as Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, reported: "He, peace be upon him, urinated standing, so I brought him water for ablution, and he performed ablution and wiped over his leather socks." One should not urinate in the bathing place. He, peace be upon him, said: "Most obsessive doubts come from it." Ibn al-Mubarak said it is permissible to urinate in the bathing place if water flows over it, mentioned by al-Tirmidhi. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Let none of you urinate in his bath then perform ablution in it, for most obsessive doubts come from it." Ibn al-Mubarak said: If the water is flowing, there is no harm in it.

One should not carry anything bearing the name of Allah the Exalted or His Messenger ﷺ, nor enter the water closet bareheaded. Upon entering, one should say: "In the name of Allah, I seek refuge in Allah from the filthy, impure, vile, accursed Satan." Upon exiting, one should say: "Praise be to Allah who has removed from me what harms me and preserved for me what benefits me," and this should be said outside the water closet. One should count the arrows before sitting down, and one should not cleanse with water in the place of need. One should ensure the removal of urine by clearing the throat and sniffing three times, and passing the hand over the lower part of the penis. One should not overthink the process of ensuring cleanliness, lest he fall into whisperings and find the matter burdensome. Any moisture felt should be presumed to be residual water; if it troubles him, he should sprinkle water upon it until he is reassured in his heart, so that Satan does not gain mastery over him through whisperings. In the report, he ﷺ did this—meaning sprinkling water. Indeed, the most lenient among them in ensuring cleanliness was the most knowledgeable; thus, whisperings in this matter indicate a lack of knowledge. In the narration of Salman, may Allah be pleased with him: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ taught us everything, even how to relieve ourselves. He commanded us not to cleanse with bones or dung, and he forbade us from facing the qiblah while defecating or urinating." A man from the Bedouin Arabs said to one of the Companions who was disputing with him: "I do not think you know how to relieve yourself properly." He replied: "Yes, by your father, I do know it well, and I am skilled at it: I distance the trace, count the clods, face the aromatic plant, turn my back to the wind, squat like a gazelle, and startle like an ostrich." The aromatic plant is a pleasant-smelling herb in the desert. Squatting here means to rise on the balls of the feet, and startling means to raise the buttocks. Among the concessions is that a man may urinate near his companion while concealed from him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did this, despite his profound modesty, to demonstrate it to people.

(How to Perform Istinja')
Then one should cleanse the anus with three stones; if it becomes clean, well and good; otherwise, use a fourth. If it becomes clean, well and good; otherwise, use a fifth, because purification is obligatory and using an odd number is recommended. He ﷺ said: "Whoever uses stones, let him use an odd number." One takes the stone with the left hand, places it on the front part of the anus before the soiled area, and wipes it with a rubbing and circular motion to the back. Then one takes the second stone, places it similarly on the back, and wipes it to the front. Then one takes the third stone and rotates it around the passage in a circular motion. If circular motion is difficult, wiping from front to back suffices. Then one takes a large stone with the right hand and the penis with the left, and wipes the stone with the penis, moving the left hand to wipe three times in three places, or with three stones, or in three places from a wall, until no moisture is seen in the wiped area. If this is achieved in two wipes, a third is brought, and this is obligatory if one intends to rely solely on stones. If it is achieved with the fourth, a fifth is recommended for the odd number. Then one moves from that place to another and cleanses with water by pouring it with the right hand over the soiled area and rubbing with the left until no trace remains that the palm can detect by touch. Thoroughness in this is achieved by exposing the inner parts, for that is the source of whisperings. Know that whatever water does not reach is considered inner, and the ruling of impurity does not apply to inner waste unless it emerges. Whatever is external and has the ruling of impurity, the limit of its appearance is that water reaches it and removes it; there is no meaning to whisperings. Upon completing istinja', one should say: "O Allah, purify my heart from hypocrisy and safeguard my private parts from immoral deeds." One should rub one's hand against a wall or the ground to remove any remaining odor. Combining water and stones is recommended, as it is narrated: "When the verse was revealed: 'In it are men who love to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who purify themselves,' the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people of Quba: 'What is this purification for which Allah has praised you?' They said: 'We used to combine water and stones.'"

(How to Perform Wudu')
When one finishes istinja', he should engage in wudu'. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was never seen exiting the toilet without performing wudu'. One should begin with the siwak, for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Your mouths are pathways for the Quran, so perfume them with the siwak." Thus, when using the siwak, one should intend to purify his mouth for reciting the Quran and remembering Allah the Exalted in prayer. He ﷺ said: "Prayer following the use of the siwak is better than seventy-five prayers without it." He ﷺ said: "Were it not that I would overburden my community, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every prayer." He ﷺ said: "Why do I see you coming to me with yellow teeth? Use the siwak." He ﷺ used the siwak many times during the night. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "He ﷺ continually commanded us to use the siwak until we thought something would be revealed about it." He, peace be upon him, said: "Upon you is the siwak, for it purifies the mouth and pleases the Lord." Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah honor him, said...

God, may He be exalted, has said: The tooth-stick increases memory and removes phlegm. The Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would go about with the tooth-stick upon their ears. Its manner is that one should clean the teeth with the wood of the arak tree or other such tree branches that roughen and remove tartar, cleaning both crosswise and lengthwise; if one limits it, then crosswise. It is recommended to use the tooth-stick before every prayer and before every ablution, even if one does not pray immediately after, and when the taste changes due to sleep, prolonged silence, or anything whose smell is disliked. Then, upon finishing with the tooth-stick, one sits for ablution facing the direction of prayer and says: In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "There is no ablution for one who does not mention the name of God, the Exalted," meaning no complete ablution. And one says at that time: I seek refuge in You from the whisperings of the devils, and I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present. Then one washes his hands three times before putting them into the vessel and says: O God, I ask You for prosperity and blessing, and I seek refuge in You from misfortune and ruin. Then one intends the removal of impurity or the permissibility of prayer and maintains the intention until washing the face; if one forgets it at the face, it does not suffice. Then one takes a handful of water for his mouth with his right hand and rinses with it three times, gargling by bringing the water to the throat, unless one is fasting, then one does so gently, and says: O God, assist me in reciting Your Book and in much remembrance of You. Then one takes a handful for his nose and sniffs water three times, raising the water with the breath to his nostrils, and expels what is within, and says while sniffing: O God, grant me the fragrance of Paradise while You are pleased with me, and while expelling: O God, I seek refuge in You from the odors of Hellfire and from the evil abode, for sniffing is conveying and expelling is removing. Then one scoops a handful for his face and washes it from the beginning of the forehead's surface to the end of what is considered of the chin in length, and from ear to ear in width. The two locks of hair at the sides of the temples are not included within the boundary of the face; they are from the head. One conveys water to the place of the parting, which is what women customarily clear the hair from, being the amount that falls on the side of the face when placing one end of a thread on the top of the ear and the other end on the corner of the temple. And one conveys water to the roots of the four hairs: the eyebrows, the mustache, the sideburns, and the eyelashes, for they are generally light. The sideburns are what parallel the ears from the beginning of the beard. It is obligatory to convey water to the roots of the light beard, meaning what is considered of the face, but not the thick part. The ruling for the mustache is like that of the beard in thickness and lightness. Then one does that three times and pours water over the outward part of the flowing beard, and inserts the fingers into the eye sockets, the place of sleep, and the gathering of kohl, and cleans them, for it has been reported that he, peace and blessings be upon him, did that. One hopes at that time for the exit of sins from his eyes, and likewise with every limb, and says there: O God, whiten my face with Your light on the day You whiten the faces of Your allies, and do not blacken my face with Your darkness on the day You blacken the faces of Your enemies. And one combs the thick beard while washing the face, for it is recommended. Then one washes his hands up to the elbows three times, moves the ring, prolongs the radiance, and raises the water to the upper arm, for they will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection radiant and gleaming from the traces of ablution, as the report has come. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever is able to prolong his radiance, let him do so." And it is narrated that the adornment reaches the places of ablution. One begins with the right and says: O God, give me my record in my right hand and hold me to an easy account. And one says while washing the left: O God, I seek refuge in You from You giving me my record in my left hand or from behind my back. Then one thoroughly wipes his head by wetting his hands, joining the tips of the fingers of his right hand with the left, placing them on the front of the head, extending them to the back of the head, then returning them to the front; this is one wiping, and one does that three times, and says: O God, cover me with Your mercy, send down upon me from Your blessings, and shade me under the shade of Your throne on the day there is no shade except Your shade. Then one wipes his ears, their outer and inner parts, with new water by inserting his index fingers into the ear canals and circling his thumbs over the outer part of his ears, then placing the palms over the ears for thoroughness, and repeats it three times, and says: O God, make me among those who listen to speech and follow the best of it. O God, let me hear the caller of Paradise with the righteous. Then one wipes his neck with new water due to his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Wiping the neck is security from the yoke on the Day of Resurrection," and says: O God, free my neck from the Fire, and I seek refuge in You from chains and shackles. Then one washes his right foot three times, combing with the left hand from beneath the toes of the right foot, beginning with the little toe of the right foot and ending with the little toe of the left foot, and says: O God, make my feet firm on the straight path on the day feet slip into the Fire. And one says while washing the left: I seek refuge in You from my foot slipping from the path on the day the feet of the hypocrites slip. And one raises

He washed his feet up to the ankles, and when he finished, he raised his head to the sky and said: "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. There is no god but You. I have done wrong and wronged myself. I seek Your forgiveness, O Allah, and I repent to You, so forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful. O Allah, make me among those who repent, make me among those who purify themselves, make me among Your righteous servants, make me a patient and grateful servant, and make me remember You much and glorify You morning and evening." It is said that whoever says this after ablution has his ablution sealed with a seal, and it is raised for him beneath the Throne, where it continuously glorifies and sanctifies Allah Almighty, and the reward for that is written for him until the Day of Resurrection.

Certain matters are disliked in ablution, among them: exceeding three washes, for whoever exceeds has done wrong and been wasteful with water (the Prophet, peace be upon him, performed ablution three times and said, "Whoever exceeds has done wrong and acted badly"). And he said: "There will be a people from this nation who are excessive in supplication and purification." From the weakness of a man's knowledge is his excessive use of water in purification. Ibrahim ibn Adham said: It is said that the first thing from which whispering begins is from purification. Al-Hasan said: There is a devil who mocks people during ablution, called Al-Walhan. It is disliked to shake the hands so that water splashes, to speak during ablution, and to slap the face with water. Some disliked drying and said: "Ablution is weighed," as said by Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and al-Zuhri. However, Mu'adh, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, wiped his face with the edge of his garment, and 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, reported that he had a towel, but this narration from 'A'ishah is disputed. It is disliked to perform ablution from a copper vessel and with water heated by the sun, and this is from a medical perspective. It is reported from Ibn 'Umar and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them, the dislike of copper vessels. Some said: I brought water for Shu'bah in a copper vessel, and he refused to perform ablution from it. The dislike of this is transmitted from Ibn 'Umar and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them.

Whenever one finishes his ablution and turns to prayer, it is fitting that it occurs to him that he has purified his outward self, which is the place observed by creation, so he should be ashamed to converse with Allah Almighty without purifying his heart, which is the place observed by the Lord, may He be glorified. It is more appropriate to realize the purification of the heart through repentance, emptying oneself of blameworthy traits, and adorning oneself with praiseworthy traits first. Whoever confines himself to outward purification is like one who invites a king to his house but leaves it filled with filth and busies himself with plastering the outer door of the house. How deserving such a man is of incurring wrath and ruin. And Allah, the Exalted, knows best.

(The Virtue of Ablution)
The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever performs ablution and perfects it, then prays two rak'ahs without thinking of anything worldly during them, emerges from his sins like the day his mother bore him." In another wording: "And does not become heedless in them, his previous sins are forgiven." He also said: "Shall I not tell you of that by which Allah erases sins and raises degrees? Performing ablution thoroughly despite dislikeness, walking to the mosques, and waiting for one prayer after another; that is the ribat, three times." He performed ablution once for each limb and said: "This is the ablution without which Allah does not accept prayer." He performed it twice for each limb and said: "Whoever performs ablution twice for each limb, Allah gives him double reward." He performed it three times for each limb and said: "This is my ablution and the ablution of the prophets before me, and the ablution of the intimate friend of the Most Merciful, Ibrahim, peace be upon him." He said: "Whoever remembers Allah during his ablution, Allah purifies his entire body, and whoever does not remember Allah, only that which the water reaches is purified." He said: "Whoever performs ablution while already in a state of purity, Allah writes for him ten good deeds." He said: "Ablution upon ablution is light upon light." All of this encourages renewing ablution. He, peace be upon him, said: "When a Muslim servant performs ablution and rinses his mouth, sins leave his mouth; when he sniffs water, sins leave his nose; when he washes his face, sins leave his face, even from under his eyelashes; when he washes his hands, sins leave his hands, even from under his fingernails; when he wipes his head, sins leave his head, even from under his ears; and when he washes his feet, sins leave his feet, even from under his toenails. Then his walking to the mosque and his prayer are an extra reward for him." It is reported: "The purified person is like a fasting person." He said: "Whoever performs ablution and perfects it, then raises his gaze to the sky and says: 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger,' the eight gates of Paradise are opened for him, and he may enter from whichever he wishes."

Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "A proper ablution drives Satan away from you." Mujahid said: "Whoever is able to not retire for the night except in a state of purity, remembrance, and seeking forgiveness, let him do so, for souls are resurrected according to the state in which they were taken."

                               (The Manner of the Major Ritual Bath)
It is that he places the vessel to his right, then mentions the name of God, the Exalted, and washes his hands three times. Then he cleanses his private parts as I have described for you, and removes any impurity upon his body if present. Then he performs the minor ablution as we have described for prayer, except for washing the feet, which he delays. For if he washes them and then places them on the ground, it is a waste of water. Then he pours water over his head three times, then over his right side three times, then over his left side three times. Then he rubs the front of his body and combs through the hair of his head and beard, ensuring the water reaches the roots of the hair, whether thick or fine. A woman is not required to undo her braids unless she knows the water will not reach within the hair. He should attend to the folds of the body and be cautious not to touch his private part during this; if he does, he must repeat the minor ablution. If he performed the minor ablution before the bath, he does not repeat it after the bath. These are the recommended practices of ablution and the bath. We have mentioned from them what the traveler on the path to the Hereafter must necessarily know and act upon. As for other issues needed for incidental circumstances, one should refer to books of jurisprudence. The obligatory elements from all we have mentioned concerning the bath are two: intention and covering the entire body with water. The obligatory elements of the minor ablution are: intention, washing the face, washing the hands up to the elbows, wiping over what the name applies to of the head, washing the feet up to the ankles, and sequence. As for continuity, it is not obligatory. The obligatory baths are four: due to the emission of semen, the meeting of the two circumcised parts, menstruation, and postnatal bleeding. Other baths are recommended, such as the bath for the two Eids, Friday, festivals, entering the state of consecration (ihram), standing at Arafah and Muzdalifah, entering Mecca, the three baths of the days of Tashreeq, and for the farewell circumambulation according to one opinion, and for the disbeliever who embraces Islam while not in a state of major impurity, and for the insane person who regains sanity, and for one who washes a deceased person. All of that is recommended.

                               (The Manner of Dry Ablution)
For one who is unable to use water due to its unavailability after searching, or due to an obstacle preventing access to it, such as a beast, or a restrainer, or if the available water is needed for his thirst or his companion's thirst, or if it belongs to another who will not sell it except for more than its fair price, or if he has a wound or illness and fears using it would cause corruption of the limb or severe affliction, then he should wait until the time of the obligatory prayer enters upon him. Then he should seek clean earth upon which is pure, clean, fine dust such that dust rises from it. He strikes it with his palms, joining his fingers, and wipes with them over his entire face once, intending at that time the permissibility of prayer. He is not required to get the dust under the hair, whether fine or thick. He should strive to cover the skin of his face with the dust, and this is achieved with one strike, for the expanse of the face does not exceed the expanse of the two palms. Sufficiency in covering is based on predominant assumption. Then he removes his ring and strikes a second time, spreading his fingers apart. Then he places the back of his right hand against the palms of the fingers of his left hand, such that the tips of the fingers from one side do not exceed the width of the rosary finger from the other side. Then he passes his left hand from where he placed it over the outer part of his right forearm to the elbow. Then he turns the palm of his left hand over the inner part of his right forearm and passes it to the wrist, and passes the palm of his left thumb over the back of his right thumb. Then he does the same with the left. Then he wipes his palms and combs between his fingers. The purpose of this procedure is to achieve coverage up to the elbows with one strike. If that is difficult for him, there is no harm in achieving coverage with two strikes or more. If he prays the obligatory prayer with it, he may pray voluntary prayers as he wishes. If he combines two obligatory prayers, he should renew the dry ablution for the second, and thus he singles out each obligatory prayer with a dry ablution. And God knows best.

    (The Third Category: From Cleanliness is Cleansing from Apparent Filth, and it is of two types: Dirt and Parts)

            (The First Type: Dirt and Secreted Moistures, and they are eight)
The first is what gathers in the hair of the head from grime and lice. Cleansing from it is recommended by washing, combing, and oiling to remove dishevelment from it. (He, peace be upon him, would oil the hair and comb it occasionally and command it.) And he, peace be upon him, said: ("Oil occasionally.") And he, peace be upon him, said: ("Whoever has a hair, let him honor it.") meaning, let him protect it from dirt. (A man with disheveled hair and unkempt beard entered upon him, so he said: "Did this one not have oil to settle his hair?" Then he said: "One of you enters as if he were a devil.") The second is what gathers of dirt in the folds of the ears; wiping removes what is apparent from it, and what gathers in the depths of the ear canal should...

One should gently clean the ears upon exiting the bath, for excessive cleaning may harm the hearing. Third, what gathers inside the nose from congealed, clinging moistures adhering to its sides, and one removes it by sniffing water in and blowing it out. Fourth, what accumulates on the teeth and the tip of the tongue from tartar, which is removed by the tooth-stick and rinsing the mouth, both of which we have mentioned. Fifth, what gathers in the beard from dirt and lice if not tended to, and it is recommended to remove that by washing and combing with a comb. In the well-known report, he (peace be upon him) "would not be without a comb, a razor, and a mirror whether traveling or resident," and this is the custom of the Arabs. In a rare report, he (peace be upon him) would comb his beard twice a day, and he (peace be upon him) had a thick beard. Likewise, Abu Bakr did, and 'Uthman had a long, fine beard, and 'Ali had a broad beard that filled the space between his shoulders. In a report more remarkable than that, 'A'isha (may God be pleased with her) said: "A group of people gathered at the door of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), and he went out to them. I saw him peeking into the mirror, arranging his head and beard, so I said, 'Do you do that, O Messenger of God?' He said, 'Yes, indeed God loves that His servant beautify himself for his brothers when he goes out to them.'" The ignorant might think that this is from a love of adornment for people, by analogy with the character of others and comparing the angels to blacksmiths—far be it! Indeed, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was commanded with the call, and among his duties was to strive to magnify the importance of his own person in their hearts, lest their souls belittle him, and to make his appearance good in their eyes, lest their eyes deem him insignificant, which would repel them. And the hypocrites would seize upon that in repelling them. This intention is obligatory upon every scholar who undertakes to call creation to God Almighty—that he observe in his outward appearance what does not cause people to be repelled. Reliance in such matters is upon the intention, for they are actions in themselves that acquire descriptions from the objective. Thus, beautifying oneself with this intention is beloved, and leaving the beard disheveled to display asceticism and lack of concern for oneself is cautioned against, and leaving it unkempt due to preoccupation with what is more important than it is beloved. These are inward states between the servant and God Almighty; the critic is discerning, and deception is not accepted under any circumstance. How many an ignorant person engages in these matters, turning attention to creation, while he deceives himself and others and claims that his intention is good? Thus, you see a group of scholars wearing luxurious garments and claiming that their intention is to humble the innovators and disputants and draw nearer to God Almighty by this. This is a matter that will be unveiled "on the Day when secrets are tested," and the day when what is in the graves is scattered and what is in the breasts is obtained. Then, the pure ingot will be distinguished from the tinsel, and we seek refuge in God from disgrace on the Day of the Greatest Presentation. Sixth, the dirt of the knuckles, which are the bends at the backs of the fingers. The Arabs used not to wash that much due to their neglecting to wash the hands after food, so dirt would gather in those creases. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) commanded them to wash the knuckles. Seventh, cleaning the fingernails. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) commanded the Arabs to clean them, meaning the tips of the fingers and the dirt under the nails, because they did not have clippers available at all times, so dirt would gather there. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) set a time for them: trimming the nails, plucking the armpits, and shaving the pubic hair every forty days. However, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) commanded cleaning under the nails. It came in the narration: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) was awaiting revelation, and when Gabriel (peace be upon him) descended to him, he said to him: 'How can we descend upon you when you do not wash your knuckles, nor clean your fingernails, and you have tartar and do not use the tooth-stick? Has your community passed by that?'" Otherwise, the dirt of the nail and the "uff" is the dirt of the ear. And His Almighty saying: "And do not say to them, 'Uff'" means weary them, that is, with what is under the nail from dirt. And it is said: do not be annoyed by them as you are annoyed by what is under the nail. Eighth, the grime that gathers on the entire body from the sweat of perspiration and the dust of the road, and that is removed by the bath. There is no harm in entering the bath; the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) entered the baths of Syria. Some of them said, "An excellent house is the bathhouse; it purifies the body and reminds of the Fire." That was narrated from Abu al-Darda' and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (may God be pleased with them both). And some of them said, "A wretched house is the bathhouse; it exposes the private parts and removes modesty." This one mentions its harm, and that one mentions its benefit, and there is no harm in seeking its benefit while guarding against its harm. But upon the one entering the bath are duties from the traditions and obligations. Upon him are two obligations regarding his own private parts and two obligations regarding the private parts of others. As for the two obligations regarding his own private parts, it is to protect them from the gaze of others and to protect them from the touch of others, so he does not undertake the matter of them and the removal of their dirt except with his own hand, and he prevents the masseur from touching the thigh and what is between the navel and the pubic area. And regarding the permissibility...

Touching what is not a private part for removing dirt is permissible, but the more correct position is prohibition, since touching the two private parts is prohibited due to looking, so likewise the rest of the private area—meaning the thighs—should be considered. The two obligations regarding the private parts of others are to lower one's gaze from them and to forbid their exposure, because forbidding evil is obligatory. Upon him is to mention that, but acceptance is not upon him, nor does the obligation of mentioning fall away except for fear of beating, abuse, or what befalls him that is unlawful in itself. Thus, he is not required to forbid an unlawful act that would compel the one being forbidden to commit another unlawful act. As for his saying, "I know that will not benefit nor be acted upon," this is not an excuse; rather, mentioning is necessary. The heart is not devoid of being affected by hearing the forbiddance and sensing caution when expressing sins, and that influences making the matter ugly in his eyes and repelling his soul, so it is not permissible to abandon it. For this reason, prudence has led to avoiding entering bathhouses in these times, as they are not free from exposed private parts, especially from below the navel to above the pubic area, since people do not consider it a private part, but the Sacred Law has included it as a private part and made it like a sanctuary for it. Thus, it is recommended to have the bathhouse cleared. Bishr ibn al-Harith said, "How harsh is a man who possesses only a dirham and gives it to have the bathhouse cleared for him." Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, was seen in the bathhouse with his face to the wall, having bound his eyes with a bandage. Some said there is no harm in entering the bathhouse but with two waist-wrappers: one for the private part and one for the head to cover himself and protect his eyes.

As for the recommended practices, they are ten: The first is intention—that he does not enter for immediate worldly gain nor playfully for the sake of whim, but intends by it the beloved cleanliness for adorning oneself for prayer. Then he gives the bath attendant the fee before entering, for what he will receive is unknown, as is what the attendant expects, so handing over the fee before entering removes ignorance from one of the two exchanges and comforts his soul. Then he steps with his left foot upon entering and says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I seek refuge in Allah from the filthy, impure, vile, and vile-inciting accursed Satan." Then he enters at a time of privacy or strives to have the bathhouse cleared, for if there are none in the bathhouse except people of religion and those cautious about private parts, then looking at exposed bodies has a tinge of lack of modesty and reminds one to look at private parts. Moreover, a person in movements is not free from exposure of private parts due to folds in the ends of the waist-wrapper, so the gaze falls upon the private part unknowingly. For this reason, Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, bound his eyes. And he washes the two sides upon entering and does not hasten to enter the hot room until he sweats in the first one, and he does not pour water excessively but restricts himself to the amount of need, for that is what is permitted by the situation's indication, and exceeding it, if the bath attendant knew, he would dislike it, especially hot water, for it has cost and involves toil. And he remembers the heat of the Fire by the heat of the bathhouse and imagines himself imprisoned in the hot room for an hour and compares it to Hell, for it is the room most resembling Hell—fire from below and darkness above. We seek refuge in Allah from that. Rather, the intelligent person is not heedless of remembrance of the Hereafter for a moment, for it is his destination and abode. Thus, in everything he sees—water, fire, or others—there is a lesson and admonition for him, for a person looks according to his aspiration. If a cloth merchant, carpenter, builder, and weaver enter a furnished, decorated house, if you observe them, you will see the cloth merchant looks at the furnishings, pondering their value; the weaver looks at the garments, pondering their weave; the carpenter looks at the ceiling, pondering how it is assembled; and the builder looks at the walls, pondering how they are firmly built and straight. Likewise, the traveler on the path of the Hereafter sees nothing from things except that it becomes an admonition and reminder of the Hereafter. Rather, he looks at nothing except that Allah, the Exalted, opens for him a way of lesson. If he looks at blackness, he remembers the darkness of the grave; if he looks at a snake, he remembers the serpents of Hell; if he looks at an ugly, repulsive image, he remembers Munkar and Nakir and the Zabaniyah; if he hears a terrifying sound, he remembers the blast of the Trumpet; if he sees something beautiful, he remembers the bliss of Paradise; if he hears a word of rejection or acceptance in a market or house, he remembers what is unveiled at the end of his affair after the Account regarding rejection and acceptance. How fitting it is for this to be predominant in the heart of the intelligent, except that only the pressing matters of the world divert him from it. If one compares the duration of stay in this world to the duration of stay in the Hereafter, he belittles it, unless he is among those whose heart is heedless and insight blinded.

Among the recommended practices is not to greet upon entering, and if greeted, he does not respond with the words of peace but remains silent if others respond, and if he wishes, he says, "May Allah grant you well-being." There is no harm in shaking hands with the entrant and saying, "May Allah grant you well-being," to initiate speech. Then he does not speak much in the bathhouse, nor recite the Quran except silently. There is no harm in showing...

Seeking refuge from Satan, and it is disliked to enter the bathhouse between the two evening prayers and near sunset, for that is a time when devils spread. There is no harm in someone else massaging him, for that was reported from Yusuf ibn Asbat, who advised that a person who was not among his companions should wash him, saying, "He massaged me in the bathhouse once, and I wanted to reward him with something that would please him, and he was pleased with that." What indicates its permissibility is what was reported from some Companions: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stopped at a place during one of his journeys and slept on his stomach while a black servant was massaging his back. I said, 'What is this, O Messenger of God?' He said, 'The she-camel jolted me.'"

Then, whenever one finishes from the bathhouse, let him thank God Almighty for this blessing, for it has been said that hot water in winter is from the bliss one will be asked about. And Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said, "The bathhouse is from the newly introduced bliss." This is from the perspective of the Sacred Law. As for from the perspective of medicine, it has been said that the bath after depilatory paste is a protection from leprosy. And it is said that depilatory paste once every month extinguishes the yellow bile, refines the complexion, and increases sexual intercourse. And it is said that urinating standing in the bathhouse in winter is more beneficial than a dose of medicine. And it is said that a nap in summer after the bath is equivalent to a dose of medicine. And washing the feet with cold water after exiting the bath is a protection from gout. And it is disliked to pour cold water on the head upon exiting, and likewise to drink it. This is the ruling for men.

As for women, he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "It is not lawful for a man to let his wife enter the bathhouse." And in the house of the one bathing, and the well-known opinion is that it is forbidden for men to enter the bathhouse except with a waist-wrapper, and it is forbidden for a woman to enter the bathhouse except if she is postpartum or ill. And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, entered a bathhouse due to an illness she had. If she enters out of necessity, she should only enter with a covering waist-wrapper. And it is disliked for a man to give her the fee for the bathhouse, for then he would be assisting her in what is disliked.

(The Second Type: Concerning what occurs on the body from the parts, and they are eight.)

The first is the hair of the head. There is no harm in shaving it for one who intends cleanliness, and there is no harm in leaving it for one who oils and combs it, except if he leaves it in patches, meaning in sections, which is the practice of the people of roguery, or he lets the forelocks hang in the manner of the people of nobility, where that has become a distinguishing mark for them, for if he is not noble, then that is a deception.

The second is the hair of the mustache. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Trim the mustache." And in another wording: "Cut the mustaches." And in another wording: "Trim the mustaches closely and let the beards grow." Meaning, make them the border of the lip, meaning around it, and the border of a thing is its surroundings, and from it is: "And you see the angels surrounding the Throne." And in another wording: "Trim closely," and this indicates complete removal. And his saying "trim closely" indicates less than that. And God Almighty said: "If He should ask it of you and press you, you would withhold." Meaning, He would demand it fully from you. As for shaving, it has not been reported. And trimming closely, which is near to shaving, was reported from the Companions: a follower looked at a man who had trimmed his mustache closely and said, "You reminded me of the companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." And Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, looked at me when my mustache had grown long and said, 'Come and trim it for me with a tooth-stick.'" And there is no harm in leaving his *sibalayh* (the two ends of the mustache), for 'Umar and others did that, because that does not cover the mouth nor does food residue remain in it, as it does not reach there. And his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "Let the beards grow" means make them abundant. And in the report: "Indeed the Jews let their mustaches grow and trim their beards, so differ from them." And some scholars disliked shaving and considered it an innovation.

The third is the hair of the armpits. It is recommended to pluck it every forty days once. That is easy for one who is accustomed to plucking it from the beginning. As for one who is accustomed to shaving, shaving suffices him, for in plucking there is torment and pain, and the objective is cleanliness and that dirt does not gather in its gaps, and that is achieved by shaving.

The fourth is the pubic hair. It is recommended to remove that, either by shaving or with depilatory paste, and it should not be delayed beyond forty days.

The fifth is the nails. Trimming them is recommended due to the ugliness of their appearance when they grow long and due to the dirt that gathers in them. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O Abu Hurayrah, trim your nails, for Satan sits upon what has grown long of them." And if there is dirt under the nail, that does not prevent the validity of ablution, because it does not prevent the water from reaching, and because one is lenient regarding it due to need, especially in the nails of a man and in the dirt that gathers on the knuckles and the backs of the feet and hands of the Arabs and the common people. And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to command them to trim and would disapprove of what he saw under their nails of dirt, and he did not command them to repeat the prayer. Had he commanded it, there would have been another benefit in it, which is severity and deterrence from that. I have not seen in the books a transmitted report concerning the order of trimming the nails, but I heard that he, peace and blessings be upon him, began with his right thumb and ended with his right thumb, and began on the left with the little finger to the thumb. And when I reflected upon...

This insight occurred to me regarding the meaning, indicating that the narration is sound, for such a meaning is not initially unveiled except by the light of Prophecy. As for the insightful scholar, his utmost is to deduce it through intellect after the action is transmitted to him. What has become clear to me therein—and God knows best—is that one must begin with the fingernails of the hand and the foot. The hand is nobler than the foot, so one begins with it. Then, the right is nobler than the left, so one begins with it. On the right hand are five fingers, and the index finger is the noblest, for it is the one pointed with during the testimony of faith among the fingers. Thereafter, one should begin with what is to its right, for the Sacred Law recommends proceeding with purification and other matters from the right. If the back of the hand is placed on the ground, the thumb is the rightmost; if the palm is placed down, the middle finger is the rightmost. When the hand is left in its natural state, the palm inclines toward the ground, as the direction of movement for the right is toward the left, and completing the movement to the left raises the back of the hand. What the natural disposition dictates is preferable. Then, when one hand is placed upon the other, the fingers become like a circular ring, necessitating an order that proceeds from the right of the index finger until returning to it, thus beginning with the little finger of the left and concluding with its thumb, leaving the thumb of the right to be the final one trimmed. I envisioned the hand placed upon the hand so the fingers become like figures in a ring to make their order apparent, and this estimation is preferable to estimating the placement of the palm on the back of the hand or the back of one hand on the back of the other, for that is not dictated by natural disposition.

As for the toes, the preferable opinion to me—if no transmitted report is established—is to begin with the little toe of the right and conclude with the little toe of the left, as in cleaning between the toes, for the meanings mentioned regarding the hand do not apply here, as there is no index finger on the foot. These toes are like a single row fixed on the ground, so one begins from the right side. To envision them as a ring by placing the sole upon the sole is rejected by natural disposition, unlike the hands. These subtleties in order are unveiled by the light of Prophecy in a single moment, though exertion is prolonged for us. Were we asked initially about the order therein, it might not have occurred to us, but when we recall his action and his order, it becomes facilitated for us through what he witnessed, by the testimony of wisdom and its indication of the meaning, deducing the meaning. Do not think that his actions in all his movements were outside of measure, law, and order. Rather, in all voluntary matters we have mentioned, the doer fluctuates between two or more options, not proceeding with one specific choice arbitrarily, but by a meaning that necessitates proceeding and giving precedence. For proceeding neglectfully as it happens is the habit of beasts, while regulating movements by the scales of meanings is the habit of the allies of God. The closer a person's movements and thoughts are to regulation and the further from neglect and leaving matters aimless, the higher his rank toward the ranks of the prophets and allies, and the more apparent his nearness to God, for he who is near to the Prophet is near to God, and he who is near to God must be near; thus, he who is near to the near one is near in relation to others. We seek refuge in God from having the reins of our movements and stillness in the hand of Satan through the medium of desire. Consider the regulation of movements in his applying kohl: "He would apply kohl to his right eye three times and to his left twice," beginning with the right for its nobility and differing between the eyes to make the total an odd number, for the odd has merit over the even, as God is Odd and loves the odd. Thus, the servant's action should not be devoid of appropriateness to an attribute of God's attributes, and for this reason, making odd in cleaning with stones is recommended. He did not limit it to three, which is odd, because the left is only given one, and typically one does not cover the roots of the eyelids with kohl. The right was specifically given three because preference is necessary for making odd, and the right is superior, so it is more deserving of the increase. If you say: Why limit the left to two, which is even? The answer is necessity, for if each were given an odd number, the total would be even, since odd plus odd is even. Observing oddness in the totality of the action, which is considered a single act, is more beloved than observing it in individual parts. There is also another way: to apply kohl to each eye three times, analogous to ablution, and this is transmitted in authentic reports and is preferable. Were I to exhaust the subtleties he observed in his movements, the matter would become lengthy, so extrapolate from what you have heard to what you have not. Know that a scholar does not become an heir of the Prophet unless he comprehends all the meanings of the Sacred Law, such that between him and the Prophet there remains only one degree: the degree of Prophethood.

This is the distinction between the inheritor and the inherited, for the inherited is he who has acquired wealth, busied himself with its acquisition, and gained power over it, while the inheritor is he who neither acquired it nor gained power over it, but rather it was transferred to him and he received it from another after it had been acquired for him. Such meanings, despite the simplicity of their matter relative to the depths and mysteries, cannot be independently grasped at the outset except by the Prophets, nor can they be independently deduced through reception after the Prophets have pointed to them except by the scholars who are the inheritors of the Prophets, peace be upon them.

The sixth and seventh are the cutting of the umbilical cord and the foreskin of the glans. As for the umbilical cord, it is cut at the beginning of birth. As for purification through circumcision, it is the custom of the Jews on the seventh day from birth, and differing from them by delaying it until the child grows teeth is more beloved and further from danger. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Circumcision is a *sunnah* for men and an honor for women." And one should not be excessive in the circumcision of the female. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Umm 'Atiyyah, who used to perform female circumcision: "O Umm 'Atiyyah, cut slightly and do not cut severely, for it is more radiant for the face and more pleasing to the husband." That is, it increases the moisture and blood of the face and is better for her intercourse. So observe the eloquence of his, peace and blessings be upon him, expression in metaphor and the radiance of the light of prophethood, from the interests of the Hereafter—which are the most important aims of prophethood—to the interests of this world, such that it was revealed to him, the unlettered one, concerning this matter of its descending decree what, if negligence had occurred regarding it, its harm would be feared. So glory be to Him who sent him as a mercy to the worlds, to gather for them, through the blessing of his mission, the interests of this world and religion.

The eighth is what is long of the beard. We have only delayed it to attach to it what is in the beard of *sunnahs* and innovations, as this is the most appropriate place befitting its mention. They have differed concerning what is long of it. It is said that if a man grasps his beard and takes what exceeds the grasp, there is no harm; indeed, Ibn 'Umar and a group of the Followers did it, and Al-Sha'bi and Ibn Sirin considered it good. Al-Hasan and Qatadah disliked it and said: "Leaving it as a natural state is more beloved," due to his, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: "Let the beards grow." The matter in this is lenient, provided it does not reach trimming the beard and rounding it from the sides, for excessive length may disfigure the natural form and unleash the tongues of backbiters to scorn it, so there is no harm in guarding against it with this intention. And Al-Nakha'i said: "I am amazed at a sensible man with a long beard, how does he not take from his beard and make it between two beards? For moderation in everything is good, and for that it is said: 'Whenever the beard lengthens, the intellect rolls up its sleeves.'"

[Section] And in the beard are ten disliked characteristics, some of which are more strongly disliked than others: dyeing it black, whitening it with sulfur, plucking it, plucking the gray hairs from it, reducing it, adding to it, combing it in an affected manner for the sake of ostentation, leaving it disheveled to display asceticism, looking at its blackness in admiration of youth, and looking at its whiteness in pride over advanced age, and dyeing it red or yellow without the intention of emulating the righteous.

As for the first, which is dyeing it black, it is prohibited due to his, peace and blessings be upon him, saying: "The best of your youth are those who resemble your elders, and the worst of your elders are those who resemble your youth." The meaning of resembling the elders is in dignity, not in whitening the hair. And "He forbade dyeing with black," and he said it is "the dye of the people of the Fire." In another wording: "Dyeing with black is the dye of the disbelievers." A man married during the time of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, and he used to dye with black. His dye wore off and his gray hair appeared, so the woman's family brought him to 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, who annulled his marriage and beat him severely, saying: "You deceived the people with youth and concealed your old age from them." It is said the first to dye with black was Pharaoh, may God curse him. And from Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "There will be at the end of time a people who dye with black like the crops of pigeons; they will not smell the fragrance of Paradise."

The second is dyeing with yellow and red. It is permissible to conceal gray hair from the disbelievers during raiding and jihad. If it is not with this intention, but rather to resemble the people of religion, then it is blameworthy. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Yellow is the dye of the Muslims, and red is the dye of the believers." They used to dye with henna for red and with *khuluq* and *katam* for yellow. Some scholars dyed with black for the purpose of raiding, and that is not harmful if the intention is sound and there is no caprice or desire in it.

The third is whitening it with sulfur, hastening to display advanced age as a means to veneration, acceptance of testimony, and credence in narration from the elders, and to elevate oneself above youth, and to display abundance of knowledge, thinking that the multitude of days grants him merit. Far from it! Increasing age only increases the ignorant in ignorance, for knowledge is the fruit of intellect, which is an innate disposition, and gray hair has no effect on it. Whoever's innate disposition is foolishness, the length of time only confirms his foolishness. Indeed, the elders used to give precedence to the youth in knowledge. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him...

Ibn Abbas, though young in years, was given precedence over senior Companions, and questions were directed to him rather than to them. Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "God Almighty does not grant knowledge to any servant except in his youth, and all good is in youth." Then he recited the words of the Almighty: "They said, 'We heard a youth mentioning them; he is called Abraham,'" and His words: "Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance," and His words: "And We gave him judgement while yet a boy."

Anas, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed away and there were not twenty white hairs on his head and beard." It was said to him: "O Abu Hamzah, you have grown old." He replied: "God has not disfigured me with grey hair." It was asked: "Is it a disfigurement?" He said: "All of you dislike it."

It is said that Yahya ibn Aktham was appointed as a judge when he was twenty-one years old. A man in his gathering, intending to embarrass him due to his young age, said: "How old is the judge, may God support him?" He replied: "Like the age of 'Attab ibn Usayd when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, appointed him as governor and judge of Mecca," thus silencing him.

It is reported from Malik, may God have mercy on him, that he said: "I read in some books: 'Let not beards deceive you, for the billy-goat has a beard.'" Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' said: "If you see a man tall in stature, small in intellect, and broad in beard, judge him to be foolish, even if he were Umayyah ibn 'Abd Shams." Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani said: "I encountered a shaykh of eighty years following a boy to learn from him." 'Ali ibn al-Husayn said: "Whoever precedes you in knowledge is your imam in it, even if he is younger than you." It was said to Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala': "Is it seemly for a shaykh to learn from a young one?" He replied: "If ignorance disfigures him, then learning adorns him."

Yahya ibn Ma'in said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal when he saw him walking behind the mule of al-Shafi'i: "O Abu 'Abdillah, you have abandoned the narrations of Sufyan due to their elevated chain, and you walk behind the mule of this youth and listen to him?" Ahmad said to him: "If you knew, you would walk from the other side. The knowledge of Sufyan, if I miss it due to elevation, I can attain it by descent. But the intellect of this youth, if I miss it, I will not attain it by elevation or descent."

The fourth is plucking its white hairs out of aversion to greyness (and the Prophet, peace be upon him, forbade plucking grey hairs and said: "It is the light of the believer"). This is akin to dyeing with black, and the reason for its dislike is as previously mentioned, for grey hair is the light of God Almighty, and aversion to it is aversion to light.

The fifth is plucking them or plucking some of them due to frivolity and folly, and that is disliked and disfigures the creation. Plucking the *fanikayn* is an innovation; they are the two sides of the moustache. A man who plucked his *fanikayn* testified before 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, and he rejected his testimony. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, and Ibn Abi Layla, the judge of Medina, rejected the testimony of one who plucked his beard.

As for plucking it at the beginning of its growth in imitation of the insolent youth, it is among the major reprehensible acts, for the beard is the adornment of men. Verily, God, glorified and exalted is He, has angels who distribute, and He who adorned the children of Adam with beards, and it is part of the perfection of creation, and by it men are distinguished from women. It is said in a rare interpretation that the beard is intended by the words of the Almighty: "He increases in creation what He wills." The companions of al-Ahnaf ibn Qais said: "We wish we could buy a beard for al-Ahnaf, even for twenty thousand." Shuraih the judge said: "I wish I had a beard, even for ten thousand." And how can the beard be disliked when in it is the exaltation of a man, and he is looked upon with the eye of knowledge and dignity, elevated in gatherings, faces turn to him, he is given precedence over the group, and it is a protection for honor? For he who insults makes reference to the beard if the insulted one has a beard. It has been said that the people of Paradise are beardless except for Harun, the brother of Musa, peace be upon them both, for he has a beard reaching to his navel, as a distinction and preference for him.

The sixth is trimming it, like making it tier upon tier, for adornment for women and affectation. Ka'b said: "There will be at the end of time people who trim their beards like the tail of a dove and curve their sandals like sickles; those will have no share."

The seventh is adding to it, which is to add hair to the sideburns from the temples, which is from the hair of the head, until it exceeds the jawbone and reaches halfway down the cheek. This contradicts the appearance of the righteous.

The eighth is combing it for the sake of people. Bishr said regarding the beard: "Two evils: combing it for the sake of people and leaving it disheveled to display asceticism."

The ninth and tenth are looking at its blackness or its whiteness with an eye of admiration, and that is blameworthy in all parts of the body, indeed in all character traits and actions, as will be explained later.

This is what we wished to mention regarding the types of adornment and cleanliness. It has been derived from three Prophetic traditions concerning the practices of the body: twelve characteristics. Five of them are in the head: parting the hair of the head, rinsing the mouth, sniffing water into the nose, trimming the moustache, and using the tooth-stick. Three are in the hands and feet: trimming the nails, washing the knuckles, and cleaning the spaces between the toes.

And four pertain to the body: plucking the armpits, shaving the pubic hair, circumcision, and cleansing with water after relieving oneself. Reports have come concerning all of these collectively. Since the aim of this book is to address outward purification, not inward, let us confine ourselves to this. And let it be known that the inner waste and filth from which cleansing is obligatory are too numerous to count. Their details will come in the Quarter of the Destroyers, along with an explanation of the methods for removing them and purifying the heart from them, God Almighty willing.

The Book of the Secrets of Purification is completed, by the praise of God the Exalted and His help. To follow, God the Exalted willing, is the Book of the Secrets of Prayer. Praise be to God alone, and may God bless our master Muhammad and every chosen servant.

[1] The hadith, "Religion is built upon cleanliness"—I have not found it exactly thus. In Ibn Hibban's *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "Purify yourselves, for indeed Islam is pure." And al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* with a very weak chain from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Cleanliness leads to faith."

[2] The hadith, "The key to prayer is purification," was transmitted by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of 'Ali. Al-Tirmidhi said: "This is the soundest and best thing in this chapter."

[5] The hadith of 'Umar: "We did not know *al-ashnan* (a cleansing agent) in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and our napkins were the insides of our feet"—I have not found it from the hadith of 'Umar. Ibn Majah has something similar, abbreviated, from the hadith of Jabir.

[6] The hadith about him removing his sandals in prayer when Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed him they had impurity on them, was transmitted by Abu Dawud and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.

[8] The hadith about tilting the vessel for the cat was transmitted by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and al-Daraqutni from the hadith of 'A'ishah. The authors of the *Sunan* narrated that as the action of Abu Qatadah.

[9] The hadith, "God created water pure; nothing makes it impure except what changes its color, taste, or smell," was transmitted by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Umamah with a weak chain. It was narrated without the exception by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and Abu Dawud and others authenticated it.

[10] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "Whoever tells you that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, urinated standing, do not believe him," was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "It is the best and soundest thing in this chapter."

[11] The hadith of 'Umar: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw me while I was urinating standing and said, 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing,'" was transmitted by Ibn Majah with a weak chain. Ibn Hibban transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and it contains no mention of 'Umar.

[12] The hadith that he, peace and blessings be upon him, urinated standing is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*).

[13] The hadith: He said concerning urine in the bathing place, "Most of the whispering is from it," was transmitted by the authors of the *Sunan* from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *gharib*. I say: Its chain is sound.

[14] The hadith about sprinkling water after ablution, which is *al-intidah*, was transmitted by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Sufyan ibn al-Hakam al-Thaqafi or al-Hakam ibn Sufyan. It is problematic (*mudtarib*), as stated by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr.

[15] The hadith of Salman: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, taught us everything, even how to relieve oneself," was transmitted by Muslim. It has preceded in the *Foundations of Beliefs*.

[18] The hadith concerning when the verse was revealed, "In it are men who love to purify themselves" (9:108), regarding the people of Quba' and their combining stones and water, was transmitted by al-Bazzar from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain. Ibn Majah and al-Hakim transmitted it and he authenticated it from the hadiths of Abu Ayyub, Jabir, and Anas concerning cleansing with water; it contains no mention of stones. Al-Nawawi's statement, following Ibn al-Salah, that combining water and stones was practiced by the people of Quba'...

[19] The hadith "Your mouths are pathways for the Quran" was reported by Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* from a narration of 'Ali, and Ibn Majah reported it as a statement of 'Ali (*mawquf*). Both chains are weak.

[20] The hadith "A prayer following the use of the tooth-stick (*siwak*) is superior to seventy-five prayers without it" was reported by Abu Nu'aym in his book *al-Siwak* from a narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain. Abu Dawud and al-Hakim reported it, and al-Hakim graded it sound (*sahih*), while al-Bayhaqi weakened it. It is also reported from a narration of 'A'ishah with a weak chain, and in a wording: "superior to seventy prayers."

[21] The hadith "Were it not that I would overburden my community, I would have commanded them to use the tooth-stick (*siwak*) with every prayer" is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from a narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[22] The hadith "Why do I see you coming to me with discolored teeth? Use the tooth-stick!" was reported by al-Bazzar and al-Bayhaqi from a narration of al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib; and by Abu Dawud and al-Baghawi from a narration of Tamam ibn al-'Abbas; and by al-Bayhaqi from a narration of 'Abdullah ibn al-'Abbas. Its chain is problematic (*mudtarib*).

[23] The hadith "He would use the tooth-stick (*siwak*) repeatedly during the night" was reported by Muslim from a narration of Ibn 'Abbas.

[24] The hadith from Ibn 'Abbas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, continuously enjoined us to use the tooth-stick (*siwak*) until we thought a revelation would be sent down to him concerning it" was reported by Ahmad.

[25] The hadith "You must use the tooth-stick (*siwak*), for it purifies the mouth and pleases the Lord" was reported by al-Bukhari as a suspended (*mu'allaq*) but definitive (*mujazam*) narration from a narration of 'A'ishah; and by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Khuzaymah with a connected chain (*mawsul*). I [the author] note: The compiler connected this hadith with the preceding one from Ibn 'Abbas. It was also reported from a narration of Ibn 'Abbas by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* and al-Bayhaqi in *Shu'ab al-Iman*.

[26] The hadith "The Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would go about with the tooth-stick (*siwak*) behind their ears" was reported by al-Khatib in his book *Asma' man Rawa 'an Malik*. In Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi, who graded it sound (*sahih*), it is reported that Zayd ibn Khalid "would attend the prayers with his tooth-stick on his ear, like the place of the pen on a scribe's ear."

[27] The hadith "There is no ablution (*wudu'*) for one who does not mention the name of God" was reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from a narration of Sa'id ibn Zayd, one of the ten [promised Paradise]. Al-Tirmidhi transmitted from al-Bukhari that it is the best narration on this topic.

[28] The hadith concerning "inserting the finger into the eye sockets, the place of the sleep (*ramas*), and where the kohl gathers" was reported by Ahmad from a narration of Abu Umamah: "He would inspect the hypocrites." Al-Daraqutni reported it from a narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain: "Moisten your eyes with water."

[29] The hadith "Whoever among you is able to lengthen his streak of light (*ghurrah*), let him do so" was reported by both [al-Bukhari and Muslim] from a narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[30] The hadith "The adornment (*hilyah*) of the believer reaches as far as the water of his ablution reaches" was reported by both [al-Bukhari and Muslim] from his narration.

[31] The hadith "Wiping the neck is a protection from the yoke (*al-ghull*)" was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from a narration of 'Umar, and it is weak.

[32] The hadith "He performed ablution three times each [for each limb] and said, 'Whoever exceeds that has done wrong and committed injustice'" was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i—and the wording is his—and Ibn Majah from a narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb, from his father, from his grandfather.

[33] The hadith "There will be a people from this community who are excessive in supplication and purification" was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim from a narration of 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal, and it is said...

[34] The hadith "The weakness of a man's knowledge is his indulgence in water for purification"—I found no basis for it.

[35] The hadith of Mu'adh that "the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, wiped his face with the edge of his garment" was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is singular (*gharib*) and its chain is weak.

[36] The hadith of 'A'ishah that "the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had a towel (*minshafah*)" was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is not established (*laysa bi-l-qa'im*). He said, "Nothing sound from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is established on this topic."

[37] The hadith "Whoever performs ablution (*wudu'*), performs it thoroughly, and prays two cycles (*rak'atayn*) without entertaining any worldly thought during them, emerges from his sins like the day his mother bore him." In another wording: "without being heedless (*lam yas-h*) during them, his previous sins are forgiven." It was reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in *Kitab al-Zuhd wa al-Raqa'iq* with both wordings together. It is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from a narration of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, without the phrase "any worldly thought" and without "without being heedless during them." Abu Dawud reported it from a narration of Zayd ibn Khalid: "then he prayed two cycles without being heedless during them"—the hadith.

[38] The hadith "Shall I not inform you of that by which God expiates sins and raises degrees?"—the hadith.

[39] Hadith: He performed ablution once for each limb and said, "This is the ablution without which Allah does not accept prayer." Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurairah.

[40] Hadith: Whoever remembers Allah during his ablution, Allah purifies his entire body. Reported by Al-Daraqutni from Abu Hurairah with a weak chain.

[41] Hadith: Whoever performs ablution while in a state of purity, Allah writes for him ten good deeds. Reported by Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah from Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[42] Hadith: Ablution upon ablution is light upon light. I did not find an origin for it.

[43] Hadith: When a Muslim or believing servant performs ablution and rinses his mouth, sins depart from his mouth. Reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from Al-Sunabihi; its chain is sound but its authenticity is disputed. A similar, concise version is in Muslim from Abu Hurairah and 'Amr ibn 'Abasah.

[44] Hadith: The pure sleeper is like the fasting person. Reported by Abu Mansur Al-Daylami from 'Amr ibn Huraith: "The pure sleeper is like the fasting person standing in prayer," with a weak chain.

[45] Hadith: Whoever performs ablution and perfects it, then raises his gaze to the sky and says, 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah...' Reported by Abu Dawud from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir. A version without the phrase "then he raised..." is in Muslim, as cited by Al-Mizzi in Al-Atraf. Also reported by Al-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah and Al-Darimi in his Musnad from the narration of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir.

[46] Hadith: He used to oil his hair and comb it. Reported by Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Shama'il with a weak chain from a hadith of Anas: "He would frequently oil his head and comb his beard." Also in Al-Shama'il with a good chain from an unnamed Companion that he would comb his hair intermittently.

[47] Hadith: Oil yourselves intermittently. Ibn Al-Salah said, "I did not find an origin for it." Al-Nawawi said it is not well-known. In Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Al-Nasa'i from 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal is the prohibition from combing except intermittently, with a sound chain.

[48] Hadith: Whoever has a hair, let him honor it. From a hadith of Abu Hurairah: "He who has hair, let him honor it." Its chain is not strong.

[49] Hadith: A man with disheveled hair and an unkempt beard entered upon him. He said, "Did this man not have any oil to settle his hair?" Reported by Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Hibban from Jabir with a good chain.

[50] Hadith: The comb and the mirror would not part from him, whether traveling or resident. Reported by Ibn Tahir in the book Sifat al-Tasawwuf from Abu Sa'id: "His toothstick and his comb would not part from his prayer place." Also reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from 'A'ishah. Both chains are weak. It will come later in the chapter on the etiquettes of travel in an expanded form.

[51] Hadith: He would comb his beard twice a day. Previously mentioned is the hadith of Anas: "He would frequently comb his beard." Al-Khatib in Al-Jami' has from Al-Hakam, mursal: "He would comb his beard with a comb."

[52] Hadith: He had a thick beard. Reported by Al-Tirmidhi in Al-Shama'il from Hind ibn Abi Halah, and by Abu Nu'aym in Dala'il al-Nubuwwah from 'Ali. Its origin is with Al-Tirmidhi.

[53] Hadith: 'A'ishah said: "Some people gathered at the door of the Messenger of Allah, and he went out to them. I saw him peering into the mirror, arranging his head and beard." Reported by Ibn 'Adi, who said it is a munkar (rejected) hadith.

[54] Hadith: The command to wash the knuckles. Reported by Al-Tirmidhi Al-Hakim in Al-Nawadir from 'Abdullah ibn Busr: "Clean your knuckles." Ibn 'Adi has it in a hadith from Anas: "...and to attend to the knuckles when performing ablution." Muslim has from 'A'ishah: "Ten are from the natural disposition (fitrah)," and among them is "washing the knuckles."

[55] Hadith: The command to clean the armpits. Reported by Ahmad from Ibn 'Abbas that it was said to him: "O Messenger of Allah, Jibril has been delayed from coming to you." It was said (to him): "And why should he not be delayed, when you do not use the toothstick, nor trim your nails, nor clip your mustaches, nor clean your armpits?" In its chain is Isma'il ibn 'Ayyash.

[56] Hadith: The specified time limit for trimming nails, plucking armpits, and shaving the pubic hair is forty days. Reported by Muslim from Anas.

[57] Hadith: The command to clean beneath the nails. Reported by Al-Tabarani from Wabishah ibn Ma'bad.

I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about everything, even about the dirt that accumulates under the nails, and he said: "Leave what causes you doubt for what does not cause you doubt."

[58] A hadith about the delay of revelation: When Gabriel descended upon him, he said to him: "How can we descend upon you when you do not wash your knuckles nor clean your molars?" This is preceded by two hadiths.

[59] A hadith: He stopped at a place during one of his journeys and slept on his stomach while a black servant massaged his back. The hadith was reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of 'Umar with a weak chain.

[60] A hadith: It is not permissible for a man to enter the bathhouse with his wife. The hadith will come in the following one with a variation.

[61] A hadith: It is forbidden for men to enter the bathhouse except with a waist-wrapper. It was reported by al-Nasa'i and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of Jabir: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day should not enter the bathhouse except with a waist-wrapper, and whoever believes in God and the Last Day should not enter the bathhouse with his wife." And from al-Hakim, from the narration of 'A'ishah: "The bathhouse is forbidden for the women of my community." He said its chain is sound. And from Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah, from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar: "Men should not enter it except with a waist-wrapper, and prevent women from it except for one who is ill or postpartum."

[62] A hadith: "Trim" and in another wording "cut short" and in another wording "shorten the mustaches and let the beards grow." Agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with the wording "shorten," and in Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah "cut short," and in Ahmad from his narration "trim."

[63] A hadith: Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) looked at me when my mustache had grown long and said: "Come and trim it for me with your toothstick." Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il.

[64] A hadith: "The Jews let their mustaches grow and trim their beards, so differ from them." Reported by Ahmad from the narration of Abu Umamah: We said: O Messenger of God, the People of the Book trim their beards and let their mustaches grow. He said: "Trim your mustaches and let your beards grow, and differ from the People of the Book." I said: The well-known practice is that of the Magians, for in the Sahih of Ibn 'Umar regarding the Magians: "They let their mustaches grow and shave their beards, so differ from them."

[65] A hadith: "O Abu Hurayrah, clip your nail, for Satan sits upon what grows long from them." Reported by al-Khatib in al-Jami' with a weak chain from the narration of Jabir: "Trim your nails, for Satan courses between the flesh and the nail."

[66] A hadith: The beginning in clipping the nails is with the thumb of the right hand and ending with its thumb, and in the left hand with the little finger to the thumb. I did not find a basis for it, and Abu 'Abdullah al-Mazari rejected it in his refutation of al-Ghazali and denounced him for it.

[67] A hadith: He would apply kohl to his right eye three times and to his left eye twice. Reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[68] A hadith: Applying kohl to each eye three times. Al-Ghazali said, and it is transmitted as such in the Sahih. I say: It is in al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi said: It is a hasan hadith.

[69] A hadith: Circumcision is a sunnah for men and an honor for women. Reported by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of Abu al-Malih ibn Usamah from his father with a weak chain.

[70] A hadith: Umm 'Atiyyah: "Take a slight cut and do not cut severely." The hadith was reported by al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi from the narration of al-Dahhak ibn Qays, and a similar version is in Abu Dawud from the narration of Umm 'Atiyyah, and both are weak.

[71] A hadith: "The best of your youth are those who resemble your elders." Reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Wa'ilah with a weak chain.

[72] A hadith: He forbade dyeing with black. Reported by Ibn Sa'd in al-Tabaqat from the narration of 'Amr ibn al-'As with an interrupted chain, and in Muslim from the narration of Jabir: "Change this with something and avoid black," he said this when he saw the white hair of Abu Quhafah.

[73] A hadith: Dyeing with black is the dye of the people of Hell, and in another wording: the dye of the disbelievers. Reported by al-Tabarani and al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with the wording "the disbeliever." Ibn Abi Hatim said it is rejected.

[74] A hadith states that at the end of time there will be a people who dye their hair black. This hadith was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with a sound chain of transmission.

[75] A hadith states: Yellow dye is the adornment of the Muslims, and red dye is the adornment of the believers. This was reported by al-Tabarani and al-Hakim in the singular form from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn Abi Hatim said it is anomalous.

[76] A hadith: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away, and there were not twenty white hairs on his head and beard. It was said to him (the narrator, Anas), "O Abu Hamzah, and you have grown old?" He replied, "God did not whiten him with grey hair." Agreed upon from the narration of Anas, without the words "It was said to him." And in Muslim's version from his narration: He was asked about the grey hair of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, "God did not touch him with whiteness."

[77] A report concerning Yahya ibn Aktham: He assumed the position of judge when he was twenty-one years old. It was said to him, "How old is a judge?" He replied, "Like the age of 'Attab ibn Usayd when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, appointed him as governor and judge of Mecca on the day of the Conquest. And I am older than Mu'adh ibn Jabal when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent him as a judge to the people of Yemen." This was reported by al-Khatib in his History with a chain of transmission that is subject to scrutiny. What Ibn Aktham mentioned is correct regarding 'Attab ibn Usayd, for he was twenty years old at the time of his appointment. As for regarding Mu'adh, this would only be valid according to the statement of Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Ansari, Malik, and Ibn Abi Hatim that he was twenty-eight years old when he died. The preponderant view is that he died at thirty-three years of age during the plague in the year eighteen. And God knows best.

[78] A hadith: He prohibited plucking grey hair and said, "It is the light of the believer." This was reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah graded it as good, from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather.

[79] A hadith concerning parting the hair of the head, etc., from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to let his hair hang down... until he said: Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, parted his head.

[80] A hadith: Ten are from the natural disposition (al-fitra). The hadith was reported by Muslim from the narration of 'A'ishah, and its wording is: Trimming the mustache, letting the beard grow, using the tooth-stick (siwak), sniffing water (into the nose), clipping the nails, washing the knuckles, plucking the armpit hair, shaving the pubic hair, and economizing water. Wa'il said: Meaning, cleansing after relieving oneself. Mus'ab said: I forgot the tenth, unless it is rinsing the mouth. Al-Nasa'i weakened it. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah have from the narration of 'Ammar ibn Yasir something similar, mentioning therein rinsing the mouth, circumcision, and using water after relieving oneself, but not mentioning letting the beard grow and economizing water. Abu Dawud said: Something similar was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas. He said: Five, all concerning the head, and among them he mentioned parting the hair, and did not mention letting the beard grow. And in the two Sahih collections, from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: The natural disposition is five... the hadith on circumcision.

[81] A hadith concerning cleaning the spaces between the teeth has preceded.
