The Book of the Remembrance of Death and What Comes After It
This is the Tenth Book of the Quarter of the Deliverances, and with it concludes the book *The Revival of the Religious Sciences*.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, Who broke with death the necks of tyrants, shattered with it the backs of emperors, and cut short with it the aspirations of Caesars whose hearts ever shrank from the remembrance of death, until the True Promise came to them and cast them into the pit. Thus, they were transferred from palaces to graves, from the light of cradles to the darkness of tombs, from sporting with maidens and youths to enduring vermin and worms, from enjoying food and drink to wallowing in dust, from the comfort of companionship to the desolation of solitude, and from soft beds to a grievous place of demise. So consider: did they find in death any fortress or might, or take behind it any screen or protection? And consider: "Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a whisper?" So glory be to Him Who is alone in subjugation and mastery, Who reserves for Himself the right to permanence, and Who humbled all categories of creation by what He decreed upon them of annihilation. Then He made death a deliverance for the God-fearing and, in their regard, an appointment for the Meeting; and He made the grave a prison for the wretched and a constricted confinement for them until the Day of Separation and Decree. To Him belongs the bestowal of manifest blessings, and to Him belongs the retribution with overwhelming calamities. To Him is gratitude in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is praise in the First and the Last. And blessings be upon Muhammad, possessor of manifest miracles and brilliant signs, and upon his family and his companions, abundant salutations.

Now then: It is fitting for one whose final destination is death, whose resting place is dust, whose companion is the worm, whose intimates are Munkar and Nakir, whose abode is the grave and whose settlement is the belly of the earth, whose appointment is the Resurrection, and whose outcome is either Paradise or the Fire, that he have no thought except of death, no remembrance except of it, no preparation except for its sake, no planning except concerning it, no aspiration except towards it, no turning aside except to it, no concern except with it, no movement except around it, and no waiting and anticipation except for it. And he is right to consider himself among the dead and to see himself among the inhabitants of the graves. For everything that is to come is near, and the distant is only that which is not coming. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The intelligent one is he who holds himself to account and works for what is after death." Preparation for a thing will only be facilitated when its remembrance is renewed upon the heart, and its remembrance is only renewed through reminding by listening to what reminds of it and by reflecting upon what alerts to it. We shall mention, concerning the matter of death, its precursors, its consequences, and the states of the Hereafter, the Resurrection, Paradise, and the Fire, what the servant must necessarily remember repeatedly and accompany with reflection and insight, so that it may spur him to preparation. For the departure to what is after death has drawn near, and what remains of life is but little, while mankind is heedless of it: "The reckoning for the people has drawn near, while they are in heedlessness, turning away." We shall mention what pertains to death in two parts:

(The First Part: Concerning its precursors and what follows them up to the Blast of the Trumpet, containing eight chapters:)
Chapter One: On the excellence of remembering death and the encouragement therein.
Chapter Two: On the mention of long hopes and their brevity.
Chapter Three: On the agonies of death and its severity, and the states that are recommended at the time of death.
Chapter Four: On the passing of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after him.
Chapter Five: On the words of the dying among the Caliphs, rulers, and the righteous.
Chapter Six: On the sayings of the knowers concerning funerals and graves, and the ruling on visiting graves.
Chapter Seven: On the reality of death and what the deceased encounters in the grave up to the Blast of the Trumpet.
Chapter Eight: On what is known of the states of the dead through unveiling in dreams.

(Chapter One: On the remembrance of death and the encouragement to increase in its remembrance)
Know that one who is engrossed in the world, bent upon its delusions, and enamored of its pleasures, his heart is inevitably heedless of the remembrance of death; he does not remember it, and when he is reminded of it, he dislikes it and recoils from it. Those are the ones concerning whom God said: "Say, 'Indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do.'" Now, people are either engrossed, or a repentant beginner, or a knower who has reached the end. As for the engrossed, he does not remember death, and if he does remember it, he remembers it to lament his worldly life and occupies himself with blaming it. This only increases his distance from God through the remembrance of death. As for the repentant one, he increases in the remembrance of death so that fear and awe may surge from his heart, thereby fulfilling repentance completely. He may dislike death, fearing it might snatch him before the completion of repentance and before preparing his provision, and he is excused in that.

Aversion to death does not fall under His saying, may He be exalted: "Whoever dislikes meeting Allah, Allah dislikes meeting him." For this person does not dislike death and meeting Allah; rather, he fears missing the meeting with Allah due to his own deficiency and shortcoming. He is like one who delays meeting the beloved, being occupied with preparing for the meeting in a manner that pleases him. Thus, he is not considered one who dislikes the meeting. The sign of this is that he is perpetually prepared for it, having no occupation other than it; otherwise, he joins those engrossed in the world. As for the knower of God, he remembers death constantly because it is the appointed time for meeting his Beloved, and a lover never forgets the appointment to meet the beloved. For the most part, such a person finds death slow in coming and loves its arrival, to be freed from the abode of the disobedient and to transfer to the proximity of the Lord of the worlds. As narrated from Hudhayfah, when death approached him, he said: "A beloved has come in a state of need; unsuccessful is he who regrets. O Allah, if You know that poverty is more beloved to me than wealth, sickness more beloved than health, and death more beloved than life, then make death easy for me until I meet You." Therefore, the repentant one is excused in his aversion to death, and this one is excused in his love for death and longing for it. Higher in rank than both is he who entrusts his affair to Allah, the Exalted, so that he chooses for himself neither death nor life, but rather the most beloved thing to him is what is most beloved to his Master. This one has reached, through intense love and devotion, the station of submission and contentment, which is the ultimate goal and end. In any case, there is reward and merit in remembering death. For even the engrossed one benefits from remembering death by turning away from the world, as it spoils his comfort and clouds the purity of his pleasure. Anything that clouds a person's pleasures and desires is among the causes of salvation.

(Explanation of the merit of remembering death in any state)
The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Increase your remembrance of the destroyer of pleasures." Its meaning is: spoil your pleasures by its remembrance until your reliance upon them is severed, so that you may turn to Allah, the Exalted. And he, peace be upon him, said: "If the beasts knew of death what the son of Adam knows, you would not eat fat from them." And 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "O Messenger of Allah, will anyone be resurrected with the martyrs?" He said: "Yes, one who remembers death twenty times a day and night." The cause of all this merit is that remembering death necessitates turning away from the abode of delusion and demands preparation for the Hereafter, while heedlessness of death calls to immersion in worldly desires. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The gift of the believer is death." He said this because the world is a prison for the believer, for he remains in it in hardship from contending with his soul, disciplining his desires, and repelling his devil. Thus, death is a release for him from this torment, and release is a gift in his right. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Death is an expiation for every Muslim." By this, he meant the true Muslim, the sincere believer, from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, and in whom the character of the believers is realized, and who is not stained by sins except minor lapses. Death purifies him from them and expiates them after he has avoided major sins and established the obligatory duties. 'Ata' al-Khurasani said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, passed by a gathering where laughter had become excessive. He said: 'Mix your gathering with the remembrance of that which spoils pleasures.' They said: 'And what is that which spoils pleasures?' He said: 'Death.'" And Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Increase your remembrance of death, for it purifies sins and induces asceticism in the world." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Sufficient is death as a separator." And upon him be peace, said: "Sufficient is death as an admonisher." "The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, went out to the mosque and found people talking and laughing. He said: 'Remember death. By the One in whose hand is my soul, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.'" "A man was mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and they praised him well. He said: 'How is your companion's remembrance of death?' They said: 'We hardly ever hear him mention death.' He said: 'Then your companion is not there.'" And Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: I came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, as the tenth of ten. A man from the Ansar said: "Who are the most intelligent and the most honorable of people, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Those who remember death most and are most prepared for it. Those are the intelligent ones; they have taken the nobility of this world and the honor of the Hereafter." As for the narrations: Al-Hasan, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "Death has exposed the world, leaving no person of understanding joyful." And al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym said: "No absent thing awaited by the believer is better for him than death." And he used to say: "Do not make anyone aware of me, and deliver me smoothly to my Lord." And one of the wise wrote to a man from his brothers: "O my brother, beware of death in this abode before you reach an abode where you will wish for death and not find it." And when death was mentioned in the presence of Ibn Sirin, every limb of his would die. And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz would gather the jurists every night, and they would discuss death.

And the Resurrection and the Hereafter, then they weep as if there were a funeral bier before them. Ibrahim al-Taymi said: "Two things have severed from me the pleasure of this world: the remembrance of death and the standing before God, Mighty and Majestic is He." Ka'b said: "Whoever knows death, the calamities and sorrows of this world become insignificant to him." Mutarrif said: "I saw in a dream, as one sees in sleep, as if a caller was saying in the middle of the Basra mosque: 'The remembrance of death has severed the hearts of the fearful.' By God, you see them only as distraught." Ash'ath said: "We used to visit al-Hasan, and it was only about the Fire, the affair of the Hereafter, and the remembrance of death." Safiyyah, may God be pleased with her, said: "A woman complained to 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, about the hardness of her heart. She said: 'Increase your remembrance of death, and your heart will soften.' She did so, and her heart softened, and she came thanking 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her." And 'Isa, peace be upon him, when death was mentioned in his presence, his skin would drip blood. And Dawud, peace be upon him, when he remembered death and the Resurrection, would weep until his limbs were convulsed, and when he remembered mercy, his soul would return to him. Al-Hasan said: "I have never seen a rational person except that I found him wary of death and sorrowful over it." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said to some of the scholars: "Admonish me." He said: "You are not the first caliph to die." He said: "Increase me." He said: "There is none of your forefathers, all the way back to Adam, except that he has tasted death, and your turn has come." So 'Umar wept for that. And al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym had dug a grave in his house and would sleep in it several times a day, thereby perpetuating the remembrance of death. He used to say: "If the remembrance of death were to depart from my heart for a single moment, it would become corrupt." And Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullah ibn al-Shikhkhir said: "Indeed, this death has embittered the bliss of the people of bliss, so seek a bliss in which there is no death." And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said to 'Anbasah: "Increase your remembrance of death, for if your life is ample, it will constrict it for you, and if your life is constricted, it will make it ample for you." And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "I said to the mother of Harun: 'Do you love death?' She said: 'No.' I said: 'Why?' She said: 'If I disobeyed a human, I would not desire to meet him, so how could I love to meet Him when I have disobeyed Him?'"

(Clarifying the Path to Realizing the Remembrance of Death)

Know that death is dreadful and its danger is great, and people's heedlessness of it is due to their lack of reflection upon it and remembrance of it. And whoever remembers it does not remember it with an empty heart, but with a heart preoccupied by worldly desires, so the remembrance of death does not benefit his heart. The path in this is for the servant to empty his heart of everything except the remembrance of death, which is before him, like one who intends to travel to a perilous desert or to embark upon the sea, for he thinks of nothing else. When his heart engages with the remembrance of death, it is likely to affect him, and at that point his joy and delight in the world diminish, and his heart is broken. The most effective path in this is to frequently remember his peers and contemporaries who have passed before him, and to recall their death and their resting places beneath the earth, and to recall their images in their positions and states, and to contemplate how the earth has now erased the beauty of their forms, and how their parts have scattered in their graves, and how they have widowed their wives, orphaned their children, squandered their wealth, left their mosques and gatherings empty of them, and their traces have been severed. Whenever a man remembers another man and details in his heart his condition and the manner of his death, and imagines his form, and recalls his vigor, his comings and goings, his contemplation of life and permanence, his forgetfulness of death, his deception by the compliance of means, his reliance on strength and youth, his inclination to laughter and diversion, and his heedlessness of the dreadful death and swift destruction before him—and how he used to come and go, and now his legs and joints have crumbled; and how he used to speak, and now worms have eaten his tongue; and how he used to laugh, and now earth has eaten his teeth; and how he used to arrange for himself what he would not need for ten years, at a time when there was not between him and death but a month, and he was heedless of what was intended for him until death came to him at a time he did not reckon—then the image of the angel was unveiled to him, and the call struck his hearing, either for Paradise or for the Fire. At that point, he looks at himself and sees that he is like them, his heedlessness is like their heedlessness, and his end will be like their end. Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, said: "When you remember the dead, count yourself as one of them." Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "The fortunate one is he who is admonished by others." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said: "Do you not see that you are preparing every day one who goes forth in the morning or returns in the evening to God, Mighty and Majestic is He, placing him in a crack of the earth, having made the earth his pillow, leaving behind loved ones, and severing means?" Persistence in these thoughts and their like, along with entering graveyards and observing the sick, is what renews the remembrance of death in the heart until it overcomes it, such that it becomes ever-present before his eyes. At that point, it is likely to become firmly established for him, and he withdraws from the abode of delusion. Otherwise, remembrance with the surface of the heart and the tip of the tongue is of little benefit in warning and alerting. Whenever his heart finds delight in anything of...

The world is such that one should constantly remember he must inevitably depart from it. Ibn Mutīʿ once looked at his house, admired its beauty, then wept and said: “By God, were it not for death, I would be delighted with you; and were it not for what we are destined for—the constriction of the graves—our eyes would find contentment in this world.” Then he wept bitterly until his voice rose.

(Chapter Two: On the Length of Hope, the Virtue of Short Hope, Its Cause, and Its Remedy)  
(Virtue of Short Hope)

The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar: “When morning comes, do not anticipate the evening; and when evening comes, do not anticipate the morning. Take from your life for your death, and from your health for your sickness. For you, O ʿAbd Allāh, do not know what your name will be tomorrow.” And ʿAlī (may God honor his face) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The two things I fear most for you are following desires and long hope. As for following desires, it turns one away from the truth; and as for long hope, it is love of this world.” Then he said: “Indeed, God gives the world to both those He loves and those He dislikes, but when He loves a servant, He grants him faith. Indeed, religion has its children and the world has its children, so be among the children of religion and not among the children of the world. Indeed, the world has departed, turning its back; indeed, the Hereafter has departed, approaching. Indeed, you are in a day of deeds without reckoning, and indeed you will soon be in a day of reckoning without deeds.”

Umm al-Mundhir said: “The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) once looked upon the people in the evening and said: ‘O people, do you not feel shame before God?’ They said: ‘What is it, O Messenger of God?’ He said: ‘You gather what you do not eat, you hope for what you will not attain, and you build what you will not inhabit.’”

Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī said: “Usāmah ibn Zayd purchased a slave-girl from Zayd ibn Thābit for one hundred dinars, with payment due in a month. I heard the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) say: ‘Are you not amazed at Usāmah, who buys with payment due in a month? Indeed, Usāmah has long hope. By the One in whose hand is my soul, I have not blinked my eyes without thinking my eyelids would not meet again until God takes my soul; nor have I raised my glance without thinking I would not lower it until I pass away; nor have I taken a bite without thinking I would not swallow it before being choked by death.’ Then he said: ‘O children of Adam, if you understand, count yourselves among the dead. By the One in whose hand is my soul, “What you are promised is sure to come, and you cannot escape it.”’”

From Ibn ʿAbbās (may God be pleased with them both): “The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) would go out to pour water and then wipe himself with dust. I said to him: ‘O Messenger of God, water is close to you.’ He replied: ‘How do I know? Perhaps I will not reach it.’”

It is reported that he (peace be upon him) took three sticks, planted one in front of him, another beside him, and the third farther away. Then he said: “Do you know what this is?” They said: “God and His Messenger know best.” He said: “This is the human, this is his appointed term, and that is his hope. The son of Adam reaches for it, but the appointed term seizes him before the hope.”

He (peace be upon him) said: “The likeness of the son of Adam is that beside him are ninety-nine deaths; if the deaths miss him, he falls into old age.” Ibn Masʿūd said: “This person, and these deaths are pathways around him leading to him, with old age behind the deaths and hope behind old age. So he hopes while these deaths are pathways toward him; whichever one passes by him takes him. If the deaths miss him, old age kills him while he is still awaiting hope.”

ʿAbd Allāh said: “The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) drew for us a square, drew a line through its middle, drew lines beside that line, and drew a line outside it. Then he said: ‘Do you know what this is?’ We said: ‘God and His Messenger know best.’ He said: ‘This is the human—the line in the middle; this is his appointed term surrounding him; these are the calamities—the lines around him—gnawing at him. If this one misses him, that one gnaws at him; and that is hope—the line outside.’”

Anas said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: “The son of Adam grows old, but two things remain with him: greed and hope.” In another narration: “Two things accompany him: greed for wealth and greed for long life.” And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: “The first of this community were saved through certainty and asceticism, and the last of this community will be ruined by stinginess and hope.”

It is said that while Jesus (peace be upon him) was sitting, an old man was working with a shovel, turning the earth. Jesus said: “O God, remove hope from him.” So the old man put down his shovel and lay down. After a while, Jesus said: “O God, restore hope to him.” The man got up and began to work again. Jesus asked him about that, and he replied: “While I was working, my soul said to me: ‘How long will you work when you are an old man?’ So I threw down the shovel and lay down. Then my soul said to me: ‘By God, you must have sustenance as long as you live.’ So I got up and returned to my shovel.”

Al-Ḥasan said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: “Do all of you love to enter Paradise?” They said: “Yes, O Messenger of God.” He said: “Shorten your hopes, place your appointed terms before your eyes, and feel true shame before God.” And he (peace be upon him) used to say in his supplication:

O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a worldly life that prevents the good of the Hereafter, and I seek refuge in You from a life that prevents the good of death, and I seek refuge in You from a hope that prevents the good of deeds. The narrations: Mutarrif ibn ‘Abdillah said: If I knew when my appointed time was, I would fear for the loss of my mind. But Allah the Exalted has bestowed favor upon His servants by making them heedless of death. Were it not for this heedlessness, they would not enjoy life, nor would markets thrive among them. Al-Hasan said: Forgetfulness and hope are two great blessings upon the children of Adam; were it not for them, the Muslims would not walk the roads. Al-Thawri said: It has reached me that man was created foolish, and were it not for that, life would not be enjoyable for him. Abu Sa‘id ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: The world is only inhabited due to the lack of intellect of its people. Salman al-Farsi, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Three things have amazed me until they made me laugh: one who hopes for the world while death pursues him; one heedless while heedlessness is not shown to him; and one laughing heartily while not knowing whether the Lord of the Worlds is angry with him or pleased. And three things have grieved me until they made me weep: parting from the beloved, Muhammad and his companions; the terror of the encounter; and standing before Allah, not knowing whether I will be commanded to Paradise or to the Fire. Some said: I saw Zurarah ibn Abi Awfa after his death in a dream and said: Which deed is most elevated among you? He said: Reliance on Allah and shortening hope. Al-Thawri said: Asceticism in the world is shortening hope; it is not eating coarse food nor wearing a woolen cloak. Al-Mufaddal ibn Fadalah asked his Lord to remove hope from him, and the desire for food and drink left him. Then he supplicated to his Lord, and hope was returned to him, and he returned to food and drink. Al-Hasan was told: O Abu Sa‘id, will you not wash your shirt? He said: The matter is more urgent than that. Al-Hasan said: Death is tied to your forelocks, and the world is folded behind you. Some said: I am like a man stretching his neck while the sword is upon it, waiting for when his neck will be struck. Dawud al-Ta’i said: If I hoped to live a month, you would see me commit grave sins. How can I hope for that when I see calamities befalling creation in the hours of night and day? It is related that Shaqiq al-Balkhi came to his teacher, called Abu Hashim al-Rumani, with something tied in the corner of his cloak. His teacher said: What is this with you? He said: Some raisins given to me by a brother, who said: I would like you to break your fast with them. He said: O Shaqiq, and you tell yourself that you will survive until night? I will never speak to you. So he closed the door in my face and entered. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz said in his sermon: For every journey there is provision without fail, so take provision for your journey from this world to the Hereafter: piety. Be like one who witnesses what Allah has prepared of reward and punishment, so that you may desire and fear. Let not the span of time lengthen upon you, hardening your hearts and making you yield to your enemy. For by Allah, none extends hope except one who does not know—perhaps he will not reach the morning after his evening, nor the evening after his morning. And perhaps between them are the sudden snatchings of death. How many have I seen, and you have seen, who were deceived by the world? Only the eye of one who is confident of salvation from Allah’s punishment is content. Only one who is safe from the terrors of the Resurrection rejoices. As for one whose wound is not treated from one side except that he is wounded from another, how can he rejoice? I seek refuge in Allah from commanding you to what I do not forbid myself, lest my transaction be lost, my defect appear, and my poverty be exposed on a day when wealth and poverty are revealed and the scales are set up. You have been preoccupied with a matter that, were the stars preoccupied with it, they would be extinguished; were the mountains preoccupied with it, they would melt; were the earth preoccupied with it, it would split. Do you not know that there is no station between Paradise and the Fire, and that you are bound for one of them? A man wrote to his brother: To proceed: The world is a dream, the Hereafter is wakefulness, and death is the intermediary between them. We are in the fragments of dreams. Peace. Another wrote to his brother: Grief over the world is long, death is near to man, deficiency has a share in him every day, and calamity creeps in his body. So hasten before the call to depart is made. Peace. Al-Hasan said: Before Adam, peace be upon him, sinned, his hope was behind his back and his appointed time was before his eyes. When he committed the sin, it was reversed: his hope was placed before his eyes and his appointed time behind his back. ‘Abdullah ibn Samit said: I heard my father say: O you who are deceived by prolonged health, have you not seen anyone die without illness? O you who are deceived by long respite, have you not seen anyone taken without warning? If you reflected on the length of your life, you would forget the pleasures that have passed. Do you feel secure through health? Do you rejoice in prolonged well-being? Do you feel safe from death? Do you dare defy the Angel of Death? When the Angel of Death comes, your wealth will not prevent him, nor your numerous supporters. Do you not know that the hour of death is full of distress, choking, and regret over negligence? Then it is said: May Allah have mercy on a servant who worked for what is after death. May Allah have mercy on a servant who looked to himself before the descent of death. Abu Zakariyya al-Taymi said: While Sulayman ibn ‘Abd al-Malik was in the mosque...

When the forbidden was brought forth, a hollowed stone was presented, and someone was sought to read it. Wahb ibn Munabbih was brought, and within it was written: "O son of Adam, if you could see how near the remainder of your life is, you would renounce the length of your hopes, yearn to increase your good deeds, and shorten your greed and schemes. Tomorrow, only regret will meet you when your foot slips, your family and servants abandon you, your parent and kin depart, and your child and relative forsake you. You will not return to your worldly life, nor add to your good deeds. So work for the Day of Resurrection before regret and remorse." Sulayman wept bitterly.

Some said: I saw a letter from Muhammad ibn Yusuf to 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Yusuf: "Peace be upon you. I praise God to you, besides whom there is no deity. To proceed: I warn you of your departure from the abode of respite to the abode of your settlement and the recompense of your deeds. You will then reside in the depths of the earth after its surface. Munkar and Nakir will come to you, seat you, and rebuke you. If God is with you, there is no despair, loneliness, or need. But if it is otherwise, may God protect me and you from an evil fate and a narrow resting place. Then the cry of the Gathering and the blast of the Trumpet will reach you, and the Almighty will rise to judge between creatures, the earth emptied of its inhabitants and the heavens of their dwellers. Secrets will be disclosed, the Fire kindled, the Scales set, the Prophets and witnesses brought forth, judgment passed with truth, and it will be said: 'Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.' How many will be exposed and concealed, how many lost and saved, how many tormented and shown mercy! Would that I knew my state and yours on that day. In this is what demolishes pleasures, consoles from desires, shortens hopes, awakens the sleepers, and warns the heedless. May God assist us and you in this immense peril, and place the world and the Hereafter in my heart and yours as they are in the hearts of the God-fearing, for we are by Him and for Him. Peace."

'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz delivered a sermon: He praised God and extolled Him, then said: "O people, you were not created in vain, nor will you be left aimless. You have a return where God will gather you for judgment and justice between you. Wretched and miserable tomorrow is the servant whom God excludes from His mercy, which encompasses all things, and from His Paradise, whose width is the heavens and the earth. Safety tomorrow is only for those who fear and are pious, who trade the little for the much, the perishable for the lasting, misery for happiness. Do you not see that you are in the garments of the perished, and after you the survivors will succeed? Do you not see that each day you escort one departing and returning to God Almighty, whose term has ended and hope severed, placing him in a crevice of the earth, neither cushioned nor smoothed, having cast off means, parted from loved ones, and faced the Reckoning? By God, I say this while knowing no one among you has more sins than I know of myself, but these are just laws from God, commanding obedience to Him and forbidding disobedience. I seek God's forgiveness." He placed his sleeve over his face and wept until his tears soaked his beard, and he did not return to his seat until he died.

Al-Qa'qa' ibn Hakim said: "I have prepared for death for thirty years; if it came to me, I would not wish to delay anything for anything."

Al-Thawri said: "I saw an elder in the mosque of Kufa saying: 'I have been in this mosque for thirty years as if awaiting death to descend upon me. If it came to me, I would not command it to do anything, nor forbid it from anything, nor have any claim over anyone, nor anyone over me.'"

'Abdullah ibn Tha'labah said: "You laugh while perhaps your shrouds have already left the washerman."

Abu Muhammad ibn 'Ali the ascetic said: "We went out for a funeral in Kufa, and Dawud al-Ta'i went out with it. He withdrew and sat aside while it was buried. I came and sat near him, and he spoke: 'Whoever fears the threat, the distant becomes near to him; whoever's hope is long, his deeds weaken; and everything to come is near. Know, O my brother, that everything distracting you from your Lord is an ill omen upon you. Know that all the people of the graves regret what they leave behind and rejoice in what they sent ahead. What the people of the graves regret, the people of the world fight over, compete for, and dispute before judges.'"

It is narrated that Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, may God have mercy on him, led the prayer. Muhammad ibn Abi Tubbah said: "He told me, 'Lead.' I said, 'If I lead you in this prayer, I will not lead you in another.' Ma'ruf said, 'And you imagine you will pray another prayer? We seek refuge in God from long hope, for it prevents good deeds.'"

'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said in his sermon: "This world is not your abode of permanence; it is an abode for which God has decreed annihilation and decreed departure for its inhabitants. How many a well-established abode will soon be ruined, and how many a contented resident will soon depart! So improve, may God have mercy on you, your journey from it with the best of what you possess for the move, and take provision, for the best provision is piety. The world is but like the shade of a mirage that vanishes while the son of Adam is still competing in it."

He is the one whose eye is powerful when God calls him by His decree and casts him to the day of his demise, thus stripping him of his traces and his worldly life, and making his constructions and his abode for other people. Indeed, the world does not bring joy to the extent that it brings harm; it brings joy little and grieves long. And from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, that he used to say in his sermon: Where are those with handsome, beautiful faces, those who were proud of their youth? Where are the kings who built cities and fortified them with walls? Where are those who used to grant victory in the fields of war? Time has crumbled them, and they have become in the darkness of graves. Beware, beware, then salvation, salvation.

(Explanation of the Cause of Prolonged Hope and Its Cure)
Know that prolonged hope has two causes: one is ignorance and the other is love of the world. As for love of the world, it is that when one becomes intimate with it, its pleasures, delights, and attachments, leaving it becomes heavy upon his heart, so his heart refrains from thinking about death, which is the cause of leaving it. Whoever dislikes something pushes it away from himself, and man is infatuated with false hopes, constantly wishing for what agrees with his desire. What agrees with his desire is remaining in the world, so he continuously imagines it and estimates it within himself, and estimates the consequences of remaining and what he needs of wealth, family, home, friends, animals, and all worldly means. Thus his heart becomes devoted to this thought, preoccupied with it, so he is distracted from the remembrance of death and does not consider its nearness. If the matter of death and the need to prepare for it occurs to him in some circumstances, he procrastinates and promises himself, saying, "The days are before you until you grow old, then repent." And when he grows old, he says, "Until you become elderly." And when he becomes elderly, he says, "Until you finish building this house, developing this estate, or return from this journey, or finish arranging for this child and his provisions, and arranging a dwelling for him, or finish subduing this enemy who gloats over you." He keeps procrastinating and delaying, and he does not engage in any task except that he attaches to completing that task ten other tasks. And thus gradually he delays day after day, and one task leads him to another, indeed to many tasks, until death snatches him at a time he does not expect. Then his regret becomes prolonged, and most of the people of the Fire and their cries are from procrastination; they will say, "Woe to us from 'I will do it later.'" The procrastinator, the wretched one, does not know that what calls him to procrastination today is with him tomorrow, and it only increases in strength and firmness with the passage of time. He thinks that one immersed in the world and preserving it could ever have leisure—far from it! None is free from it except he who casts it away:
No one has ever fulfilled his need from it,
And no seeker reaches an end except to another need.
The origin of all these hopes is love of the world, intimacy with it, and heedlessness of the meaning of His saying, "Love whom you will, for you will leave him." As for ignorance, it is that man may rely on his youth and consider death remote despite youth. The wretched one does not reflect that if the elders of his town were counted, they would be fewer than a tenth of the town's men. They are few because death in youth is more frequent; for every elder who dies, a thousand children and youths die. He may consider death remote due to his health, and consider sudden death remote, not knowing that this is not far-fetched. Even if that is remote, sudden illness is not remote, and every illness occurs suddenly. When he falls ill, death is not remote. If this heedless one reflected and knew that death has no specific time—neither youth, old age, nor middle age; neither summer, winter, autumn, nor spring; neither night nor day—his awareness would be great, and he would busy himself with preparation for it. But ignorance of these matters and love of the world call him to prolonged hope and to heedlessness of estimating near death. He always thinks that death will be before him and does not consider its descent upon him and its occurrence to him. He always thinks that he escorts funerals and does not consider that his funeral will be escorted, because this has repeated for him and he is accustomed to it—witnessing the death of others. As for his own death, he is not accustomed to it and cannot imagine becoming accustomed to it, for it has not occurred. And when it occurs in another state after this, it is the first and the last. His way is to compare himself to others and know that inevitably his funeral will be carried and he will be buried in his grave. Perhaps the brick that will cover his grave has already been molded and finished, while he does not know. So his procrastination is pure ignorance. When you know that its cause is ignorance and love of the world, its cure is to remove its cause. As for ignorance, it is removed by pure thought from a present heart and by hearing profound wisdom from pure hearts. As for love of the world, the cure is to extract it from the heart, which is severe, for it is the chronic disease that has exhausted the first and the last in its treatment. There is no cure for it except faith in the Last Day and in what it contains of great punishment and abundant reward. Whenever certainty of that is attained, love of the world departs from his heart.

As for the world, love for the weighty matter is what erases from the heart love for the trivial. So when one sees the insignificance of the world and the preciousness of the Hereafter, he scorns to turn his attention to the world at all, even if he were given dominion over the earth from east to west. How could it be otherwise when he possesses of the world only a small, troubled, and vexing portion? How then could he rejoice in it or allow love for it to become firmly rooted in the heart alongside faith in the Hereafter? So we ask God, exalted is He, to show us the world as He showed it to the righteous among His servants. And there is no remedy for establishing the thought of death in the heart like looking upon those of one's peers and contemporaries who have died, and how death came upon them at a time they did not reckon. As for one who was prepared, he has attained a great triumph. But as for one who was deluded by long hope, he has incurred a manifest loss. Let a person look every hour at his limbs and members, and contemplate how they will inevitably be consumed by worms, and how his bones will crumble. Let him reflect that the worm begins with his right eye first, or his left. There is nothing on his body except that it is food for worms, and he has nothing from himself except knowledge and deeds sincerely for the sake of God, exalted is He. Likewise, let him reflect on what we will mention of the punishment of the grave, the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, and of the Gathering and the Resurrection, and the terrors of the Standing, and the sounding of the call on the Day of the Greatest Presentation. Such thoughts as these are what renew the remembrance of death upon his heart and call him to prepare for it.

(Explanation of the Ranks of People Regarding Length and Shortness of Hope)
Know that people vary in this. Among them are those who hope for survival and constantly desire it. God, exalted is He, says: "He would wish that he might be granted a life of a thousand years" (Quran 2:96). Among them are those who hope for survival until old age, which is the utmost lifespan he has witnessed and seen, and he is the one who loves the world intensely. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The old man is a youth in his love for seeking the world, even if his collar-bones rattle from old age, except for those who are God-fearing, and few they are." Among them are those who hopes for a year, so he does not busy himself with arranging what is beyond it, nor does he anticipate his own existence in the coming year. Yet this one prepares in summer for winter and in winter for summer, so when he gathers what suffices him for his year, he occupies himself with worship. Among them are those who hopes for the duration of summer or winter, so he does not store up winter clothes in summer, nor summer clothes in winter. Among them are those whose hope reverts to a day and a night, so he prepares only for his day, but not for the morrow. Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Do not be concerned with tomorrow's provision, for if tomorrow is from your appointed terms, your provisions will come to you with your appointed terms, and if it is not from your appointed terms, then do not be concerned for the appointed terms of others." Among them are those whose hope does not exceed an hour, as our Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "O servant of God, when you reach the morning, do not promise yourself the evening, and when you reach the evening, do not promise yourself the morning." Among them are those who does not even anticipate survival for an hour, as the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would perform dry ablution despite the availability of water before an hour had passed, saying to 'Ali, "I will not reach it." Among them are those for whom death is before his eyes as if it is befalling him, so he awaits it. This is the person who prays the prayer of one bidding farewell. In this regard, what is reported from Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may God be pleased with him, when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, asked him about the reality of his faith, and he said: "I took not a single step except that I thought I would not take another after it." And as reported from al-Aswad, who was an Abyssinian, that he would pray at night and glance right and left. Someone said to him, "What is this?" He said, "I am looking to see from which direction the Angel of Death will come to me." These are the ranks of people, and for each are degrees with God. It is not that one's hope is limited to a month, like one whose hope is a month and a day, but rather between them is a difference in degree with God, for God wrongs not even the weight of an atom (Quran 4:40). Then the effect of short hope becomes apparent in hastening to work. Every person claims he is short of hope, but he is lying. This only becomes apparent through his deeds. For he attends to means he may not need for a year, and this indicates the length of his hope. The sign of success is that death is before the eye, not forgotten for an hour. So let him prepare for the death that may come to him at any moment. If he lives until evening, he thanks God, exalted is He, for His obedience and rejoices that he did not waste his day, but rather took his full share from it and stored it for himself. Then he begins the same anew until morning, and so on when he reaches the morning. This is not facilitated except for one whose heart is empty of concern for tomorrow and what will be in it. Such a one, if he dies, is blessed and gains, and if he lives, he rejoices in good preparation and the sweetness of intimate discourse. So death for him is bliss, and life for him is increase. So let death be on your mind, O wretched one, for the journey is urging you on while you are heedless of yourself. Perhaps you have drawn near to the abode and traversed the distance. You will not be like this except by hastening to work, seizing every breath in which you are granted respite.

(Explanation of Hastening to Work and Warning Against the Affliction of Delay)

Know that one who has two absent brothers, expecting the arrival of one tomorrow and the other after a month or a year, does not prepare for the one arriving in a month or a year, but only prepares for the one whose arrival is expected tomorrow. Thus, preparation is a consequence of the proximity of expectation. Whoever expects death to come after a year, their heart becomes preoccupied with the duration and forgets what lies beyond it. Then each day passes while they await the full year, not subtracting the day that has passed, and this prevents them from hastening to good deeds forever, seeing ample time for themselves in that year and thus delaying action. As the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "What does any of you expect from this world except overwhelming wealth, or forgotten poverty, or debilitating illness, or confining old age, or death that makes ready, or the False Messiah—for the False Messiah is the worst absent one awaited—or the Hour, and the Hour is more grievous and bitter." And Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man while admonishing him: "Take advantage of five before five: your youth before your old age, your health before your sickness, your wealth before your poverty, your free time before your preoccupation, and your life before your death." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Two blessings are taken for granted by many people: health and free time." Meaning, they do not seize them and only recognize their value when they are gone. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever fears sets out at night, and whoever sets out at night reaches the destination. Indeed, God's commodity is precious; indeed, God's commodity is Paradise." He, peace be upon him, said: "The Tremor has come, followed by the Resurrection, and Death has come with what it contains." And whenever the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sensed heedlessness or negligence among his companions, he would call out to them in a loud voice: "Death has come to you, fixed and inevitable, either with wretchedness or with happiness." And Abu Huraira said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "I am the warner, Death is the raider, and the Hour is the appointment." And Ibn Umar said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, went out while the sun was at the tips of the palm branches, and he said: "What remains of this world is only like what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The likeness of this world is like a garment torn from its beginning to its end, remaining hanging by a thread at its end, and soon that thread will snap." And Jabir said: Whenever the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, delivered a sermon and mentioned the Hour, his voice would rise and his cheeks would redden as if he were warning an army, saying: "Morning and evening have come upon you. I have been sent and the Hour are like these two," and he joined his two fingers. And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited: "So whoever God wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam." Then he said: "When light enters the heart, it expands." It was said: "O Messenger of God, is there a sign for that which can be recognized?" He said: "Yes: turning away from the abode of deception, turning to the abode of eternity, and preparing for death before it descends." And Al-Suddi said regarding: "He who created death and life to test which of you is best in deed." Meaning: which of you remembers death most, prepares for it best, and fears and is cautious of it most. And Hudhayfa said: "There is no morning or evening except that a caller calls out: 'O people, depart, depart!'" And the confirmation of that is His saying, exalted is He: "Indeed, it is one of the greatest warnings to mankind, for whoever among you wishes to advance or delay." Regarding death. And Suhaym, the freedman of Banu Tamim, said: "I sat with 'Amir ibn 'Abdullah while he was praying, and he made his prayer brief, then turned to me and said: 'Relieve me of your need, for I am hastening.' I said: 'What are you hastening to?' He said: 'The Angel of Death, may God have mercy on you.' So I left him, and he returned to his prayer." And Dawud al-Ta'i passed by, and a man asked him about a hadith, so he said: "Leave me, for I am only hastening the departure of my soul." 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Deliberateness in everything is good except in deeds for the Hereafter." And Al-Mundhir said: "I heard Malik ibn Dinar saying to himself: 'Woe to you, hasten before the command comes to you! Woe to you, hasten before the command comes to you!' until he repeated it sixty times, I hearing him without him seeing me." And Al-Hasan used to say in his admonition: "Hasten, hasten, for it is only breaths; if they are held back, your deeds by which you draw near to God, exalted is He, are cut off. May God have mercy on a person who looks at himself and weeps over the number of his sins." Then he recited this verse: "We only count for them a number." Meaning the breaths; the last of the count is the departure of your soul, the last of the count is parting from your family, the last of the count is your entry into your grave. And Abu Musa al-Ash'ari strove intensely before his death, so it was said to him: "If you held back or showed yourself some gentleness." He said: "When horses are released and near the end of their course, they expend all they have, and what remains of my life is less than that." He did not cease from that until he died, and he used to say to his wife: "Tighten your saddle, for there is no bridge over Hell." And a certain caliph said from his pulpit: "O servants of God, fear God as much as you are able, and be a people who, when called out to, awaken. Know that this world is not an abode for you, so exchange it and prepare for death, for it has overshadowed you. Depart, for it has become earnest with you. Indeed, its end is diminished by the moment and demolished by the hour."

Indeed, the brevity of life's span makes it worthy of heed, and an absent one who finds the two renewals—night and day—bringing him fresh opportunities is most deserving of swift return. And an arrival who attains either triumph or misery is worthy of the finest preparation. So the God-fearing, before his Lord, is he who counsels his own soul, advances his repentance, and overcomes his desire. For his term is concealed from him, his hope deceives him, and Satan is assigned to him, deluding him with repentance only to lead him to it, and beautifying sin for him so he may commit it, until his death assaults him when he is most heedless of it. And indeed, between any one of you and Paradise or Hell lies only death descending upon him. Oh, what regret for the heedless one, or that his life becomes a proof against him, and his days lead him to misery. May God make us and you among those whom no blessing makes arrogant, whom no sin hinders from obeying God, and upon whom no regret settles after death. Truly, He hears supplication, and in His hand is all good, ever doing what He wills.

Some exegetes said concerning His words, "You tempted yourselves"—meaning with desires and pleasures—"and you awaited"—meaning with repentance—"and you doubted"—meaning you wavered—"until God's command came"—meaning death—"and the deceiver deceived you concerning God"—meaning Satan. Al-Hasan said: Be patient and firm, for these are but few days, and you are a halted caravan; soon a man among you will be called and he will answer without turning back. So depart with the good you have at hand. Ibn Mas'ud said: There is not one of you who wakes in the morning except as a guest, and what he has is a loan; the guest departs, and the loan is returned. Abu 'Ubaydah al-Baji said: We visited al-Hasan during the illness from which he died, and he said: Welcome and greetings, may God grant you safety and settle us and you in the Abode of Permanence. This is a manifest goodness if you are patient, truthful, and God-fearing. So let not your share of this news, may God have mercy on you, be that you hear it with this ear and let it out from this ear. For whoever saw Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw him coming and going, not placing brick upon brick nor reed upon reed, but a banner was raised for him, so hasten, hasten! Salvation, salvation! Why do you delay? You have come, by the Lord of the Ka'bah, as if you and the matter are together. May God have mercy on a servant who made life a single life: he ate a morsel, wore worn garments, clung to the earth, strove in worship, wept over sin, fled from punishment, and sought mercy until his term came to him while he was upon that. 'Asim al-Ahwal said: Fudayl al-Raqqashi said to me while I was asking him: O this one, let not the multitude of people distract you from yourself, for the matter will come to you alone, not them. And do not say, "I will go here and there," so the day passes you by in nothingness, for the matter is recorded against you. And you have never seen anything more beautifully sought nor more swiftly attained than a fresh good deed for an old sin.

(Chapter Three: On the Agonies of Death and Its Severity, and What Conduct Is Recommended at That Time)

Know that if there were before the wretched servant no distress, terror, or torment except the agonies of death alone, it would be sufficient to embitter his life, cloud his joy, and separate him from his heedlessness and neglect. And it would be fitting for him to prolong his reflection and greatly increase his preparation, especially since he is at every moment on the verge of it, as some wise men said: A distress in another's hand—you know not when it will overcome you. Luqman said to his son: O my son, an affair you know not when it will meet you—prepare for it before it surprises you. And it is astonishing that if a person were in the greatest pleasures and the sweetest gatherings of amusement, and he expected a soldier to enter upon him and strike him five blows with a stick, his pleasure would be spoiled and his life ruined, while at every moment he is on the verge of the Angel of Death entering upon him with the agonies of departure, yet he is heedless of it. This has no cause except ignorance and delusion.

Know that the severity of pain in the agonies of death is not truly known except by one who has tasted it; and whoever has not tasted it knows it only by analogy to the pains he has experienced, or by inference from the states of people in the throes of death. As for the analogy that testifies to it: every limb without spirit feels no pain, but when spirit is in it, what perceives pain is the spirit. So whenever a limb is wounded or burned, the effect travels to the spirit, and the pain is felt according to what reaches the spirit. The painful agent is distributed over flesh, blood, and other parts, so only some of the pain reaches the spirit. But if there is a pain that directly affects the spirit itself and meets nothing else, how immense is that pain and how severe! The agony of death is an expression for a pain that descends upon the very spirit, engulfing all its parts until no part of the spirit, spread through the depths of the body, remains untouched by pain. If a thorn pricks him, the pain he feels flows only in a part of the spirit that meets that spot struck by the thorn. And the effect of burning is great only because parts of the fire penetrate all parts of the body...

A portion of the burnt limb remains, both outwardly and inwardly, except that the fire touches it, and the spiritual parts diffused throughout all portions of the flesh sense it. As for a wound, it only affects the specific place the iron touched; thus, the pain of the wound is unlike the pain of the fire. The pain of extraction assaults the very soul and pervades all its parts, for it is the extracted, the dragged out from every vein among the veins, every nerve among the nerves, every part among the parts, every joint among the joints, and from the root of every hair and skin from the parting of the hair to the foot. So do not ask about its anguish and pain, to the point that they have said: "Death has no severity like being struck by the sword, sawn with saws, or clipped with shears." For cutting the body with a sword only pains due to its connection to the soul, so how about when the agent directly involved is the soul itself? The one struck cries for help and screams due to the persistence of his strength in his heart and his tongue. The voice and cry of the dying person are cut off only from the intensity of his pain, because the anguish has overwhelmed him, risen over his heart, and reached every part of him, weakening every strength and enfeebling every limb, leaving him no power to call for help. As for the intellect, it is shrouded and confused; as for the tongue, it is struck dumb; as for the extremities, they are weakened. He would wish, if he were able, to find relief through groaning, screaming, and calling for help, but he is incapable of that. If any strength remains in him, you hear from him, at the extraction and pulling of the soul, a bellowing and gurgling from his throat and chest. His color changes and becomes livid until it is as if the dust, which is the origin of his nature, has appeared from him. Every vein is pulled out individually, so the pain is spread throughout his interior and exterior until the pupils rise to the tops of his eyelids, the lips contract, the tongue retracts to its root, the testicles rise to the top of their place, and his fingertips turn green. So do not ask about a body from which every vein among its veins is pulled! If the pulled one were a single vein, its pain would be immense, so how about when the pulled one is the pained soul itself, not from a single vein but from all the veins? Then each of his limbs dies gradually: his two feet grow cold first, then his two shins, then his two thighs. For every limb there is stupor after stupor and anguish after anguish until it reaches the throat. At that point, his gaze is cut off from the world and its people, the door of repentance is closed upon him, and regret and remorse encompass him. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The repentance of the servant is accepted as long as the death rattle has not begun." Mujahid said concerning God's saying, exalted is He: "But repentance is not for those who continue to do evil deeds until, when death comes to one of them, he says, 'Indeed, I have now repented,'" that it means when he sees the [angelic] messengers. At that moment, the countenance of the Angel of Death becomes apparent to him, so do not ask about the taste of death's bitterness and its anguish at the succession of its stupors! For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say: "O God, make easy for Muhammad the agonies of death." People only fail to seek refuge from it and deem it insignificant due to their ignorance of it, for things before their occurrence are only perceived by the light of prophethood and sainthood. Therefore, the fear of death was immense among the prophets, peace be upon them, and the saints, to the point that Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "O company of disciples, pray to God, exalted is He, to make easy this stupor," meaning death, "for I fear death with a fear that has brought me, out of my fear of death, to the brink of death." It is related that a group from the Children of Israel passed by a graveyard, and some of them said to the others, "If you were to pray to God, exalted is He, to bring out for you from this graveyard a dead person so you could ask him..." They prayed to God, exalted is He, and there appeared to them a man who stood up, with the mark of prostration between his eyes, having emerged from one of the graves. He said, "O people, what do you want from me? I have tasted death fifty years ago, and the bitterness of death has not subsided from my heart." Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said, "I do not envy anyone for whom death is made easy after what I saw of the severity of the death of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." It is related that he, peace and blessings be upon him, used to say: "O God, You take the soul from between the nerves, the marrow, and the fingertips. O God, so help me against death and make it easy for me." And from Al-Hasan: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, mentioned death, its choking, and its pain, and said, 'It is like three hundred blows with a sword.'" He, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about death and its severity, and he said: "The easiest death is like a thorn in wool. Does the thorn come out of the wool except with some wool [clinging to it]?" He, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon a sick person and then said: "I know what he encounters; there is no vein in him except that it pains from death in its own way." Ali, may God honor his countenance, used to urge fighting and say, "If you are not killed, you will die. By the One in whose hand is my soul, a thousand blows with the sword are easier for me than death upon a bed." Al-Awza'i said: "It has reached us that the deceased feels the pain of death until he is resurrected from his grave." Shaddad ibn Aws said: "Death is the most dreadful terror in this world and the next for the believer, and it is more severe than being sawn with saws, clipped with shears, and thrown into cauldrons. If the deceased were to be resurrected and inform..."

The people of this world derive no benefit from their life nor pleasure from their sleep through death. And from Zayd ibn Aslam, from his father, who said: When something remains for a believer from his ranks [in Paradise] which he has not attained by his deeds, the agony of death is intensified for him so that through its pangs and distress he may attain his rank in Paradise. And when a disbeliever has done a good deed, the [suffering of] death is not made light for him, so that he may receive the full reward for his good deed [in this world] and then proceed to the Fire. And from one of them, that he used to ask many of the sick, "How do you find death?" Then when he fell ill, it was said to him, "And you, how do you find it?" He said, "As if the heavens were pressing down upon the earth, and as if my soul were exiting through the eye of a needle."

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Sudden death is a mercy for the believer and a cause of regret for the wicked." And it is narrated from Makhul, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: "If a single hair from the deceased were placed upon the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, they would die by the permission of God, the Exalted, for in every hair is death, and death does not befall anything except that it dies." And it is narrated: "If a drop of the agony of death were placed upon all the mountains of the world, they would melt." And it is narrated that when Abraham, peace be upon him, died, God, the Exalted, said to him: "How did you find death, O my intimate friend?" He said: "Like a hot iron rod thrust into damp wool and then pulled out." He said: "But verily, We have made it light for you."

And it is narrated from Moses, peace be upon him, that when his spirit came to God, the Exalted, his Lord said to him: "O Moses, how did you find death?" He said: "I found my soul like a sparrow being roasted on a griddle; it does not die to find rest, nor does it escape to fly away." And it is narrated from him that he said: "I found my soul like a living sheep being skinned by the hand of the butcher."

And it is narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he had a cup of water near him at the time of death, and he would put his hand in the water, then wipe his face with it and say: "O God, make easy for me the agonies of death." And Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, said: "O, the distress of your distress, my father!" And he was saying: "There is no distress for your father after this day."

And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said to Ka'b al-Ahbar: "O Ka'b, tell us about death." He said: "Yes, O Commander of the Faithful. Verily, death is like a thorny branch inserted into a man's innards, with every thorn gripping a vein. Then a man of immense strength pulls it, taking what it takes and leaving what it leaves."

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, the servant struggles with the distress of death and its agonies, and his joints bid farewell to one another, saying, 'Peace be upon you; you part from me and I part from you until the Day of Resurrection.'"

These are the agonies of death for the allies and beloved of God. So what is our state, we who are engrossed in sins, and upon us, along with the agonies of death, descend the remaining calamities? For the calamities of death are three. The first: the severity of the soul's extraction, as we have mentioned. The second calamity: beholding the form of the Angel of Death and the entry of terror and fear from him into the heart. For if the greatest of men in strength were to see the form in which he seizes the soul of the sinful servant, he could not bear the sight of it. It is narrated from Abraham, the intimate friend, peace be upon him, that he said to the Angel of Death: "Can you show me the form in which you seize the soul of the wicked?" He said: "You cannot bear that." He said: "Yes, I can." He said: "Then turn away from me." So he turned away from him, then glanced back, and there was a man, black, with hair standing on end, foul of odor, clothed in black, with flames and smoke issuing from his mouth and nostrils. Abraham, peace be upon him, fell unconscious. Then he regained consciousness, and the Angel of Death had returned to his original form. He said: "O Angel of Death, if the wicked encountered nothing at death but the sight of your face, it would be sufficient for him."

And Abu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him: "David, peace be upon him, was a man of intense jealousy. When he would go out, he would lock the doors. One day he locked them and went out. His wife looked out and saw a man in the courtyard. She said, 'Who let this man in? If David comes, he will surely face trouble from him.' David came and saw him and said, 'Who are you?' He said, 'I am he who fears no kings, and no veil can prevent me.' He said, 'Then, by God, you are the Angel of Death.' And David, peace be upon him, fainted in his place."

And it is narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by a skull and struck it with his foot and said, "Speak, by the permission of God." It said, "O Spirit of God, I was the king of such-and-such a time. While I was seated in my kingdom upon my crown, with my soldiers and attendants around me upon my royal throne, the Angel of Death appeared to me. Every limb of mine fell apart separately, then my soul departed to him. Would that all those multitudes had been separation, and would that all that companionship had been solitude!" This is a calamity encountered by the disobedient, from which the obedient are spared. For the Prophets only recounted the mere agony of the extraction, not the terror experienced by one who beholds the form of the Angel of Death. Even if he were to see it in his dream one night, it would embitter the rest of his life, so how about seeing it in such a state? As for the obedient, he sees him in the most beautiful and finest form.

It is narrated from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn 'Abbas, that Abraham, peace be upon him, was a man of intense jealousy, and he had a house in which he worshipped.

Then he closed it upon leaving. One day he returned to find a man inside the house. He asked, "Who let you into my home?" The man replied, "The Lord of this house let me in." He said, "I am its lord." The man responded, "He who has greater authority over it than you or me let me in." He asked, "Which angel are you?" He said, "I am the Angel of Death." He said, "Can you show me the form in which you take the soul of a believer?" He said, "Yes, but turn away from me." So he turned away, then looked back and saw a youth—and he described the beauty of his face, the fineness of his clothes, and the fragrance of his scent. He said, "O Angel of Death, if a believer at death saw only your form, that would suffice him."

Among them is witnessing the two guardian angels. Wahb said: It has reached us that no one dies until his two recording angels appear to him with his deeds. If he was obedient, they say to him, "May God reward you well on our behalf. How many gatherings of truth you seated us in, and how many righteous deeds you brought us to!" If he was wicked, they say to him, "May God not reward you well on our behalf. How many evil gatherings you seated us in, and how many unrighteous deeds you brought us to, and foul speech you made us hear! May God not reward you well on our behalf." That is the fixing of the dying person’s gaze upon them, and he never returns to this world.

The third calamity: witnessing the places of the disobedient in the Fire, and their fear before actually seeing it. For in the throes of death their strength fails and their souls submit to departure, yet their souls will not depart until they hear the announcement of the Angel of Death in one of two forms: either "Rejoice, O enemy of God, with the Fire!" or "Rejoice, O friend of God, with Paradise!" From this arises the fear of the possessors of intellect. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "None of you will leave this world until he knows his destination and sees his place in Paradise or the Fire." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever loves to meet God, God loves to meet him; and whoever hates to meet God, God hates to meet him." They said, "But we all dislike death." He said, "It is not that. When a believer is shown what lies ahead, he loves to meet God and God loves to meet him."

It is narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman said to Ibn Mas'ud, who was with him late at night, "Get up and see what hour it is." Ibn Mas'ud got up and then came to him and said, "The red dawn has appeared." Hudhayfah said, "I seek refuge in God from a morning that leads to the Fire." Marwan entered upon Abu Hurayrah, and Marwan said, "O God, make it light for him." Abu Hurayrah said, "O God, make it severe." Then Abu Hurayrah wept and said, "By God, I do not weep out of sorrow for this world nor from distress at parting from you, but I await one of the two announcements from my Lord: of Paradise or of the Fire."

It is narrated in a hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "When God is pleased with a servant, He says, 'O Angel of Death, go to so-and-so and bring me his soul that I may give him rest. I am sufficient regarding his deeds; I have tested him and found him as I love.' Then the Angel of Death descends with five hundred angels, carrying stalks of sweet basil and roots of saffron, each one bringing him glad tidings different from his companion's. The angels stand in rows for the departure of his soul, with them the sweet basil. When Iblis sees them, he places his hand on his head and shrieks. His soldiers say to him, 'What is wrong, our master?' He says, 'Do you not see the honor bestowed upon this servant? Where were you in this matter?' They say, 'We strove against him, but he was protected.'"

Al-Hasan said: "The believer finds no rest except in meeting God. And for him whose rest is in meeting God Almighty, the day of death is a day of joy, happiness, security, honor, and nobility." It was said to Jabir ibn Zayd at the time of death, "What do you desire?" He said, "A look at al-Hasan." When al-Hasan entered upon him, it was said, "This is al-Hasan." He raised his eyes to him and then said, "O my brothers, by God, this very hour I part from you, either to the Fire or to Paradise." Muhammad ibn Was'i said at the time of death, "O my brothers, peace be upon you—either to the Fire, or may God pardon." Some wished to remain in the agony of death forever and not be resurrected for reward or punishment. Thus, the fear of a bad ending has pierced the hearts of the knowers of God, and it is among the great calamities at death. We have mentioned the meaning of a bad ending and the intensity of the knowers' fear of it in the Book of Fear and Hope, which is fitting for this place, but we shall not prolong by repeating it.

(Explanation of What is Desirable from the State of the Dying Person at Death)
Know that what is beloved at death regarding the appearance of the dying person is calmness and stillness; regarding his tongue, that it be speaking the testimony of faith; and regarding his heart, that it have good hope in God Almighty. As for appearance, it is narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "Observe the deceased at three signs: if his forehead perspires, his eyes shed tears, and his lips dry—that is from God's mercy that has descended upon him; and if he gasps like one being strangled, his color reddens, and his lips darken—that is from God's punishment that has descended upon him." As for his tongue being fluent with the word of testimony, it is a sign of good. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Prompt your dying ones..."

Your deceased ones, "There is no god but Allah." In the narration of Hudhayfah: "For it demolishes what came before it of sins." And 'Uthman said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever dies while knowing that there is no god but Allah enters Paradise." And 'Ubaydullah testified to it. And 'Uthman said: When the dying person is in the throes of death, then prompt him with 'There is no god but Allah,' for there is no servant whose final words are sealed with it at his death except that it becomes his provision to Paradise. And 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Be present with your dying ones and remind them, for they see what you do not see, and prompt them with 'There is no god but Allah.' And Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: "The Angel of Death attended a man who was dying. He looked into his heart and found nothing in it. So he opened his jaws and found the tip of his tongue stuck to his palate, saying 'There is no god but Allah,' so he was forgiven by the word of sincerity."

The one who prompts should not be insistent in the prompting but should be gentle, for perhaps the tongue of the sick person may not speak, and that would distress him and lead to him finding the prompting burdensome and disliking the word. It is feared that this might be a cause of a bad ending. The meaning of this word is that a man dies with nothing in his heart other than Allah. So when nothing remains for him as an object of desire except the One True Reality, his arrival by death to his Beloved is the utmost bliss in his regard. But if the heart is infatuated with the world, turned towards it, regretting its pleasures, and the word is merely on the tip of the tongue, and the heart does not accord with its realization, then the matter falls into the peril of the Divine Will. For the mere movement of the tongue is of little avail unless Allah, the Exalted, graciously accepts it.

As for having good expectations, it is recommended at this time, and we have mentioned that in the Book of Hope. Reports have come regarding the merit of having good expectations of Allah. Wa'ilah ibn al-Asqa' visited a sick man and said, "Inform me, what is your expectation of Allah?" He said, "My sins have drowned me, and I am on the brink of destruction, but I hope for the mercy of my Lord." Wa'ilah said "Allahu Akbar" and the people of the house said it with him, and he said, "Allah is Greatest! I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'Allah, the Exalted, says: I am as My servant expects of Me, so let him expect of Me what he wills.'"

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, visited a youth who was dying and said, "How do you find yourself?" He said, "I hope in Allah and I fear my sins." He, peace be upon him, said, "These two do not gather in the heart of a servant in such a situation except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and secures him from what he fears." And Thabit al-Bunani said: There was a youth with some sharpness, and he had a mother who often admonished him and said to him, "O my son, you have a day (of reckoning), so remember your day." When the command of Allah, the Exalted, descended upon him, his mother leaned over him and began to say, "O my son, I used to warn you of this fate of yours and say, 'You have a day.'" He said, "O my mother, I have a Lord abundant in kindness, and I indeed hope that He will not deprive me today of some of His kindness." Thabit said: So Allah had mercy on him due to his good expectation of his Lord.

And Jabir ibn Waddah said: There was a youth with some levity who was in the throes of death. His mother said to him, "O my son, do you wish to bequeath anything?" He said, "Yes, my ring—do not strip it from me, for in it is the remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, so perhaps Allah will have mercy on me." When he was buried, he was seen in a dream, and he said, "Inform my mother that the word has benefited me and that Allah has forgiven me."

And a Bedouin fell ill, and it was said to him, "You will die." He said, "Where will I be taken?" They said, "To Allah." He said, "Then why should I dislike going to One from whom no good is seen except from Him?" And Abu al-Mu'tamir ibn Sulayman said: My father, when death was present for him, said, "O Mu'tamir, relate to me the concessions (in religion), so that perhaps I will meet Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, while having good expectations of Him." And they recommended that the servant's good deeds be mentioned to him at his death so that he would have good expectations of his Lord.

(Explanation of the anguish upon meeting the Angel of Death, with narratives that express the state eloquently.)

Ash'ath ibn Aslam said: Ibrahim, peace be upon him, asked the Angel of Death—and his name is 'Azra'il, and he has two eyes, an eye in his face and an eye in the back of his head—and said, "O Angel of Death, what do you do when there is a soul in the east and a soul in the west, and a plague occurs in a land, and two armies meet in battle—how do you manage?" He said, "I call the souls by the permission of Allah, and they are between these two fingers of mine." And he said that the earth was flattened out for him so it became like a basin before him, from which he takes what he wills. He said this while giving him the glad tidings that he was the intimate friend of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.

And Sulayman ibn Dawud, peace be upon them both, said to the Angel of Death, peace be upon him, "Why do I not see you being equitable among people? You take this one and leave that one." He said, "I am no more knowledgeable about that than you. They are merely scrolls or writings that are cast to me, containing the names."

And Wahb ibn Munabbih said: There was a king among kings who wanted to ride to a land. He called for garments to wear, but they did not please him, so he sought others until he wore what pleased him after several attempts. Likewise, he sought a mount, and one was brought to him, but it did not please him until mounts were brought, and he rode the finest of them. Then Iblis came and blew into his nostrils a breath that filled him with arrogance. Then he set out, and the horses went with him, and he did not look at the people out of arrogance.

A man of shabby appearance came to him, greeted him, but received no return of the greeting. So he seized the bridle of his mount. The man said, "Release the bridle, for I have undertaken a grave matter." He replied, "I have a need of you." The man said, "Wait until I dismount." He said, "No, now." So he compelled him by the bridle of his mount. The man said, "Shall I mention it?" He said, "It is a secret." So he drew his head near and whispered to him, saying, "I am the Angel of Death." The king's complexion changed and his tongue faltered. Then he said, "Let me return to my family, settle my affairs, and bid them farewell." He said, "No, by God, you shall never see your family and your burden again." So he seized his soul, and he fell as if he were a piece of wood. Then he departed.

He met a believing servant in that same state, greeted him, and the servant returned the greeting. He said, "I have a need of you; I shall mention it in your ear." He said, "Speak." So he whispered to him, saying, "I am the Angel of Death." He said, "Welcome and greetings to one whose absence has been long upon me. By God, there was no absent one on earth I longed to meet more than you." The Angel of Death said, "Fulfill the need for which you came out." He said, "I have no need greater to me, nor more beloved, than meeting God, the Exalted." He said, "Then choose in whatever state you wish for me to take your soul." He said, "Are you able to do that?" He said, "Yes, for I have been commanded to do so." He said, "Then let me perform ablution and pray, then take my soul while I am prostrating." So he took his soul while he was prostrating.

Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdullah al-Muzani said: A man from the Children of Israel gathered wealth. When he was on the verge of death, he said to his sons, "Show me the varieties of my wealth." So he was brought a great deal: horses, camels, slaves, and other things. When he looked at it, he wept in regret over it. The Angel of Death saw him weeping and said to him, "What makes you weep? By the One who bestowed it upon you, I shall not leave your house until I separate your soul from your body." He said, "Then a respite until I distribute it." He said, "Far be it! The respite has been cut off from you. If only you had done that before your appointed time arrived." So he seized his soul.

It is narrated that a man gathered wealth, amassing it, leaving no kind of wealth but that he acquired it. He built a palace and put upon it two sturdy doors, and gathered upon it guards from his servants. Then he gathered his family and prepared food for them, and sat upon his couch, raising one leg over the other while they were eating. When they finished, he said, "O my soul, enjoy yourself for years, for I have gathered for you what will suffice you." He had not finished his speech when the Angel of Death approached him in the form of a man wearing worn clothes, with a beggar's bag around his neck, resembling the poor. He knocked on the door with a mighty, alarming knock that startled him on his bed. The servants rushed to him and said, "What is your business?" He said, "Call me to your master." They said, "Should our master come out to the likes of you?" He said, "Yes." So they informed him of that. He said, "Why did you not do such and such to him?" He knocked on the door a knock stronger than the first. The guards rushed to him. He said, "Inform him that I am the Angel of Death." When they heard him, terror was cast upon them, and humility and awe fell upon their master. He said, "Speak to him gently, and say, 'Do you take anyone?'" He entered upon him and said, "Do with your wealth what you will do, for I shall not leave it until I take your soul." He ordered his wealth to be placed before him. When he saw it, he said, "May God curse you, O wealth! You distracted me from the worship of my Lord and prevented me from devoting myself to my Lord." God gave speech to the wealth, and it said, "Why do you curse me? You used to enter upon rulers through me, and the pious were turned away from their doors. You married luxurious women through me, sat in the gatherings of kings through me, and spent me in the path of evil, and I did not withhold from you. Had you spent me in the path of good, I would have benefited you. You were created, O son of Adam, from dust, so some are set free by righteousness and some by sin." Then the Angel of Death seized his soul, and he fell.

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: The Angel of Death seized the soul of a tyrant among tyrants, the like of whom was not on earth. Then he ascended to heaven. The angels said, "To whom were you more merciful than the one whose soul you just took?" He said, "I was commanded to take the soul of a woman in a wilderness on earth. I came to her and she had just given birth to a child. I had mercy on her for her isolation, and mercy on her child for its smallness and being in a wilderness with no one to care for it." The angels said, "The tyrant whose soul you just took is that very child upon whom you had mercy." The Angel of Death said, "Glory be to the Subtle One in what He wills."

'Atā' ibn Yasar said: When the night of the middle of Sha'ban comes, a scroll is given to the Angel of Death, and it is said, "Take in this year whoever is in this scroll." He said, "Verily, the servant may plant saplings, marry wives, and build buildings, while his name is in that scroll, and he does not know."

Al-Hasan said: There is no day except that the angel of the day inspects every house three times. Whoever he finds among them has received his provision fully and his term has ended, he takes his soul. When he takes his soul, his family comes forward with wailing and weeping. The Angel of Death takes hold of the doorposts and says, "By God, I did not consume his provision, nor did I exhaust his lifespan, nor did I diminish his term. And I shall return to you again and again until I leave none of you." Al-Hasan said, "By God, if they were to see his standing and hear his speech, they would be distracted from their dead and would weep for themselves." And Yazid said...

Al-Raqashi: While a tyrant among the tyrants of the Children of Israel was sitting in his home, secluded with some of his family, he saw a person enter through the door of his house. He sprang toward him in alarm and anger, saying, “Who are you, and who let you into my dwelling?” He replied, “As for the one who let me into the house, it is its Lord. As for me, I am the one who is not barred by any veil, nor do I seek permission from kings, nor do I fear the might of oppressors. No obstinate tyrant nor rebellious devil can keep me away.” The tyrant was struck dumb and trembled until he fell upon his face. Then he raised his head to him, pleading and humbling himself, and said, “Then you are the Angel of Death?” He said, “I am he.” He said, “Will you grant me respite so that I may make a will?” He said, “Far from it! Your term has ended, your breaths have been exhausted, and your hours have run out. There is no way to delay you.” He said, “Then where will you take me?” He said, “To the deeds you have sent ahead and to the home you have prepared.” He said, “But I have not sent ahead any righteous deeds, nor have I prepared a good home.” He said, “Then to the Blazing Fire that strips away the scalp!” Then he seized his soul, and he fell dead among his family, amid cries and weeping. Yazid al-Raqashi said: If they knew the evil of the destination, the wailing over that would be greater.

From al-A‘mash, from Khaythama, who said: The Angel of Death entered upon Solomon, son of David, peace be upon them, and he kept gazing at one of his companions, looking at him persistently. When he left, the man said, “Who is this?” He said, “This is the Angel of Death.” He said, “I saw him looking at me as if he wanted me.” He said, “What do you wish?” He said, “I wish that you would deliver me from him, so command the wind to carry me to the farthest part of India.” The wind did so. Then Solomon said to the Angel of Death after he came to him a second time, “I saw you gazing persistently at one of my companions.” He said, “Yes, I was amazed at him because I had been commanded to seize his soul in the farthest part of India at a near hour, and he was with you, so I was amazed at that.”

(The Fourth Chapter: On the Death of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Rightly Guided Caliphs after him – The Death of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him)

Know that in the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, there is an excellent example, alive and deceased, in his actions, his words, and all his states—a lesson for the observers and an insight for the discerning. For no one was more honored by God than him, since he was the intimate friend of God, His beloved, His confidant, His chosen one, His Messenger, and His Prophet. So consider: was he granted any respite at the expiration of his term? Was he delayed for a moment after the arrival of his appointed time? No, rather the noble angels entrusted with seizing the souls of mankind were sent to him, and they hastened to take his pure, noble soul to transfer it. They struggled to remove it from his immaculate body to mercy, pleasure, and beautiful blessings—indeed, to a seat of truth in the proximity of the Merciful. Yet despite this, his anguish in the throes of death intensified, his groaning became apparent, his distress multiplied, his lament rose, his complexion changed, his brow sweated, and his left and right sides trembled with contraction and expansion, until those present wept for his passing and sobbed at the severity of his state. Have you seen the station of prophethood ward off from him what was decreed? Did the Angel show regard for him due to family or kin? Did he pardon him because he was a supporter of truth and a bearer of glad tidings and warnings to creation? Far from it! Rather, he complied with what he was commanded and followed what he found inscribed on the Preserved Tablet. This was his state, while he, with God, possesses the praiseworthy station and the pond to be drunk from, and he is the first for whom the earth will split open, and he is the possessor of intercession on the Day of Presentation. So it is astonishing that we do not take admonition from him, and we are not confident in what we will meet. Rather, we are captives of desires and companions of sins and misdeeds. Why do we not heed the demise of Muhammad, the master of the messengers, the leader of the God-fearing, the beloved of the Lord of the worlds? Perhaps we imagine that we are immortal, or we suppose that with our evil deeds we are honored by God! Far from it, far from it! Rather, we are certain that we will all enter the Fire, and none will be saved from it except the God-fearing. So we are certain of entering it, yet we imagine being saved from it. No, rather we have wronged ourselves if we, in such a state, are awaiting what is most likely. For by God, we are not among the God-fearing. And God, the Lord of the worlds, has said: “And there is none of you but will come to it. This is, with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished. Then We will save those who feared God, and leave the wrongdoers therein, kneeling.” So let every servant look at his own soul: is he closer to the wrongdoers or to the God-fearing? Look at yourself after you have looked at the conduct of the righteous predecessors, for they, despite what they were granted, were among the fearful. Then look at the master of the messengers, for his affair was one of certainty, since he was the master of the prophets and the guide of the God-fearing. And reflect on how his anguish was at parting from the world and how severe his affair was when turning to the Garden of Abode! Ibn Mas‘ud, may God be pleased with him, said: We entered upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in the house of our mother ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, when the parting drew near. He looked at us, and his eyes, peace and blessings be upon him, filled with tears, then he said: “Welcome to you…”

May God grant you life, shelter you, and grant you victory. I enjoin upon you the fear of God, and God enjoins upon you concerning me. Verily, I am to you from Him a clear warner: that you do not exalt yourselves above God in His lands and over His servants. The appointed time has drawn near, and the return is to God, and to the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary, and to the Garden of Refuge, and to the fullest cup. So convey upon yourselves, and upon those who enter your religion after me, peace from me and the mercy of God.

And it is narrated that he, peace be upon him, said to Gabriel, upon him be peace, at the time of his death: "Who will be for my community after me?" So God, Exalted is He, revealed to Gabriel: "Give glad tidings to My Beloved that I will not forsake him concerning his community. And give him glad tidings that he is the swiftest of people to emerge from the earth when they are resurrected, and their master when they are gathered, and that Paradise is forbidden to the nations until his community enters it." He said: "Now my eye is comforted."

And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded us to wash him with seven waterskins from seven wells. We did that, and he found relief. He went out and led the people in prayer, sought forgiveness for the people of Uhud and supplicated for them. And he enjoined concerning the Ansar, saying: 'Now then, O company of the Emigrants, you will increase, while the Ansar have become such that they will not increase beyond what they are today. Verily, the Ansar are my trusted shelter to which I resorted. So honor their honorable ones—meaning their doers of good—and overlook their wrongdoers.' Then he said: 'A servant was given the choice between this world and what is with God, and he chose what is with God.' Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, wept, thinking he meant himself. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'Gently, O Abu Bakr. Block these streets leading to the mosque except the door of Abu Bakr, for I know of no one more excellent to me in companionship than Abu Bakr.'"

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "He, peace be upon him, passed away in my house, on my day, between my chest and my throat, and God joined my saliva with his at the time of death. My brother Abd al-Rahman entered, and in his hand was a toothstick. He began to look at it, and I knew he desired it. I said to him: 'Shall I take it for you?' He indicated with his head, 'Yes.' I gave it to him, and he placed it in his mouth, but it was too hard for him. I said: 'Shall I soften it for you?' He indicated with his head, 'Yes.' So I softened it. There was a water vessel before him. He would dip his hand in it and say: 'There is no god but God. Indeed, death has its agonies.' Then he raised his hand, saying: 'The Highest Companion, the Highest Companion.' I said: 'Then, by God, he will not choose us.'"

And Sa'id ibn Abdullah narrated from his father, who said: "When the Ansar saw that the Prophet, peace be upon him, was growing increasingly weak, they gathered around the mosque. Al-Abbas, may God be pleased with him, entered upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and informed him of their presence and their concern. Then al-Fadl entered upon him and informed him of the same. Then Ali, may God be pleased with him, entered upon him and informed him likewise. He extended his hand and said: 'Here,' so they took hold of him. He said: 'What do you say?' They said: 'We say we fear you may die, and their women will wail due to the gathering of their men with the Prophet, peace be upon him.' The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, arose and went out, leaning on Ali and al-Fadl, with al-Abbas before him. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had his head wrapped, dragging his feet until he sat on the lowest step of the pulpit. The people gathered to him. He praised God and extolled Him, then said: 'O people, it has reached me that you fear death, as if you find the death of your Prophet strange. What do you find strange about the death of your Prophet? Did I not convey to you, and were your own souls not conveyed to you? Did any prophet before me remain forever among the people to whom he was sent, so that I should remain forever among you? Verily, I am going to my Lord, and you are going to Him. I enjoin you to treat the first Emigrants well, and I enjoin the Emigrants concerning their relations among themselves, for God, Mighty and Majestic, has said: "By time, indeed mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed..." to its end. Matters proceed by God's permission, so let not the delay of a matter lead you to hasten it, for God, Mighty and Majestic, is not hastened by anyone's haste. Whoever contends with God, He will overcome him; whoever tries to deceive God, He will deceive him. "Then is it to be expected of you, if you turn away, that you will cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of] kinship?" I enjoin you to treat the Ansar well, for they are the ones who settled the Home and [embraced] faith before you, that you be good to them. Did they not share their fruits with you? Did they not make room for you in their dwellings? Did they not prefer you over themselves, even while in need? Verily, whoever is appointed to judge between two men, let him accept from their doers of good and overlook their wrongdoers. Do not withhold from them. Verily, I am your forerunner, and you will come to me. Verily, your appointed place is the Pool—my Pool—wider than the distance between Busra in Syria and Sana'a in Yemen. The spout of al-Kawthar pours into it. Its water is whiter than milk, softer than foam, and sweeter than honey. Whoever drinks from it will never thirst again. Its pebbles are pearls, and its soil is musk. Whoever is deprived of it on the Day of Standing is deprived of all good. So whoever loves to meet me at it tomorrow, let him restrain his tongue and his hand from all but what is right.' Al-Abbas said: 'O Prophet of God, enjoin concerning Quraysh.' He said: 'I only enjoin this matter to Quraysh, and the people follow Quraysh: their righteous for their righteous, and their wicked for their wicked. So enjoin the family of Quraysh to treat the people well. O people, sins change blessings.'"

And the condition changes, so when people are righteous, their leaders are righteous, and when people are corrupt, their intellects are corrupted. God Almighty says: "Thus do We make the wrongdoers allies of one another for what they have earned." (6:129) And Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him: "Ask, O Abu Bakr." He said: "O Messenger of God, the appointed time has drawn near." He said: "Indeed, the appointed time has drawn near and is descending." He said: "May what is with God delight you, O Prophet of God! I wonder about our return." He said: "To God, and to the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary, then to the Garden of Refuge and the Highest Paradise, and the fullest cup, and the Highest Companion, and the share and the pleasant life." He said: "O Prophet of God, who will wash you?" He said: "Men from my closest family, then the next closest." He said: "In what shall we shroud you?" He said: "In these garments of mine, and in a Yemeni garment, and in the white cloth of Egypt." He said: "How shall we pray over you, while we weep?" And he wept. Then he said: "Gently, may God forgive you and reward you well on behalf of your Prophet. When you have washed me and shrouded me, place me on my bed in this house of mine, at the edge of my grave. Then withdraw from me for a while, for the first to pray over me will be God, Mighty and Majestic, 'It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels.' (33:43) Then He will grant the angels permission to pray over me. So the first of God's creation to enter upon me and pray over me will be Gabriel, then Michael, then Israfil, then the Angel of Death with many troops, then all the angels together, may God's blessings be upon them all. Then you, enter upon me in groups and pray over me in groups, company by company, and give salutations of peace, and do not harm me with loud praise, or outcry, or wailing. Let the Imam and my closest family, then the next closest, begin among you, then groups of women, then groups of children." He said: "Who will place you in the grave?" He said: "A company from my closest family, then the next closest, along with many angels whom you will not see, but they will see you. Rise and convey from me to those after me."

And Abdullah ibn Zam'ah said: "Bilal came at the beginning of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal and gave the call to prayer. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' I went out and saw no one at the door except Umar among men, and Abu Bakr was not among them. I said: 'Stand, O Umar, and lead the people in prayer.' Umar stood, and when he said the takbir—and he was a man with a loud voice—the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, heard his voice with the takbir and said: 'Where is Abu Bakr? God refuses that, and so do the Muslims.' He said it three times: 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: 'O Messenger of God, Abu Bakr is a man of tender heart; when he stands in your place, weeping overcomes him.' He said: 'You are like the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' He said: So Abu Bakr led the prayer after the prayer that Umar had led. And Umar would later say to Abdullah ibn Zam'ah: 'Woe to you, what have you done to me? By God, had I not thought that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded you, I would not have done it.' And Abdullah would say: 'I saw no one more deserving of that than you.' Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: 'I did not say that, nor divert it from Abu Bakr, except out of desire for him to turn away from this world, and because of the peril and destruction in leadership except for whom God protects. I also feared that people might not love a man who led prayer in the place of the Prophet, peace be upon him, while he was still alive, unless God wills, and they would envy him, bear malice against him, and consider him an ill omen. So indeed, the command is God's command, and the decree is His decree, and God protected him from everything I feared for him in matters of this world and religion.'"

And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "When the day came on which the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, died, they saw lightness in him at the beginning of the day, so the men dispersed to their homes and their needs, rejoicing, and they left the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, with the women. While we were in that state—not in our usual state of hope and joy before that—the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'Let everyone leave me; this angel seeks permission to enter upon me.' Everyone in the house left except me, and his head was in my lap. He sat up, and I withdrew to a corner of the house. The angel conversed with him at length. Then he called me and placed his head back in my lap and said to the women: 'Enter.' I said: 'This is not the presence of Gabriel, peace be upon him.' The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'Yes, O Aisha, this is the Angel of Death. He came to me and said: "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, has sent me and commanded me not to enter upon you except with your permission. If you do not permit me, I will return, and if you permit me, I will enter. And He commanded me not to take your soul until you command me." So what do you command?' I said: 'Hold back from me until Gabriel, peace be upon him, comes to me, for this is the hour of Gabriel.'" Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "We were faced with a matter for which we had no answer or opinion, and we were stunned, as if struck by a deafening blow; we could not think of anything, and no one in the household spoke out of reverence for that matter and an awe that filled our hearts." She said: "Gabriel came at his hour and gave salutations. I recognized his presence, and the household left. He entered and said: 'Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, conveys His greetings to you and says: "How do you find yourself?"—and He knows best what you are experiencing—but He wished to increase you in honor and nobility.'"

And that your honor and nobility over creation be perfected, and that it become a sunnah for your community. He said, "I feel pain." He said, "Rejoice, for Allah the Exalted intends to grant you what He has prepared for you." He said, "O Gabriel, the Angel of Death has sought permission to enter upon me," and he informed him of the matter. Gabriel said, "O Muhammad, your Lord longs for you. Did He not inform you of what He intends for you? No, by Allah the Exalted, the Angel of Death has never sought permission to enter upon anyone, nor will he ever seek permission, except that your Lord is perfecting your nobility and He longs for you." He said, "Then do not leave until he comes." And he gave permission for the women. He said, "O Fatimah, come near." So she leaned over him, and he whispered to her. She raised her head, her eyes weeping, unable to speak. Then he said, "Bring your head near to me." So she leaned over him, and he whispered to her. She raised her head, laughing, unable to speak. What we saw from her was astonishing. I asked her about it afterward, and she said, "He informed me and said, 'I will die today,' so I wept. Then he said, 'I supplicated to Allah to join you with me as the first of my family and to place you with me,' so I laughed." And she brought her two sons near to him, and he smelled them. She said, "And the Angel of Death came and sought permission, and permission was granted to him. The angel said, 'What do you command us, O Muhammad?' He said, 'Join me with my Lord now.' He said, 'Yes, from this day of yours. Indeed, your Lord longs for you. He has not hesitated over anyone as He hesitated over you, nor has He forbidden me from entering upon anyone without permission except you. But your hour is before you.' And he left." She said, "And Gabriel came and said, 'Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah. This is the last of what is revealed to me on earth forever. Revelation is rolled up, and the world is rolled up. I have no need on earth except you, and I have no need therein except your presence, then adhering to my station.' No, by the One who sent Muhammad with the truth, there was no one in the house able to utter a word to him in that, nor could anyone be sent to any of his men due to the greatness of what they heard from his speech and what we found and our apprehension." She said, "I went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) until I placed his head between my breasts and held his chest. He began to lose consciousness until it overcame him, and his forehead exuded a sweat I have never seen from any human. I began to wipe that sweat, and I never found the scent of anything more pleasant than it. I would say to him when he regained consciousness, 'May my father and mother, my soul and my family be sacrificed for you, what is this sweat on your forehead?' He said, 'O Aisha, the soul of the believer exits with sweat, and the soul of the disbeliever exits from his jaws like the braying of a donkey.' At that, we were alarmed and sent for our families. The first man to come to us, and my brother did not witness it, he sent to my father. And the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died before anyone came. Indeed, Allah only kept them away from him because He entrusted him to Gabriel and Michael." And when he would lose consciousness, he would say, "Rather, the Highest Companion," as if the choice were presented to him. And when he was able to speak, he said, "The prayer, the prayer. You will remain united as long as you pray together. The prayer, the prayer." He kept enjoining it until he died, saying, "The prayer, the prayer." Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died between the rising of the forenoon and midday on Monday." Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "What I have encountered from Monday! By Allah, the community will continue to be afflicted in it by a great calamity." And Umm Kulthum said on the day Ali (may Allah honor his face) was struck in Kufa, like her, "What I have encountered from Monday! The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died on it, and on it Ali (may Allah honor him) was killed, and on it my father was killed. What I have encountered from Monday!" And Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died, the people rushed in when the wailing rose, and the angels shrouded the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with a garment. They differed: some denied his death, some were struck dumb and did not speak except after a long time, others were confused and mixed speech without clarity, and others remained with their intellects intact, and others sat down. Umar ibn al-Khattab was among those who denied his death, Ali was among those who sat down, and Uthman was among those struck dumb. Umar went out to the people and said, 'The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) has not died. Allah Almighty will return him, and He will cut off the hands and feet of men among the hypocrites who wish death for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Allah Almighty only promised him as He promised Moses, and He is coming to you.'" In another narration, he said, "O people, restrain your tongues regarding the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), for he has not died. By Allah, I will not hear anyone mention that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) has died except that I strike him with this sword of mine." As for Ali, he sat down and did not leave the house. As for Uthman, he began not to speak to anyone; he would be taken by the hand, brought and taken away. And no one among the Muslims was in a state like Abu Bakr and al-Abbas, for Allah Almighty supported them with success and correctness. And the people did not come to their senses except by the words of Abu Bakr, until al-Abbas came and said, "By Allah, besides whom there is no god, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) has indeed tasted death, and he said while among you, 'Indeed, you are to die, and indeed they are to die. Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute.'" And the news reached Abu Bakr while he was with the Banu al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj, so he came and entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).

He looked upon him, then leaned over and kissed him, saying, "May my father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of God! God Almighty would not make you taste death twice. By God, the Messenger of God has indeed passed away." Then he went out to the people and said, "O people! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad has died. But whoever worships the Lord of Muhammad, He is Ever-Living and does not die." God Almighty says: "Muhammad is but a messenger; messengers have passed away before him. If he were to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels?" It was as if the people had never heard this verse until that day.

In another narration: When Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, received the news, he entered the house of the Messenger of God while he was laid out, and his eyes overflowed, his sobs rising like the bubbling of a water-skin. Yet in that state, he was firm in action and speech. He leaned over him, uncovered his face, kissed his forehead and cheeks, wiped his face, and wept, saying, "May my father and mother, my soul, and my family be your ransom! You were pure in life and in death. What was severed by your death was not severed by the death of any other prophet. Prophethood is too immense to be described, too majestic for weeping. You were singled out until you became a consolation, and made universal until we became equal in you. Had your death not been by your own choice, we would have expended our very souls in grief for you. Had you not forbidden weeping, we would have poured forth our tears upon you. As for what we cannot dispel from ourselves—sorrow and remembrance are two companions that do not depart. O God, convey to him from us: Remember us, O Muhammad, before your Lord, and keep us in your thoughts. Were it not for the tranquility you left behind, no one could have endured the desolation you left. O God, convey to Your Prophet from us, and preserve him among us."

From Ibn 'Umar: When Abu Bakr entered the house, prayed, and praised, the household wailed loudly, a lament heard by those in the prayer area. Whenever he mentioned something, they increased in weeping. Their wailing did not cease until a man at the door, with a strong, clear voice, gave salutations, saying, "Peace be upon you, O people of the house. 'Every soul will taste death.' In God is a successor to everyone, a fulfillment for every desire, and salvation from every fear. So place your hope in God Almighty, trust in Him, listen to Him, and reject this, and cease weeping." When the weeping stopped, his voice faded. One of them looked out but saw no one. Then they returned to weeping. Another caller, whose voice they did not recognize, called to them, "O people of the house, remember God Almighty and praise Him in every state, that you may be among the sincere. In God is solace for every affliction and compensation for every loss. So obey God and act by His command." Abu Bakr said, "This was Al-Khidr and Al-Yasa', peace be upon them, attending the Prophet."

Al-Qa'qa' ibn 'Amr fully recounted the account of Abu Bakr's sermon: Abu Bakr stood to address the people after they had spent their tears in a sermon that was largely prayers upon the Prophet. He praised God and extolled Him in every circumstance, saying, "I bear witness that there is no god but God alone. He fulfilled His promise, aided His servant, and alone defeated the confederates. Praise belongs to God alone. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, the seal of His prophets. I bear witness that the Book is as He legislated, the religion as He established, the narration as he related, and the word as he spoke, and that God is the Manifest Truth. O God, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant, Messenger, Prophet, beloved, trusted one, chosen one, and elect, with the best blessings You have sent upon any of Your creation. O God, make Your blessings, Your pardon, and Your mercy upon the master of messengers, the seal of prophets, the imam of the God-fearing, Muhammad, the leader of good, the imam of good, the messenger of mercy. O God, bring near his intercession, magnify his proof, honor his station, and resurrect him to a praiseworthy station envied by the first and the last. Benefit us by his praiseworthy station on the Day of Resurrection, and appoint him as our successor in this world and the next. Grant him the highest rank and the means of nearness in Paradise. O God, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and bestow favor upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You blessed and bestowed favor upon Abraham. Indeed, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious.

O people, whoever worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad has died. But whoever worships God, God is Ever-Living and does not die. God has presented to you His decree, so do not abandon it in panic. For God Almighty chose for His Prophet what is with Him over what is with you, and took him to His reward, leaving among you His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet. Whoever takes hold of them will know, and whoever separates between them will be led astray. 'O you who believe, be upholders of justice.' Let not Satan distract you with the death of your Prophet, nor tempt you away from your religion. Confront Satan with good and you will overcome him; do not grant him respite, lest he overtake you and tempt you."

Ibn 'Abbas said: When Abu Bakr finished his sermon, he said, "O 'Umar, I was told that you said, 'The Prophet of God has not died.' Do you not see that the Prophet of God said on such-and-such day such-and-such, and on such-and-such day such-and-such? And God says in His Book: 'Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die.'" He replied, "By God, it is as if I had never heard it in the Book of God until now, when this befell us. I bear witness that..."

The Book as it was revealed, and the Hadith as it was narrated, and that God is Ever-Living, He does not die. "Indeed, to God we belong and to Him we shall return." And may the blessings of God be upon His Messenger, and with God we place our trust in His Messenger. Then he sat with Abu Bakr.

And 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said: When they gathered to wash him, they said, "By God, we do not know how to wash the Messenger of God. Should we remove his garments as we do with our dead, or wash him in his garments?" She said: Then God sent sleep upon them until there remained not a man among them except that his chin was upon his chest, sleeping. Then a speaker, whom none knew, said, "Wash the Messenger of God in his garments." They awoke and did so, washing the Messenger of God in his shirt. When they finished washing him, they shrouded him. And 'Ali, may God honor his face, said, "We intended to remove his shirt, but we were called to, 'Do not remove the garments from the Messenger of God.' So we left it and washed him in his shirt as we wash our dead, lying on his back. We did not wish to turn any limb of his for us except that it was turned for us without any force until we finished with him. And indeed, with us in the house was a rustling like a gentle wind, and a voice called to us, 'Be gentle with the Messenger of God, for you will soon shroud him.'" Thus was the passing of the Messenger of God, and he left neither a coarse mat nor a felt mat except that it was buried with him. Abu Ja'far said: His grave was spread with his bedding and his woolen blanket, and his garments which he wore while awake were spread upon the woolen blanket and bedding. Then he was placed upon them in his shrouds. He left behind no wealth after his passing, nor did he, during his life, build brick upon brick or place reed upon reed. In his passing is a complete lesson, and for the Muslims in him is an excellent example.

(On the passing of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him)
When Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, was nearing death, 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, came and recited this verse:
"By your life, wealth does not avail a young man, when the death rattle comes one day and the chest is constricted by it."
He uncovered his face and said, "Not like that, but say: 'And the stupor of death comes with the truth; that is what you were avoiding.' Look at these two garments of mine; wash them and shroud me in them, for the living have more need of new garments than the dead." And 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said at the time of his death:
"And a fair-faced one by whose countenance the clouds are besought for rain, the springtime of orphans, a protection for widows."
Abu Bakr said, "That is the Messenger of God." They entered upon him and said, "Shall we not call a physician to examine you?" He said, "He has already examined me, my Physician, and said, 'Indeed, I do what I will.'" And Salman al-Farsi, may God be pleased with him, entered upon him to visit him and said, "O Abu Bakr, counsel us." He said, "Indeed, God is opening the world to you, so take from it only what suffices you. And know that whoever prays the dawn prayer is under the protection of God, so do not betray God in His protection, lest He cast you into the Fire on your face." And when Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, became gravely ill and the people wanted him to appoint a successor, he appointed 'Umar, may God be pleased with him. The people said to him, "You have appointed over us a harsh and severe man. What will you say to your Lord?" He said, "I will say, 'I appointed the best of Your creation over Your creation.'" Then he sent for 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, and he came. He said, "I counsel you with a counsel. Know that God has a right in the daytime which He does not accept in the night, and a right in the night which He does not accept in the daytime, and He does not accept supererogatory acts until the obligatory acts are fulfilled. Indeed, the scales of those whose scales are heavy on the Day of Resurrection are heavy only because they followed the truth in the world and it was heavy upon them. And it is fitting for a scale in which nothing but the truth is placed to be heavy. Indeed, the scales of those whose scales are light on the Day of Resurrection are light only because they followed falsehood and it was light upon them. And it is fitting for a scale in which nothing but falsehood is placed to be light. And God mentions the people of Paradise by their best deeds and overlooks their evil deeds. So a person will say, 'I am less than these, and I do not reach the station of the righteous deeds they performed.' And another will say, 'I am better than these.' And God mentions the verse of mercy and the verse of punishment so that the believer may be desirous and fearful, and not cast himself with his own hands into destruction, nor wish upon God other than the truth. If you preserve this counsel of mine, then let no absent thing be more beloved to you than death, for you must meet it. And if you neglect my counsel, then let no absent thing be more hateful to you than death, for you must meet it, and you cannot escape it."

And Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: When Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, was nearing death, a group of the Companions came to him and said, "O Successor of the Messenger of God, provide us provision, for we see what is with you." Abu Bakr said, "Whoever says these words and then dies, God will place his soul in the Clear Horizon." They said, "And what is the Clear Horizon?" He said, "A plain before the Throne, in which are the gardens, rivers, and trees of God, visited every day by a hundred mercies. So whoever says this statement, God will place his soul in this place: 'O God, You originated creation without any need of them from You. Then You made them two parties: a party for bliss and a party for the Blaze. So make me...'"

For bliss, and do not make me for the Blaze. O Allah, You created creation in divisions and distinguished them before You created them, making among them the wretched and the fortunate, the misguided and the rightly guided, so do not make me wretched through disobedience to You. O Allah, You knew what every soul would earn before You created it, and there is no escape for it from what You foreknew, so make me among those whom You employ in Your obedience. O Allah, none wills until You will, so make Your will that I will what brings me nearer to You. O Allah, You have decreed the movements of Your servants, and nothing moves except by Your leave, so make my movements in reverence of You. O Allah, You created good and evil and appointed for each a worker to perform it, so make me from the better of the two divisions. O Allah, You created Paradise and the Fire and appointed for each its inhabitants, so make me among the dwellers of Your Paradise. O Allah, You willed misguidance for a people and constricted their hearts with it, so expand my heart for faith and adorn it within my heart. O Allah, You manage all affairs and have made their final end to You, so grant me life after death a goodly life and draw me near to You in closeness. O Allah, whoever begins his morning and evening with his trust and hope in other than You—You are my trust and my hope, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah. Abu Bakr said: All of this is in the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic.

(The Passing of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him)
'Amr ibn Maymun said: I was standing on the morning 'Umar was struck, with none between him and me except 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas. When he would pass between the rows, he would stand between them, and if he saw a gap he would say, "Straighten the rows," until he saw no gap. Then he would not proceed forward until he said the Takbir. He said: Sometimes he would recite Surah Yusuf or Surah an-Nahl or the like in the first Rak'ah until the people gathered. It was only when he said the Takbir that I heard him say, "The dog has killed me—or eaten me," when Abu Lu'lu'ah stabbed him. The non-Arab man dashed with a double-edged dagger, stabbing anyone to his right or left until he had stabbed thirteen men, of whom nine died—in one narration, seven. When a Muslim man saw this, he threw a cloak over him. When the non-Arab man thought he was captured, he slit his own throat. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, took hold of 'Abdur-Rahman ibn 'Awf and placed him forward. As for those near 'Umar, they saw what I saw, but those in other parts of the mosque did not know what had happened; they only missed 'Umar's voice and were saying, "Subhanallah, Subhanallah." 'Abdur-Rahman led them in a brief prayer. When they finished, he said, "O Ibn 'Abbas, see who has struck me." He went away for a while and then returned and said, "The slave of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah." 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "May Allah fight him! I had indeed enjoined good treatment upon him." Then he said, "Praise be to Allah who did not make my death at the hand of a man who professes Islam. You and your father used to desire that non-Arabs increase in al-Madinah, and al-'Abbas had the most slaves among them." Ibn 'Abbas said, "If you wish, I will do it," meaning, "If you wish, I will kill them." He said, "After they have spoken your language, prayed toward your Qiblah, and performed your Hajj?" He was carried to his house, and we went with him. He said: It was as if the people had not been struck by a calamity before that day. Some were saying, "I fear for him," and others saying, "It is nothing." He was brought some Nabidh (a drink) and drank it, but it came out from his wound. Then he was brought milk and drank it, and it came out from his wound, so they knew he would die. He said: We entered upon him, and people came praising him. A young man came and said, "Receive glad tidings, O Commander of the Faithful, of good news from Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic. You had companionship with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and precedence in Islam as is known. Then you assumed leadership and were just. Then, martyrdom." He said, "I wish that would be just sufficient, neither against me nor for me." When the man turned to leave, his lower garment was touching the ground. He said, "Bring the young man back to me." He said, "O my nephew, raise your garment, for it is cleaner for your garment and more pious toward your Lord." Then he said, "O 'Abdullah, see what debt is upon me." They calculated it and found it to be about eighty-six thousand. He said, "If the wealth of the family of 'Umar suffices, then repay it from their wealth. If not, then ask among Banu 'Adi ibn Ka'b. If their wealth does not suffice, then ask among Quraysh, and do not go beyond them. Repay this debt on my behalf. Go to the Mother of the Believers, 'Aishah, and say, ''Umar sends you greetings of peace,' and do not say 'the Commander of the Faithful,' for I am not today the commander of the believers. Say, 'He asks permission for 'Umar ibn al-Khattab to be buried with his two companions.'" 'Abdullah went, gave greetings, sought permission, and entered upon her. He found her sitting and weeping. He said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab sends you greetings of peace and asks permission to be buried with his two companions." She said, "I had desired it for myself, but I would prefer him over myself today." When he returned, it was said, "Here is 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar coming." He said, "Lift me up." A man supported him against himself. He said, "What news do you have?" He said, "What you love, O Commander of the Faithful. She has given permission." He said, "Praise be to Allah. Nothing was more important to me than that. When I am taken, carry me, then give greetings and say, ''Umar seeks permission.' If she permits me, then enter me. If she turns me back, then return me to the graveyard of the Muslims." And Umm al-Mu'minin Hafṣah came...

The women were covering her, and when we saw her, we rose, and she entered upon him. She remained with him for a while, then the men sought permission and entered inside. We heard her weeping from within, and they said, "Offer your testament, O Commander of the Faithful, and appoint a successor." He said, "I do not see anyone more deserving of this matter than these men, with whom the Messenger of God ﷺ was pleased at the time of his passing." He named Ali, Uthman, al-Zubayr, Talha, Sa'd, and Abd al-Rahman, and said, "Let Abdullah ibn Umar bear witness among you, though he has no share in the command, as a form of consolation for him. If leadership falls to Sa'd, then so be it; otherwise, let whichever of you is appointed seek his aid, for I have not exempted him due to incapacity or betrayal." And he said, "I enjoin the Caliph after me to treat the early Emigrants well, to acknowledge their merit and preserve their sanctity. I enjoin him to treat the Ansar well—those who settled the abode and faith before them—to accept from their doers of good and pardon their wrongdoers. I enjoin him to treat the people of the garrison towns well, for they are the support of Islam, the collectors of wealth, and the vexation of the enemy, and that he take from them only their surplus willingly. I enjoin him to treat the Bedouins well, for they are the root of the Arabs and the substance of Islam, and that he take from the fringes of their wealth and return it to their poor. I enjoin him by the covenant of God Almighty and the covenant of His Messenger ﷺ to fulfill their pact, to fight on their behalf from behind them, and not to burden them beyond their capacity." He said: When he passed away, we carried him out and proceeded walking. Abdullah ibn Umar gave salutations and sought permission for Umar ibn al-Khattab. She said, "Admit him," and he was admitted to a place there with his two companions.

The Hadith: From the Prophet ﷺ, he said: "Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to me: 'Let Islam weep for the death of Umar.'" And from Ibn Abbas, he said: Umar was placed on his bed, and people surrounded him supplicating and praying before he was raised, and I was among them. Suddenly, I felt a man take me by my shoulder, and I turned to find Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him. He invoked mercy upon Umar and said, "I have left no one whose deeds I would more love to meet God with than yours. By God, I indeed used to think that God would place you with your two companions, for I often heard the Prophet ﷺ say: 'I and Abu Bakr and Umar went; I and Abu Bakr and Umar went out; I and Abu Bakr and Umar entered.' Thus, I hoped—indeed, I thought—that God would place you with them."

(The Passing of Uthman, may God be pleased with him)
The Hadith concerning his killing is well-known. Abdullah ibn Salam said: I came to my brother Uthman to greet him while he was under siege. I entered upon him, and he said, "Welcome, my brother. I saw the Messenger of God ﷺ tonight at this small window—a window in the house." He said, "O Uthman, have they besieged you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Have they made you thirsty?" I said, "Yes." Then he lowered to me a bucket containing water, and I drank until I was quenched, to the point that I still feel its coolness between my chest and my shoulders. And he said to me, "If you wish, I will grant you victory over them, and if you wish, you may break your fast with us." I chose to break my fast with him, and he was killed that day, may God be pleased with him. And Abdullah ibn Salam said to those present while Uthman was struggling in death when wounded, "What did Uthman say as he struggled?" They said, "We heard him say: 'O God, unite the community of Muhammad ﷺ' three times." He said, "By the One in whose hand is my soul, had he prayed to God that they never unite, they would not have united until the Day of Resurrection." And from Thamama ibn Hazn al-Qushayri, he said: I witnessed the house when Uthman, may God be pleased with him, appeared to them and said, "Bring me your two companions who incited you." He said: They were brought as if they were two lambs or two donkeys. Uthman, may God be pleased with him, appeared to them and said, "I adjure you by God and Islam, do you not know that when the Messenger of God ﷺ arrived in Medina, there was no sweet water to drink except the well of Rumah? He said, 'Whoever buys Rumah and places his bucket with the buckets of the Muslims will have better than it in Paradise,' so I bought it with my own wealth. And today you prevent me from drinking from it, even from the water of the sea?" They said, "O God, yes." He said, "I adjure you by God and Islam, do you not know that I equipped the army of hardship from my wealth?" They said, "Yes." He said, "I adjure you by God and Islam, do you not know that the mosque became too narrow for its people, and the Messenger of God ﷺ said, 'Whoever buys the plot of so-and-so to add it to the mosque will have better than it in Paradise,' so I bought it with my own wealth. And today you prevent me from praying two rak'ahs in it?" They said, "O God, yes." He said, "I adjure you by God and Islam, do you not know that the Messenger of God ﷺ was upon Thabir in Mecca, with Abu Bakr, Umar, and I, and the mountain shook until its stones fell into the valley? He struck it with his foot and said, 'Be still, O Thabir, for upon you are only a Prophet, a truthful one, and two martyrs.'" They said, "O God, yes." He said, "God is greatest! They have borne witness for me, and by the Lord of the Kaaba, I am a martyr." And it is narrated from a shaykh of the tribe of Dabba that when Uthman was struck and blood flowed upon his beard, he kept saying, "There is no god but You, glory be to You, indeed I have been among the wrongdoers. O God, I seek Your aid against them, and I seek Your help in all my affairs, and I ask You for patience with what You have tested me."

(The Passing of Ali, may God honor his countenance)
Al-Asbagh al-Hanzali said: On the night in which Ali, may God honor his countenance, was struck down, Ibn al-Tiyyah came to him at the break of dawn to call him to prayer. He found him lying down, sluggish. He returned a second time and found him the same. Then he returned a third time, and Ali rose, walking while saying:
      "Gird your loins for death, for death shall come to you.
      And do not be dismayed by death when it descends upon your valley."
When he reached the small door, Ibn Muljam assailed him and struck him. Umm Kulthum, the daughter of Ali, may God be pleased with him and her, came out and began to say, "What is the dawn prayer to me now? The dawn prayer has killed my husband, the Commander of the Faithful! The dawn prayer has killed my father!" And from a shaykh of Quraysh: When Ali, may God honor his countenance, was struck by Ibn Muljam, he said, "I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka'ba!" And from Muhammad ibn Ali: When he was struck, he instructed his sons, then spoke nothing but 'There is no god but God' until he passed away. And when al-Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them both, grew gravely ill, al-Husayn, may God be pleased with him, entered upon him and said, "O my brother, why are you dismayed? You are going forward to meet the Messenger of God ﷺ and Ali ibn Abi Talib, and they are your two fathers; and to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid and Fatimah bint Muhammad, and they are your two mothers; and to Hamzah and Ja'far, and they are your two uncles." He said, "O my brother, I am going forward to a matter the like of which I have never gone forward to before." And from Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, may God be pleased with them both, who said: When the people descended upon al-Husayn, may God be pleased with him, and he became certain they would kill him, he stood among his companions and delivered a sermon. He praised God and extolled Him, then said, "That which you see has now come to pass. The world has changed and become alien, its good has turned its back and shriveled away until nothing remains of it but like the dregs in a vessel. Is not an existence like blighted pasture enough for me? Do you not see that right is not acted upon and wrong is not refrained from? So let the believer yearn for the meeting with God, the Exalted. I see death as nothing but felicity, and life with the wrongdoers as nothing but sin."

       (Chapter Five: On the Words of the Dying among the Caliphs, Commanders, and the Righteous)
When the death of Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan approached, he said, "Sit me up." They sat him up, and he began to glorify God, the Exalted, and remember Him. Then he wept and said, "Remember your Lord, O Mu'awiyah, after old age and decline? Would that this were so, and the branch of youth fresh and succulent!" And he wept until his weeping grew loud, and said, "O Lord, have mercy on the sinful old man with the hard heart. O God, pardon the stumble, forgive the slip, and treat with Your forbearance one who hopes in none but You and trusts in no one besides You." It is narrated from a shaykh of Quraysh that he entered upon him with a group during his illness, and they saw wrinkles upon his skin. He praised God and extolled Him, then said, "As for what follows: Is the entire world anything but what we have experienced and seen? By God, we faced its bloom with our earnestness and our delight in our living, but the world did not tarry long before it stripped that from us, state after state, bond after bond, until the world rose having betrayed us, failed us, and become hostile to us. Fie upon the world as an abode! Then fie upon it as an abode!" And it is narrated that the last sermon Mu'awiyah delivered, he said: "O people, I am from a crop that has fully ripened. I have governed you, and none shall govern you after me except one worse than me, just as those before me were better than me. And O Yazid, when my term is fulfilled, appoint a discerning man to wash me, for the discerning one is held in a place by God. So let him wash me thoroughly and raise his voice with the takbir. Then proceed to a kerchief in the chest containing a garment from the garments of the Prophet ﷺ and a clipping from his hair and nails. Place the clipping in my nose, my mouth, my ears, and my eyes, and place the garment upon my skin beneath my shrouds. And O Yazid, keep God's injunction regarding parents. When you enfold me in my new cloth and place me in my grave, leave Mu'awiyah to the Most Merciful of the merciful." And Muhammad ibn 'Uqbah said: When death descended upon Mu'awiyah, he said, "Would that I were a man from Quraysh in Dhu Tawa, and that I had never been involved in this affair at all."
When the death of 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan approached, he looked at a washerman beside Damascus wringing a garment with his hand and then striking it against the washing stone. 'Abd al-Malik said, "Would that I were a washerman, eating from the labor of my hands day by day, and had never been involved in the affairs of the world at all." This reached Abu Hazim, who said, "Praise be to God, who makes them, when death approaches them, wish for what we are in; and when death approaches us, we do not wish for what they are in." 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was asked during the illness from which he died, "How do you find yourself, O Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "I find myself as God, the Exalted, has said: 'And you have certainly come to Us alone as We created you the first time, and you have left what We bestowed upon you behind your backs...' (Quran 6:94)" and he died. And Fatimah bint 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the wife of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, said: I used to hear 'Umar during the illness from which he died saying, "O God, make my death easy for them, even for an hour of the day." On the day he was taken, I left his presence and sat down.

In another chamber between us with a door, he being in his dome, I heard him say: "That abode of the Hereafter We assign to those who seek not exaltation in the earth nor corruption, and the outcome is for the righteous." Then he fell silent. I ceased to hear any movement or speech, so I said to his attendant, "See if he is asleep." When he entered, he cried out, and I rushed in to find him deceased. It was said to him as death approached, "Leave a testament, O Commander of the Faithful." He said, "I warn you against a demise like this one, for it is inevitable for you." It is related that when 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz became gravely ill, a physician was summoned for him. When the physician examined him, he said, "I see the man has been given poison, and I fear death for him." 'Umar raised his gaze and said, "And do you not also fear death for one who has not been given poison?" The physician said, "Did you sense this, O Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "Yes, I knew it when it entered my belly." He said, "Then seek treatment, O Commander of the Faithful, for I fear your soul will depart." He said, "My Lord is the best destination. By God, if I knew my cure lay in the lobe of my ear, I would not raise my hand to my ear to take it. O God, choose for 'Umar in meeting You." He lingered but a few days until he died. It was said that when his death approached, he wept. He was asked, "What makes you weep, O Commander of the Faithful? Rejoice, for God has revived through you traditions and manifested through you justice." He wept and then said, "Will I not be made to stand and questioned concerning the affairs of this creation? By God, even if I were just among them, I would fear for my soul that it would not fulfill its argument before God, unless God prompts its argument. So what of the many things we have neglected?" His eyes overflowed, and he lingered but a short while until he died. When the time of his death drew near, he said, "Sit me up." They sat him up, and he said, "I am the one You commanded, yet I fell short; You forbade me, yet I disobeyed," three times. Then he said, "But there is no god but God." Then he raised his head, fixing his gaze intently. He was asked about that, and he said, "Verily, I see a verdant green; they are neither human nor jinn." Then he passed away, may God have mercy on him. It is recounted of Harun al-Rashid that he selected his shrouds with his own hand at death and would look at them and say, "His wealth availed him not, nor his authority; it has perished from him." Al-Ma'mun spread ashes and lay upon them, saying, "O You whose dominion does not vanish, have mercy on one whose dominion has vanished." Al-Mu'tasim would say at his death, "Had I known my life was this short, I would not have done [what I did]." Al-Muntasir would writhe upon himself at his death, and it was said to him, "There is no harm upon you, O Commander of the Faithful." He said, "It is only this: the world has gone, and the Hereafter has come." 'Amr ibn al-'As said at death, looking at chests belonging to his sons, "Who will take them with their contents? Would that it were dung." Al-Hajjaj said at his death, "O God, forgive me, for the people say You will not forgive me." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz admired this statement of his and envied him for it. When this was recounted to al-Hasan, he said, "Did he say it?" It was said, "Yes." He said, "Perhaps."

(Exposition of the sayings of a group from among the elect righteous from the Companions, the Successors, and those after them from the people of Sufism, may God be pleased with them all.)

When death approached Mu'adh, may God be pleased with him, he said, "O God, I used to fear You, and today I hope in You. O God, You know I did not love the world and long abiding in it for the flowing of rivers nor the planting of trees, but for the thirst of the midday heat, the striving through the hours, and jostling with the scholars in the company at the circles of remembrance." When his death throes intensified—throes like none had experienced—every time he emerged from the swoon, he would open his eyes and say, "My Lord, how You suffocate me with Your suffocation! By Your might, You know my heart loves You." (When death approached Salman, he wept. He was asked, "What makes you weep?" He said, "I weep not in anguish for the world, but the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, enjoined upon us that the provision of any of us from the world should be like the provision of a traveler.") When Salman died, they looked at all he left, and its value was a few dirhams. When death approached Bilal, his wife said, "O our grief!" He said, "Nay, O our joy! Tomorrow we meet the beloved ones, Muhammad and his party." It is said that 'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak opened his eyes at death and smiled, saying, "For the like of this let the workers work." When death approached Ibrahim al-Nakha'i, he wept. He was asked, "What makes you weep?" He said, "I await a messenger from God to give me glad tidings of Paradise or of the Fire." When death approached Ibn al-Munkadir, he wept. He was asked, "What makes you weep?" He said, "By God, I weep not for a sin I know I committed, but I fear I committed something I deemed trivial while it is great with God." When death approached 'Amir ibn 'Abd al-Qays, he wept. He was asked, "What makes you weep?" He said, "I weep not in dread of death nor in craving for the world, but I weep for what I will miss of the thirst of the midday heat and for standing in prayer at night in winter." When death approached Fudayl, he lost consciousness, then opened his eyes and said, "O how distant his journey, and how scant his provision!" When death approached Ibn al-Mubarak, he said to Nasr...

His master said, "Place my head upon the earth," and he wept. Nusayr asked him, "What makes you weep?" He replied, "I remembered the bliss I was in, and here you are dying poor and estranged." He said, "Be silent, for I asked God Almighty to grant me the life of the wealthy and the death of the poor." Then he said to him, "Meet me, and do not return to me unless I speak a second word."

‘Ata ibn Yasar said: Iblis appeared to a man at the time of death and said to him, "You are saved." He replied, "What security do you have after this?" And one of them wept at the time of death, so it was said to him, "What makes you weep?" He said, "A verse in the Book of God Almighty, His Mighty and Majestic saying: 'God only accepts from the righteous.'"

Al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, entered upon a man whose soul was departing and said, "A matter whose beginning is such is truly worthy that its end be feared, and a matter whose end is such is truly worthy that its beginning be renounced."

Al-Jurayri said: I was with al-Junayd during his final moments, and it was Friday and the day of Nayruz. He was reciting the Qur’an and completed it. I said to him in that state, "O Abu al-Qasim." He replied, "And who is more deserving of that than I? Behold, my scroll is being rolled up."

Ruwaym said: I attended the passing of Abu Sa‘id al-Kharraz, and he was saying:
"The yearning of the hearts of the knowers for remembrance,
And their recollection at the time of intimate communion with the Secret.
Cups of deaths were passed around to them,
So they became heedless of the world like the heedlessness of the grateful.
Their concerns roam in a camp
Where the people of God’s affection are like shining stars.
Their bodies on earth are slain by His love,
And their spirits in the veils soar toward the heights.
They have not camped except near their Beloved,
Nor have they alighted from any touch of misery or harm."

It was said to al-Junayd, "Abu Sa‘id al-Khazzaz used to be greatly overcome with spiritual emotion at death." He said, "It is not surprising that his spirit would fly away out of longing." And it was said to Dhu al-Nun at his death, "What do you desire?" He said, "That I know Him a moment before my death." And it was said to one of them while in the throes of death, "Say 'Allah'." He replied, "How long will you say 'Allah' while I am burning with Allah?"

One of them said: I was with Mumsad al-Dinawari when a poor man approached and said, "Peace be upon you. Is there here a clean place where a person can die?" He said: They pointed him to a place, and there was a spring of water there. The poor man renewed his ablution, prayed as much as God willed, then went to that place, stretched out his legs, and died.

Abu ‘Abbas al-Dinawari was speaking in his gathering when a woman cried out in spiritual emotion. He said to her, "Die." The woman stood up, and when she reached the house, she turned to him and said, "I have died," and fell down dead.

It is related from Fatimah, the sister of Abu ‘Ali al-Rudhbari, that she said: When the term of Abu ‘Ali al-Rudhbari drew near, and his head was in my lap, he opened his eyes and said, "These are the gates of heaven, they have opened; these are the gardens, they have been adorned; and this is a caller saying, 'O Abu ‘Ali, we have brought you to the highest rank, even if you did not desire it.'" Then he began to say:
"By Your right, I have not looked to other than You
With an eye of affection, until
I see You—You see my torment with a languid glance
And with the rosy cheek from Your life."

It was said to al-Junayd, "Say 'There is no god but God'." He replied, "I have not forgotten it that you should remind me of it." Ja‘far ibn Nasir asked Bakran, the servant of al-Dinawari who attended al-Shibli, "What did you see from him?" He said, "He said, 'There is a single dirham of injustice against me, and I have given thousands in charity on behalf of its owner, yet there is no concern upon my heart greater than it.' Then he said, 'Make ablution for me for prayer.' I did so, but I forgot to comb his beard, and he had seized his tongue. So he grasped my hand and inserted it into his beard, then he died." Ja‘far wept and said, "What do you say about a man who, at the end of his life, did not neglect a single etiquette of the Sacred Law?"

It was said to Bishr ibn al-Harith when he was on his deathbed—and it was as if life was dear to him—so he said, "The arrival before God is severe." And it was said to Salih ibn Mismar, "Will you not leave a will for your son and your family?" He said, "I am too shy before God to entrust them to other than Him."

When Abu Sulayman al-Darani was on his deathbed, his companions came to him and said, "Receive glad tidings, for you are proceeding to a Lord Forgiving and Merciful." He said to them, "Will you not say, 'Beware, for you are proceeding to a Lord who will call you to account for the small and punish you for the great'?"

When Abu Bakr al-Wasiti was on his deathbed, it was said to him, "Counsel us." He said, "Preserve the desire of the Truth concerning you."

One of them was on his deathbed, and his wife wept. He said to her, "What makes you weep?" She said, "I weep for you." He said, "If you must weep, then weep for yourself, for I have wept for this day for forty years."

Al-Junayd said: I entered upon Sari al-Saqati to visit him in his fatal illness and said, "How do you find yourself?" He began to say:
"How can I complain to my Physician of what ails me,
When what ails me has come to me from my Physician?"
I took a fan to fan him, and he said, "How can the breeze of the fan reach one whose innards are burning?" Then he began to say:
"The heart is burning, the tears are racing,
The distress is gathered, and patience is scattered.
How can there be settlement for one who has no settlement
From what passion, longing, and anxiety have incurred?
O Lord, if there is any relief for me in anything,
Bestow it upon me as long as I have a breath."

It is related that a group of al-Shibli’s companions entered upon him while he was dying and said to him, "Say 'There is no god but God'." He began to say:

A house you inhabit needs no lamp, for your hoped-for countenance is our argument on the day people come with their proofs. May God not grant me relief on the day I call upon you for deliverance.

It is related that Abu al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Ata’ entered upon Junayd at the moment of his passing. He greeted him, but Junayd did not answer. Then he answered after an hour and said, “Excuse me, for I was in my litany.” Then he turned his face toward the *qiblah*, uttered the *takbir*, and died.

It was said to al-Kinani when death approached him, “What was your practice?” He said, “Had my term not drawn near, I would not have told you. I stood at the door of my heart for forty years, and whenever anything other than God passed through it, I barred it from him.”

It is related from al-Mu‘tamir, who said: I was among those present with al-Hakam ibn ‘Abd al-Malik when the Truth came to him. I said, “O God, make the agonies of death easy for him, for he was such and such,” and I mentioned his good qualities. He regained consciousness and said, “Who is speaking?” I said, “I am.” He said, “Indeed, the Angel of Death, peace be upon him, says to me, ‘I am gentle with every generous person.’” Then he was extinguished.

And when the death of Yusuf ibn Asbat approached, Hudhayfah attended him and found him anxious. He said, “O Abu Muhammad, this is the time for anxiety and dismay?” He said, “O Abu ‘Abd Allah, how can I not be anxious and dismayed, for I do not know that I have been truthful to God in any of my works?” Hudhayfah said, “How astonishing! This righteous man leaves at his death claiming he does not know he was truthful to God in any of his works.”

And from al-Mughazili, who said: I entered upon a shaykh of mine from the people of this quality while he was ill, and he was saying, “You are able to do what you wish, so be gentle with me.”

And one of the shaykhs entered upon Mumsad al-Dinawari at the time of his death and said to him, “May God Almighty act and do,” from the door of supplication. He laughed and then said, “For thirty years Paradise has been presented to me with all that is in it, and I have not cast a glance at it.”

And it was said to Ruwaym at death, “Say, ‘There is no god but God.’” He said, “I know nothing else.”

And when the death of al-Thawri approached, it was said to him, “Say, ‘There is no god but God.’” He said, “Is there not then a command?”

And al-Muzani entered upon al-Shafi‘i, mercy of God upon them both, during the illness in which he died and said to him, “How are you this morning, O Abu ‘Abd Allah?” He said, “I have become one departing from the world, parting from the brethren, meeting my evil deeds, drinking from the cup of death, and arriving before God Almighty. And I do not know whether my soul will go to Paradise, so that I may congratulate it, or to the Fire, so that I may console it.” Then he began to recite:

> When my heart hardened and my paths narrowed, I made my hope toward Your pardon a ladder.
> My sin seemed immense to me, but when I compared it to Your pardon, my Lord, Your pardon was greater.
> You have not ceased to be One who pardons sin, constantly bestowing and pardoning out of grace and generosity.
> Were it not for You, no worshipper would have been led astray by Iblis, so how, when he led astray Your intimate Adam?

And when the death of Ahmad ibn Khadruwayh approached, he was asked about a question. His eyes welled with tears and he said, “O my son, a door I have been knocking upon for ninety-five years—behold, it is opened for me this very hour. I do not know whether it opens with felicity or wretchedness. Now is the time for the answer.”

These are their sayings, and they differed only according to the difference of their states. Fear dominated some, hope others, and yearning and love others. Each of them spoke according to the requirement of his state, and all are sound relative to their states.

*(The Sixth Chapter: On the Sayings of the Knowers Concerning Funerals and Graves, and the Ruling on Visiting Graves)*

Know that funerals are a lesson for the insightful and contain an admonition and reminder for the heedless. However, they only increase them in hardness, for they think they are always looking at the funeral of another and do not consider that they will inevitably be carried upon biers—or they do consider it, but they do not have the capacity for nearness, nor do they reflect that those carried upon biers also thought thus, but their thinking proved false and their time expired in nearness. Let no servant look upon a funeral without imagining himself carried upon it, for he will be carried upon it in nearness—as if it has already happened, and perhaps tomorrow or the day after.

It is related from Abu Hurayrah that when he saw a funeral, he would say, “Proceed, for we are upon the trace.”

And Makhul al-Dimashqi, when he saw a funeral, would say, “Go forth, for we are going.” A powerful admonition and a swift heedlessness—the first and the last pass away, he who has no intellect.

And Usayd ibn Hudayr said, “I never witnessed a funeral without my soul telling me of nothing except what is being done to him and what he is proceeding to.”

And when the brother of Malik ibn Dinar died, Malik went out in his funeral procession weeping and saying, “By God, my eye will not be comforted until I know to what I have proceeded, and I will not know as long as I am alive.”

And al-A‘mash said, “We used to attend funerals and not know whom to console, for all were grieving.”

And Thabit al-Bunani said, “We used to attend funerals and see none but one weeping with his head covered. Such was their fear of death. And now we look at a group attending a funeral, and most of them are laughing and amusing themselves, speaking only of his inheritance and what he left for his heirs. His peers and relatives think only of the stratagem by which...”

Each person only reflects upon what God wills regarding his own funeral procession and his state when carried upon it. The sole cause of this heedlessness is the hardening of hearts through abundant sins and transgressions, until we have forgotten God Almighty, the Last Day, and the terrors that lie before us. Thus, we amuse ourselves, become heedless, and occupy ourselves with what does not concern us. We ask God Almighty for awakening from this heedlessness, for the best state of those present at funerals is their weeping over the deceased. Had they understood, they would weep for themselves, not for the deceased. Ibrahim al-Zayyat looked upon people invoking mercy for the deceased and said, "If you invoked mercy for yourselves, it would be better for you. He has been delivered from three terrors: the face of the Angel of Death, which he has seen; the bitterness of death, which he has tasted; and the fear of the final outcome, from which he is now secure."

Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala' said: I sat with Jarir while he was dictating poetry to his scribe. A funeral procession appeared, and he stopped and said, "By God, these funeral processions have turned my hair gray," and he began to recite:
      Funeral processions alarm us as they approach,
      Yet we amuse ourselves when they depart.
      Like the alarm of a flock at a wolf's den,
      When it disappears, they return to grazing.

Among the etiquettes of attending funerals are reflection, alertness, preparation, and walking ahead of it with an attitude of humility, as we have mentioned its manners and traditions in the section on jurisprudence. Among its etiquettes is to think well of the deceased, even if he was a sinner, and to think ill of oneself, even if one's outward appearance is righteous, for the final outcome is perilous and its reality is unknown. Therefore, it is related from 'Umar ibn Dhar that one of his neighbors who had been excessive against himself died, and many people avoided his funeral. He attended it and prayed over him. When he was lowered into his grave, he stood at his grave and said, "May God have mercy on you, O so-and-so. You spent your life in affirmation of God's Oneness and soiled your face in prostration. If they say he was a sinner and full of faults, then who among us is not a sinner and without faults?"

It is recounted that a man immersed in corruption died in an area of Basra, and his wife found no one to help her with his funeral, as none of his neighbors knew of it due to his great wickedness. She hired porters, carried him to the prayer ground, but no one prayed over him. She then carried him to the desert for burial. On a nearby hill was a great ascetic. He saw her as if waiting for the funeral, then intended to pray over it. The news spread in the town that the ascetic had descended to pray over so-and-so, so the townspeople came out. The ascetic prayed, and they prayed with him. People were astonished at the ascetic praying over him. He said, "I was told in a dream: 'Go down to such-and-such place; you will see a funeral with no one except a woman. Pray over him, for he is forgiven.'" This increased the people's astonishment. The ascetic summoned the wife and asked her about his condition and his conduct. She said, "As is known, his entire day was spent in the tavern, occupied with drinking wine." He said, "Look, do you know of any good deeds from him?" She said, "Yes, three things: Every day he would sober up from his drunkenness at dawn, change his clothes, perform ablution, and pray the dawn prayer in congregation, then return to the tavern and occupy himself with vice. Secondly, his house was never without one or two orphans, and his kindness to them was greater than his kindness to his own children, and he was intensely concerned for them. Thirdly, he would sober up during his drunkenness in the darkness of the night and weep, saying, 'O Lord, which corner of Hell do You wish to fill with this vile one?' meaning himself." The ascetic departed, his perplexity about the matter resolved.

From Sila ibn Ashim, when he buried a brother of his, he said at his grave:
      If you are saved from it, you are saved from a tremendous thing,
      Otherwise, I do not think you will be saved.

(Explanation of the state of the grave and their sayings at the graves)
Al-Dahhak said: A man asked, "O Messenger of God, who are the most ascetic of people?" He said, "He who does not forget the grave and decay, leaves the excess adornment of this world, prefers what lasts over what perishes, does not count tomorrow among his days, and counts himself among the people of the graves."

It was said to 'Ali, may God honor his face, "Why have you taken the graveyard as a neighbor?" He said, "I find them the best neighbors; I find them truthful neighbors who restrain tongues and remind of the Hereafter." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "I have seen no sight except that the grave is more dreadful than it." 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said, "We went out with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to the graveyards. He sat by a grave, and I was the closest of the people to him. He wept, and I wept, and they wept. He said, 'What makes you weep?' We said, 'We wept because of your weeping.' He said, 'This is the grave of my mother, Aminah bint Wahb. I asked my Lord's permission to visit her, and He permitted me. I asked His permission to seek forgiveness for her, but He refused me. I was overcome by the tenderness a child feels.'"

'Uthman ibn 'Affan, may God be pleased with him, when he stood at a grave, would weep until his beard became wet. He was asked about that, and it was said to him, "You remember Paradise and Hellfire and do not weep, yet you weep when you stand at a grave?"

I stood by a grave, and he said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "The grave is the first of the abodes of the Hereafter. If its occupant is saved from it, what comes after is easier than it. And if he is not saved from it, what comes after is more severe." It was said that 'Amr ibn al-'As looked at the graveyard, dismounted, and prayed two units of prayer. He was asked, "This is something you did not used to do." He replied, "I remembered the people of the graves and what has come between them and this, so I wished to draw nearer to God with them." And Mujahid said: "The first thing to speak to the son of Adam is his grave. It will say: I am the house of worms, the house of solitude, the house of estrangement, and the house of darkness. This is what I have prepared for you, so what have you prepared for me?" And Abu Dharr said: "Shall I not inform you of the day of my poverty? The day I am placed in my grave." And Abu al-Darda' would sit by the graves. He was asked about that, and he said: "I sit with a people who remind me of my ultimate return, and when I rise, they do not backbite me." And Ja'far ibn Muhammad would come to the graves at night and say: "O people of the graves, why is it that when I call you, you do not answer me?" Then he would say: "By God, they are prevented from answering me, and soon I shall be like them." Then he would turn to prayer until the dawn rose. And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said to some of his companions: "O so-and-so, I was sleepless last night, pondering the grave and its occupant. If you were to see the deceased after three days in his grave, you would be terrified by his proximity after long familiarity with him, and you would see a house where vermin crawl, pus flows, and worms penetrate, along with the changing of the air and the decay of the shrouds after fine appearance, pleasant scent, and clean garment." Then he gasped a gasp and fell unconscious. And Yazid al-Raqqashi would say: "O you who are buried in his pit, secluded in his grave in his solitude, comforted in the belly of the earth by his deeds—I wonder by which of your deeds you rejoiced and by which of your brothers you were gladdened." Then he would weep until his turban became wet, then say: "By God, he rejoiced in his righteous deeds and was gladdened, by God, by his brothers cooperating in obedience to God Almighty." And when he looked at the graves, he would bellow like an ox bellows. And Hatim al-Asamm said: "Whoever passes by the graveyards and does not reflect for himself and does not supplicate for them has betrayed himself and betrayed them." And Bakr al-'Abid said: "O my mother, would that you had been barren concerning me! Verily, your son has a long imprisonment in the grave, and after that, a departure from it." And Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "O son of Adam, your Lord has called you to the Abode of Peace, so see from where you will answer Him. If you answer Him from your worldly life and busy yourself with the journey to Him, you will enter it. And if you answer Him from your grave, you will be barred from it." And al-Hasan ibn Salih, when he overlooked the graves, would say: "How fine your exteriors are! The calamities are only within you." And 'Ata' al-Sulami, when night fell upon him, would go out to the graveyard and say: "O people of the graves, you have died—O my death!—and you have witnessed your deeds—O my deeds!" Then he would say: "Tomorrow 'Ata' will be in the graves." And he would persist in that until morning. And Sufyan said: "Whoever increases in remembrance of the grave finds it a garden from the gardens of Paradise, and whoever is heedless of its remembrance finds it a pit from the pits of Hell." And al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym had dug a grave in his house, and when he found hardness in his heart, he would enter it, lie down, and remain as long as God willed. Then he would say: " 'My Lord, send me back, that I might do righteousness in what I left behind,'" repeating it. Then he would reply to himself: "O Rabi', I have sent you back, so act." And Ahmad ibn Harb said: "The earth is amazed at a man who prepares his resting place and smooths his bed for sleep, and it says: 'O son of Adam, why do you not remember your long tribulation? There is nothing between me and you.'" And Maymun ibn Mihran said: "I went out with 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz to the graveyard. When he looked at the graves, he wept, then turned to me and said: 'O Maymun, these are the graves of my forefathers from Banu Umayyah, as if they never shared with the people of the world in their pleasures and their living. Do you not see them as slain, upon whom calamities have descended, decay has firmly taken hold, and vermin have found a resting place in their bodies?' Then he wept and said: 'By God, I do not know of anyone more blissful than he who has gone to these graves and is secure from the punishment of God.'" And Thabit al-Bunani said: "I entered the graveyards, and when I intended to leave them, I heard a voice saying: 'O Thabit, let not the silence of their inhabitants deceive you, for how many a distressed soul is within them.'" And it is narrated that Fatimah bint al-Husayn looked at the funeral procession of her husband, al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan, covered her face, and said:
    And they were a hope, then they became a calamity.
    Truly, those calamities have become great and immense.
And it is said that she pitched a tent over his grave and secluded herself there for a year. When the year passed, they removed the tent, and she entered Medina. They heard a voice from the direction of al-Baqi': "Have they found what they lost?" They heard from the other direction: "Rather, they have despaired, so they have turned back." And Abu Musa al-Tamimi said: "The wife of al-Farazdaq died, and the notables of Basra went out in her funeral procession, among them al-Hasan. Al-Hasan said to him: 'O Abu Firas, what have you prepared for this day?' He said: 'The testimony that there is no god but God, for sixty years.' When she was buried, al-Farazdaq stood by her grave and said:"

I fear what lies beyond the grave, if You do not pardon me,
More severe and narrower than the grave's burning and constriction.
When the Day of Resurrection comes to me, a harsh driver
And a forceful herder will drive forth Al-Farazdaq.
Truly disappointed is he among the children of Adam who walks
To the Fire, with a shackled collar, blue-faced.

And they recited regarding the people of the graves:
Stand by the graves and say upon their grounds:
Who among you is submerged in its darknesses?
And who among you is honored in its depths,
Having tasted the coolness of security from its terrors?
As for the stillness for the one with eyes, it is one;
Distinction in its degrees is not discerned.
If they answered you, they would inform you with tongues
That describe realities after their states.
As for the obedient, he is settled in a meadow,
Leading to whatever he wills of its spreading trees.
And the criminal transgressor therein is tossed
In a pit, taking refuge with its serpents,
And scorpions hasten to him, while his soul
Is in severe torment from their stings.

And Dawud al-Ta'i passed by a woman weeping over a grave, and she was saying:
I have lost life and not attained it,
If they have laid you in the grave, entombed.
So how and where shall I taste the flavor of slumber,
When you, with your right hand, have been made my pillow?
Then she said, "O my son, in which of your cheeks did the worm begin?" And Dawud was struck senseless on the spot and fell unconscious. And he said...

Malik ibn Dinar said: I passed by the cemetery and began to say:
I came to the graves and called out to them:
Where is the honored and where is the despised?
Where is the arrogant in his authority,
And where is the purified when he boasts?
He said: Then I was called from among them—I heard a voice but saw no person—and it said:
They have all perished, so no informer remains,
And they have all died, and news has died.
The daughters of the earth come and go,
Erasing the beauties of those forms.
So O you who ask about people who have passed,
Do you not have in what you see a lesson?
He said: So I returned weeping.

Verses found written upon graves:
Found written upon a grave:
The silent tombs converse with you, though they are mute,
And their inhabitants beneath the earth are hidden.
O gatherer of the world for other than a provision,
For whom do you gather the world when you will die?

And found upon another grave written:
O gainer, is not your span wide,
And your grave fortified on all sides, secure?
But what benefits the entombed the prosperity of his grave,
When within it his body crumbles?

And Ibn al-Sammak said: I passed by the graves and found upon a grave written:
My relatives pass by the sides of my grave,
As if my relatives did not know me.
The heirs divide my wealth,
And they do not fail to deny my debts.
They have taken their shares and lived on—
By God, how quickly they forgot me!

And found upon a grave written:
Indeed, the beloved among beloveds is snatched away;
No doorkeeper or guard can prevent death.
So how can you rejoice in the world and its pleasures,
O you upon whom speech and breath are counted?
You have become, O heedless one, immersed in deficiency,
While you were in your time immersed in pleasures.
Death does not mercy the ignorant for his delusion,
Nor the one from whom knowledge was acquired.
How many a silent one has death in a grave you stood by,
From answering—we are not silent regarding what is in it.
Your palace was once inhabited, having honor,
But your grave today among the tombs is effaced.

And found upon another grave written:
I stood by the beloved when their graves
Were aligned like racehorses.
Then when I wept and my tears overflowed,
My eyes saw among them my place.

And found upon a physician's grave written:
I said when a speaker said to me:
Luqman has gone to his resting place.
So where is what is described of his medicine,
And his skill in water with his touch?
Far be it! He cannot repel from another
What he could not repel from himself.

And found upon another grave written:
O people, I had a hope,
But my term cut me short from reaching it.
So let a man fear his Lord,
For whom work was possible in his life.
I am not alone in being transferred where you see;
Each will be transferred to his burden.

These are verses written upon graves due to the shortcoming of their inhabitants in taking heed before death. The insightful one is he who looks at others and sees his place among them, and so prepares to join them, and knows that they will not depart from their place until he catches up with them. And let him realize that if one day from the days of his life—which he is squandering—were offered to them, it would be more beloved to them than the entire world, because they have come to know the value of lifetimes and the realities of matters have been unveiled to them. Their regret is only for a day of life, that the negligent one might make up for his negligence and be saved from punishment, and that the divinely aided one might increase his rank and have it multiplied for him.

The reward, for they only recognized the value of a lifetime after its severance, so their regret was for a single hour of life. Yet you are capable of that very hour, and perhaps you are capable of its like, yet you are squandering it. So condition your soul to regret its waste when the matter passes beyond choice, if you do not seize your portion of your hour with promptness. Indeed, a righteous man said: "I saw a brother of mine in God in a dream-vision, and I said, 'O so-and-so, you have lived, praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.' He replied, 'To be able to say it—meaning 'Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds'—is more beloved to me than the world and all it contains.' Then he said, 'Did you not see where they were burying me? For so-and-so stood and prayed two rak'ahs. To be able to pray them is more beloved to me than the world and all it contains.'"

(Clarifying their statements upon the death of a child)
It is incumbent upon one whose child or close relative dies to regard their preceding him in death as if they were on a journey and the child arrived first at the country which is their destination and homeland. Then his grief is not excessive, knowing he will soon join them, with nothing between them but precedence and delay. Such is death, for its meaning is to precede to the homeland until the one who follows catches up. When one believes this, his anguish and sorrow diminish, especially since there has come regarding the death of a child a reward that consoles every afflicted person. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "For me to precede [to Paradise] with a miscarried child is more beloved to me than to leave behind a hundred horsemen, all fighting in the cause of God." He mentioned the miscarriage to alert by the lesser to the greater, for the reward is according to the child's place in the heart. Zayd ibn Aslam said: "A son of Dawud, peace be upon him, died, and he grieved for him intensely. He was asked, 'What was his worth to you?' He said, 'The earth filled with gold.' It was said to him, 'Then for you in the Hereafter is a reward like that.'" And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "No Muslim loses three of his children and is resigned to God's decree, except that they will be a protection for him from the Fire." A woman near the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Or two?" He said, "Or two." Let the parent sincerely supplicate for his child at death, for it is the most hopeful supplication and nearest to acceptance. Muhammad ibn Sulayman stood at his son's grave and said: "O God, I begin the day hoping in You for him and fearing You for him, so realize my hope and secure my fear." Abu Sinan stood at his son's grave and said: "O God, I have forgiven him what was due to me from him, so forgive him what is due to You from him, for You are more Generous and more Noble." A Bedouin stood at his son's grave and said: "O God, I have granted him what he fell short of in his duty to me, so grant him what he fell short of in obeying You." When Dharr ibn 'Umar ibn Dharr died, his father 'Umar ibn Dharr stood after placing him in the grave and said: "O Dharr, grief for you has distracted us from grieving over you. Would that I knew what you said and what was said to you!" Then he said: "O God, this is Dharr; You gave me enjoyment of him as long as You gave me enjoyment, and You fulfilled his term and his provision, and You did not wrong him. O God, I had enjoined upon him obedience to You and obedience to me. O God, whatever reward You promised me for my affliction, I have granted that to him, so grant me his punishment and do not punish him." He made the people weep. Then he said upon departing: "We have no want after you, O Dharr, and we have no need for any person alongside God. We have gone on and left you, and had we stayed, we would not have benefited you." A man looked at a woman in Basra and said, "I have never seen such freshness; that is only from lack of grief." She said, "O servant of God, I am in a grief in which no one shares with me." He said, "How so?" She said, "My husband slaughtered a sheep on the day of Eid al-Adha. I had two beautiful boys playing. The older one said to the other, 'Do you want me to show you how my father slaughtered the sheep?' He said, 'Yes.' So he took him and slaughtered him, and we only became aware when he was writhing in his blood. When the cries rose, the boy fled and took refuge in a mountain, where a wolf overtook him and ate him. His father went out searching for him and died of thirst from the intense heat." She said, "So time has clothed me as you see." Such calamities should be remembered at the death of children to console oneself from intense anguish, for there is no calamity except that one can imagine what is greater than it, and what God averts in every circumstance is the greater portion.

(Clarifying visiting graves, supplicating for the deceased, and related matters)
Visiting graves is recommended in general for remembrance and taking heed, and visiting the graves of the righteous is for seeking blessings along with taking heed. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had forbidden visiting graves, then later permitted it. It is narrated from 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "I had forbidden you from visiting graves, so visit them, for they remind you of the Hereafter, but do not speak foolishly." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, visited his mother's grave with a thousand helmeted men, and no day was seen with more weeping than that day. On that day he said, "I was given permission to visit, but not to seek forgiveness," as we mentioned before.

Umm al-Mu'minin 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) came one day from the graveyards, so I said, "O Mother of the Believers, from where have you come?" She said, "From the grave of my brother 'Abd al-Rahman." I said, "Did not the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbid it?" She said, "Yes, then he commanded it." One should not cling to this to permit women to go out to the graveyards, for they often wail excessively at the heads of graves, so the good of their visitation does not outweigh its harm, nor are they free on the way from exposure and display, and these are grave matters. Visitation is a recommended practice, so how can that be tolerated for its sake? Indeed, there is no harm in a woman going out in shabby clothes that repel the eyes of men, and that is on the condition of restricting oneself to supplication and refraining from speaking at the head of the grave. Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter; and wash the dead, for handling a hollow body is an eloquent admonition; and pray over the funeral processions, perhaps that will grieve you, for the grieved one is in the shade of Allah." Ibn Abi Mulaykah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Visit your dead and greet them, for there is a lesson for you in them." From Nafi', that Ibn 'Umar would not pass by anyone's grave without stopping at it and greeting its occupant. From Ja'far ibn Muhammad, from his father, that Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet (peace be upon him), used to visit the grave of her uncle Hamzah on certain days, and she would pray and weep at it. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever visits the grave of his parents or one of them every Friday, he is forgiven and recorded as dutiful." From Ibn Sirin, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "A man may die while his parents are alive and he is undutiful to them, then he supplicates to Allah for them after their death, so Allah records him among the dutiful." The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever visits my grave, my intercession becomes incumbent for him." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Whoever visits me in Madinah seeking reward, I will be an intercessor and a witness for him on the Day of Resurrection." Ka'b al-Ahbar said: "No dawn breaks except that seventy thousand angels descend until they surround the grave, striking with their wings and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) until when evening comes, they ascend, and a similar number descend and do the same, until when the earth splits, he will emerge with seventy thousand angels, honoring him." The recommended practice in visiting graves is to stand with one's back to the Qiblah, facing the deceased with one's face, and to give greetings, and not to wipe the grave, nor touch it, nor kiss it, for that is from the practice of the Christians. Nafi' said: I saw Ibn 'Umar a hundred times or more come to the grave and say, "Peace be upon the Prophet, peace be upon Abu Bakr, peace be upon my father," and then depart. From Abu Umamah, he said: I saw Anas ibn Malik come to the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and stand, and he raised his hands until I thought he had commenced prayer, then he greeted the Prophet (peace be upon him) and departed. 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "There is no man who visits the grave of his brother and sits by it except that he finds comfort with him and a reply is given to him until he gets up." Sulayman ibn Suhaym said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in a dream, so I said, "O Messenger of Allah, these people who come to you and greet you, do you understand their greeting?" He said, "Yes, and I reply to them." Abu Hurayrah said: If a man passes by the grave of a man he knows and greets him, his greeting is returned to him and he is recognized; and if he passes by a grave he does not know and greets it, his greeting is returned. A man from the family of 'Asim al-Jahdari said: I saw 'Asim in my dream two years after his death, so I said, "Have you not died?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Where are you?" He said, "By Allah, I am in a meadow from the meadows of Paradise, I and a group of my companions. We gather every Friday night and its morning with Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdullah al-Muzani, and we meet to share your news." I said, "Your bodies or your spirits?" He said, "Far be it! The bodies have decayed; only the spirits meet." I said, "Do you know of our visiting you?" He said, "Yes, it is known to us on the eve of Friday and the whole day of Friday and the day of Saturday until sunrise." I said, "How is that, to the exclusion of all other days?" He said, "Because of the virtue and greatness of Friday." Muhammad ibn Was'i used to visit on Friday, so it was said to him, "If only you delayed until Monday." He said, "It reached me that the dead are informed of their visitors on Friday and the day before it and the day after it." Al-Dahhak said: "Whoever visits a grave before sunrise on Saturday, the deceased is informed of his visitation." It was said, "How is that?" He said, "Because of the status of Friday." Bishr ibn Mansur said: During the time of the plague, a man would frequent the cemetery to attend prayers over the funeral processions, and when evening came, he would stand at the gate of the graveyards and say, 'May Allah comfort your loneliness, have mercy on your estrangement, overlook your misdeeds, and accept your good deeds,' not exceeding these words. The man said: I spent one evening and returned to my family and did not come to the graveyards to supplicate as I used to supplicate. While I was asleep, a great many people came to me, so I said, "Who are you and what do you need?" They said, "We are the people of the graveyards." I said, "What has brought you?" They said, "You have accustomed us to a gift from you upon your departure to..."

You have destroyed us!" I said, "And what is it?" They said, "The supplications you used to make for us." I said, "Then I shall return to that," and I did not abandon it thereafter. And Bashar ibn Ghalib al-Najrani said: "I saw Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyyah, the worshipper, in my dream, and I used to supplicate for her frequently. She said to me, 'O Bashar ibn Ghalib, your gifts come to us upon a platter of light, covered with silk kerchiefs.' I said, 'How is that?' She said, 'And thus is the supplication of the living believers; when they supplicate for the dead and it is answered, that supplication is placed upon platters of light and covered with silk kerchiefs, then it is brought to the deceased and it is said to him, "This is a gift from so-and-so to you."'"

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The deceased in his grave is none other than like a drowning person crying for help, awaiting a supplication to reach him from his father, or his brother, or a friend of his. When it reaches him, it is more beloved to him than the world and all that is in it. And verily, the gifts of the living to the dead are supplication and seeking forgiveness." And one of them said: "A brother of mine died and I saw him in a dream. I said, 'What was your state when you were placed in your grave?' He said, 'A visitor came to me with a brand of fire, and were it not that a supplicant supplicated for me, I would have thought he was about to strike me with it.'"

From this, it is recommended to prompt the deceased after burial and to supplicate for him. Sa'id ibn 'Abdullah al-Azdi said: "I witnessed Abu Umamah al-Bahili while he was in the throes of death, and he said, 'O Sa'id, when I die, do with me as the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us.' He said, 'When one of you dies and you have leveled the earth over him, then let one of you stand at the head of his grave and say, "O so-and-so, son of so-and-so," for he hears but does not reply. Then let him say, "O so-and-so, son of so-and-so," a second time, for he will sit up straight. Then let him say, "O so-and-so, son of so-and-so," a third time, for he will say, "Guide us, may God have mercy on you," but you will not hear. Then say to him, "Remember what you departed upon from the world: the testimony that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God; and that you were pleased with God as your Lord, with Islam as your religion, with Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, as your Prophet, and with the Qur'an as your guide." For then Munkar and Nakir will each draw back and say, "Let us go, what keeps us sitting with this one when his proof has been prompted?" And God, Mighty and Exalted, will be his advocate against them.'" A man said, "O Messenger of God, what if he does not know his mother's name?" He said, "Then let him trace his lineage back to Eve."

There is no harm in reciting the Qur'an over graves. It is narrated from 'Ali ibn Musa al-Haddad, who said: "I was with Ahmad ibn Hanbal at a funeral, and Muhammad ibn Qudamah al-Jawhari was with us. When the deceased was buried, a blind man came and recited at the grave. Ahmad said to him, 'O you, reciting at the grave is an innovation.' When we left the cemetery, Muhammad ibn Qudamah said to Ahmad, 'O Abu 'Abdullah, what do you say about Mubashshir ibn Isma'il al-Halabi?' He said, 'Trustworthy.' He said, 'Did you write anything from him?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Mubashshir ibn Isma'il informed me from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-'Ala' ibn al-Lajlaj, from his father, that he instructed when he was buried that the opening of Surah al-Baqarah and its closing be recited at his head, and he said, "I heard Ibn 'Umar instructing that."' So Ahmad said to him, 'Then go back to the man and tell him to recite.'"

And Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Marwazi said: "I heard Ahmad ibn Hanbal say, 'When you enter the cemeteries, recite the Opening of the Book, the two seeking-refuge chapters, and "Say: He is God, the One," and make the reward of that for the people of the graves, for it reaches them.'"

And Abu Qilabah said: "I came from Syria to Basrah and stopped at al-Khandaq. I performed ablution and prayed two rak'ahs at night, then I laid my head on a grave and slept. Then I awoke, and the occupant of the grave was complaining about me, saying, 'You have harmed me since tonight.' Then he said, 'You do not know, and we know, but we are incapable of action.' Then he said, 'The two rak'ahs you prayed are better than the world and all that is in it.' Then he said, 'May God reward the people of the world well on our behalf; convey peace to them, for indeed from their supplication there enters upon us light like mountains.'"

The purpose of visiting graves is, for the visitor, to take admonition from them, and for the visited, to benefit from his supplication. Therefore, the visitor should not neglect supplicating for himself and for the deceased, nor neglect taking admonition from him. He attains admonition by picturing in his heart the deceased—how his parts were dispersed, how he will be resurrected from his grave, and that he will soon join him.

As is narrated from Mutarrif ibn Abi Bakr al-Hudhali, who said: "There was an elderly woman from 'Abd al-Qays who was devout. When night came, she would gird herself and stand at the prayer niche, and when day came, she would go out to the graves. It reached me that she was reproached for her frequent coming to the cemeteries. She said, 'The hard heart, when it becomes callous, nothing softens it except the traces of decay. I come to the graves, and it is as if I see them having emerged from between their layers, and as if I see those dust-covered faces, and those changed bodies, and those greasy eyelids. What a sight it is! If the servants were to imbibe it into their hearts, they would not find its bitterness harsh for the souls, nor its severity destructive for the bodies.'"

Rather, one should bring to mind the image of the deceased as mentioned by 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, where...

A jurist entered upon him and marveled at the alteration of his appearance due to his abundant striving and worship. He said to him, "O so-and-so, if you were to see me after three days, when I have been placed in my grave, and the eyeballs have come out and flowed down upon the cheeks, and the lips have shrunk back from the teeth, and pus has issued from the mouth, and the mouth has opened, and the belly has swollen so it rises to the chest, and the spine has come out from the anus, and worms and pus have come out from the nostrils—you would see something more astonishing than what you see now."

It is recommended to praise the deceased and that nothing but good be mentioned of them. ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "When your companion dies, leave him and do not revile him." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not insult the dead, for they have proceeded to what they have sent forth." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not mention your dead except with good, for if they are among the people of Paradise, you will have sinned, and if they are among the people of the Fire, then what they are in is sufficient for them." And Anas ibn Mālik said: "A funeral passed by the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and they praised it with evil. So he, upon him be peace, said, 'It has become incumbent.' And another passed by and they praised it with good. So the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'It has become incumbent.' ‘Umar asked him about that, and he said, 'This one, you praised him with good, so Paradise has become incumbent for him. And this one, you praised him with evil, so the Fire has become incumbent for him. And you are God's witnesses on earth.'" And Abū Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, a servant dies and the people praise him with praise, while God knows otherwise from him. So God, exalted is He, says to His angels, 'I call you to witness that I have accepted the testimony of My servants concerning My servant, and I have overlooked what I know of My servant.'"

(The Seventh Chapter: On the Reality of Death and What the Deceased Encounters in the Grave until the Blast of the Trumpet)
(Explanation of the Reality of Death)

Know that people have false assumptions concerning the reality of death in which they have erred. Some of them assumed that death is annihilation, and that there is no resurrection or gathering, and no consequence for good and evil, and that the death of a human is like the death of animals and the withering of plants. This is the view of the atheists and all who do not believe in God and the Last Day. A group assumed that he becomes annihilated by death and neither suffers harm nor enjoys reward as long as he is in the grave until he is restored at the time of the gathering. Others said that the spirit remains and is not annihilated by death, and that only the spirits are rewarded and punished, not the bodies, and that the bodies are not resurrected or gathered at all. All these are corrupt assumptions deviating from the truth. Rather, what the ways of reflection testify to and what the verses and reports declare is that the meaning of death is merely a change of state, and that the spirit remains after parting from the body, either in torment or in bliss. The meaning of its parting from the body is the cessation of its governance over the body due to the body's departure from its obedience. For the limbs are instruments of the spirit; it uses them such that it strikes with the hand, hears with the ear, sees with the eye, and knows the reality of things with the heart—and the heart here is an expression for the spirit. The spirit knows things by itself without an instrument. Therefore, it may suffer by itself with types of grief, sorrow, and anguish, and it may enjoy types of joy and delight, all of which are not connected to the limbs. Thus, whatever is a description of the spirit by itself remains with it after parting from the body, and whatever is for it by means of the limbs becomes inoperative with the death of the body until the spirit is returned to the body. It is not far-fetched that the spirit is returned to the body in the grave, nor is it far-fetched that it is delayed until the Day of Resurrection. God knows best what He has decreed for every servant of His servants. The body's becoming inoperative by death resembles the limbs of a living person becoming inoperative due to a corruption of temperament that occurs in it, or due to a severity that occurs in the nerves preventing the spirit's penetration into them. Thus, the knowing, reasoning, perceiving spirit remains, using some limbs while some have become refractory to it. Death is an expression for the refractoriness of all the limbs. All the limbs are instruments, and the spirit is the one that uses them. By "spirit" I mean the meaning within a human that perceives knowledge, the pains of sorrows, and the pleasures of joys. Whenever its governance over the limbs ceases, the knowledge and perceptions do not cease from it, nor do the joys and sorrows cease from it, nor does its receptivity to pains and pleasures cease from it. In reality, the human is the meaning that perceives knowledge, pains, and pleasures, and that does not die—that is, it is not annihilated. The meaning of death is the cessation of its governance over the body and the body's departure from being an instrument for it, just as the meaning of lameness is the hand's departure from being a usable instrument. Thus, death is absolute lameness in all the limbs, and the reality of the human is his self and his spirit, and it remains. Yes, his state changes in two respects: One is that his eye, his ear, his tongue, his hand, his foot, and all his limbs are taken from him; his family, his children, his relatives, and all his acquaintances are taken from him; his horses, his beasts, his servants, his houses, his estates, and all his possessions are taken from him. There is no difference between

That these things be stripped from man, and that man be stripped from these things—the pain lies in separation, and separation occurs sometimes by a man's wealth being plundered, and sometimes by a man being taken captive away from his kingdom and wealth. The pain is one in both cases. The meaning of death is but the stripping of man from his possessions by his removal to another world unsuited to this one. If he had in this world something he found solace in, took comfort from, and considered significant by its existence, then his grief over it after death becomes immense and his misery in parting from it severe. Indeed, his heart turns to each single item of his wealth, status, and property, even to a shirt he used to wear, for example, and he rejoices in it. But if he did not rejoice except in the remembrance of God and found solace only in Him, then his bliss is immense and his happiness complete when he is left alone with his Beloved and the obstacles and distractions are cut off from him, for all worldly causes are distractions from the remembrance of God. This is one aspect of the difference between the state of death and the state of life.

The second is that what was not unveiled to him in life is unveiled to him through death, just as what was not unveiled to him in sleep may be unveiled to the one who is awake. People are asleep; when they die, they awaken. The first thing unveiled to him is what harms him and benefits him from his good and bad deeds. That was inscribed in a book folded within the secret of his heart, and the distractions of the world preoccupied him from perceiving it. When the distractions are cut off, all his deeds are unveiled to him. He looks upon his evil deeds only to grieve over them with a grief that makes him wish to plunge into the depths of the Fire to be free from that regret. To such a servant it is said: "Enough is yourself this day as a reckoner against you." All this is unveiled at the severing of the breath and before burial, and the fires of separation—meaning separation from what he felt at peace with in this perishing world, not from what he desired from it for provision and sufficiency—ignite within him. For he who seeks provision for sufficiency, when he reaches the destination, rejoices at parting with the remainder of the provision, since he did not want the provision for its own sake. This is the state of one who took from the world only out of necessity and wished for his necessity to cease so he could be free of it; he has attained what he wished and is free of it.

These are types of great punishment and pains that assail him before burial. Then, at burial, his spirit may be returned to his body for another type of punishment, or he may be pardoned. The state of one who indulged in the world and felt at peace with it is like the state of one who indulged in the absence of a king, in his house, his kingdom, and his womenfolk, relying on the king being lenient with him or on the king not knowing what vile actions he committed. Then the king seized him suddenly and presented him with a scroll in which all his obscenities and crimes were recorded, particle by particle, step by step, while the king is overpowering, dominant, jealous for his sanctities, avenging against the criminals upon his kingdom, and not turning to anyone who intercedes for those who transgressed against him. Consider this seized one, how his state would be before the king's punishment descends upon him—of fear, shame, humiliation, grief, and regret. This is the state of the sinful deceased who was deceived by the world and felt at peace with it, before the punishment of the grave descends upon him, indeed at his death—we seek refuge in God from it. For disgrace, exposure, and the tearing of the veil are greater than any punishment that befalls the body from beating, cutting, and the like. This is an allusion to the state of the deceased at death, witnessed by the people of insight through an inward vision stronger than the vision of the eye, and testified to by evidences from the Book and the Sunnah.

Indeed, it is not possible to lift the veil from the essence of the reality of death, for he who does not know life does not know death, and knowledge of life is through knowledge of the reality of the soul in itself and the perception of its essential nature. "And it was not granted to the Messenger of God to speak concerning it, nor to add more than to say, 'The spirit is of the affair of my Lord.'" Therefore, it is not for any of the scholars of religion to disclose the secret of the spirit, even if they have perceived it. What is permitted is to mention the state of the spirit after death. That death is not an expression for the non-existence of the spirit and the cessation of its perception is indicated by many verses and reports. As for the verses, there is what came concerning the martyrs, as the Exalted said: "And do not think of those who are killed in the way of God as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision, rejoicing." And when the chiefs of Quraysh were killed at Badr, the Messenger of God called out to them, saying: "O so-and-so, O so-and-so, O so-and-so, I have found what my Lord promised me to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true?" It was said: "O Messenger of God, do you call out to them when they are dead?" He said: "By the One in whose hand is my soul, they hear this speech of mine better than you do, except that they cannot reply." This is a clear text regarding the spirit of the wretched one and the permanence of its perception and knowledge, and the verse is a clear text regarding the spirits of the martyrs. The deceased is not devoid of either happiness or wretchedness. And he said: "The grave is either a pit from the pits of the Fire, or a garden from the gardens of Paradise."

The Gardens of Paradise [110] This is an explicit text indicating that death means only a change of state, and that what will be of the deceased's misery or happiness is brought forward at the moment of death without delay, though some types of punishment and reward are deferred, but not their fundamental reality. Anas reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "Death is the Resurrection; so whoever dies, his resurrection has come to pass." [111] And he (peace be upon him) said: "When one of you dies, his place is shown to him morning and evening. If he is among the people of Paradise, then from Paradise; and if he is among the people of the Fire, then from the Fire. And it is said: 'This is your place until you are resurrected to it on the Day of Resurrection.'" It is not hidden what is in the immediate witnessing of these places, of punishment or bliss. [112] And from Abu Qays, who said: We were with 'Alqamah at a funeral, and he said: "As for this one, his resurrection has come to pass." And 'Ali (may God honor his countenance) said: "It is forbidden for a soul to depart from the world until it knows whether it is among the people of Paradise or among the people of the Fire." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever dies as a stranger dies a martyr, is shielded from the trials of the grave, and is granted his provision from Paradise morning and evening." [113] And Masruq said: "I have never envied a believer in the grave who has found rest from the toil of the world and is secure from the punishment of God Almighty." And Ya'la ibn al-Walid said: I was walking one day with Abu al-Darda' and I said to him: "What do you wish for one you love?" He said: "Death." I said: "And if he does not die?" He said: "That his wealth and children diminish." And I only love death because none loves it except the believer, and death is the believer's release from prison. And I only love the diminishment of wealth and children because they are a trial and a cause for attachment to the world, and attachment to that from which one must inevitably part is the utmost misery. For everything other than God, His remembrance, and intimacy with Him must inevitably be parted from at death, without fail. For this reason, 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said: "The likeness of the believer when his soul or spirit departs is like a man who spent the night in a prison and was then released from it, so he roams freely upon the earth and moves about in it." This which he mentioned is the state of one who has turned away from the world, grown weary of it, and had no intimacy except with the remembrance of God Almighty, and whom the preoccupations of the world held back from his Beloved, and the struggle with base desires pained him. So in death was his deliverance from all that causes pain, and his solitude with his Beloved, with Whom was his intimacy, without any hindrance or repeller. How deserving is that to be the ultimate bliss and delight! And the tasting of delights is for the martyrs who were killed in the path of God, for they only advanced to combat having severed their attachment to worldly ties, yearning for the meeting with God, content with being killed in seeking His pleasure. If he looks to the world, he has willingly sold it for the Hereafter, and the seller's heart does not turn back to what he sold. And if he looks to the Hereafter, he has purchased it and longed for it. So how immense is his joy with what he purchased when he sees it, and how little is his turning back to what he sold when he parts from it! The heart's purification for the love of God Almighty may occur in some states, but death does not overtake him in that state, so it changes. Combat is a cause of death, so it was a cause for death to overtake him in such a state. For this reason, his bliss is immense, for the meaning of bliss is that a person attains what he desires. God Almighty said: "And for them will be what they desire." [Qur'an] So this is the most comprehensive expression for the meanings of the delights of Paradise. And the greatest punishment is that a person is prevented from what he desires, as God Almighty said: "And a barrier will be placed between them and what they desire." [Qur'an] So this is the most comprehensive expression for the punishments of the people of Hell. And this bliss is attained by the martyr as his soul is severed, without delay. This is a matter revealed to the possessors of hearts by the light of certainty. And if you seek testimony for it from the realm of hearing, then all the narrations concerning the martyrs indicate it. Every narration that expresses the ultimate nature of their bliss with another expression... Indeed, it is reported from 'A'ishah (may God be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to Jabir—and his father had been martyred on the day of Uhud—"Shall I not give you glad tidings, O Jabir?" He said: "Yes, may God give you glad tidings of good." He said: "Indeed, God Almighty has revived your father and seated him before Him and said: 'Ask of Me, My servant, whatever you wish, I will grant it to you.' He said: 'O Lord, I did not worship You as You deserve to be worshipped. I ask of You that You return me to the world so that I may fight alongside Your Prophet and be killed for You once again.' He said to him: 'It has already been decreed by Me that you shall not return to it.'" [114] And Ka'b said: A man will be found in Paradise weeping, and it will be said to him: "Why do you weep when you are in Paradise?" He said: "I weep because I was only killed once for God, and I wished to be returned so I could be killed for Him many times." And know that for the believer, following death, is unveiled from the vastness of God's majesty such that the world in comparison to it is like a prison and a constricted place. His likeness is like one imprisoned in a dark house, for whom a door is opened to a vast garden, whose furthest bounds cannot be reached, containing all kinds of trees, flowers, fruits, and birds. He would not desire to return to the dark prison. And the Messenger (peace be upon him) gave an example...

God gave an example, saying regarding a man who died: "This one has departed from the world at dawn, leaving it for its people. If he was content, he would not be pleased to return to the world, just as none of you would be pleased to return to his mother's womb." Thus, He made known to you through this that the vastness of the Hereafter compared to this world is like the vastness of this world compared to the darkness of the womb. And He said: "The likeness of the believer in this world is that of a fetus in its mother's womb; when it emerges from her womb, it cries over its exit until it sees the light and is placed down, then it does not desire to return to its place." Similarly, the believer is distressed by death, but when he reaches his Lord, he does not desire to return to the world, just as the fetus does not desire to return to its mother's womb. It was said to the Messenger of God: "So-and-so has died." He said: "Is he relieved, or are others relieved of him?" He indicated by "relieved" the believer, and by "others relieved of him" the wicked, for the people of the world are relieved of him. Abu 'Umar, the companion of the watering-place, passed by us when we were boys, and he looked at a grave where a skull was exposed. He ordered a man to bury it, then said: "These bodies are not harmed by this dust at all; it is the souls that are punished and rewarded until the Day of Resurrection." From 'Amr ibn Dinar: "No one dies except that he knows what will happen to his family after him. They wash him and shroud him, and he looks upon them." Malik ibn Anas said: "It reached me that the souls of the believers are set free to go wherever they wish." Al-Nu'man ibn Bashir said: "I heard the Messenger of God on the pulpit saying: 'Verily, nothing remains of this world except like a fly buzzing in its air. So fear God, fear God regarding your brothers among the people of the graves, for your deeds are presented to them.'" Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet said: "Do not disgrace your dead with the evils of your deeds, for they are presented to your loved ones among the people of the graves." Because of this, Abu al-Darda' said: "O God, I seek refuge in You from performing a deed that would bring me shame before 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah"—and he had died, being his uncle. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As was asked about the souls of the believers when they die: where are they? He said: "In the crops of white birds in the shade of the Throne, and the souls of the disbelievers are in the seventh earth." Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of God say: "Verily, the deceased recognizes the one who washes him, the one who carries him, and the one who lowers him into his grave." Salih al-Murri said: "It reached me that the souls meet at death, and the souls of the dead say to the soul that comes out to them: 'How was your abode, and in which of the two bodies were you—in a good one or a bad one?'" 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr said: "The people of the graves await news. When the deceased comes to them, they say: 'What did so-and-so do?' He says: 'Has he not come to you, or has he not arrived before you?' They say: 'To God we belong and to Him we return. He has taken a path other than ours.'" From Ja'far ibn Sa'id: "When a man dies, his children receive him as one receives an absent person." Mujahid said: "A man is indeed given glad tidings of his child's righteousness in his grave." Abu Ayyub al-Ansari narrated from the Prophet that he said: "When the soul of a believer is taken, the people of mercy from God receive it as a bearer of glad tidings is received in this world. They say: 'Look at your brother until he rests, for he was in severe distress.' They ask him: 'What did so-and-so do, and what did so-and-so do, and did so-and-so marry?' If they ask him about a man who died before him and he says, 'He died before me,' they say: 'To God we belong and to Him we return. He has been taken to his mother, the abyss.'"

(Explanation of the Grave's Address to the Deceased)

The speech of the dead is either by the tongue of statement or by the tongue of state, which is more eloquent in making the dead understand than the tongue of statement is in making the living understand. The Messenger of God said: "The grave says to the deceased when he is placed in it, and it calls out: 'O son of Adam, what deluded you about me? Did you not know that I am the abode of trials, the abode of darkness, the abode of solitude, and the abode of worms? What deluded you about me when you used to pass by me?' Then, if he was righteous, a responder answers on his behalf, saying: 'What do you think if he used to enjoin good and forbid evil?' The grave says: 'Then I am transformed for him into greenery, his body returns as light, and his spirit ascends to God Almighty.'" And "fadhadh" is the one who puts one foot forward and delays the other; thus the narrator explained it. 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr al-Laythi said: "No one dies except that his grave, in which he is buried, calls out to him: 'I am the abode of darkness, solitude, and isolation. If you were obedient to God in your life, I am a mercy upon you today; but if you were disobedient, then I am a punishment upon you today. I am the one whom, if an obedient person enters me, he leaves delighted, and if a disobedient person enters me, he leaves destroyed.'" Muhammad ibn Subayh said: "It reached us that when a man is placed in his grave and is tormented or afflicted with something he dislikes, his neighbors among the dead call out to him: 'O you who remained behind in the world after your brothers and neighbors, did you not have...'"

There is a lesson for us in this. Did you not reflect upon those who preceded you? Did you not see the cessation of our deeds from us while you are in the respite? Why did you not recover what your brothers have missed? And you call out across the expanse of the earth, "O you who are deluded by the outward appearance of this world! Why did you not take a lesson from those of your family who have vanished into the earth's belly, those whom the world deceived before you, then their appointed time preceded them to the graves? And you see him being carried, his loved ones bearing him gently to the abode from which there is no escape."

Yazid al-Raqqashi said: It reached me that when the deceased is placed in his grave, his deeds surround him, then God gives them speech. They say, "O servant, alone in his pit! Companions and family have been cut off from you, so you have no intimate friend with us today."

Ka'b said: When the righteous servant is placed in the grave, his righteous deeds surround him: prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, striving, and charity. Then the angels of punishment come from the direction of his feet, and Prayer says, "You have no way to him, for he stood long for God upon them." They come to him from the direction of his head, and Fasting says, "You have no way to him, for he endured thirst for God in the worldly abode, so you have no way to him." They come to him from the direction of his body, and Pilgrimage and Striving say, "You have no way to him, for he exerted his soul and fatigued his body, performing pilgrimage and striving for God." They come to him from the direction of his hands, and Charity says, "Hold back from my companion! How much charity issued from these two hands until it fell into the hand of God, seeking His Countenance. You have no way to him." It is said to him, "Congratulations! You were wholesome in life and wholesome in death." Then the angels of mercy come to him, spread for him a bed from Paradise and a covering from Paradise, widen his grave as far as his sight reaches, and bring a lamp from Paradise by whose light he is illuminated until the day God resurrects him from his grave.

Abdullah ibn 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr said at a funeral: It reached me that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, the deceased sits up and hears the footsteps of those escorting him. Nothing speaks to him except his grave, and it says, 'Woe to you, O son of Adam! Did I not warn you? Did I not warn you of my narrowness, my decay, my horror, and my worms? So what have you prepared for me?'"

(Explanation of the Punishment of the Grave and the Questioning by Munkar and Nakir)

Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib said: We went out with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, for the funeral of a man from the Ansar. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sat at his grave, his head bowed, then said, "O God, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave," three times. Then he said: "When the believer is in the throes of the Hereafter and the severance from the world, God sends down angels whose faces are like the sun, with his embalming perfume and shroud. They sit as far as his sight reaches. When his soul departs, every angel between heaven and earth prays upon him, and every angel in heaven, and the gates of heaven are opened. There is no gate but that it loves for his soul to enter through it. When his soul ascends, it is said, 'O Lord, Your servant so-and-so.' He says, 'Return him, and show him what I have prepared for him of honor, for I promised him, "From it We created you and into it We will return you and from it We will bring you forth another time."' And verily, he hears the shuffling of their sandals when they turn away, until it is said to him, 'O you, who is your Lord, and what is your religion, and who is your prophet?' He says, 'My Lord is God, my religion is Islam, and my prophet is Muhammad,' peace be upon him. He is then rebuked with a severe rebuke, and this is the last trial presented to the deceased. When he says that, a caller calls out, 'He has spoken the truth.' This is the meaning of His saying, exalted is He, 'God keeps firm those who believe with the firm word.' Then one comes to him, beautiful of face, fragrant of scent, fine of garment, and says, 'Receive glad tidings of your Lord's mercy and gardens wherein is everlasting bliss.' He says, 'And you, may God give you glad tidings of good. Who are you?' He says, 'I am your righteous deed. By God, I only knew you to be swift to God's obedience and slow to His disobedience, so may God reward you with good.' Then a caller calls out, 'Spread for him from the bedding of Paradise and open for him a gate to Paradise.' So bedding from Paradise is spread for him and a gate to Paradise is opened for him, and he says, 'O God, hasten the establishment of the Hour so that I may return to my family and my wealth.'

As for the disbeliever, when he is in the throes of the Hereafter and severed from the world, angels descend to him, harsh and severe, with garments of fire and shirts of pitch, and they surround him. When his soul departs, every angel between heaven and earth curses him, and every angel in heaven, and the gates of heaven are closed. There is no gate but that it hates for his soul to enter through it. When his soul ascends, it is cast away, and it is said, 'O Lord, Your servant so-and-so.' Heaven does not accept him, nor does earth. God, mighty and majestic, says, 'Return him, and show him what I have prepared for him of evil, for I promised him, "From it We created you and into it We will return you and from it We will bring you forth another time."' And verily, he hears the shuffling of their sandals when they turn away, until it is said to him, 'O you, who is your Lord, and who is your prophet, and what is your religion?' He says, 'I do not know.' It is said, 'You did not know.' Then one comes to him, ugly of face, foul of scent, vile of garment, and says, 'Receive tidings of wrath from God and of punishment...'

He will be in lasting torment, and it will be said: "May God give you evil for your evil. Who are you?" It will reply: "I am your wicked deed." And by God, you were swift in disobeying God and slow in obeying Him, so may God reward you with evil." And he will say to it: "And you, may God reward you with evil." Then a blind, deaf, and dumb being is appointed for him, holding an iron mace—if the two weighty kinds (of jinn and mankind) were to gather to lift it, they could not. If it were to strike a mountain, it would turn to dust. He strikes him with it once, and he becomes dust. Then the soul is returned to him, and he strikes him between the eyes with a blow heard by all on the earths, not just the two weighty kinds. Then a caller will call out: "Spread for him two slabs of fire and open for him a door to the Fire." So two slabs of fire are spread for him, and a door to the Fire is opened for him.

Muhammad ibn Ali said: "No one dies but that his good deeds and his evil deeds are presented to him at death." He said: "He gazes at his good deeds and turns away from his evil deeds." Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When a believer is near death, the angels come to him with a silk cloth containing musk and bundles of sweet basil. They draw out his soul as gently as a hair is drawn from dough, and it is said: 'O contented soul, come forth pleased and pleasing, to the spirit and grace of God.' When his soul is taken out, it is placed upon that musk and basil, wrapped in the silk, and sent up to the Highest Heaven. But when a disbeliever is near death, the angels come to him with a coarse cloth containing a burning ember. They wrench his soul out violently, and it is said: 'O wicked soul, come forth displeased and displeasing, to the disgrace and punishment of God.' When his soul is taken out, it is placed upon that ember—and it has a sizzling sound—wrapped in the coarse cloth, and taken down to the lowest depths."

From Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi, regarding God's saying: "Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, 'My Lord, send me back, that I might do righteousness in what I left behind,'" he said: "What do you desire? In what do you wish? Do you wish to return to gather wealth, plant trees, build buildings, and dig canals?" He says: "No, that I might do righteousness in what I left behind." The Almighty says: "No, it is but a word he is saying"—meaning he will surely say it at death.

Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The believer in his grave is in a verdant meadow, and his grave is widened for him seventy cubits, and it is illuminated until it is like the full moon. Do you know why 'He will have a life of hardship' was revealed?" They said: "God and His Messenger know best." He said: "The punishment of the disbeliever in his grave: ninety-nine dragons are set upon him. Do you know what a dragon is? Ninety-nine serpents, each with nine heads, they scratch him, lick him, and blow into his body until the Day they are resurrected."

One should not be astonished at this specific number, for the numbers of these serpents and scorpions correspond to the number of blameworthy traits such as arrogance, ostentation, envy, rancor, malice, and all other attributes. They have countable roots, then branches diverge from them, also countable, then their branches divide into sections. Those very traits are the destroyers, and those very things transform into scorpions and serpents. The strong among them stings like a dragon, the weak stings like a scorpion, and what is between them harms like a serpent. The possessors of hearts and insight witness, by the light of insight, these destroyers and the branching paths of their offshoots, though the precise measure of their number is only known by the light of Prophethood. Such reports have sound outward meanings and hidden secrets, but they are clear to the possessors of insight. For one whose inner realities are not unveiled, he should not deny their outward meanings; rather, the lowest degree of faith is belief and acceptance.

If you say: "We observe the disbeliever in his grave for a period and watch him, and we do not see any of that. So how can belief be reconciled with contrary observation?" Know that you have three stations in believing such matters. The first, which is the most apparent, correct, and safest, is to believe that they exist and they sting the deceased, but you do not witness it. For this eye is not fit to perceive matters of the unseen realm, and all that pertains to the Hereafter is from the knowledge of the unseen. Do you not see how the Companions, may God be pleased with them, believed in the descent of Gabriel without seeing him, and believed that the Prophet, peace be upon him, saw him? If you do not believe this, then establishing the foundation of faith in angels and revelation is more important for you. And if you have believed it and allowed that the Prophet could see what the community did not see, then how can you not allow this for the deceased? And just as an angel does not resemble humans or animals, the serpents and scorpions that sting in the grave are not of the kind in our world; rather, they are another kind, perceived by another sense.

The second station is to recall the state of the sleeper, for he may see in his dream a serpent stinging him, and he suffers pain from it until you see him tossing in his sleep and his forehead sweating, and he may be startled from...

His place—all of this he perceives within himself and is pained by it, just as one awake is pained while witnessing it. And you see his outward form at rest, yet you do not see the serpent around him, though the serpent exists in his reality, and the torment is present, but in your perception it is not witnessed. And if the torment lies in the pain of a bite, there is no difference between an imagined serpent and one beheld.

The third station: You know that the serpent itself does not cause pain; rather, what afflicts you from it is its venom. Then the venom is not the pain itself, but your torment lies in the effect produced in you by the venom. If such an effect were to occur without venom, the torment would still be complete, and that type of torment could only be defined by attributing it to the cause that ordinarily leads to it. For if, for example, pleasure of intercourse were created in a person without the actual occurrence of its form, it could not be defined except by reference to it, so that the attribution serves to define it by its cause, while the fruit of the cause is attained even if the form of the cause is not. The cause is sought for its fruit, not for its own essence. These destructive attributes turn into harmful and painful afflictions in the soul at death, so that their pains become like the pains of serpent bites without the existence of serpents. And the transformation of an attribute into something harmful resembles the transformation of love into something painful at the death of the beloved. For if it was pleasurable, then a state supervenes whereby the pleasure itself becomes painful, such that it returns to the heart with kinds of torment through which one wishes he had never enjoyed the love and union. Indeed, this very thing is one of the types of torment of the deceased, for he subjected his soul to love in this world, so that he came to love his wealth, his estate, his status, his children, his relatives, and his acquaintances. If all of that were taken from him in his lifetime by one from whom he had no hope of recovery, what do you suppose his state would be? Would not his misery be immense, his torment severe, and would he not wish and say, "If only I had never possessed any wealth or status, so that I would not be pained by its separation"? Death is but an expression for the separation from all worldly beloved things at once:

What is the state of one who had a single beloved, and that single one was taken from him?

Then what is the state of one who finds joy only in the world, and the world is taken from him and delivered to his enemies? Then added to this torment is his regret for what he missed of the bliss of the Hereafter and the veil from God, Mighty and Majestic. For love of other than God veils him from meeting God and enjoying Him. Thus, upon him descends the pain of separation from all his beloved things and his regret for what he missed of the bliss of the Hereafter for all eternity, and the humiliation of rejection and the veil from God, Exalted is He. That is the torment with which he is punished, for nothing follows the fire of separation except the Fire of Hell, as He, Exalted is He, said: "No indeed! On that Day they will be veiled from their Lord. Then indeed they will enter the Blazing Fire."

As for one who did not find comfort in the world and loved none but God, and who yearned for the meeting with God, he has been delivered from the prison of the world and the struggle with desires within it, and he has advanced to his Beloved, and the obstacles and distractions have been cut off from him, and bliss has been made complete for him, with security from disappearance for all eternity. For the like of this let the workers strive.

The intended meaning is that a man may love his horse to such an extent that, if given the choice between it being taken from him and being stung by a scorpion, he would prefer to endure the scorpion's sting. Thus, the pain of separation from the horse is greater for him than that of the scorpion, and his love for the horse is what stings him when his horse is taken from him. So let him prepare for these stings, for death will take from him his horse, his mount, his house, his estate, his family, his children, his loved ones, and his acquaintances. It will take from him his status and his acceptance; indeed, it will take from him his hearing, his sight, and his limbs, and he will despair of all of that ever returning to him. So if he loved nothing else, and all of that is taken from him, that is greater upon him than scorpions and serpents. And just as if that were taken from him while alive his punishment would be immense, so too when he dies—for we have clarified that the essence which perceives pains and pleasures does not die; rather, his torment after death is more severe, because in life he consoles himself with means that occupy his senses, such as companionship and conversation, and he consoles himself with the hope of its return and the hope of compensation for it. But there is no consolation after death, for the paths of consolation have been closed to him and despair has set in.

Therefore, every shirt and handkerchief he loved, such that it would grieve him if taken from him, remains a source of regret and torment for him. If it was light in the world, he is safe—and that is the meaning of their saying, "The lightly burdened are saved." But if he was heavily burdened, his torment is immense. And just as the state of one from whom a dinar is stolen is lighter than the state of one from whom ten dinars are stolen, so too the state of the owner of a dirham is lighter than the state of the owner of two dirhams—and that is the meaning of His saying, "The owner of a dirham is lighter in account than the owner of two dirhams." And there is nothing of the world that remains with you at death except that it becomes a regret upon you after death. So if you wish, amass much, and if you wish, take little. For if you amass much, you are but amassing regret; and if you take little, you are not lightening [your burden] except by little.

Save from your own self, for indeed snakes and scorpions multiply in the graves of the wealthy who preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter, rejoiced in it, and found contentment therein. These are the stations of faith amidst the serpents and scorpions of the grave and all other forms of its torment. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri saw his son, who had died, in a dream and said to him, "O my son, admonish me." He replied, "Do not oppose God Almighty in what He wills." He said, "O my son, give me more." He said, "O my father, you cannot bear it." He said, "Speak." He said, "Do not place a shirt between you and God." So he did not wear a shirt for thirty years.

If you ask: Which of these three stations is correct? Know that among people are those who affirm only the first and deny what follows; among them are those who deny the first and affirm the second; and among them are those who affirm only the third. The truth that has been unveiled to us through insight is that all of that is within the realm of possibility, and whoever denies any of it does so due to the narrowness of his comprehension and his ignorance of the vastness of God's power, glorified be He, and the wonders of His management. Thus, he denies from the acts of God Almighty what he is not familiar with and accustomed to, and that is ignorance and deficiency. Rather, these three ways of punishment are possible, and believing in them is obligatory. Some servants are punished with one type of these kinds, and some servants have all three kinds combined upon them. We seek refuge in God from His punishment, little or much. This is the truth, so believe in it by following tradition, for it is rare upon the face of the earth for one to know it with certainty. What I advise you is not to excessively ponder the details of that, nor occupy yourself with knowing it. Rather, occupy yourself with planning how to ward off the punishment in any way. For if you neglect work and worship and occupy yourself with investigating that, you are like one seized by a ruler and imprisoned to have his hand cut off and his nose severed, who spends the entire night pondering whether he will cut it with a knife, a sword, or a razor, while neglecting the means of cunning to avert the root of the punishment from himself. This is the height of ignorance, for it is known with certainty that after death, the servant is not free from either immense punishment or everlasting bliss, so one must prepare for it. As for investigating the details of punishment and reward, it is superfluous and a waste of time.

(Explanation of the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, their forms, the pressure of the grave, and the remainder of the discourse on the torment of the grave)

Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When a servant dies, two black, blue-eyed angels come to him, one called Munkar and the other Nakir. They say, 'What did you used to say about this Prophet?' If he was a believer, he says, 'He is the servant of God and His Messenger; I bear witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.' They say, 'We knew you would say that.' Then his grave is expanded for him seventy cubits by seventy cubits, and his grave is illuminated for him. Then it is said to him, 'Sleep.' He says, 'Let me return to my family to inform them.' It is said to him, 'Sleep,' and he sleeps like the sleep of a bridegroom whom none awakens except the most beloved of his family to him, until God raises him from that resting place. If he was a hypocrite, he says, 'I do not know; I used to hear people saying something and I would say it.' They say, 'We knew you would say that.' Then it is said to the earth, 'Close in upon him,' and it closes in upon him until his ribs interlace, and he remains tormented until God raises him from that resting place."

From 'Ata' ibn Yasar, he said: The Messenger of God said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him: "O 'Umar, how will you be when you die and your people take you, measure for you three cubits by a cubit and a span, then return to you, wash you, shroud you, embalm you, then carry you until they place you in it, then heap the earth upon you and bury you? When they depart from you, the tempters of the grave, Munkar and Nakir, come to you—their voices like crashing thunder and their sight like flashing lightning, dragging their hair and digging the grave with their fangs, tearing you and tossing you—how will you be then, O 'Umar?" 'Umar said, "Will I have my intellect like now?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Then I will suffice against them."

This is an explicit text that the intellect does not change with death; rather, the body and limbs change. Thus, the deceased is rational, perceiving, aware of pains and pleasures as he was, with nothing of his intellect changed. The perceiving intellect is not these limbs; rather, it is an inner thing having no length nor width. Indeed, that which is indivisible in itself is what perceives things. Even if all the limbs of a person were scattered and nothing remained except the perceiving part that is indivisible and does not split, the rational person in his completeness would remain established and existing. And so it is after death, for that part is not dissolved by death nor does non-existence befall it.

Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: It reached me that the disbeliever is given mastery over in his grave by a blind, deaf creature, in its hand an iron whip with a head like a camel's bucket, with which it strikes him until the Day of Resurrection. He does not see it to guard against it, nor does he hear its voice so that it might have mercy on him.

Abu Huraira said: When the deceased is placed in his grave, there come...

His righteous deeds surrounded him. If it came from the direction of his head, his recitation of the Qur’an came forth. If it came from the direction of his feet, his standing in prayer came forth. If it came from the direction of his hands, the hands said, “By God, he used to extend me for charity and supplication; you have no way to him.” If it came from his mouth, his remembrance and his fasting came forth. Likewise, the prayer and patience stood aside and said, “Indeed, if I had seen any shortcoming, I would have been its companion.” Sufyan said: His righteous deeds fended for him as a man fends for his brother, his family, and his children. Then it is said to him at that time, “May God bless you in your resting place. How excellent are your companions, and how excellent are your friends.”

From Hudhayfah, who said: We were with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, at a funeral. He sat at the head of the grave, then began looking into it and said, “The believer is pressed in this [grave] with a pressure that makes his ribs converge.”

‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, “The grave has a pressure; if anyone were to be safe or saved from it, Sa‘d ibn Mu‘adh would have been saved.”

From Anas, who said: Zaynab, the daughter of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, died. She was a woman who was often ill. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, followed her, and his condition saddened us. When we reached the grave and he entered it, his face turned pale yellow. When he came out, his face brightened. We said, “O Messenger of God, we saw something from you; what was that?” He said, “I remembered the pressure upon my daughter and the severity of the grave’s punishment. I came and was informed that God had lightened it for her, yet she was pressed with a pressure whose sound was heard between the two horizons.”

(Chapter Eight: What is Known of the States of the Dead Through Spiritual Disclosure in Dreams)

Know that the lights of insight gained from the Book of God Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace be upon him, and from the paths of reflection, acquaint us with the states of the dead in general and their division into the blissful and the wretched. However, the specific state of Zayd or ‘Amr is not disclosed at all. For if we rely on the faith of Zayd and ‘Amr, we do not know upon what he died or how his end was sealed. If we rely on his outward righteousness, the place of God-consciousness is the heart, and it is obscure, hidden even from the possessor of God-consciousness, let alone others. Therefore, outward righteousness without inward God-consciousness holds no judgment. God Almighty said: “God only accepts from the God-conscious.” Thus, the judgment of Zayd or ‘Amr cannot be known except by witnessing him and what befalls him. When he dies, he has transferred from the world of dominion and testimony to the world of the unseen and the sovereign realm. He is not seen with the outward eye, but is seen with another eye created in the heart of every person. However, a dense veil from his desires and worldly preoccupations has been placed upon it, so he does not see with it, nor can he imagine seeing anything from the sovereign realm unless that veil is lifted from the eye of his heart. Since the veil was lifted from the eyes of the prophets, upon them be peace, they undoubtedly looked upon the sovereign realm and witnessed its wonders, and the dead are in the sovereign realm, so they saw them and informed [others]. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw the pressure of the grave in the case of Sa‘d ibn Mu‘adh and in the case of his daughter Zaynab. Likewise was the state of Abu Jabar when he was martyred, as he informed him that God seated him before Him with no veil between them. Such witnessing is not attainable except for the prophets and the saints whose rank is close to theirs. What is possible for the likes of us is another, weaker form of witnessing, yet it is also a prophetic witnessing: I mean witnessing in dreams, which is from the lights of prophethood. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: “The good dream is one part of forty-six parts of prophethood.” This too is a disclosure that occurs only by the lifting of the veil from the heart. Therefore, it is only trusted from the dream of a righteous, truthful man. Whoever lies frequently, his dream is not truthful. Whoever is excessive in corruption and disobedience, his heart becomes darkened, and what he sees is confused dreams. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commanded purity when sleeping, so that one may sleep in a state of purity—an allusion to inward purity as well, for it is the foundation, while outward purity is like its completion and perfection. Whenever the inward becomes clear, what will occur in the future is disclosed in the pupil of the heart, just as the entry into Makkah was disclosed to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in sleep, until the verse was revealed: “God has truly fulfilled His Messenger’s vision in truth.” Rarely is a person without dreams that indicate matters which are later found to be true. The dream and knowledge of the unseen in sleep are among the wonders of God Almighty’s creation and the marvels of human nature. It is among the clearest proofs of the sovereign realm, yet people are heedless of it, as they are heedless of the other wonders of the heart and the wonders of the world. Speaking on the reality of the dream is from the subtleties of the sciences of spiritual disclosure; it cannot be mentioned in addition to the science of spiritual conduct. But the amount that can be mentioned here is an example to make you understand the intended meaning: which is to know that the heart is like a mirror in which images and the realities of matters are reflected, and that everything God Almighty has decreed from the beginning of creation...

The world and all that follows is inscribed and established in the creation that God, Exalted is He, brought into being. It is expressed at times as the Preserved Tablet, at times as the Clear Book, and at times as a Manifest Imam, as has come in the Qur’an. Thus, all that has occurred in the world and all that will occur is written therein and engraved upon it with an engraving not beheld by this eye. Do not imagine that this Tablet is of wood, iron, or bone, nor that the Book is of paper or parchment. Rather, you must understand definitively that the Tablet of God does not resemble the tablet of creation, and the Book of God does not resemble the book of creation, just as His Essence and Attributes do not resemble the essence and attributes of creation. If you seek an analogy to bring it closer to your understanding, then know that the establishment of the decrees upon the Tablet parallels the establishment of the words and letters of the Qur’an in the mind and heart of one who has memorized it. For it is inscribed therein, such that when he recites it, it is as if he is looking upon it. Yet if you were to examine his brain part by part, you would not perceive a single letter of that script, even though there is no visible script or observable letter there. From this pattern, you should understand the nature of the Tablet being engraved with all that God, Exalted is He, has decreed and ordained.

In the analogy, the Tablet is like a mirror in which images appear. If another mirror were placed opposite it, the image from that mirror would be reflected in this one, unless there is a veil between them. The heart is a mirror that receives the impressions of knowledge, and the Tablet is a mirror in which all the impressions of knowledge are present. The heart’s preoccupation with its desires and the demands of the senses is a veil cast between it and the contemplation of the Tablet, which is from the realm of the Unseen. If a wind blows, moving and lifting this veil, something from the realm of the Unseen flashes in the mirror of the heart like fleeting lightning. It may become established and endure, or it may not endure—and this is the more common case. As long as one is awake, the heart is occupied with what the senses bring to it from the realm of dominion and the visible world, and this is a veil from the realm of the Unseen. The meaning of sleep is that the senses are subdued and do not bring their impressions to the heart. When it is freed from them and from imagination, and is pure in its essence, the veil between it and the Preserved Tablet is lifted. Then something from what is on the Tablet falls into the heart, just as an image falls from one mirror to another when the veil between them is removed. However, sleep prevents all the senses from functioning, but it does not prevent imagination from its work and its movement. Thus, what falls into the heart is immediately seized by the imagination, which imitates it with a resembling form. Imaginative forms are more firmly retained in memory than others, so the imagination remains in memory. When one awakens, only the imagination is remembered, and the interpreter must look at this imagined form to discern which meaning among meanings it is a depiction of, returning to the meanings through the connection between the imagined form and the meanings. Examples of this are evident to one who has studied the science of dream interpretation. One example should suffice you: A man said to Ibn Sirin, "I saw as if I had a ring in my hand with which I was sealing the mouths of men and the private parts of women." He said, "You are a caller to prayer who gives the call before dawn in Ramadan." The man said, "You have spoken the truth." Consider that the spirit of sealing is prevention, and for this reason sealing is intended. What is unveiled to the heart from the Preserved Tablet is the actual state of the person as it truly is—namely, that he is one who prevents people from eating and drinking. But the imagination is accustomed to associating prevention with sealing by a ring, so it depicted it with the imaginative form that contains the spirit of the meaning. What remains in memory is only the imaginative form. This is a brief glimpse from the ocean of the knowledge of dreams, whose wonders are boundless. And how could it not be, for it is the brother of death? Indeed, death is a wonder among wonders, and this is because it resembles it in one weak aspect: its effect in lifting the veil from the unseen realm, to the point that the sleeper comes to know what will be in the future. So what do we suppose of death, which tears the veil and removes the covering entirely, so that a person, at the moment the soul is severed, sees without delay—either surrounded by punishments, disgrace, and shame (we seek refuge in God from that), or enveloped in everlasting bliss and a great, endless dominion? At this point, it is said to the wretched, when the covering has been removed: "You were certainly in unmindfulness of this, and We have removed from you your covering, so your sight today is sharp." And it is said: "Is this magic, or do you not see? Enter it and be patient, or do not be patient—it is all the same to you. You are only being recompensed for what you used to do." And to them is the allusion in His saying, Exalted is He: "And there will appear to them from God that which they had never anticipated." Thus, the most knowledgeable of scholars and the wisest of sages, upon death, will have unveiled to him wonders and signs that never once crossed his mind or stirred within his conscience. If a rational person had no concern or grief other than contemplating the gravity of that state—what the veil is lifted from, and what the covering is removed from, whether it be inherent misery or permanent felicity—that alone would suffice to consume an entire lifetime. A wonder indeed is our heedlessness, with these immense matters before us. And more wondrous still is our rejoicing in our wealth and our families.

And through our means and our progeny, nay, through our limbs and our hearing and sight, even though we know with certainty that we shall part from all of that. But where is he who breathes the Spirit of Holiness into awe, uttering what was said to the Master of the Prophets: "Love whom you will, for you shall part from them; live as you will, for you shall die; and do as you will, for you shall be recompensed for it." Thus, inevitably, since that was unveiled to him with the eye of certainty, he was in the world like a wayfarer who laid not brick upon brick, nor reed upon reed, and left behind neither dinar nor dirham, nor took a beloved or an intimate friend. Indeed, he said: "If I were to take an intimate friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as an intimate friend, but your companion is the intimate friend of the All-Merciful." Thus, he clarified that the intimate friendship of the All-Merciful permeated the innermost of his heart and that His love took hold of the core of his heart, leaving no room therein for an intimate or a beloved. And he said to his community: "If you love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you." For his community is only those who follow him, and none follow him except those who turn away from this world and turn towards the Hereafter, for he called only to Allah and the Last Day, and diverted only from the world and immediate gains. Thus, to the extent you turn away from the world and turn towards the Hereafter, you have trodden his path which he trod; and to the extent you tread his path, you have followed him; and to the extent you follow him, you have become of his community; and to the extent you incline towards the world, you have deviated from his path, desired other than following him, and joined those about whom Allah, the Exalted, said: "But as for he who transgressed and preferred the life of this world, then indeed, Hellfire will be his refuge." So if you were to emerge from the abode of delusion and be just to yourself, O man—and all of us are that man—you would know that from morning until evening you strive only for immediate gains, and you move and rest only for the immediate world, then you hope to be tomorrow among his community and followers. How distant is your assumption, and how cold your hope! "Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is [wrong] with you? How do you judge?" Let us return to what we were upon and concerning, for the reins of speech have extended beyond its intended aim. And let us now mention from the dreams that reveal the states of the deceased what greatly benefits, since prophethood has gone and only glad tidings remain, and that is nothing but dreams.

(Explanation of dreams that reveal the states of the deceased and deeds beneficial in the Hereafter)

Among these is the vision of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and he said, peace be upon him: "Whoever sees me in a dream has indeed seen me truly, for Satan cannot take my form." And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in a dream, and I saw him not looking at me. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is my affair?' He turned to me and said: 'Are you not the one who kisses while you are fasting?' By the One in whose hand is my soul, I will never kiss a woman while I am fasting, ever." And al-'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I was fond of 'Umar and wished to see him in a dream, but I did not see him until near the turn of the year. I saw him wiping sweat from his forehead, saying: 'This is the time of my relief. Were it not that I met Him as Compassionate, Merciful, my throne would indeed be shaken.'" And al-Hasan ibn 'Ali said: "'Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said to me: 'The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, appeared to me tonight in a dream. I said: "O Messenger of Allah, what have you encountered from your community?" He said: "Supplicate against them." So I said: "O Allah, replace them for me with those better for me than them, and replace me for them with one worse for them than me." Then he went out and Ibn Muljam struck him.'" And some of the shaykhs said: "I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me.' But he turned away from me. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah narrated to us from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah that you never refused when asked for anything.' He said: 'No.' Then he turned to me and said: 'May Allah forgive you.'" And it is narrated from al-'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, who said: "I was a close companion to Abu Lahab, keeping company with him. When he died and Allah informed about him what He informed, I grieved for him and his matter concerned me. I asked Allah, the Exalted, for a year to show him to me in a dream." He said: "I saw him aflame with fire. I asked him about his condition, and he said: 'I have entered the Fire in torment; it is not lightened for me nor is there relief except on Monday night among all the days and nights.' I said: 'How is that?' He said: 'Muhammad, peace be upon him, was born on that night. Umm Ayman came to me and gave me the glad tidings of his birth from Aminah, so I rejoiced at him and freed a slave girl of mine out of joy for him. Thus, Allah rewarded me for that by lifting the torment from me every Monday night.'" And 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid said: "I went out for Hajj, and a man accompanied me who would not stand, sit, move, or rest without sending blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him. I asked him about that, and he said: 'I will tell you about that. The first time I went out to Mecca, my father was with me. When we turned back, I slept at one of the stopping places. While I was asleep, a visitor came to me and said: "Get up, for Allah has caused your father to die and blackened his face." I got up in alarm and lifted the cloth from his face, and he was dead with a blackened face. Terror entered me because of that. While I was in that grief, my eyes overcame me and I slept."

Then, at my father's head stood four black men holding iron rods, when a man of handsome countenance, clad in two green garments, approached and said to them, "Step aside." He wiped his face with his hand, then came to me and said, "Rise, for God has whitened your father's face." I asked, "Who are you, may my father and mother be your ransom?" He replied, "I am Muhammad." I rose and uncovered the cloth from my father's face, and behold, it was white. Never after that did I neglect to send blessings upon the Messenger of God ﷺ. And from 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, he said: I saw the Messenger of God ﷺ with Abu Bakr and 'Umar, may God be pleased with them, sitting beside him. I gave greetings and sat down. While I was seated, 'Ali and Mu'awiyah were brought and led into a house, the door closed upon them as I watched. No sooner had they entered than 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, emerged saying, "By the Lord of the Ka'bah, judgment has been passed in my favor!" And no sooner had he emerged than Mu'awiyah followed, saying, "By the Lord of the Ka'bah, I have been forgiven!" And Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, once awoke from sleep exclaiming in grief, "By God, al-Husayn has been killed!"—this before his actual slaying. His companions expressed disbelief, so he said, "I saw the Messenger of God ﷺ holding a vial of blood, and he said, 'Do you not know what my community has done after me? They have killed the son of al-Husayn, and this is his blood and the blood of his companions, which I raise to God Almighty.'" The news of his killing came twenty-four days later, on the very day he had seen it. And al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, was seen in a vision and asked, "You used to constantly say on your tongue, 'This will lead me to the watering places'—so what has God done with you?" He replied, "I said with it, 'There is no god but God,' and He led me to Paradise."

(Explanation of the Dreams of the Masters, may God's mercy be upon them all.)

One of the masters said: I saw Muttamim al-Dawraqi in a dream and asked, "O my master, what has God done with you?" He replied, "He settled me in the Gardens." It was said to him, "O Muttamim, did you find anything pleasing therein?" He said, "No, O my master." He responded, "Had you found anything pleasing therein, I would have entrusted you to it and not brought you to me." And Yusuf ibn al-Husayn was seen in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He forgave me." Asked, "By what means?" He replied, "I never mixed seriousness with levity." And from Mansur ibn Isma'il, he said: I saw 'Abdullah ibn al-Bazzar in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He stood me before Him and forgave me every sin I confessed, except one, for I was too ashamed to confess it. So He kept me standing in sweat until the flesh of my face fell away." I asked, "What was that sin?" He said, "I looked at a handsome youth and admired him, and I was ashamed before God to mention it." And Abu Ja'far al-Saydalani said: I saw the Messenger of God ﷺ in a dream, surrounded by a group of the poor. While we were thus, the sky split open and two angels descended, one holding a basin and the other a ewer. They placed the basin before the Messenger of God ﷺ, and he washed his hands, then commanded until all had washed. Then they placed the basin before me, and one said to the other, "Do not pour over his hand, for he is not of them." I said, "O Messenger of God, is it not reported from you that you said, 'A person is with those he loves'?" He said, "Yes." I said, "O Messenger of God, I love you and I love these poor ones." He ﷺ said, "Pour over his hand, for he is of them." And al-Junayd said: I saw in a dream as if I were speaking to people when an angel stood by and asked, "What is the closest means by which seekers draw near to God Almighty?" I said, "A hidden deed weighed in the balance." As I spoke, the angel said, "A successful word, by God!" And Mujammi' was seen in a dream and asked, "How did you find the matter?" He replied, "I saw that those who renounce the world have taken the best of this world and the Hereafter." And a man from Syria said to al-'Ala' ibn Ziyad, "I saw you in a dream as if you were in Paradise." He rose from his seat, turned to him, and said, "Perhaps Satan intended something, but I was protected from it," and he sent a man to kill me. And Muhammad ibn Was'i said, "A dream gladdens the believer but does not deceive him." And Salih ibn Bashir said: I saw 'Ata' al-Sulami in a dream and said, "May God have mercy on you, you were long in sorrow in the world." He said, "By God, that has brought me lasting comfort and perpetual joy." I asked, "In which ranks are you?" He replied, "With those upon whom God has bestowed favor: the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous—and excellent are those as companions." And Zurarah ibn Abi Awfa was asked in a dream, "Which deeds are most excellent in your view?" He said, "Contentment and short hopes." And Yazid ibn Madh'ur said: I saw al-Awza'i in a dream and asked, "O Abu 'Amr, guide me to a deed by which I may draw near to God Almighty." He said, "I have not seen there any rank higher than the rank of the scholars, then the rank of the grief-stricken." Yazid was a great elder, and he wept until his eyes grew dark. And Ibn 'Uyaynah said: I saw my brother in a dream and asked, "O my brother, what has God done with you?" He said, "Every sin I sought forgiveness for was forgiven me, and what I did not seek forgiveness for was not forgiven." And 'Ali al-Talhi said: I saw in a dream a woman unlike the women of this world and asked, "Who are you?" She said, "A houri." I said, "Give yourself to me in marriage." She said...

"Seek my hand in marriage from my Master, and set my dowry." I asked, "And what is your dowry?" She replied, "To restrain your soul from its afflictions." Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Harbi said, "I saw Zubaydah in a dream and asked, 'What has God done with you?' She answered, 'He forgave me.' I asked her, 'For what you spent on the road to Mecca?' She said, 'As for the expenditures I made, their rewards returned to their owners, but I was forgiven for my daughter.'"

When Sufyan al-Thawri died, he was seen in a dream and asked, "What has been done with you?" He said, "My first foot was placed on the Bridge, and the second in Paradise." Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari said, "I saw in a dream a maiden, the most beautiful I had ever seen, and her face shone with light. I asked her, 'From what is the radiance of your face?' She said, 'From remembering that night you wept.' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'I took your tear and wiped my face with it, and hence the radiance you see.'"

Al-Kattani said, "I saw al-Junayd in a dream and asked him, 'What has God done with you?' He said, 'Those allusions vanished and those expressions departed, and we gained nothing but two rak'ahs we used to pray at night.' Zubaydah was seen in a dream and asked, 'What has God done with you?' She said, 'He forgave me for these four words: "There is no god but God"—I spent my life with it; "There is no god but God"—I enter my grave with it; "There is no god but God"—I am alone with it; "There is no god but God"—I meet my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, with it.'"

And it was said, "O Bishr, are you not ashamed before Me? You used to fear Me with all that fear." Abu Sulayman was seen in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He showed me mercy." Bishr was seen in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He showed me mercy, and nothing was more harmful to me than the allusions of the people to me." Abu Bakr al-Kattani said, "I saw in a dream a youth, the most beautiful I had ever seen. I asked him, 'Who are you?' He said, 'Piety.' I said, 'Where do you dwell?' He said, 'In every sorrowful heart.' Then I turned and saw a black woman. I asked, 'Who are you?' She said, 'I am Sickness.' I said, 'Where do you dwell?' She said, 'In every joyful, merry heart.' I awoke and vowed not to laugh except if overcome."

Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz said, "I saw in a dream as if Iblis leapt upon me, and I took a stick to strike him, but he was not alarmed by it. A caller cried out to me, 'This one does not fear this; he only fears a light that is in the heart.'" Al-Masuhi said, "I saw Iblis in a dream walking naked. I said, 'Are you not ashamed before people?' He said, 'By God, these are people? If they were from people, I would not toy with them all day as children toy with a ball. Rather, people are a folk other than these; they have sickened my body'—and he pointed with his hand to our Sufi companions."

Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz said, "I was in Damascus and saw in a dream as if the Prophet, peace be upon him, came to me leaning on Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them. He came and stood over me while I was uttering some sounds and beating my chest. He said, 'The evil of this is greater than its good.'" From Ibn 'Uyaynah, he said, "I saw Sufyan al-Thawri in a dream as if he were in Paradise, flying from tree to tree, saying, 'For the like of this let the workers work.' I said to him, 'Advise me.' He said, 'Minimize acquaintance with people.'"

Abu Hatim al-Razi narrated from Qabishah ibn 'Uqbah, who said, "I saw Sufyan al-Thawri and asked, 'What has God done with you?' He said:
      I beheld my Lord face to face, and He said to me,
      'Rejoice in My pleasure with you, O son of Sa'id.
      You were one who stood in prayer when darkness fell,
      With a tear of longing and a heart devoted.
      So choose for yourself any palace you desire,
      And visit Me, for I am not far from you.'"

Al-Shibli was seen after his death by three days and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He called me to account until I despaired, and when He saw my despair, He enveloped me in His mercy." Bani 'Amir was seen after his death in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He forgave me and made me a proof against the lovers." Al-Thawri was seen in a dream and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He showed me mercy." It was said, "What is the state of Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak?" He said, "He is among those who enter upon his Lord twice every day."

Some of them were seen and asked about his state. He said, "They called us to account, scrutinized strictly, then bestowed and set free." Malik ibn Anas was seen and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He forgave me for a word that Uthman ibn 'Affan, may God be pleased with him, used to say upon seeing a funeral: 'Glory be to the Ever-Living who does not die.'" In the night al-Hasan al-Basri died, it was seen as if the gates of heaven were open and a caller called out, 'Behold, al-Hasan al-Basri has come to God, and He is pleased with him.'"

Al-Jahiz was seen and asked, "What has God done with you?" He said:
      "Write not with your hand except what will please you to see on the Day of Resurrection."

Al-Junayd saw Iblis in a dream naked and said, "Are you not ashamed before people?" He said, "And these are people? People are a folk in the mosque of al-Shuniziyyah who have worn out my body and burned my liver." Al-Junayd said, "When I awoke, I went to the mosque and saw a group who had placed their heads on their knees, contemplating. When they saw me, they said, 'Let not the talk of the wicked deceive you.'" Al-Nasr Abadhi was seen in Mecca after his death in a dream.

It was said to him, "What has God done with you?" He replied, "I was reproached with the reproach of the noble, then I was called, 'O Abu al-Qasim, after connection comes separation.' So I said, 'No, O Possessor of Majesty!' I had not been placed in the grave before I joined my Lord."

'Utbah the youth saw a houri in a dream, in a beautiful form. She said, "O 'Utbah, I am in love with you. So beware, do not perform any deed that would cause a barrier between me and you." 'Utbah said, "I have divorced the world thrice; there is no return for me to it until I meet you."

It was said that Ayyub al-Sakhtiyani saw the funeral procession of 'Asim, so he entered a passageway so as not to pray over him. Then someone saw the deceased in a dream and it was said to him, "What has God done with you?" He said, "He forgave me," and said, "Tell Ayyub: 'Say, [O Muhammad], "If you possessed the treasuries of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold out of fear of spending."'"

Some said, "I saw on the night Dawud al-Ta'i died a light, angels descending and angels ascending. I said, 'What night is this?' They said, 'The night Dawud al-Ta'i died. Paradise has been adorned for the arrival of his spirit.'"

Abu Sa'id al-Shahham said, "I saw Sahl al-Sa'luki in a dream. I said, 'O Elder.' He said, 'Leave off calling me elder.' I said, 'Those spiritual states you witnessed?' He said, 'They availed us nothing.' I said, 'What has God done with you?' He said, 'He forgave me due to questions concerning incapacity that were asked.'"

Abu Bakr al-Rashidi said, "I saw Muhammad al-Tusi the teacher in a dream. He said to me, 'Tell Abu Sa'id al-Saffar the tutor:
    "We were resolved not to turn from passion,
    But by the life of love, you have turned, and we have not."'
I awoke and mentioned that to him. He said, 'I used to visit his grave every Friday, but I did not visit it this Friday.'"

Ibn Rashid said, "I saw Ibn al-Mubarak in a dream after his death. I said, 'Have you not died?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'What has God done with you?' He said, 'He forgave me with a forgiveness that encompassed every sin.' I said, 'And Sufyan al-Thawri?' He said, 'Ah, ah! That one is "from those upon whom God has bestowed favor, of the prophets and the truthful..."'"

Al-Rabi' ibn Sulayman said, "I saw al-Shafi'i, mercy of God upon him, after his death in a dream. I said, 'O Abu 'Abdillah, what has God done with you?' He said, 'He seated me upon a chair of gold and scattered moist pearls over me.'"

A man from the companions of al-Hasan al-Basri saw, on the night al-Hasan died, as if a caller was calling out: 'Indeed, God chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of 'Imran over the worlds,' and chose al-Hasan al-Basri over the people of his time."

Abu Ya'qub al-Qari al-Daqiqi said, "I saw in my dream a tall, dark-skinned man, and people were following him. I said, 'Who is this?' They said, 'Uways al-Qarani.' I went to him and said, 'Counsel me, may God have mercy on you.' He frowned at me. I said, 'I am seeking guidance, so guide me, may God guide you.' He turned to me and said, 'Follow the mercy of your Lord at the time of His love, and beware His wrath at the time of your disobedience, and do not cut off your hope in Him amidst all that.' Then he turned away and left me."

Abu Bakr ibn Abi Maryam said, "I saw Warqa' ibn Bishr al-Hadrami. I said, 'What have you done, O Warqa'?' He said, 'Weeping from the fear of God.'"

Yazid ibn Na'amah said, "A young woman perished in the sweeping plague. Her father saw her in a dream and said to her, 'O my daughter, inform me about the Hereafter.' She said, 'O my father, we have arrived at a tremendous matter. We know but do not act, and you act but do not know. By God, a glorification or two glorifications, or a rak'ah or two rak'ahs performed in a moment of leisure, is more beloved to me than the world and all it contains.'"

One of the companions of 'Utbah the youth said, "I saw 'Utbah in a dream. I said, 'What has God done with you?' He said, 'I entered Paradise by that supplication written in your house.' When I awoke, I came to my house and found the handwriting of 'Utbah the youth on the wall of the house: 'O Guide of the misguided, O Merciful to the sinners, O Accepter of the stumbles of the stumblers, have mercy on Your servant of great peril and upon all the Muslims collectively, and place us with the living, the provided-for, those upon whom You have bestowed favor from among the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. Amen, O Lord of the worlds.'"

Musa ibn Hammad said, "I saw Sufyan al-Thawri in Paradise, flying from one palm tree to another and from one tree to another. I said, 'O Abu 'Abdillah, by what did you attain this?' He said, 'By scrupulous piety.' I said, 'What about 'Ali ibn 'Asim?' He said, 'That one is scarcely seen except as a star is seen.'"

A man from the Followers saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, in a dream and said, "O Messenger of God, admonish me." He said, "Yes. Whoever does not take stock of his deficiency is in deficiency, and whoever is in deficiency, death is better for him."

Al-Shafi'i, mercy of God upon him, said, "An affair overcame me in these days that distressed and pained me, and none but God, the Mighty and Majestic, was aware of it. Last night, a visitor came to me in my dream and said to me, 'O Muhammad ibn Idris, say: O God, I possess for myself neither benefit nor harm, nor death, nor life, nor resurrection. I cannot take except what You have given me, nor guard against except what You have protected me from. O God, so grant me success in what You love and are pleased with of speech and action, in well-being.'"

I have now prepared that. When the day had advanced, God Almighty granted me my request and facilitated my deliverance from what I was in. So, adhere to these supplications; do not neglect them. This is a collection of spiritual unveilings that indicate the states of the deceased and the deeds that draw one nearer to God. After this, we shall mention what lies before the deceased, from the initial blast of the Trumpet to the final abode, whether in Paradise or in the Fire. And praise be to God, the praise of the thankful.

[The second part of the book: The Remembrance of Death, concerning the states of the deceased from the time of the Trumpet's blast to the final settlement in Paradise or the Fire, and a detailing of the terrors and perils that lie before him.] In it is an explanation of the Trumpet's blast, the description of the land of the Gathering and its people, the description of the length of the Day of Resurrection, the description of the Day of Resurrection and its calamities and its names, the description of the questioning about sins, the description of the Scales, the description of the disputants and the restitution of wrongs, the description of the Bridge, the description of Intercession, the description of the Pool, the description of Hell and its terrors, its shackles, its serpents, and its scorpions, the description of Paradise and the varieties of its bliss, the number of its gardens, its gates, its chambers, its walls, its rivers, its trees, the clothing of its people, their furnishings and their couches, the description of their food, the description of the wide-eyed maidens and the immortal youths, the description of gazing upon the Countenance of God Almighty, and a chapter on the vastness of His mercy, Almighty is He, with which the book is concluded, God willing.

(Description of the Trumpet's Blast)
You have come to know in what preceded the states of the deceased in the agonies of death and his peril in the fear of the outcome, then his suffering the darkness of the grave and its worms, then [his encounter with] Munkar and Nakir and their questioning, then the torment of the grave and its peril if he is one upon whom wrath has fallen. Greater than all of that are the perils that lie before him: the blowing of the Trumpet, the resurrection on the Day of Rising, the presentation before the Compeller, the questioning about the little and the much, the setting up of the Scales to ascertain the measures, then the crossing of the Bridge despite its fineness and sharpness, then awaiting the call at the decree of judgment, either to felicity or to wretchedness. These are states and terrors which you must necessarily know, then believe in with certainty and affirmation, then prolong reflection upon, so that from your heart may arise the motives to prepare for them. Most people have not had faith in the Last Day enter the core of their hearts, nor has it taken firm root in the innermost recesses of their breasts. Indicative of this is their intense exertion and preparation for the heat of summer and the cold of winter, and their heedlessness regarding the heat of Hell and its bitter cold, along with the difficulties and terrors that encompass it. Rather, if they are asked about the Last Day, their tongues utter it, then their hearts become heedless of it. Whoever is informed that the food before him is poisoned, and says to his companion who saw it, "You have spoken the truth," then stretches forth his hands to take it, has affirmed with his tongue but belied with his action, and the denial of action is more severe than the denial of the tongue. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (God Almighty said: The son of Adam has reviled Me, though it is not fitting for him to revile Me, and he has belied Me, though it is not fitting for him to belie Me. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying, 'I have a child.' As for his belying Me, it is his saying, 'He will not restore me as He originated me.') The weakness of the inner selves regarding the strength of certainty and affirmation of the resurrection and rising is only due to the lack of understanding in this world of such matters. If a person did not witness the procreation of animals and it was said to him that a maker creates from a drop of fluid a being like this fashioned, rational, speaking, and capable human, his inner self would strongly recoil from affirming it. Therefore, God Almighty said: "Does man not see that We created him from a drop? Then, behold, he is a clear adversary." And He said: "Does man think that he will be left neglected? Was he not a drop of emitted semen? Then he became a clinging clot; then He created and proportioned and made from him the two sexes, male and female." In the creation of the human, with the multitude of its wonders and the differing composition of its limbs, are wonders that exceed the wonders in his resurrection and restoration. So how can one who witnesses that in His creation and power deny that from the power and wisdom of God Almighty? If there is weakness in your faith, then strengthen faith by contemplating the first creation, for the second is like it and easier than it. If you are strong in faith regarding it, then make your heart feel those fears and perils, and increase in reflection and taking lesson therein, so that ease and tranquility may be stripped from your heart, and you may busy yourself with preparing for the presentation before the Compeller. First, reflect on what strikes the hearing of the inhabitants of the graves from the intensity of the Trumpet's blast, for it is a single cry by which the graves are split open over the heads of the deceased, and they rise up all at once. Imagine yourself having sprung forth, your face altered, your body dust-covered from your head to your feet from the dust of your grave, stunned by the severity of the shock, your eyes fixed towards the call, while creation has risen up in a single uprising from the graves in which their tribulation was long, and alarm and terror have roused them, added to what was with them of sorrows, griefs, and the intensity of awaiting the outcome of the matter, as He said...

He, the Exalted, said: "And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth will fall dead, except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." And He, the Exalted, said: "Then when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast, that Day will be a difficult day for the disbelievers, not easy." And He, the Exalted, said: "And they say, 'When is this promise, if you should be truthful?' They await not but one blast which will seize them while they are disputing. And they will not be able to make a testament, nor to their families will they return. And the Trumpet will be blown, and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten. They will say, 'O woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping place?' [The reply will be], 'This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.'"

If there were nothing before the dead except the terror of that blast, it would be sufficient to inspire fear. For it is a blast and a shout by which all who are in the heavens and the earth are struck dead—meaning they die by it—except whom Allah wills, and that is some of the angels. For this reason, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "How can I be at ease when the bearer of the Trumpet has placed the horn to his mouth, lowered his forehead, and inclined his ear, awaiting when he will be commanded to blow?" Muqatil said: The Trumpet is the horn. Israfil, upon him be peace, places his mouth upon the horn like a trumpet, and the circumference of the horn's head is like the breadth of the heavens and the earth. He is gazing intently towards the Throne, waiting for when he will be commanded to blow the first blast. When he blows, all who are in the heavens and the earth are struck dead—meaning every living creature dies from the intensity of the terror—except whom Allah wills, and they are Gabriel, Michael, Israfil, and the Angel of Death. Then the Angel of Death is commanded to take the soul of Gabriel, then the soul of Michael, then the soul of Israfil. Then the Angel of Death is commanded, and he dies. Then the creation remains after the first blast in the Barzakh for forty years. Then Allah, the Exalted, revives Israfil and commands him to blow the second blast. That is His saying, the Exalted: "Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on." They will be standing on their feet, looking at the Resurrection. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "When I was sent as a prophet, I was sent to the bearer of the Trumpet. He brought it to his mouth, placed one foot forward and the other back, waiting for when he would be commanded to blow. So fear the blast."

Reflect upon the creation, their humiliation, their brokenness, and their submission at the time of being raised, in fear of this death-stroke and in anticipation of what is decreed for them of happiness or wretchedness. And you are among them, broken as they are broken, bewildered as they are bewildered. Rather, if you were among the affluent and the wealthy enjoying luxury in this world, the kings of the earth on that Day are the most humbled people of the gathering place, the smallest and most insignificant of them. They will be trodden underfoot like ants. At that time, the wild beasts from the deserts and the mountains will come forward, their heads lowered, mingled with the creation after their wildness, humbled for the Day of Resurrection, not due to any sin they have been defiled by, but their gathering is due to the intensity of the death-stroke and the terror of the blast, and that preoccupies them from fleeing from the creation and being wild among them. That is His saying, the Exalted: "And when the wild beasts are gathered." Then the rebellious devils, after their rebellion and insolence, will come forward, submitting humbly from the awe of the presentation before Allah, the Exalted, confirming His saying, the Exalted: "So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them around Hell on their knees." So reflect upon your state and the state of your heart there.

(Description of the Gathering Ground and Its People)

Then observe how they are driven after the resurrection and being raised, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, to the Gathering Ground—a white land, a level plain. You see in it no crookedness nor elevation. You see upon it no hill behind which a person can hide, nor a depression lowering from sight. Rather, it is a single, smooth, level ground with no variation. They are driven to it in groups. So glory be to the One who gathers the creation despite the differences in their kinds from the corners of the earth when He drives them with the Shaker, followed by the Follower. The Shaker is the first blast, and the Follower is the second blast. It is truly fitting for those hearts to be trembling on that Day and for those eyes to be humbled. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "The people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection on a white, reddish-white earth like a pure loaf of bread, with no landmark for anyone." The narrator said: Al-'Afrah is a whiteness that is not brilliant, and an-Naqee is the pure flour free from bran and husk. 'No landmark' means there is no structure to provide cover, nor variation to divert the gaze. Do not think that land is like the earth of this world. Rather, they are equal only in name. He, the Exalted, said: "On the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens [as well]." Ibn 'Abbas said: It increases and decreases, and its trees, mountains, valleys, and what is in it vanish. It is stretched out like the stretching of the hide of the 'Ukaz market—a white land like silver, upon which no blood has been spilled and upon which no sin has been committed. The heavens lose their sun, moon, and stars. So look, O wretched one, at the terror and severity of that Day. For when the creation is gathered on this level ground, the stars of the sky will scatter above them, the sun and moon will be extinguished, and the earth will darken as its lamp is quenched.

While they were in that state, the heavens above their heads began to revolve and split apart, despite their immense thickness and solidity of five hundred years, with angels standing upon their edges and corners. Imagine the terror of the sound of their splitting in your hearing, and the awe of the day when the sky will split apart despite its firmness and strength, then collapse and flow like molten silver, tinged with a yellowness until it becomes like red oil. The sky will become like molten brass, the mountains like carded wool, and people will be scattered like moths, walking barefoot and naked. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "People will be resurrected barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised, with sweat overwhelming them, reaching up to their earlobes." Sawdah, the wife of the Prophet and narrator of the hadith, said: "I exclaimed, 'O Messenger of God, how terrible! Will we see each other?' He replied, 'The people will be too preoccupied with their own affairs: "Every man that Day will have concern enough to make him heedless."'" So reflect greatly on the day when private parts will be exposed, and yet looking and turning will be safe. How much more so when some will be walking on their bellies and faces, unable to turn to look at others. Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "People will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in three groups: riders, walkers, and on their faces." A man asked, "O Messenger of God, how can they walk on their faces?" He said, "The One who made them walk on their feet is capable of making them walk on their faces." It is in human nature to deny anything one is not accustomed to. Had a person not seen a snake slithering on its belly like a flash of lightning, they would deny the possibility of moving without legs. Even walking with legs seems improbable to one who has not witnessed it. Beware of denying any of the wonders of the Day of Resurrection simply because they contradict worldly analogies, for if you had not witnessed the wonders of this world and they were described to you beforehand, you would have denied them even more vehemently. So envision in your heart your own image: standing naked, exposed, humiliated, defeated, bewildered, stunned, awaiting the decree that will befall you—whether bliss or misery. Magnify this state in your mind, for it is immense.

(Description of the Sweat)

Then contemplate the crowding of creation and their assembly, until the inhabitants of the seven heavens and seven earths—angels, jinn, humans, devils, beasts, predators, and birds—are crammed into the gathering place. The sun will rise upon them, its heat multiplied and its nature transformed from its former mildness. It will be brought near to the heads of all beings, as close as the distance of two bow-lengths or nearer. No shadow will remain on earth except the shadow of the Lord of the Worlds, and none will be able to take shelter in it except those brought near. So among them will be those shaded by the Throne, and those exposed to the sun's heat, melted by its blaze, their distress and anguish intensified by its scorching. Then the creatures will jostle and push one another due to the severe crowding and differing paces, compounded by intense shame and modesty from exposure and the desire to hide when presented before the Compeller of the heavens. Thus, the scorching of the sun, the heat of breaths, and the burning of hearts with the fire of shame and fear will combine, causing sweat to gush from the root of every hair until it flows upon the plain of Resurrection. Then it will rise upon their bodies according to their ranks with God: for some, the sweat will reach their knees; for others, their waists; for others, to their earlobes; and for others, they will nearly be submerged in it. Ibn 'Umar reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "On the Day when people stand before the Lord of the Worlds, one of them will be submerged in his sweat up to half his ears." Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "People will sweat on the Day of Resurrection until their sweat goes seventy cubits into the earth, overwhelming them and reaching their ears." So it is narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Sahih. In another hadith: "Standing, their eyes fixed on the sky for forty years, sweat will overwhelm them from the intensity of distress." 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The sun will draw near to the earth on the Day of Resurrection, and people will sweat. Among them, some will have sweat reaching their ankles, some halfway up their shins, some their knees, some their thighs, some their waists, and some their mouths"—and he gestured with his hand to his mouth—"and some will be covered by sweat," and he struck his hand upon his head like this. So reflect, O wretched one, upon the sweat of the people of the gathering and the intensity of their distress, among whom will be those who cry out, "My Lord, relieve me from this distress and waiting, even if to the Fire!" And all this before they have even faced the reckoning or punishment. For you are one of them, and you do not know how high the sweat will reach you. Know that every sweat not expended through exertion in the path of God—in pilgrimage, jihad, fasting, night prayer, striving to fulfill a Muslim's need, or bearing hardship in enjoining good and forbidding evil—will be extracted by shame and fear on the plain of Resurrection, and the distress will be prolonged. If the son of Adam were saved from ignorance and delusion, he would know that the sweat of exertion in bearing the difficulties of obedience is a lighter matter and shorter in duration than the sweat of distress and waiting on the Day of Resurrection.

A day of immense gravity, its intensity prolonged, its duration lengthy.
                            (Description of the Length of the Day of Resurrection)
A day when the creatures will stand, their eyes staring, their hearts rent asunder. They will not speak, nor will any regard be given to their affairs. They will stand for three hundred years, not eating a single meal therein, nor drinking a single drink, nor finding therein the breath of a breeze. Ka'b and Qatadah said concerning, "The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds" (83:6), that they will stand for the measure of three hundred years. Nay, Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) recited this verse and then said: "How would it be with you if God gathered you as arrows are gathered in a quiver for fifty thousand years and did not look at you?" And al-Hasan said: "What is your thought concerning a day in which they stood upon their feet for the measure of fifty thousand years, not eating a single meal therein, nor drinking a single drink, until when their necks were severed from thirst and their bellies burned from hunger, they were turned to the Fire and given to drink from a boiling spring whose heat had reached its peak and whose scorching blaze had intensified. When their utmost exertion reached what they had no power to bear, some of them spoke to others, seeking one who would be honored by his Lord to intercede on their behalf. But they clung to no prophet except that he pushed them away and said, 'Leave me, myself, myself! My own affair preoccupies me from the affair of another.' And each one excused himself due to the severity of the wrath of God Almighty, saying, 'Our Lord has become wrathful today a wrath like which He has never been wrathful before, nor will He be wrathful after its like,' until our Prophet (peace be upon him) intercedes for those for whom permission is granted therein: 'None will possess the power of intercession except he to whom the Most Merciful gives permission and approves of his word' (20:109). So contemplate the length of this day and the severity of waiting therein, so that the waiting for patience from sins in your brief lifespan may become light upon you. And know that whoever's waiting in this world for death is prolonged due to the severity of his struggle for patience against desires, his waiting on that Day in particular will be shortened." The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, when asked about the length of that day: "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it will indeed be lightened for the believer until it becomes easier for him than a prescribed prayer he prays in the world." So strive to be among those believers. As long as a breath of your life remains, the matter is up to you, and preparation is in your hands. So work in short days for long days, gaining a profit whose joy has no end. And deem insignificant your lifespan—nay, the lifespan of this world, which is seven thousand years—for if you were to be patient for, for example, seven thousand years to be delivered from a day whose measure is fifty thousand, your profit would be great and your toil slight.
                      (Description of the Day of Resurrection, its Calamities, and its Names)
So prepare, O wretched one, for this day of tremendous import, lengthy time, overpowering dominion, and imminent arrival. A day when you will see the sky split asunder, the stars scattered from its terror, the shining stars extinguished, the sun rolled up, the mountains set in motion, the pregnant camels neglected, the wild beasts gathered, the seas set ablaze, the souls paired with their bodies, Hellfire stoked, Paradise brought near, the mountains pulverized, the earth stretched forth. A day when you will see the earth quaking with its quake, and the earth will cast out its burdens. On that Day, mankind will proceed in diverse groups to be shown their deeds. A day when the earth and the mountains will be lifted and crushed with a single crushing. Then on that Day, the Inevitable Event will occur, and the sky will be cleft asunder, for it will be frail on that Day, and the angels will be at its edges. And the Throne of your Lord will be borne above them on that Day by eight. On that Day you will be presented, nothing of you hidden. A day when the mountains will move and you will see the earth laid bare. A day when the earth will be shaken with a shaking, and the mountains will be crumbled to powder, becoming scattered dust. A day when mankind will be like scattered moths, and the mountains will be like carded wool. A day when every nursing mother will be distracted from that which she nursed, and every pregnant female will deliver her burden, and you will see mankind intoxicated, yet they are not intoxicated, but the punishment of God is severe. A day when the earth will be changed to a different earth, and the heavens, and they will appear before God, the One, the Subduer. A day when the mountains will be blown away, leaving a level plain wherein you will see no crookedness nor curvature. A day when you will see the mountains, thinking them firmly fixed, yet they will pass like the passing of clouds. A day when the sky will be split open, becoming rose-colored like oil. Then on that Day, no human or jinn will be asked about his sin. A day when the disobedient will be prevented from speech, and no inquiry will be made therein about crimes; rather, they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet. A day when every soul will find what it did of good present, and what it did of evil—it will wish there were a vast distance between it and that. A day when every soul will know what it has brought forth, and will bear witness to what it sent ahead and left behind. A day when tongues will be silenced and limbs will speak. A day whose mention turned grey the Master of the Messengers when al-Siddiq (may God be pleased with him) said to him: "I see you have turned grey, O Messenger of God." He said: "Surah Hud and its sisters turned me grey"—and they are al-Waqi'ah, al-Mursalat, 'Amma yatasa'alun, and Idha al-shamsu kuwirat. So O incapable reader, your portion from your reading is merely that you mumble the Quran and move your tongue with it.

If you were truly contemplating what you recite, you would be worthy of having your gall bladder burst from the bitterness that tinged the hair of the Master of the Messengers. If you content yourself with the movement of the tongue, you have been deprived of the fruit of the Qur'an. The Resurrection is one of the matters mentioned therein, and Allah has described some of its calamities and multiplied its names, so that through the abundance of its names we may comprehend the abundance of its meanings. The purpose of the numerous names is not the mere repetition of names and titles; rather, the aim is to alert those of understanding. Beneath each name of the Resurrection lies a secret, and within every attribute ascribed to it is a meaning. Therefore, strive to know their meanings. We shall now gather its names for you. They are: The Day of Resurrection, the Day of Regret, the Day of Remorse, the Day of Reckoning, the Day of Questioning, the Day of Racing, the Day of Scrutiny, the Day of Competition, the Day of the Earthquake, the Day of the Great Convulsion, the Day of the Thunderbolt, the Day of the Inevitable, the Day of the Striking Calamity, the Day of the Quaking, the Day of the Successive Blow, the Day of the Overwhelming Event, the Day of the Disaster, the Day of the Approaching, the Day of the Inevitable Truth, the Day of the Overwhelming Catastrophe, the Day of the Deafening Blast, the Day of the Meeting, the Day of Separation, the Day of the Drive, the Day of Retribution, the Day of the Mutual Calling, the Day of Account, the Day of Return, the Day of Punishment, the Day of Flight, the Day of the Abode, the Day of the Meeting, the Day of Permanence, the Day of the Decree, the Day of Recompense, the Day of Trial, the Day of Weeping, the Day of Gathering, the Day of the Threat, the Day of the Presentation, the Day of the Weighing, the Day of Truth, the Day of Judgment, the Day of Decision, the Day of Assembly, the Day of Raising, the Day of Victory, the Day of Disgrace, a Great Day, a Barren Day, a Difficult Day, the Day of Recompense, the Day of Certainty, the Day of Emergence, the Day of Destination, the Day of the Blast, the Day of the Shout, the Day of the Tremor, the Day of the Great Quake, the Day of the Stern Command, the Day of Stupefaction, the Day of Terror, the Day of the End, the Day of Distress, the Day of the Abode, the Day of the Appointed Time, the Day of Refuge, the Day of the Watch, the Day of Anxiety, the Day of Sweat, the Day of Need, the Day of Denial, the Day of Dispersal, the Day of Splitting, the Day of Standing, the Day of Emergence, the Day of Eternity, the Day of Mutual Loss and Gain, a Frowning Day, a Known Day, the Hour, a Witnessed Day, a Day about which there is no doubt, a Day when secrets are tested, a Day when no soul will avail another in the least, a Day when gazes will be fixed, a Day when no protector will avail another in the least, a Day when no soul will have power for another, a Day when they will be called to the Fire of Hell, a Day when they will be dragged upon their faces into the Fire, a Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire, a Day when no parent will avail his child, a Day when a man will flee from his brother, his mother, and his father, a Day when they will not speak nor be permitted to offer excuses, a Day from which there is no repelling from Allah, a Day when they will be exposed, a Day when they will be tried over the Fire, a Day when wealth and children will not avail, a Day when the wrongdoers' excuses will not avail them, and for them is the curse, and for them is the evil abode, a Day when excuses will be returned, secrets will be tested, consciences will be laid bare, and veils will be removed, a Day when gazes will be downcast, voices will be stilled, turning away will be scarce, hidden things will be exposed, and sins will be manifest, a Day when the servants will be driven, with their witnesses accompanying them, the young will turn grey, and the old will be stupefied. On that Day, the Scales will be set up, the Records will be spread open, Hellfire will be made manifest, the scalding water will boil, the Fire will roar, the disbelievers will despair, the Fires will be stoked, complexions will be changed, the tongue will be silenced, and the limbs of man will speak. O mankind, what has deluded you concerning your Generous Lord, when the doors are closed, the curtains are drawn, and you are concealed from creation, yet you commit immorality? What will you do when your own limbs bear witness against you? So woe, utter woe to us, the company of the heedless! Allah sends to us the Master of the Messengers and reveals to him the Clear Book, informing us of these attributes describing the Day of Recompense. Then He makes known our heedlessness, saying: "The reckoning of the people has drawn near, while they are in heedlessness, turning away. No mention comes to them from their Lord, newly revealed, but they listen to it while they are playing, their hearts distracted." Then He informs us of the nearness of the Hour, saying: "The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split." "Indeed, they see it as distant, but We see it as near." "And what will make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near." Then the best of our states is that we take the study of this Qur'an as a practice, yet we do not ponder its meanings, nor do we reflect upon the multitude of descriptions and names of this Day, nor do we prepare to escape its calamities. So we seek refuge in Allah from this heedlessness, unless Allah encompasses us with His vast mercy.

(Description of the Questioning)

Then reflect, O wretched one, after these states, upon the questioning that will be directed to you verbally, without an interpreter. You will be asked about the little and the much, the speck on a date-stone and the thin membrane covering it. While you are in the distress of the Resurrection, its sweat, and the severity of its great terrors, angels descend from the highest heaven with massive bodies and enormous forms, harsh and severe, commanded to seize the forelocks of the criminals to the standing place of presentation before the Compeller.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, God Almighty has an angel between the two edges of whose eyes is a distance of one hundred years' journey." So what do you think of yourself when you witness, for example, these angels sent to you to take you to the station of presentation, and you see them, despite the immensity of their forms, humbled by the severity of the Day, trembling from what has become apparent of the wrath of the Compeller upon His servants? At their descent, no prophet, no saint, nor any righteous person remains but that they fall upon their chins in fear that they might be the ones taken. This is the state of those brought near, so what do you think of the sinful transgressors?

At that time, groups of people, from the intensity of terror, will hasten to say to the angels: "Is our Lord among you?" due to the grandeur of their procession and the intensity of their awe. The angels will be alarmed by their question, venerating their Creator from being among them, and they will call out with their voices, declaring their Lord transcendent above what the people of the earth have imagined, saying: "Glory be to our Lord! He is not among us, but He is coming thereafter."

At that point, the angels will stand in rows, encircling the creatures from all sides, and upon all of them will be the marks of humility and submission, and the state of fear and awe due to the severity of the Day. Then God Almighty will fulfill His word: "And We shall certainly question those to whom messengers were sent, and We shall certainly question the messengers. Then We shall relate to them with knowledge, and We were not absent." And His word: "So by your Lord, We will surely question them all about what they used to do."

Then He, glorified be He, will begin with the prophets: "The Day when God will gather the messengers and say, 'What response were you given?' They will say, 'We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.'" Oh, the severity of a day when the minds of the prophets are bewildered and their knowledge is erased from the intensity of awe, when they are asked, 'What response were you given?'—when they had been sent to the creatures and they had known. Their minds are stunned, so they do not know how to answer, and they say from the intensity of awe, 'We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.' And they are truthful at that time, for their intellects have fled and their knowledge has been erased, until God Almighty strengthens them.

Then Noah, peace be upon him, will be called and it will be said to him: 'Did you convey?' He will say: 'Yes.' It will be said to his people: 'Did it reach you?' They will say: 'No warner came to us.' Jesus, peace be upon him, will be brought, and God Almighty will say to him: 'Did you say to the people, "Take me and my mother as gods besides God"?' He will remain convulsing under the awe of this question for years. Oh, the greatness of a day when accountability is established upon the prophets with a question like this!

Then the angels will come forward and call out one by one: 'O so-and-so, son of so-and-so, come forth to the station of presentation!' At that, limbs will tremble, joints will shake, minds will be confounded, and groups will wish they could be taken to the Fire rather than have the foulness of their deeds presented before the Compeller and their coverings unveiled before the gathering of all creatures.

Before the questioning begins, the light of the Throne will appear—"and the earth will shine with the light of its Lord"—and every servant will be certain of the Compeller's approach to question the servants. Each one will think that no one sees him but Him, and that he alone is the one taken for accountability and questioning, to the exclusion of all others. Then the Compeller, glorified and exalted be He, will say at that time: 'O Gabriel, bring the Fire.' Gabriel will come for it and say: 'O Hell, respond to your Creator and your Sovereign.' Gabriel will find it in its rage and wrath. No sooner is it called than it surges, boils, snorts towards the creatures, and gasps. The creatures will hear its rage and its snorting, and its keepers will rise up, springing towards the creatures in wrath against those who disobeyed God Almighty and opposed His command.

So let your mind consider and your heart envision the state of the servants' hearts when they are filled with terror and dread. They will fall down on their knees and turn their backs in flight—"the Day you will see every nation kneeling"—and some of them will fall upon their faces, prone. The sinners and wrongdoers will cry out, 'Woe! Ruin!' and the truthful will cry, 'Myself! Myself!'

While they are in that state, Hell will snort its second snort, doubling their fear and causing their strength to fail, and they will think they are being taken. Then it will snort its third snort, and the creatures will fall upon their faces, and they will stare with their eyes, looking from a hidden, humble corner. At that, the hearts of the wrongdoers will be crushed, reaching their throats, choking, and the minds of the blissful and the wretched alike will be bewildered.

Thereafter, God Almighty will turn to the messengers and say, 'What response were you given?' When they see what accountability has been established upon the prophets, terror will intensify upon the sinners. The parent will flee from their child, the brother from his brother, the husband from his wife, and each one will remain awaiting his own command.

Then they will be taken one by one, and God Almighty will question him directly about the little and the much of his deeds, about his secret and his public acts, and about all his limbs and organs. Abu Hurairah said: They asked, 'O Messenger of God, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?' He said, 'Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when there is no cloud obscuring it?' They said, 'No.' He said, 'Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a night when it is full and there is no cloud obscuring it?' They said, 'No.' He said, 'By the One in whose hand is my soul, you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord.' Then the servant will be cast and he will say...

Did I not honor you, make you master, give you in marriage, and subjugate horses and camels for you, allowing you to lead and dwell in comfort? The servant will say, "Yes." He will say, "Did you suppose you would meet Me?" The servant will say, "No." He will then say, "I will forget you as you forgot Me." Imagine yourself, O wretched one, when the angels have taken you by your arms and you are standing before God, exalted is He, and He questions you directly, saying: "Did I not bestow youth upon you? In what did you expend it? Did I not grant you respite in life? In what did you waste it? Did I not provide you with wealth? From where did you earn it, and on what did you spend it? Did I not honor you with knowledge? What did you do with what you learned?" How then do you see your shame and disgrace as He enumerates His blessings upon you and your acts of disobedience, His favors and your misdeeds? If you deny, your own limbs will testify against you. Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: We were with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he laughed, then said, "Do you know why I laughed?" We said, "God and His Messenger know best." He said, "From the servant's dialogue with his Lord. He will say, 'O Lord, did You not protect me from injustice?' He will say, 'Yes.' He will then say, 'I do not accept for Myself any witness except from Myself.' He will say, 'Your own soul is sufficient as a reckoner against you today, and the noble scribes as witnesses.'" He said, "Then his mouth will be sealed, and it will be said to his limbs, 'Speak.'" He said, "So they will speak with his deeds. Then he will be left to speak, and he will say to his limbs, 'Away with you, be gone! It was for your sake that I strayed.'" So we seek refuge in God from being exposed before the entire creation by the testimony of the limbs, except that God, exalted is He, has promised the believer that He will cover him and not expose him to others. A man asked Ibn 'Umar, saying to him, "How did you hear the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, speak concerning the private discourse?" He said, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'One of you will be brought so near to his Lord that He places His veil over him and says, "Did you do such and such?" He will say, "Yes." He will say, "Did you do such and such?" He will say, "Yes." Then He will say, "I concealed it for you in the world, and I forgive it for you today."'" And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever conceals the fault of a believer, God will conceal his fault on the Day of Resurrection." This is only hoped for a believing servant who concealed people's faults, bore their shortcomings against himself, did not move his tongue to mention their misdeeds, and did not speak of them in their absence with what they would dislike if they heard it. Such a one is worthy of being recompensed with the same on the Day of Resurrection. Even if He has concealed it from others, has not the call to the presentation reached your hearing? Is not that terror sufficient recompense for your sins, when you are seized by your forelock and led forth, your heart agitated, your mind bewildered, your limbs trembling, your color changed, and the world dark upon you from the intensity of the terror? Imagine yourself in this state, stepping over necks, breaking through rows, being led as a worn-out horse is led, while all creation has raised their eyes to you. Imagine yourself in the hands of those entrusted with you in this state until they bring you to the Throne of the Merciful, then cast you from their hands, and God, glorious and exalted is He, calls you with His mighty word: "O son of Adam, draw near to Me." So you draw near to Him with a palpitating, sorrowful, fearful, and humble heart, a downcast gaze, and a broken heart, and you are given your record, which leaves nothing small or great but that it has accounted it. How many obscenities you had forgotten, then remembered! How many acts of obedience you were heedless of their faults, then their defects were unveiled to you! How much shame and cowardice is yours! How much constraint and incapacity is yours! I wonder, upon which foot will you stand before Him, with which tongue will you answer, with which heart will you comprehend what you say? Then reflect upon the magnitude of your life when He reminds you of your sins directly, saying: "O My servant, were you not ashamed of Me, yet you confronted Me with the ugly, and were ashamed of My creation, so you showed them the good? Was I more trivial to you than My other servants? You took lightly My observation of you and did not care, yet you deemed great the observation of others. Did I not bestow favors upon you? What made you heedless of Me? Did you suppose that I do not see you and that you would not meet Me?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "There is not one of you except that God, the Lord of the worlds, will question him, with no veil between them and no interpreter." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "One of you will surely stand before God, mighty and majestic, with no veil between them, and He will say to him, 'Did I not bestow favors upon you? Did I not give you what you have?' He will say, 'Yes.' He will say, 'Did I not send a messenger to you?' He will say, 'Yes.' Then he will look to his right and see nothing but Hellfire, then look to his left and see nothing but Hellfire. So let one of you protect himself from the Fire, even with half a date; if he does not find that, then with a good word.'" Ibn Mas'ud said it similarly: "There is not one of you except that God, mighty and majestic, will seclude Himself with him as one of you secludes himself with the moon on the night of the full moon, then He will say, 'O son of Adam, what made you heedless of Me? O son of Adam, what did you do with what you knew? O son of Adam, how did you answer the messengers? O son of Adam, was I not a watcher over your eye when you looked with it at what is not lawful for you? Was I not a watcher over your ears?'" And so on, enumerating all his other limbs. And Mujahid said: "The feet of a servant will not move from before God, mighty and majestic, on the Day of Resurrection until he is questioned about four matters: about his life, in what he spent it; about his knowledge, what he did with it; about his body..."

In what he has expended and from his wealth, from where he earned it and on what he spent it. So be awed, O wretched one, by your shame before that, and by your peril, for you are between being told, "I concealed it for you in the world, and I forgive it for you today," at which your joy and delight would be immense, and the former and later generations would envy you; or it being said to the angels, "Take this evil servant, bind him, then cast him into Hell," at which, if the heavens and the earth were to weep for you, it would be fitting for the enormity of your calamity and the intensity of your regret for what you neglected of obedience to God and for what you sold your Hereafter for—a base world that did not remain with you.

Then do not neglect to contemplate the Balance and the flying of the books to the right and the left. For after the questioning, people are of three groups: a group who have no good deed, so a black neck emerges from the Fire, gathering them as a bird gathers seeds, enfolds them, and casts them into the Fire, and the Fire swallows them, and a call is made upon them: "Misery, after which there is no happiness." Another group have no evil deed, so a caller calls out, "Let those who praise God in every circumstance rise," so they rise and are sent forth to Paradise. Then the same is done for the people who pray at night, then for those whom worldly trade and its sale did not distract from the remembrance of God Almighty, and a call is made upon them: "Happiness, after which there is no misery." A third group remains, and they are the majority, who mixed a righteous deed and another evil one. It may be hidden from them, but it is not hidden from God Almighty, whether their good deeds or their evil deeds predominate. But God refuses except to make them know that, to manifest His grace in pardon and His justice in punishment. So the scrolls and books fly, enfolded upon the good deeds and evil deeds, and the Balance is set up, and gazes are fixed upon the books—will they fall to the right or to the left?—then upon the tongue of the Balance—will it incline to the side of evil deeds or to the side of good deeds? This is a tremendous state in which the minds of creation are bewildered. Al-Hasan narrated: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had his head in 'A'ishah's lap, may God be pleased with her, and he dozed. She remembered the Hereafter and wept until her tears flowed and dropped onto the cheek of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He awoke and said, 'What makes you weep, O 'A'ishah?' She said, 'I remembered the Hereafter. Will you remember your families on the Day of Resurrection?' He said, 'By the One in Whose hand is my soul, in three places no one will remember except himself: when the scales are placed and the deeds are weighed, until a son of Adam sees whether his scale is light or heavy; and at the scrolls, until he sees whether he takes his book with his right hand or his left; and at the Bridge.'"

From Anas: "The son of Adam will be brought on the Day of Resurrection until he is made to stand between the two pans of the Balance, and an angel is entrusted with him. If his scale is heavy, the angel calls out with a voice heard by all creation, 'So-and-so is happy, a happiness after which he will never be miserable.' If his scale is light, he calls out with a voice heard by all creation, 'So-and-so is miserable, a misery after which he will never be happy.' And when the pan of good deeds is light, the Zabaniyah advance, with iron maces in their hands, wearing garments of fire, and they take the share of the Fire to the Fire." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said regarding the Day of Resurrection: "It is a day when God Almighty calls Adam, peace be upon him, and says to him, 'Rise, O Adam, and send forth the contingent to the Fire.' He says, 'And how many is the contingent to the Fire?' He says, 'From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.' When the Companions heard that, they were dismayed until not one of them showed a smile. When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw what was with his Companions, he said, 'Strive and receive glad tidings, for by the One in Whose hand is Muhammad's soul, with you are two creations that were never with anyone except they outnumbered those who perished from the Children of Adam and the Children of Iblis.' They said, 'And what are they, O Messenger of God?' He said, 'Gog and Magog.' So relief came to the people. Then he said, 'Strive and receive glad tidings, for by the One in Whose hand is Muhammad's soul, you among people on the Day of Resurrection are but like a mole on a camel's side or like a mark on a beast's foreleg.'"

You have known the terror of the Balance and its peril, and that eyes are fixed upon the tongue of the Balance: "Then as for him whose scales are heavy, he will be in a pleasant life. But as for him whose scales are light, his refuge will be an abyss. And what will convey to you what that is? A blazing Fire." And know that none is saved from the peril of the Balance except he who, in this world, held his soul to account and weighed therein with the scale of the Sacred Law his deeds, his words, his passing thoughts, and his glances, as 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Hold yourselves to account before you are held to account, and weigh yourselves before you are weighed." His holding his soul to account is that he repents from every sin before death with sincere repentance, makes up for what he neglected of his shortcoming in the obligations due to God Almighty, and restores wrongs, grain by grain, and seeks absolution from everyone his tongue, his hand, or the evil suspicion of his heart has wronged, with their hearts being content, until he dies and no wrong or obligation remains upon him. Such a one enters Paradise without reckoning. But if he dies before restoring wrongs, his adversaries surround him, this one taking him by the hand and that one...

He will seize him by his forelock, and this one will grab him by his collar. This one says, "You wronged me," and this one says, "You insulted me," and this one says, "You ridiculed me," and this one says, "You mentioned me in my absence with what displeases me," and this one says, "You were my neighbor and you violated my neighborly rights," and this one says, "You dealt with me and you cheated me," and this one says, "You sold to me and you defrauded me, concealing the defect of your merchandise from me," and this one says, "You lied about the price of your goods," and this one says, "You saw me in need while you were wealthy, yet you did not feed me," and this one says, "You found me wronged while you were capable of repelling the wrong from me, yet you appeased the wrongdoer and did not consider me."

While you are in that state, and the adversaries have sunk their claws into you and firmly grasped your collars with their hands, and you are bewildered and perplexed by their multitude—to the point that there remains no one in your lifetime with whom you transacted for a dirham or sat with in a gathering except that they have a rightful claim against you for a wrong through backbiting, betrayal, or a look of contempt—and you have weakened in resisting them, and you have stretched forth the neck of hope to your Master and Lord, hoping He might deliver you from their grasp, then the call of the Almighty, Glorious is His Majesty, strikes your hearing: "Today every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today!" (Qur'an 40:17). At that moment, your heart is torn out from awe, and your soul becomes certain of ruin, and you remember what God, Exalted is He, warned you through the tongue of His Messenger, where He said: "And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror]. Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come back to them, and their hearts are void. And, warn the people..." (Qur'an 14:42-44) the verse.

How great was your joy today in savoring people's reputations and taking their wealth, and how severe will be your regrets on that Day when your Lord stands upon the carpet of justice and you are presented for the address of reckoning, while you are bankrupt, poor, helpless, and humiliated, unable to restore a right or present an excuse. At that time, your good deeds, for which you toiled your entire life, will be taken and transferred to your adversaries in lieu of their rights.

Abu Hurairah reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Do you know who the bankrupt one is?" We said, "The bankrupt among us is one who has no dirham nor dinar nor property." He said, "The bankrupt from my nation is the one who comes on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and zakah, but he comes having insulted this one, slandered that one, consumed the wealth of this one, shed the blood of that one, and struck this one. So, his good deeds are given to this one and that one. If his good deeds are exhausted before what is upon him is settled, then their sins are taken and cast upon him, then he is cast into the Fire." So, look at your calamity on such a Day, when not a single good deed of yours is safe from the afflictions of ostentation and the snares of Satan. If a single good deed remains safe over a long period, your adversaries will rush to it and take it. Perhaps if you were to hold yourself to account while being diligent in fasting the day and praying at night, you would know that not a day passes you by except that there flows from your tongue backbiting of the Muslims sufficient to consume all your good deeds. So how about the rest of the sins, such as consuming the unlawful and doubtful matters, and shortcomings in acts of obedience? And how can you hope for deliverance from wrongs on a Day when recompense will be taken for the hornless from the horned?

It has been narrated from Abu Dharr: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw two sheep butting each other and said, "O Abu Dharr, do you know why they are butting each other?" I said, "No." He said, "But Allah knows, and He will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection."

And Abu Hurairah said regarding the saying of God, Mighty and Majestic: "There is no creature on the earth or bird that flies with its wings except that they are communities like you." (Qur'an 6:38) that all creatures will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection—the beasts, the animals, the birds, and everything. The justice of God, Exalted is He, will reach such a degree that He will take recompense for the hornless from the horned. Then He will say, "Be dust." That is when the disbeliever will say, "I wish I were dust." So you, O wretched one, on a day when you see your record empty of the good deeds for which you long toiled, you will say, "Where are my good deeds?" It will be said, "They have been transferred to the records of your adversaries." And you will see your record laden with sins, for which you long endured fatigue and strove hard to abstain, and you will say, "O Lord, these are sins I never committed." It will be said, "These are the sins of the people whom you backbit, insulted, intended harm for, and wronged in transactions, neighborly relations, speech, debate, conversation, study, and all other types of dealings."

Ibn Mas'ud reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, Satan has despaired of being worshipped through idols in the land of the Arabs, but he will be content with you through what is less than that: through the 'insignificant' sins, which are the destructive ones. So, guard against wrongdoing as much as you are able. For indeed, a servant will come on the Day of Resurrection with good deeds like mountains, thinking they will save him. Then one person after another will come and say, 'O Lord, so-and-so wronged me with a wrong.' So He will say, 'Take from his good deeds.' And it will continue like that until nothing of his good deeds remains. The likeness of that is a group of travelers who alight in a desert with no firewood. The people disperse and gather firewood. It is not long before they have made their fire great and cooked what they desired." Similarly, the sins... (And when the saying of God, Exalted is He, was revealed: "Indeed, you...")

Dead, and they are dead; then on the Day of Resurrection before your Lord you will dispute." Al-Zubayr said: "O Messenger of God, will what was between us in this world be repeated upon us, along with the specific sins?" He said: "Yes, it will indeed be repeated upon you until every right-holder is given his due right." Al-Zubayr said: "By God, the matter is severe." So he magnified the severity of a day in which no step is pardoned, and no slap nor word is overlooked, until the wronged is vindicated from the wrongdoer. Anas said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "God will resurrect the servants naked, barefoot, and uncircumcised." We said: "What does 'barefoot' mean?" He said: "They will have nothing with them. Then their Lord, the Exalted, will call them with a voice heard by those far away as it is heard by those near: 'I am the King, I am the Judge. It is not fitting for anyone from the people of Paradise to enter Paradise while anyone from the people of Hell has a grievance against him until I exact it from him, nor for anyone from the people of Hell to enter Hell while anyone from the people of Paradise has a grievance against him until I exact it from him—even for a slap.'" We said: "How can that be, when we come to God, the Mighty and Majestic, naked, barefoot, and uncircumcised?" He said: "Through good deeds and bad deeds."

So fear God, O servants of God, and the wrongs against servants: taking their wealth, violating their honor, constricting their hearts, and behaving poorly in companionship. For what is between a servant and God is private, and forgiveness from Him is swifter. But for one upon whom grievances have accumulated, and he has repented from them, yet finds it difficult to seek absolution from the claimants of those grievances, let him multiply his good deeds for the Day of Reckoning, and let him rejoice in some good deeds between him and God with perfect sincerity, such that none is aware of them except God. Perhaps that will bring him nearer to God, the Exalted, so that he attains by it His gentleness, which He has stored for His beloved believers in warding off the wrongs of servants from them.

As narrated from Anas from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he said: "While the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was sitting, we saw him laugh until his front teeth showed. 'Umar said: 'What makes you laugh, O Messenger of God? May my father and mother be sacrificed for you!' He said: 'Two men from my nation knelt before the Lord of Might. One of them said: "O Lord, exact my grievance from my brother." God, the Exalted, said: "Give your brother his due." He said: "O Lord, none of his good deeds remain." God, the Exalted, said to the claimant: "What will you do, when none of his good deeds remain?" He said: "O Lord, let him bear some of my burdens."' And the eyes of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, overflowed with tears. Then he said: 'Indeed, that is a tremendous day, a day when people will need others to bear their burdens.' He said: 'Then God said to the claimant: "Raise your head and look into the Gardens." He raised his head and said: "O Lord, I see cities of elevated silver, and palaces of gold adorned with pearls. For which prophet is this, or for which truthful one, or for which martyr?" He said: "For whoever gives Me the price." He said: "O Lord, and who possesses its price?" He said: "You possess it." He said: "What is it?" He said: "Your pardoning your brother." He said: "O Lord, I have pardoned him." God, the Exalted, said: "Take your brother by the hand and admit him into Paradise."' Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said at that: 'Fear God and reconcile between yourselves, for God reconciles between the believers.'"

This is an alert that this is only attained by adorning oneself with the attributes of God, which is reconciling between people and all other noble traits. So reflect now upon yourself: if your record is free from wrongs, or gentleness has been shown to you until you were pardoned, and you are certain of eternal happiness—how will your joy be upon departing from the Plain of Gathering, when the garment of acceptance has been bestowed upon you, and you return with a happiness after which there is no misery, and a bliss at whose edges annihilation does not circle? At that, your heart will fly with joy and gladness, your face will become white, radiant, and shining like the full moon on its night. Imagine yourself proceeding among the creation, your head raised, your back free from burdens, the freshness of the breeze of bliss and the coolness of acceptance gleaming from your forehead, and the creation of the first and the last looking at you and your state, envying you for your beauty and comeliness, while angels walk before you and behind you, proclaiming atop all gatherings: "This is so-and-so, son of so-and-so; God is pleased with him and has made him pleased. He has attained a happiness after which he will never be miserable." Do you think this station is not greater than the position you attain in the hearts of creation in this world through your ostentation, hypocrisy, affectation, and adornment? If you know it is better than that—indeed, there is no comparison between them—then strive to reach this rank through pure sincerity and truthful intention in your dealings with God, for you will not attain it except by that.

But if it is the other—God forbid—that a sin you considered minor has emerged from your record, yet it is great with God, so He detested you because of it and said: "Upon you is My curse, O wicked servant! I do not accept your worship," then you will not hear this call except that your face turns black. Then the angels will become angry due to the anger of God, the Exalted, and they will say: "And upon you is our curse and the curse of all creation." At that, the Zabaniyah will descend upon you, having become angry due to the anger of their Creator, advancing upon you with their harshness, their terrifying cries, and their dreadful forms.

They seized your forelock, dragging you face-down before the entire creation as they gaze upon the blackening of your face and the exposure of your disgrace. You cry out in ruin and calamity, while they say to you, “Do not call today for a single calamity, but call for many calamities.” The angels proclaim, saying, “This is so-and-so, son of so-and-so; God has uncovered his scandals and his shameful deeds, and He has cursed him for his vile misdeeds.” Thus he is wretched with a wretchedness after which he will never know happiness. And perhaps that comes from a sin you committed secretly among God’s servants, or from seeking status in their hearts, or from fearing exposure before them. How immense is your ignorance when you guard against exposure before a small group of God’s servants in this perishing world, yet do not dread the tremendous exposure before that great assembly, along with facing God’s wrath and His painful punishment, and being dragged by the hands of the fierce guards to the midst of Hellfire. These are your states, while you remain unaware of the greatest peril—the peril of the Bridge.

Then, after these terrors, reflect on the words of God Almighty: “On the Day when We gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation, and drive the criminals to Hell as a thirsty herd,” and in His saying: “So guide them to the path of Hell. And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned.” After these terrors, people are driven to the Bridge—a bridge stretched over the back of the Fire, sharper than a sword and finer than a hair. Whoever was upright in this world on the Straight Path will find the Bridge of the Hereafter light and will be saved; but whoever deviated from uprightness in this world, burdened his back with sins, and disobeyed will stumble at the first step on the Bridge and plummet. Consider now what terror would seize your heart when you see the Bridge and its fineness, then your sight falls upon the blackness of Hell beneath it, and your hearing is struck by the roaring and rage of the Fire—while you are obliged to walk on the Bridge in your weak state, with your heart agitated, your feet unsteady, and your back weighed down by sins that hinder you from walking even on the smooth earth, let alone on the sharpness of the Bridge. How will it be when you place one foot upon it and feel its sharpness, compelled to lift the second foot, while the creatures before you slip and stumble, and the guards of the Fire pull them down with hooks and grappling irons? You watch how they are overturned, their heads descending toward the Fire and their feet rising. What a dreadful sight, what a difficult ascent, and what a narrow passage! Look at your state as you crawl and climb upon it, burdened with your sins, glancing right and left at the creatures as they tumble into the Fire, while the Messenger, peace be upon him, says, “O Lord, grant safety, grant safety!” and the cries of ruin and calamity rise to you from the depths of Hell due to the multitude of creatures who slip from the Bridge. How would it be if your foot slipped and your regret availed you not, so you cry out in ruin and calamity, saying, “This is what I feared! Would that I had sent ahead for my life! Would that I had taken a way with the Messenger! Woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so as a friend! Would that I were dust! Would that I were forgotten, utterly forgotten! Would that my mother had not borne me!” At that moment, the fires seize you—God forbid—and the caller calls out, “Be driven into it, and do not speak!” Then no recourse remains except screaming, groaning, panting, and pleading for help. How do you now regard your intellect, with these perils before you? If you do not believe in that, how long will your stay be with the disbelievers in the depths of Hell? And if you believe in it but are heedless of it and negligent in preparing for it, how great is your loss and transgression! What will your faith profit you if it does not spur you to strive in seeking the pleasure of God Almighty through obeying Him and abandoning disobedience? Even if nothing lay before you except the terror of the Bridge and the dread in your heart at the peril of crossing it—even if you are saved—that alone is sufficient as terror, fright, and horror. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: “The Bridge will be laid across the midst of Hellfire, and I will be the first of the messengers to cross with his community. On that day, none will speak except the messengers, and the supplication of the messengers that day will be: ‘O God, grant safety! O God, grant safety!’ In Hell are hooks like the thorns of the sa‘dan plant—have you seen the thorns of the sa‘dan?” They said, “Yes, O Messenger of God.” He said, “They are like the thorns of the sa‘dan, except that none knows the measure of their size except God Almighty. They snatch people according to their deeds: among them are those who are ruined by their deeds, and among them are those who are scratched but then saved.” And Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: “People will pass over the bridge of Hell, upon which are thorns, hooks, and grappling irons that snatch people to the right and left. On its two sides are angels saying, ‘O God, grant safety! O God, grant safety!’ Among the people are those who pass like lightning, and those who pass like the wind, and those who pass like a galloping horse, and those who run, and those who walk, and those who crawl, and those who drag themselves. As for the people of the Fire who are its true inhabitants, they…”

They die and do not come to life, while others are seized for their sins and iniquities, then burned into embers, after which permission for intercession is granted." And he mentioned the rest of the hadith. And from Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, that he said: "God will gather the former and the latter for an appointed day, standing for forty years, their gazes fixed toward the sky, awaiting the decree." And he mentioned the hadith until he spoke of the time of the believers' prostration, saying: "Then He will say to the believers, 'Raise your heads,' so they raise their heads, and He gives them their light according to the measure of their deeds. Among them is he who is given light like a great mountain, moving before him; and among them is he whose light is smaller than that; and among them is he whose light is like a palm tree; and among them is he whose light is smaller than that, until the last of them is a man given light upon his big toe, illuminating at times and fading at others. When it illuminates, he places his foot and walks, and when it darkens, he stands still." Then he mentioned their crossing over the Bridge according to their light: among them are those who pass like the blink of an eye, and among them are those who pass like lightning, and among them are those who pass like clouds, and among them are those who pass like the shooting of stars, and among them are those who pass like the gallop of a horse, and among them are those who pass like the running of a man, until he who was given light upon his big toe passes, crawling on his face, his hands and feet dragging—one hand clinging, another dragging; one foot clinging, another dragging—his sides scorched by the Fire. He remains thus until he is delivered. When he is delivered, he stands upon it and says, 'Praise be to God, God has given me what He gave no one, for He saved me from it after I saw it.' Then he is taken to a pond at the gate of Paradise and washes." And Anas ibn Malik said: I heard the Messenger of God say: "The Bridge is like the edge of a sword or like the edge of a hair, and the angels rescue the believing men and women, and Gabriel, peace be upon him, is holding my waist, and I say, 'O Lord, safety, safety!' And many will slip and fall on that day." These are the terrors and enormities of the Bridge, so prolong your reflection upon it, for those who are saved from the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are those who prolonged their reflection upon it in this world. Indeed, God does not combine two fears upon a servant: whoever fears these terrors in this world will be secure from them in the Hereafter. And I do not mean by fear a tenderness like the tenderness of women, where your eye weeps and your heart softens upon hearing, then you soon forget and return to your diversion and play. What fear is there in that? Rather, whoever fears something flees from it, and whoever hopes for something seeks it. Nothing will save you except a fear that prevents you from the disobedience of God Almighty and urges you to His obedience. And far from the tenderness of women is the fear of the foolish: when they hear the terrors, seeking refuge springs to their tongues, so one of them says, 'I seek help from God, we seek refuge in God, O God, safety, safety!' while they persist in the disobedience that is the cause of their ruin. So Satan laughs at their seeking refuge, just as he laughs at one pursued by a predatory lion in a desert, behind whom is a fortress. When he sees the fangs of the lion and its ferocity from afar, he says with his tongue, 'I seek refuge in this impregnable fortress, and I seek help in the strength of its structure and the firmness of its pillars,' saying that with his tongue while sitting in his place. How can that avail him against the lion? Likewise, the terrors of the Hereafter have no fortress except the sincere saying of 'There is no god but God.' The meaning of its sincerity is that he has no object of desire besides God Almighty and no object of worship other than Him. And whoever takes his desire as his god is far from sincerity in his monotheism, and his affair is perilous within himself. If you are incapable of all that, then be a lover of the Messenger of God, eager to honor his traditions, yearning to heed the hearts of the righteous among his community, and seeking blessing through their supplications, so that perhaps you may attain from his intercession or their intercession, and be saved by intercession if your provision is scant.

(Description of Intercession)
Know that when entry into the Fire becomes due for groups among the believers, then God Almighty, by His grace, accepts intercession on their behalf from the prophets and the truthful, indeed from the scholars and the righteous, and everyone who has standing and good dealings with God Almighty—for he has intercession for his family, relatives, friends, and acquaintances. So be eager to acquire for yourself a rank of intercession with them, and that is by never despising any human being at all, for God Almighty has concealed His friendship within His servants—perhaps the one your eye belittles is a friend of God. And never deem any sin insignificant at all, for God Almighty has concealed His wrath within sins—perhaps God's displeasure lies therein. And never deem any obedience insignificant at all, for God Almighty has concealed His pleasure within obedience—perhaps His pleasure lies therein, even if it be a good word or a sincere intention or what resembles it. And evidences of intercession in the Qur'an and reports are many: God Almighty said: "And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied." It is narrated from 'Amr ibn al-'As: "That the Messenger of God recited the saying of Abraham, peace be upon him: 'My Lord, indeed they have led astray many of the people. So whoever follows me, then he is of me; and whoever disobeys me—indeed, You are Forgiving, Merciful,' and the saying of Jesus, peace be upon him: 'If

Then he raised his hands and said, "My community, my community," and wept. So Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said, "O Gabriel, go to Muhammad and ask him what makes him weep." Gabriel came to him and asked him, and he informed him—though Allah knows best—so He said, "O Gabriel, go to Muhammad and tell him: We shall please you concerning your community and not grieve you." And he (peace be upon him) said, "I have been given five things not given to anyone before me: I am aided by terror a month's journey away; spoils have been made lawful for me, though they were not lawful for anyone before me; the earth has been made a place of prostration and its soil pure for me, so wherever a man from my community is overtaken by prayer, let him pray; I have been granted intercession; and every prophet was sent to his own people specifically, but I have been sent to all people." And he (peace be upon him) said, "On the Day of Resurrection, I will be the leader of the prophets, their orator, and the possessor of their intercession—without boasting." And he (peace be upon him) said, "I am the master of the children of Adam, without boasting, and I am the first for whom the earth will split open, and the first intercessor and the first whose intercession is accepted. In my hand will be the banner of praise, beneath which will be Adam and those after him." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Every prophet has a supplication that is answered, and I wish to reserve my supplication as intercession for my community on the Day of Resurrection." And Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "Pulpits of gold will be set up for the prophets, and they will sit upon them, but my pulpit will remain—I will not sit on it, standing before my Lord, upright, fearing that I may be sent to Paradise while my community remains after me. So I will say, 'O Lord, my community!' And Allah, Mighty and Majestic, will say, 'O Muhammad, what do you wish Me to do with your community?' I will say, 'O Lord, hasten their reckoning.' Then I will continue to intercede until I am given writs for men who have been sent to the Fire, and until Malik, the keeper of Hell, says, 'O Muhammad, you have left no remnant for the Fire due to your Lord's anger toward your community.'" And he (peace be upon him) said, "Indeed, I will intercede on the Day of Resurrection for more than the stones and clay upon the face of the earth." And Abu Huraira said: Some meat was brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the foreleg was raised to him—it used to please him—so he took a bite from it, then said, "I am the master of the messengers on the Day of Resurrection. And do you know why that is? Allah will gather the first and the last on a single plain; the caller will make them hear, and their sight will penetrate; the sun will draw near until the people are overcome with distress and anguish they cannot bear or endure. Then the people will say to one another, 'Do you not see what has befallen you? Will you not look for someone to intercede for you with your Lord?' Some will say to others, 'Go to Adam (peace be upon him).' So they will come to Adam and say, 'You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His own hand, breathed into you of His spirit, and commanded the angels to prostrate to you. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state? Do you not see what has befallen us?' Adam (peace be upon him) will say to them, 'My Lord is angry today with an anger like none before and none after. He forbade me the tree, and I disobeyed. Myself, myself! Go to another. Go to Noah.' So they will come to Noah (peace be upon him) and say, 'O Noah, you are the first messenger to the people of the earth, and Allah named you a grateful servant. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state?' He will say, 'My Lord is angry today with an anger like none before and none after. I had a supplication which I invoked against my people. Myself, myself! Go to another. Go to Abraham, the friend of Allah.' So they will come to Abraham, the friend of Allah (peace be upon him), and say, 'You are the prophet of Allah and His friend from among the people of the earth. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state?' He will say to them, 'My Lord is angry today with an anger like none before and none after. I told three lies'—and he mentioned them—'Myself, myself! Go to another. Go to Moses.' So they will come to Moses (peace be upon him) and say, 'O Moses, you are the messenger of Allah; He favored you with His message and His speech above the people. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state?' He will say, 'My Lord is angry today with an anger like none before and none after. I killed a soul I was not commanded to kill. Myself, myself! Go to another. Go to Jesus (peace be upon him).' So they will come to Jesus and say, 'O Jesus, you are the messenger of Allah and His word which He cast to Mary, and a spirit from Him; you spoke to people in the cradle. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state?' Jesus (peace be upon him) will say, 'My Lord is angry today with an anger like none before and none after'—and he did not mention a sin—'Myself, myself! Go to another. Go to Muhammad (peace be upon him).' So they will come and say, 'O Muhammad, you are the messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets; Allah has forgiven you your past and future sins. Intercede for us with your Lord. Do you not see our state?' Then I will go and come beneath the Throne, falling prostrate before my Lord. Then Allah will open for me from His praises and beautiful glorification something He has not opened for anyone before me. Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad, raise your head. Ask, and you will be given; intercede, and your intercession will be granted.' So I will raise my head."

I say, "My community, my community, O Lord." He said, "O Muhammad, admit from your community those upon whom there is no reckoning through the right-hand gate of the gates of Paradise, and they are partners with the people in the other gates." Then He said, "By the One in whose hand is my soul, the distance between the two doorposts of the gates of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Himyar, or like the distance between Mecca and Busra." In another narration with this same context, the sins of Abraham are mentioned—his saying about the stars, "This is my Lord," his saying about their idols, "Rather, their chief did this," and his saying, "Indeed, I am ill." This is the intercession of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. And for individuals of his community from the scholars and the righteous, there is also intercession, to the extent that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "More people will enter Paradise by the intercession of a man from my community than the tribes of Rabi'ah and Mudar." And he, peace be upon him, said, "It will be said to a man, 'Arise, O so-and-so, and intercede.' So the man will arise and intercede for the tribe, for the household, and for one or two men, according to the measure of his deeds." And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "A man from the people of Paradise will look down on the Day of Resurrection upon the people of the Fire, and a man from the people of the Fire will call out to him and say, 'O so-and-so, do you recognize me?' He will say, 'No, by God, I do not recognize you. Who are you?' He will say, 'I am the one you passed by in the world and you asked me for a drink of water, and I gave you to drink.' He will say, 'Now I recognize you.' He will say, 'Then intercede for me with it before your Lord.' So he will ask God, may He be remembered and exalted, and say, 'I looked down upon the people of the Fire, and a man from its people called out to me and said, "Do you recognize me?" I said, "No, who are you?" He said, "I am the one who asked you for a drink in the world and you gave me to drink, so intercede for me before your Lord." So intercede for me concerning him.' So God will grant him intercession for him, and he will be commanded, and he will be brought out of the Fire." And from Anas, he said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "I am the first of the people to emerge when they are resurrected, and I am their speaker when they are presented, and I am their bearer of glad tidings when they despair. The banner of praise on that day will be in my hand, and I am the most honored of the children of Adam before my Lord, and I do not boast." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "I will stand before my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and I will be clothed in a garment from the garments of Paradise. Then I will stand at the right side of the Throne; no one from creation will stand in that station except me." And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said, "A group of the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, were sitting waiting for him. He came out, and when he drew near to them, he heard them conversing and heard their talk. One of them said, 'It is amazing that God, may He be glorified and exalted, took from His creation a close friend—He took Abraham as a close friend.' Another said, 'What is more amazing than the speech of Moses—He spoke to him directly.' Another said, 'And Jesus—God is his word and His spirit.' Another said, 'Adam—God chose him.' Then he, peace be upon him, came out to them, greeted them, and said, 'I have heard your words and your amazement. Indeed, Abraham is the close friend of God, and that is so. And Moses is the one God spoke to, and that is so. And Jesus is the spirit of God and His word, and that is so. And Adam is the one God, may He be exalted, chose, and that is so. But know that I am the beloved of God, and I do not boast. And I am the bearer of the banner of praise on the Day of Resurrection, and I do not boast. And I am the first to intercede and the first whose intercession is accepted on the Day of Resurrection, and I do not boast. And I am the first to move the ring of Paradise, so God will open it for me, and I will enter it, and with me are the poor believers, and I do not boast. And I am the most honored of the first and the last, and I do not boast.'"

(The Description of the Basin)
Know that the Basin is a great honor with which God has specifically favored our Prophet, peace be upon him. The reports have encompassed its description, and we hope that God, may He be exalted, will grant us in this world knowledge of it and in the Hereafter the tasting of it. For among its attributes is that whoever drinks from it will never thirst again. Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, dozed off, then raised his head smiling. They said to him, "O Messenger of God, why did you smile?" He said, "A verse was just revealed to me," and he recited, "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful: 'Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar...'" until he finished it. Then he said, "Do you know what al-Kawthar is?" They said, "God and His Messenger know best." He said, "It is a river that my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, has promised me in Paradise. Upon it is abundant good. Upon it is a basin to which my community will come on the Day of Resurrection. Its vessels are like the number of the stars in the sky." And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "While I was traveling in Paradise, I came upon a river whose banks were domes of hollow pearl. I said, 'What is this, O Gabriel?' He said, 'This is al-Kawthar which your Lord has given you.' Then the angel struck with his hand, and its mud was fragrant musk." And he used to say, peace be upon him, "The distance between the two sides of my basin is like the distance between Medina and Sana'a, or like the distance between Medina and Oman." And Ibn Umar reported that when the verse, "Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar," was revealed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "It is a river in Paradise whose banks are of gold. Its drink is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, and more fragrant than musk. It flows over pebbles of pearl and coral." And Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, my basin extends from Aden to Oman al-Balqa'. Its water is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, and its cups are like the number of the stars in the sky. Whoever drinks a single drink from it...

The first to arrive at it will be the poor emigrants, never to thirst thereafter. Umar ibn al-Khattab asked, "Who are they, O Messenger of God?" He replied, "They are those with dishevelled hair, soiled garments, who do not marry women of luxury, and for whom the gates of comfort are not opened." Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz then said, "By God, I have married a woman of luxury, Fatimah bint Abd al-Malik, and the gates of comfort have been opened for me, unless God has mercy on me. Assuredly, I will not oil my head until it becomes dishevelled, nor wash the garment upon my body until it becomes soiled."

And from Abu Dharr, who said: I asked, "O Messenger of God, what are the vessels of the Basin?" He said, "By Him in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, its vessels are more numerous than the stars and planets in a dark, clear night. Whoever drinks from it will never thirst again. At its farthest point, two spouts from Paradise pour into it. Its width is like its length, the distance between Oman and Aylah. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey."

And from Samurah, who said the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Every prophet has a basin, and they vie with one another as to who will have the most arrivals. I indeed hope to be the one with the most arrivals." This is the hope of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. So let every servant hope to be among the arrivals, and beware of being a mere wisher, deluded while thinking he is hopeful. For the one who hopes for the harvest is he who sows the seed, clears the land, and waters it, then sits hoping for God's bounty in bringing forth growth and warding off lightning until harvest time. As for one who abandons tilling, planting, clearing the land, and watering it, yet hopes from God's bounty that grain and fruit will grow for him—this is a deluded wisher and is not among the hopeful in any way. Such is the hope of most people, and it is the delusion of fools. We seek refuge in God from delusion and heedlessness. For delusion concerning God is greater than delusion concerning the world. God Almighty has said: "So let not the worldly life delude you, nor let the Deceiver delude you concerning God."

(The Discourse on the Description of Hell, Its Terrors and Punishments)

O you who are heedless of yourself, deluded by the preoccupations of this worldly life which is nearing its end and disappearance! Cease pondering what you are departing from, and turn your thought to your destination. For you have been informed that the Fire is the destination for all, as it is said: "There is none of you but will enter it. This is, for your Lord, a decree determined. Then We will save those who feared God and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees." So you are certain of the arrival, but in doubt about the salvation. Let the terror of that destination take hold of your heart, that you may perhaps prepare for salvation from it.

Contemplate the state of the creatures when they have endured the calamities of the Resurrection. While they are in its distress and terrors, standing, awaiting the reality of its tidings and the intercession of its intercessors, darknesses with many branches envelop the guilty, and a fire with flames overshadows them. They hear it roaring and rumbling, expressing intense wrath and anger. At that, the guilty become certain of destruction, and the nations fall upon their knees, until the innocent fear a terrible fate.

A caller from the guardians of Hell emerges, saying: "Where is so-and-so, son of so-and-so, who deceived himself in the world with prolonged hopes, wasting his life in evil deeds?" They hasten to him with iron maces, confront him with grave threats, and drive him to severe torment. They plunge him into the depths of Hell and say to him: "Taste! Indeed, you are the mighty, the noble!" They are settled in an abode narrow in expanse, dark in its paths, obscure in its perils, where the captive remains forever and the blaze is kindled. Their drink therein is scalding water, and their resting place is Hell. The guardians subdue them, and the abyss gathers them. Their hopes therein are for ruin, and they have no escape therefrom. Their feet are shackled to their foreheads, and their faces are blackened from the darkness of sins. They call out from its confines and cry in its corners and edges: "O Malik, the promise has come true for us! O Malik, the iron has burdened us! O Malik, our skins have been cooked! O Malik, take us out from it, for we will not return!" But the guardians say: "Far be it! Now is not the time for hope, nor is there any exit for you from the abode of disgrace. Be driven into it, and do not speak. Even if you were brought out, you would return to what you were forbidden." At that, they despair and grieve for what they neglected in God's cause. Regret does not save them, nor does grief avail them. Rather, they are thrown upon their faces, bound. The fire is above them, the fire beneath them, the fire to their right, and the fire to their left. They are drowned in the Fire; their food is fire, their drink is fire, their clothing is fire, and their bedding is fire. They are amidst fragments of fire and garments of pitch, struck with maces and weighed down by chains. They clamor in its narrow straits, are shattered in its depths, and are tossed amidst its billows. The Fire boils them as a cauldron boils. They cry out in woe and lamentation. Whenever they call for destruction, scalding water is poured over their heads, melting what is in their bellies and their skins. And for them are maces of...

Iron shall shatter their foreheads, causing pus to gush from their mouths, and their livers shall rupture from thirst. Their eyeballs shall stream down their cheeks, flesh shall fall from their jaws, and hair shall be torn from their limbs—indeed, their very skins. Whenever their skins are scorched, they will be replaced with new ones, until their bones are stripped bare of flesh, leaving souls tethered to veins and nerve fibers, writhing in the blaze of those fires. Yet, they will wish for death but not die. How would you fare if you beheld them with faces blackened darker than pitch, their sight blinded, tongues silenced, backs broken, bones shattered, ears severed, skins torn, hands shackled to their necks, their foreheads bound to their feet as they walk upon the fire with their faces, treading upon iron thorns with their eyes, while the flames course through their innards and the serpents and scorpions of the abyss cling to their limbs? This is but a glimpse of their state.

Now consider in detail their terrors, and reflect also upon the valleys and ravines of Hell. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "In Hell there are seventy thousand valleys, in each valley seventy thousand ravines, in each ravine seventy thousand serpents and seventy thousand scorpions, and the disbeliever and hypocrite will not cease until all of these are inflicted upon them." And Ali (may God honor his countenance) reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Seek refuge in God from the Pit of Sorrow or the Valley of Sorrow." It was asked, "O Messenger of God, what is the Valley or Pit of Sorrow?" He replied, "It is a valley in Hell from which Hell itself seeks refuge seventy times a day, prepared by God Almighty for hypocritical reciters." Such is the vastness of Hell and the branching of its valleys, corresponding to the number of worldly desires and its gates, matching the seven limbs through which a servant disobeys, one above another: the uppermost is Jahannam, then Saqar, then Laza, then Hutamah, then Sa’ir, then Jahim, then Hawiyah. Now contemplate the depth of Hawiyah, for its depth is limitless, just as worldly desires are boundless. For as no worldly craving ends except in a greater craving, so no abyss in Hell ends except in a deeper abyss. Abu Hurairah said: "We were with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) when we heard a crash. The Messenger said, 'Do you know what this is?' We said, 'God and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'This is a stone cast into Hell seventy years ago, and only now has it reached its bottom.'"

Then observe the disparity of levels, for the Hereafter has greater degrees and greater distinction. Just as people’s immersion in the world varies—some drowned in excess, others wading to a limited extent—so too their suffering in the Fire varies. For God wrongs not even an atom’s weight; thus, the types of torment do not converge upon every inhabitant of the Fire indiscriminately. Rather, each has a prescribed measure according to their disobedience and sin, though the least punished among them, if offered the entire world, would ransom himself from the severity of his plight. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "The least punished of the people of the Fire on the Day of Resurrection will wear sandals of fire that cause his brain to boil from their heat." Now consider those for whom it is lightened, and take warning from those for whom it is intensified. If you doubt the severity of Hell’s punishment, bring your finger near a fire and measure by it, then know that you have erred in comparison, for the fire of this world does not equate to the Fire of Hell. Yet, since the severest worldly torment is that of this fire, the torment of Hell is understood through it. Far be it! If the people of the Blaze found such a fire, they would willingly plunge into it to escape their state. This is alluded to in some reports: "The fire of this world was washed seventy times with the waters of mercy so that the people of this world could bear it." Indeed, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) explicitly described the Fire of Hell, saying: "God commanded that the Fire be kindled for a thousand years until it reddened, then for another thousand years until it whitened, then for another thousand years until it blackened, and so it is black and dark." And he (peace be upon him) said: "The Fire complained to its Lord, saying, 'O Lord, part of me consumes another.' So He permitted it two breaths: a breath in winter and a breath in summer. Thus, the most intense heat you experience in summer is from it, and the most intense cold you experience in winter is from its frost." Anas ibn Malik said: "The most comfortable disbeliever in the world will be brought and told, 'Dip him once into the Fire.' Then he will be asked, 'Have you ever experienced any comfort?' He will say, 'No.' Then the most afflicted person in the world will be brought and told, 'Dip him once into Paradise.' Then he will be asked, 'Have you ever experienced any affliction?' He will say, 'No.'" Abu Hurairah said: "If there were a hundred thousand or more in the mosque, and one inhabitant of the Fire exhaled, they would all perish." Some scholars said regarding His words, 'The Fire will scorch their faces,' that it scorches them once and leaves no flesh upon bone except that it casts it at their heels." Then, after this, consider the stench...

The pus that flows from their bodies until they drown in it—this is the ghasaq (foul fluid). Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "If a bucket of the ghasaq of Hell were poured onto the world, it would corrupt the people of the earth." This is their drink when they cry out from thirst; the most intensely thirsty among them is given water of pus to gulp down, scarcely able to swallow it, and death comes to him from every direction yet it does not kill him. And if they cry for relief, they are given water like molten brass that scalds their faces—how wretched a drink and how evil a resting place! Then consider their food: it is the Zaqqum tree, as God Almighty says: "Then indeed you, O misguided deniers, will surely eat from the tree of Zaqqum and fill your bellies with it, then drink on top of it boiling water, drinking like thirsty camels." And He says: "Indeed, it is a tree that emerges from the depths of Hellfire; its fruit is as if it were the heads of devils. So indeed they will eat from it and fill their bellies with it. Then indeed they will have upon it a mixture of scalding water. Then indeed their return will be to the Blaze." And He says: "He will enter a blazing Fire and be given to drink from a boiling spring." And He says: "Indeed, with Us are shackles and a Blaze, and food that chokes, and a painful punishment." Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "If a drop of Zaqqum were dripped into the seas of the world, it would spoil the livelihoods of the people of the world—so how about one whose food is that?" And Anas reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Aspire to what God has made desirable for you, and beware and fear what God has warned you of—His punishment and His retribution, and Hellfire. For if a drop of Paradise were with you in your worldly life, its fragrance would delight you; and if a drop of the Fire were with you in your worldly life, its foulness would afflict you." And Abu al-Darda' reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Hunger is cast upon the people of the Fire until it equals the torment they are in, so they cry out for food and are given food of dhari' (a bitter, thorny plant) that neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger. And they cry out for food and are given food that chokes, and they remember how they used to clear their throats in the world with a drink, so they cry out for a drink. Then boiling water is raised to them with hooks of iron, and when it draws near their faces, it scorches their faces. And when the drink enters their bellies, it cuts up what is in their bellies. So they say, 'Call the keepers of Hell!' They call them, and they say, 'Call upon your Lord to lighten for us a day of the torment.' They say, 'Did not your messengers come to you with clear proofs?' They say, 'Yes.' They say, 'Then call, but the call of the disbelievers is only in vain.' So they say, 'Call Malik.' They call him, and they say, 'O Malik, let our Lord decree an end for us!' He answers them, 'Indeed, you will remain.'" Al-A'mash reported: I was informed that between their call and Malik's answer to them is a thousand years. Then they say, 'Call upon your Lord, for none is better than your Lord.' They say, 'Our Lord, our wretchedness has overcome us, and we were a misguided people. Our Lord, bring us out of it; if we return [to evil], then indeed we are wrongdoers.' He answers them, 'Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.' At that, they despair of all good, and at that they begin to groan and lament and woe. And Abu Umamah reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said concerning God's words, 'And he is given to drink of purulent water; he gulps it but can hardly swallow it': "It is brought near to him and he loathes it. When it is brought close to him, it scorches his face and the skin of his head falls off. And when he drinks it, it cuts his intestines until it exits from his anus. God Almighty says, 'And they are given scalding water to drink so that it cuts their intestines.' And He says, 'And if they cry for relief, they are given water like molten brass that scalds the faces.'" Such is their food and drink in their hunger and thirst. Now reflect upon the serpents of Hell and its scorpions, and upon the intensity of its poisonous winds, the enormity of its forms, and the horror of its appearance—set upon its inhabitants and incited against them, so that they do not cease from biting and stinging for a single moment. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever is given wealth by God and does not pay its zakah, it will be made for him on the Day of Resurrection into a venomous serpent with two fangs that will encircle him on the Day of Resurrection, then seize him by his jaws—meaning his cheeks—and say, 'I am your wealth, I am your treasure.' Then he recited God's words: 'And let not those who are stingy with what God has given them of His bounty think...' to the end of the verse." And the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, in the Fire are serpents like the necks of Bactrian camels; their sting is felt for forty autumns. And in it are scorpions like mules with loads; their sting is felt for forty autumns. These serpents and scorpions are only set upon those who were given to stinginess, bad character, and harming people in the world. Whoever is protected from that is protected from these serpents, so they are not made to appear to him." Then reflect after all this upon the magnification of the bodies of the people of the Fire, for God Almighty increases their bodies in length and width so that their torment is multiplied thereby, and they feel the scorching of the Fire and the stings of the scorpions and serpents from all their parts at once.

One after another, Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A molar of the disbeliever in the Fire is like Mount Uhud, and the thickness of his skin is a journey of three." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "His lower lip will sag onto his chest, and the upper one will be raised, covering his face." And upon him be peace said: "Indeed, the disbeliever will drag his tongue in Sijjeen on the Day of Resurrection, and people will tread upon it." Despite the enormity of their bodies, the Fire will burn them repeatedly, renewing their skins and flesh. Al-Hasan said regarding God's statement, "Whenever their skins are roasted, We will replace them with other skins," that the Fire consumes them seventy thousand times each day; whenever it consumes them, they are told, 'Return,' and they return as they were. Then reflect now upon the weeping of the people of the Fire, their gasping, and their cries of 'Woe!' and 'Ruin!'—for that is unleashed upon them upon their initial casting into the Fire. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "On that Day, Hell will be brought forth with seventy thousand reins, and with each rein are seventy thousand angels." And Anas reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Weeping will be sent upon the people of the Fire, and they will weep until their tears are exhausted, then they will weep blood until trenches appear on their faces—if ships were sent into them, they would sail. And as long as they are permitted to weep, gasp, exhale, and cry 'Woe!' and 'Ruin!', they find some relief therein, but they are also prevented from that." Muhammad ibn Ka'b said: "The people of the Fire have five supplications; God Almighty answers them in four, but when it comes to the fifth, they will never speak again. They will say, 'Our Lord, You have caused us to die twice and given us life twice, and we confess our sins. Is there any way out?' God Almighty will answer them, 'That is because when God alone was invoked, you disbelieved; but if others are associated with Him, you believe. So the judgment belongs to God, the Most High, the Great.' Then they will say, 'Our Lord, delay us for a brief term that we may respond to Your call and follow the messengers.' God Almighty will answer, 'Did you not swear before that there would be no end for you?' They will say, 'Our Lord, take us out; we will do righteous deeds, other than what we used to do.' God Almighty will answer, 'Did We not give you long enough lives that whoever would remember could do so? And the warner came to you. So taste, for the wrongdoers have no helper.' Then they will say, 'Our Lord, our misfortune has overwhelmed us, and we were a people astray. Our Lord, remove us from it; if we return, then indeed we are wrongdoers.' God Almighty will answer them, 'Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.' They will never speak after that, and that is the utmost severity of punishment." Malik ibn Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: "Zayd ibn Aslam said regarding God's statement, 'It is all the same for us whether we despair or are patient; there is for us no escape,' that they were patient for a hundred years, then they despaired for a hundred years, then they were patient for a hundred years, then they said, 'It is all the same for us whether we despair or are patient.'" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection like a white ram and slaughtered between Paradise and the Fire, and it will be said, 'O people of Paradise, eternity without death! O people of the Fire, eternity without death!'" And from Al-Hasan, he said: "A man will emerge from the Fire after a thousand years. Would that I were that man!" And Al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, was seen sitting in a corner weeping. He was asked, "Why are you weeping?" He said, "I fear that He will cast me into the Fire and not care." These are the categories of Hell's punishment in summary, and the detailing of its generality, its parts, its trials, and its regret has no end. The greatest matter for them, alongside what they encounter of severe punishment, is the regret of missing the bliss of Paradise, missing the meeting with God Almighty, and missing His pleasure—knowing that they sold all that for a paltry price, a few dirhams, for they sold it only for base desires in the world, for short days that were not pure but rather troubled and marred. They will say within themselves, "Alas for us! How we destroyed ourselves by disobeying our Lord! Why did we not compel ourselves to be patient for a few days? Had we been patient, those days would have passed, and we would now be in the company of the Lord of the worlds, enjoying pleasure and approval." Such is their regret, for they have missed it and are afflicted with what they are afflicted, and nothing of the world's pleasures and delights remains with them. Moreover, had they not witnessed the bliss of Paradise, their regret would not be so great, but it is displayed to them. Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "On the Day of Resurrection, some people will be brought from the Fire to Paradise until, when they draw near to it, inhale its fragrance, and look upon its palaces and what God has prepared for its people therein, they will be called, 'Turn them away; they have no share in it.' They will return with a regret that no one before or after has experienced. They will say, 'Our Lord, if You had entered us into the Fire before showing us what You showed us of Your reward and what You prepared therein for Your allies, it would have been easier for us.' God Almighty will say, 'That is what I intended for you. When you were alone, you would confront Me with grave sins, and when you met people, you met them humbly, showing people the opposite of what you concealed.'"

You give Me from your hearts when you have given to people, yet you do not revere Me. You honor people, yet you do not honor Me. You leave matters for people, yet you do not leave them for Me. So today I shall make you taste the painful punishment along with depriving you of the everlasting reward." (215) Ahmad ibn Harb said, "One of us prefers shade over the sun, yet he does not prefer Paradise over the Fire." Jesus, peace be upon him, said, "How many a healthy body, fair face, and eloquent tongue will tomorrow be screaming between the layers of the Fire." David said, "My God, I have no patience for the heat of Your sun, so how can I have patience for the heat of Your Fire? I have no patience for the sound of Your mercy, so how for the sound of Your punishment?" So look, O wretched one, at these terrors and know that God Almighty created the Fire with its terrors and created people for it who will neither increase nor decrease, and that this is a matter already decreed and concluded. God Almighty said: "And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be decided while they are in a state of heedlessness, and they do not believe." By my life, the allusion is to the Day of Resurrection, nay, in pre-eternity, but what the decree has preceded with becomes manifest on the Day of Resurrection. So the wonder is at you, how you laugh and play and busy yourself with the trifles of the world, while you do not know what the decree has preceded with concerning your fate. If you say, "Would that I knew what my destination is, and to what my end and return is, and what the decree has preceded with concerning me," then you have a sign to find solace in and to affirm your hope because of it. It is that you look at your states and your deeds, for everyone is facilitated towards what he was created for. If the path of good has been made easy for you, then give glad tidings, for you are kept far from the Fire. But if you do not intend any good except that obstacles surround you and repel it, and you do not intend any evil except that its causes are made easy for you, then know that a decree has been passed upon you. For the indication of this upon the outcome is like the indication of rain upon vegetation and the indication of smoke upon fire. God Almighty has said: "Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss, and indeed, the wicked will be in a Blazing Fire." So measure yourself against these two verses, and you will have known your abode in the two abodes. And God knows best.

(The Discourse on the Description of Paradise and the Varieties of Its Bliss)
Know that that abode, whose sorrows and griefs you have come to know, is faced by another abode. So contemplate its bliss and its joy, for whoever is distant from one of them will inevitably reside in the other. So extract fear from your heart through prolonged reflection on the terrors of Hellfire, and extract hope through prolonged reflection on the everlasting bliss promised to the people of the Gardens. Drive your soul with the whip of fear and guide it with the reins of hope to the Straight Path, for by that you attain the great dominion and are saved from the painful punishment. So reflect upon the people of Paradise, upon their faces the radiance of bliss, being given to drink of a pure, sealed wine, seated upon thrones of red ruby, in tents of moist white pearl, upon spreads of green brocade, reclining upon couches set along the banks of rivers flowing with wine and honey, attended by immortal youths and boys, adorned with wide-eyed maidens of beautiful virtues, as if they were ruby and coral, whom no man or jinn has touched before them, walking in the levels of the Gardens. When one of them sways in her walk, seventy thousand of the boys carry the hems of her garments, upon her are the finest of white silks at which eyes are dazzled, crowned with tiaras studded with pearl and coral, coquettish, alluring, fragrant, secure from aging and misery, secluded in the tents within palaces of ruby built amidst the meadows of the Gardens, with restrained glances, large-eyed. Then they are served, and upon them are served, with cups and ewers and a pure, white drink from a flowing spring, a delight to the drinkers. And there circulate upon them servants and boys like hidden pearls, as a reward for what they used to do, in a secure station, in Gardens and springs, in Gardens and a river, in a seat of honor near a Sovereign Perfect in Ability. They look therein upon the face of the Noble King, and the radiance of bliss has shone upon their faces. No fatigue shall touch them, nor any abasement; rather, they are honored servants, and with various gifts from their Lord they are attended. They are immortal therein in what their souls desire, they fear not therein, nor do they grieve, and they are secure from the doubt of death. They are therein in bliss, and they eat of its foods and drink from its rivers milk, wine, and honey, in rivers whose beds are of silver and whose gravel is coral, and upon a ground whose dust is fragrant musk and whose vegetation is saffron. And they are rained upon from clouds therein from the water of sweet basil upon dunes of camphor. And they are brought cups—and what cups!—cups of silver studded with pearls, ruby, and coral; a cup containing the sealed pure wine mixed with the sweet *Salsabeel*; a cup whose light shines from the clarity of its jewel, the drink appearing from behind it with its delicacy and redness. No human made it, falling short in perfecting its craftsmanship and beautifying its workmanship, in the hand of a servant whose face's radiance resembles the sun in its brightness. But from where would the sun have sweetness like the sweetness of his form, the beauty of his temples, and his loveliness?

His eyes, so how wondrous it is for one who believes in an abode of such description and is certain that its inhabitants do not die, nor do calamities befall those who dwell in its courtyards, nor do events cast the eye of change upon its people—how can he find comfort in an abode whose ruin God has decreed, and delight in a life beneath it? By God, if there were in it nothing but the soundness of bodies, with security from death, hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions, it would be worthy of abandoning this world for its sake, and of not preferring over it that which is fleeting and tainted with hardship. How much more so when its inhabitants are secure kings, enjoying varieties of bliss, having therein all they desire, and who each day attend the court of the Throne, gazing upon the Noble Countenance of God, and attaining from that vision from God what makes them not look at any other bliss of Paradise, nor turn aside, while they perpetually move among these varieties of blessings, secure from their disappearance. Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A caller will call out: 'O people of Paradise, you are granted health, so you shall never fall ill; you are granted life, so you shall never die; you are granted youth, so you shall never grow old; you are granted bliss, so you shall never grieve.' That is the meaning of His word, Exalted is He: 'And they will be called, "This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do."'" And whenever you wish to know the description of Paradise, read the Qur'an, for there is no explanation beyond the explanation of God, the Exalted. Read from His saying, the Exalted: "For those who feared the standing before their Lord are two gardens" to the end of Surah Ar-Rahman, and read Surah Al-Waqi'ah and other surahs. And if you wish to know the detailed descriptions from the reports, then contemplate now my detailing of it after you have grasped its summary. And first, contemplate the number of the gardens. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said regarding His saying, the Exalted: "And for those who feared the standing before their Lord are two gardens": "Two gardens of silver, their vessels and all within them, and two gardens of gold, their vessels and all within them, and nothing lies between the people and their looking at their Lord except the veil of majesty upon His Countenance in the Garden of Eden." Then look to the gates of Paradise, for they are numerous according to the roots of acts of obedience, just as the gates of Hell are according to the roots of sins. Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever spends a pair from his wealth in the way of God will be called from all the gates of Paradise. Paradise has eight gates: whoever was among the people of prayer will be called from the gate of prayer; whoever was among the people of fasting will be called from the gate of fasting; whoever was among the people of charity will be called from the gate of charity; whoever was among the people of jihad will be called from the gate of jihad." Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said: "By God, no one is in need of being called from all of them. Is anyone called from all of them?" He said: "Yes, and I hope you are among them." And from 'Asim bin Damrah, from 'Ali, may God honor his face, that he mentioned the Fire, magnifying its affair with a mention I do not recall, then he said: "And those who feared their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups," until when they reached a gate from its gates, they found near it a tree from beneath whose trunk two springs flowed. They turned to one of them as they were commanded and drank from it, and it removed whatever harm or ailment was in their bellies. Then they turned to the other and purified themselves with it, and the freshness of bliss flowed over them, so their hair never changed thereafter, nor did their heads become disheveled, as if they were anointed with oil. Then they reached Paradise, and its keepers said to them: 'Peace be upon you, you have done well, so enter it, abiding eternally.' Then the youths meet them, circulating among them as the youths of this world circulate around a beloved who returns to them from an absence, saying to him: 'Rejoice, God has prepared such and such honor for you.' Then a youth from those youths speaks to one of his wives from the wide-eyed maidens, saying: 'So-and-so has come,' by the name he was called in the world. She says: 'Have you seen him?' He says: 'I have seen him, and he is behind me.' Joy overwhelms her until she rises to the threshold of her door. When he reaches his dwelling, he looks at the foundation of its structure, and behold, it is a pearl boulder, above it a palace of red, green, and yellow, of every hue. Then he raises his head and looks at its ceiling, and behold, it is like lightning, and were it not that God, the Exalted, had decreed it, it would have taken his sight. Then he lowers his head, and behold, his wives, 'and cups set in place, cushions arrayed, and carpets spread.' Then he reclines and says: 'Praise be to God, who has guided us to this; we would not have been guided had God not guided us.' Then a caller calls out: 'You shall live and never die, you shall dwell and never depart, you shall be healthy and never fall ill.'" And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "I will come on the Day of Resurrection to the gate of Paradise and ask for it to be opened. The keeper will say: 'Who are you?' I will say: 'Muhammad.' He will say: 'For you I was commanded not to open for anyone before you.'" Then contemplate now the chambers of Paradise and the differing degrees of elevation within it, for the Hereafter has greater degrees and greater distinction. And just as among people in...

The outward acts of worship and the praiseworthy inward character traits differ manifestly, and likewise there is a manifest difference in what they are recompensed with. If you seek the highest degrees, then strive that none precede you in obedience to God, the Exalted, for God has commanded you to race and compete in it. He, the Exalted, said: "Race one another to forgiveness from your Lord" (Qur'an 57:21). And He, the Exalted, said: "For that let the competitors compete" (Qur'an 83:26). It is astonishing that if your peers or neighbors surpass you by an extra dirham or a taller building, that weighs heavily upon you and distresses your heart, and your life becomes bitter due to envy. Yet, in the best of your states, you would be settled in Paradise while not being safe therein from people who precede you with subtleties that the entire world cannot equal. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the people of Paradise see the people of the elevated chambers above them just as you see the setting star on the horizon from east to west, due to the superiority between them." They said, "O Messenger of God, those are the dwellings of the prophets which none but they can reach." He said, "Yes, by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, men who believed in God and were truthful to the messengers." He also said: "Indeed, the people of the highest degrees are seen by those below them just as you see the rising star on a horizon of the horizons of the sky. And Abu Bakr and 'Umar are among them and how excellent they are." Jabir reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to us: "Shall I not inform you of the chambers of Paradise?" I said, "Yes, O Messenger of God, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you." He said, "In Paradise there are chambers made of every kind of jewel, their exterior seen from their interior and their interior from their exterior. In them is bliss, delights, and joy that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human being." He said, "O Messenger of God, for whom are these chambers?" He said, "For the one who spreads peace, feeds food, persists in fasting, and prays at night while people are asleep." We said, "O Messenger of God, who can bear that?" He said, "My community can bear that, and I will inform you about it: Whoever meets his brother and greets him with peace or returns the greeting has spread peace. Whoever feeds his family and dependents food until they are full has fed food. Whoever fasts the month of Ramadan and three days from every month has persisted in fasting. Whoever prays the 'Isha' prayer and prays the dawn prayer in congregation has prayed at night while people are asleep," meaning the Jews, Christians, and Magians. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked about His saying: "And goodly dwellings in Gardens of Eden" (Qur'an 9:72). He said: "Palaces of pearl; in every palace are seventy houses of red ruby; in every house are seventy rooms of green emerald; in every room is a couch; on every couch are seventy beds of every color; on every bed is a wife from the wide-eyed maidens; in every house are seventy tables; on every table are seventy kinds of food; in every house are seventy attendants; and the believer is given every morning—meaning from the strength—what enables him to encompass all of that."

(Description of the Wall of Paradise, Its Lands, Trees, and Rivers)

Ponder the image of Paradise and reflect on the bliss of its inhabitants and the regret of those deprived of it due to being content with this world as a substitute for it. Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The wall of Paradise is a brick of silver and a brick of gold; its soil is saffron and its clay is musk." He, peace be upon him, was asked about the soil of Paradise and said: "White musk, pure." Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever is pleased that God, the Mighty and Majestic, gives him wine to drink in the Hereafter, let him leave it in this world. And whoever is pleased that God clothes him in silk in the Hereafter, let him leave it in this world." He said: "The rivers of Paradise gush forth from beneath hills or beneath mountains of musk." "If the ornament of the lowest of the people of Paradise were to equal the ornament of all the people of this world, what God, the Mighty and Majestic, adorns him with in the Hereafter would be better than all the ornament of this world." Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "In Paradise is a tree in whose shade a rider travels for a hundred years without traversing it. Recite if you wish: 'And an extended shade' (Qur'an 56:30)." Abu Umama reported: "The companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to say, 'God, the Mighty and Majestic, benefits us through the Bedouins and their questions.' A Bedouin came and said, 'O Messenger of God, God has mentioned in the Qur'an a harmful tree, and I did not know there was a tree in Paradise that harms its owner.' The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'What is it?' He said, 'The lote-tree, for it has thorns.' He said, 'God, the Exalted, has said: "Among lote-trees without thorns" (Qur'an 56:28). God removes its thorns and places in place of every thorn a fruit. Then the fruit splits open from it into seventy-two colors of food, none of which resembles another.'" Jarir ibn 'Abdullah reported: We alighted at al-Safah and there was a man sleeping beneath a tree; the sun had almost reached him. I said to the servant, "Go with this leather mat and shade him." So he went.

He shaded him, and when he awoke, it was Salman. I came to him and greeted him with peace. He said, "O Jarir, humble yourself before God, for whoever humbles himself before God in this world, God will elevate him on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know what the darknesses are on the Day of Resurrection?" I said, "I do not know." He said, "The injustices people commit against one another." Then he took a twig so small I could barely see it and said, "O Jarir, if you sought the like of this in Paradise, you would not find it." I said, "O Abu 'Abdullah, then where are the date palms and trees?" He said, "Their trunks are of pearl and gold, and their uppermost parts are fruit."

(Description of the Garments, Furnishings, Couches, Thrones, and Tents of the People of Paradise)
God Almighty said: "They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and their garments therein will be silk." The verses concerning this are many, and its details are in the narrations. It has been narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever enters Paradise will enjoy bliss and never grieve; his garments will not wear out, nor will his youth fade. In Paradise is that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has never occurred to the heart of man." A man said, "O Messenger of God, tell us about the garments of the people of Paradise: are they created or woven?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, remained silent, and some of the people laughed. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Why do you laugh at an ignorant one asking a knowledgeable one?" Then the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Rather, they are split open from the fruit of Paradise, twice." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the first group to enter Paradise will be in the likeness of the moon on the night of the full moon. They will not spit therein, nor blow their noses, nor defecate. Their vessels and combs will be of gold and silver, their sweat will be musk, and each of them will have two wives, the marrow of whose shins will be seen from behind the flesh due to their beauty. There will be no discord among them nor hatred; their hearts will be as one heart, glorifying God morning and evening." (In a narration: "Each wife will have seventy garments.") And regarding His saying, Almighty is He: "They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold," he, peace be upon him, said: "They will have crowns upon them; the smallest pearl among them will illuminate what is between the east and the west." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The tent is a hollow pearl, its height in the sky is sixty miles; in each corner of it are believers, family members whom the others do not see." Narrated by al-Bukhari in the Sahih. Ibn 'Abbas said: "The tent is a hollow pearl, a parasang by a parasang, with four thousand doors of gold." And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said regarding His saying, Almighty is He: 'And raised couches,' he said: 'The distance between two couches is like the distance between the heaven and the earth.'"

(Description of the Food of the People of Paradise)
The description of the food of the People of Paradise is mentioned in the Qur'an: from fruits, plump birds, manna, quail, honey, milk, and countless varieties. God Almighty said: "Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, 'This is what we were provided with before,' and they will be given it in resemblance." God Almighty mentioned the drink of the People of Paradise in many places. Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "I was standing with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, when a Jewish rabbi came to him and asked questions until he said, 'Who will be the first to cross, meaning over the Sirat?' He said, 'The poor emigrants.' The Jew said, 'Then what is their gift when they enter Paradise?' He said, 'The increase of the whale's liver.' He said, 'Then what is their meal after that?' He said, 'The bull of Paradise that used to graze at its edges will be slaughtered for them.' He said, 'Then what is their drink with it?' He said, 'From a spring therein called Salsabil.' He said, 'You have spoken the truth.'" And Zayd ibn Arqam said: "A man from the Jews came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, 'O Abu al-Qasim, do you not claim that the people of Paradise will eat and drink therein?' And he said to his companions, 'If he affirms this to me, I will argue with him.' The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'Yes, by the One in whose hand is my soul, indeed one of them is given the strength of a hundred men in eating, drinking, and intercourse.' The Jew said, 'But whoever eats and drinks will have need (to relieve himself).' The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, 'Their need is a sweat that flows from their skins like musk, and then the belly becomes flat.'" And Ibn Mas'ud said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "You will see a bird in Paradise and desire it, and it will fall before you roasted." And Hudhayfah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "In Paradise are birds like al-Bukhati (large camels)." Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, said, "They are indeed delicate, O Messenger of God." He said, "More delicate than them is the one who eats them, and you are among those who will eat them, O Abu Bakr." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said regarding His saying, Almighty is He: "There will be circulated among them plates," he said: "There will be circulated among them seventy plates of gold, each plate containing a color not found in another like it." And 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said regarding "And its mixture is of Tasnim," he said: "It is mixed for the companions of the right hand, and the near ones drink it pure." And Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, said regarding His saying, Almighty is He: "Its seal is musk," he said: "It is a white drink like silver, with which they seal the last of their drink. If

That a man of worldly pursuits dipped his hand into it and withdrew it, leaving no living being but that it found the fragrance of its perfume.
                         (Description of the Wide-Eyed Maidens and Youths)
   Their description has been repeated in the Qur'an, and reports have come with additional clarification. Anas, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A morning or an evening spent in the path of God is better than the world and all it contains. And the space of a bow's length, or the place of one's foot, in Paradise is better than the world and all it contains. Were a woman from the women of the people of Paradise to look out towards the earth, she would illuminate it and fill what is between them with fragrance, and her head-covering upon her head is better than the world and all it contains," meaning the veil. And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said regarding His statement, the Exalted: 'As if they were rubies and coral' (Qur'an 55:58): 'You look at her face in her chamber, clearer than a mirror. Indeed, the lowest pearl upon her illuminates what is between the East and the West. And she will have upon her seventy garments, yet his sight penetrates them until he sees the marrow of her shin from behind that.'" And Anas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When I was taken on the Night Journey, I entered a place in Paradise called al-Baydakh, upon which were tents of pearl, green chrysolite, and red ruby. They said, 'Peace be upon you, O Messenger of God.' I said, 'O Gabriel, what is this call?' He said, 'These are the ones secluded in the tents; they sought permission from their Lord to greet you, and He permitted them.' Then they began to say, 'We are the contented ones, never displeased; we are the eternal ones, never departing.'" And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited the statement of the Exalted: "Maidens secluded in tents" (Qur'an 55:72). And Mujahid said regarding His statement, the Exalted: "And purified spouses" (Qur'an 2:25): "Purified from menstruation, feces, urine, spittle, phlegm, semen, and childbirth." And al-Awza'i said regarding "In occupation, enjoying" (Qur'an 36:55): "Their occupation is the deflowering of virgins." (And a man said: "O Messenger of God, do the people of Paradise have intercourse?" He said: "A man among them is given, in a single day, strength better than that of seventy of you.") And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said: "The lowest in rank among the people of Paradise is he for whom a thousand servants are set to work, each servant upon a task not incumbent upon his master." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, a man from the people of Paradise will marry five hundred wide-eyed maidens, four thousand virgins, and eight thousand previously married women. He will embrace each one of them for the duration of his worldly life." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, in Paradise there is a market wherein there is no buying or selling, except images of men and women. When a man desires an image, he enters into it. And in it is a gathering of the wide-eyed maidens, raising their voices with sounds the like of which creation has never heard, saying, 'We are the eternal ones, never perishing; we are the blissful ones, never grieved; we are the contented ones, never displeased. Blessed is he for whom we are, and we are for him.'" And Anas, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the wide-eyed maidens in Paradise sing, 'We are the beautiful maidens, reserved for noble spouses.'" And Yahya ibn Kathir said regarding His statement, the Exalted: "In a garden, honored" (Qur'an 30:15): "Listening to singing in Paradise." And Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "There is no servant who enters Paradise except that two of the wide-eyed maidens sit at his head and at his feet, singing to him with the most beautiful voice heard by mankind and jinn, and it is not with the flute of Satan, but with the praise of God and His glorification."
            (Explanation of various collective descriptions of the people of Paradise that have come in reports)
   Usamah ibn Zayd narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to his companions: "Is there not one who strives for Paradise? For Paradise has no equal, by the Lord of the Ka'bah! It is a gleaming light, a swaying sweet basil, a lofty palace, a flowing river, abundant ripe fruit, and a beautiful, lovely spouse in splendor, and bliss in an eternal abode, and freshness in a lofty, splendid, secure abode." They said: "We are the ones who strive for it, O Messenger of God." He said: "Say, 'If God wills.'" Then he mentioned jihad and urged towards it. (And a man came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said: "Are there horses in Paradise, for they amaze me?" He said: "If you desire that, you will be brought a horse of red ruby, and it will fly with you in Paradise wherever you wish." And a man said to him: "Camels amaze me, so are there camels in Paradise?" He said: "O servant of God, if you enter Paradise, you will have therein what your soul desires and what delights your eyes.") And from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, he said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, a man from the people of Paradise will have a child born to him as he desires, its pregnancy, weaning, and youth occurring in a single hour." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When the people of Paradise are settled in Paradise, brothers will long for brothers. So the couch of this one will travel to the couch of that one, and they will meet and converse about what was between them in the abode of the world. One will say, 'O my brother, do you remember such-and-such a day in such-and-such a gathering when we called upon God, the Mighty and Majestic, and He forgave us?'" And the Messenger

God Almighty said: "Indeed, the inhabitants of Paradise are beardless, youthful, with kohl-rimmed eyes, appearing as thirty-three-year-olds, in the form of Adam, their height sixty cubits by a width of seven cubits." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The lowest of the people of Paradise is he who has eighty thousand servants and seventy-two wives, and a pavilion of pearl, chrysolite, and ruby is erected for him, stretching from Jabiyah to Sana'a. Upon them are crowns, and the least of its pearls would illuminate what is between the east and the west." And he, peace be upon him, said: "I looked into Paradise and saw that a pomegranate from its pomegranates was like the hide of a fattened camel, and its birds were like Bactrian camels. And there was a maiden in it, so I said, 'O maiden, to whom do you belong?' She said, 'To Zayd ibn Harithah.' And in Paradise is that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human."

And Ka'b said: God the Exalted created Adam, peace be upon him, with His hand, wrote the Torah with His hand, and planted Paradise with His hand. Then He said to it, 'Speak,' and it said: 'Indeed, the believers have succeeded.' These are the attributes of Paradise we have mentioned in summary, then conveyed in detail. Al-Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, mentioned its entirety, saying: "Its pomegranates are like large water-skins, its rivers are of water unsullied, rivers of milk whose taste does not change, rivers of purified honey not clarified by men, and of wine delightful to the drinkers, which does not befuddle the mind nor cause headaches. And in it is that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human. They are kings in comfort, appearing as thirty-three-year-olds of one age, their height sixty cubits, in heaven, kohl-rimmed, beardless, youthful. They are secure from punishment and the abode is tranquil for them. Its rivers flow over gravel of ruby and chrysolite, and its roots, palm trees, and vines are of pearl, and its fruits—none knows their nature except God the Exalted. Its fragrance is found from a distance of five hundred years' journey. They have therein horses and swift camels, their saddles, bridles, and saddles of ruby, visiting therein. Their spouses are the wide-eyed maidens, as if they were hidden pearls. A woman takes seventy garments between her two fingers and wears them, and the marrow of her shin is seen from behind those seventy garments. God has purified the characters from evil and the bodies from death. They do not blow their noses therein, nor urinate, nor defecate; it is only a fragrant perspiration of musk. Their provision therein is morning and evening. But know, there is no night; morning succeeds evening and evening succeeds morning. The last to enter Paradise and the lowest in rank—his sight and his dominion are extended for a journey of a hundred years in palaces of gold and silver and tents of pearl, and his sight is expanded so he sees its farthest as he sees its nearest. They are served in the morning with seventy thousand trays of gold and in the evening with the like, on each tray a flavor not matched by the other, and he finds the taste of the last as he finds the taste of the first. In Paradise is a ruby containing seventy thousand dwellings, in each dwelling seventy thousand houses, without crack or hole."

And Mujahid said: "The lowest of the people of Paradise in rank is he whose dominion extends for a thousand years' journey, seeing its farthest as he sees its nearest, and the highest of them is he who looks upon his Lord in the morning and the evening." And Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib said: "There is no one from the people of Paradise except that in his hand are three bracelets: a bracelet of gold, a bracelet of pearl, and a bracelet of silver." And Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, said: "In Paradise is a maiden called al-'Ayna'; when she walks, seventy thousand handmaidens walk to her right and left, and she says, 'Where are those who enjoin good and forbid evil?'" And Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "Abandoning the world is difficult, but missing Paradise is more difficult. Abandoning the world is the dowry for the Hereafter." He also said regarding seeking the world: "It is humiliation for the souls," and regarding seeking the Hereafter: "It is honor for the souls. So how strange is he who chooses humiliation in seeking what perishes and leaves honor in seeking what endures."

(The Attribute of Vision and Looking upon the Face of God, Blessed and Exalted)
God the Exalted said: "For those who do good is the best reward and extra." This extra is the vision of the face of God the Exalted, and it is the greatest delight in which the bliss of the people of Paradise is forgotten. We have mentioned its reality in the Book of Love. The Book and the Sunnah testify to it, contrary to what the people of innovation believe. Jarir ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali said: "We were sitting with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, when he saw the moon on the night of the full moon. He said, 'You will see your Lord as you see this moon; you will have no difficulty in seeing Him. So if you are able not to be overcome in prayer before sunrise and before sunset, then do so.' Then he recited: 'And exalt [God] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting.'" This is recorded in the two Sahih collections. Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Suhayb that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited God's saying: "For those who do good is the best reward and extra," and said: "When the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of the Fire enter the Fire, a caller will call out..."

O dwellers of Paradise, you have a promise with God that He wishes to fulfill for you. They said, "What is this promise? Has He not already made our scales heavy, whitened our faces, admitted us into Paradise, and delivered us from the Fire?" He said: Then the veil is lifted, and they gaze upon the Countenance of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and they are given nothing more beloved to them than gazing upon Him. This tradition of the Vision has been narrated by a group of the Companions, and this is the ultimate beauty and the final bounty. All the delights we have detailed pale in comparison to this blessing; they are forgotten. Indeed, the joy of the people of Paradise upon the bliss of the Meeting has no end; rather, no pleasure of Paradise bears any proportion to the pleasure of the Meeting. We have been brief here due to our detailed exposition in the Book of Love, Longing, and Contentment. Thus, the servant's aspiration regarding Paradise should be for nothing other than meeting the Master. As for the other delights of Paradise, even the grazing beast released in the pasture shares in them.

                           [Chapter on the Vastness of God's Mercy]
        We conclude the book with a chapter on the vastness of God's mercy, as an optimistic omen.
   Indeed, the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) loved good omens. We have no deeds by which we may hope for forgiveness, so we follow the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) in optimism and hope that our end is sealed with goodness in this world and the next, just as we have concluded the book by mentioning God's mercy. For God Almighty has said: "Indeed, God does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills." And He Almighty has said: "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'" And He Almighty has said: "And whoever does evil or wrongs himself then seeks forgiveness of God will find God Forgiving and Merciful." And we seek forgiveness from God Almighty for every slip of the foot or excess of the pen in this book of ours and in all our books. We seek His forgiveness for our words that our deeds do not match. We seek His forgiveness for what we claimed and displayed of knowledge and insight into God's religion while being deficient in it. We seek His forgiveness for every knowledge and action we intended for His Noble Countenance, then mixed it with other than Him. We seek His forgiveness for every promise we made to ourselves, then fell short in fulfilling. We seek His forgiveness for every blessing He bestowed upon us, which we then used in disobedience to Him. We seek His forgiveness for every explicit or implicit mention of the deficiency of the deficient or the shortcoming of the falling short, with which we were characterized. We seek His forgiveness for every fleeting thought that prompted us to affectation, pretense, and showing off to people in a book we penned, a speech we composed, or knowledge we imparted or acquired. And after seeking forgiveness for all of that—for ourselves and for whoever peruses this book of ours, writes it, or hears it—we hope to be honored with forgiveness, mercy, and pardon for all sins, outward and inward. For generosity is abundant, mercy is vast, and bounty upon all kinds of creation is overflowing. We are but a creation from among the creations of God, Mighty and Majestic is He, and we have no means to Him except His grace and generosity. For the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Indeed, God Almighty has one hundred mercies. He sent down one mercy among the jinn, mankind, birds, beasts, and insects; through it they show affection and mercy to one another. And He withheld ninety-nine mercies with which He will show mercy to His servants on the Day of Resurrection." And it is narrated that "When the Day of Resurrection comes, God Almighty will bring out a book from beneath the Throne, in which is written: 'My mercy has preceded My wrath, and I am the Most Merciful of the merciful.' Then He will bring out of the Fire a number like the people of Paradise." And the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "God, Mighty and Majestic is He, will appear to us on the Day of Resurrection smiling and will say: 'Rejoice, O community of Muslims, for there is not one of you except that I have placed a Jew or a Christian in his place in the Fire.'" And the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "God Almighty will grant Adam intercession on the Day of Resurrection for all his progeny, for one hundred thousand thousand and ten thousand thousand." And he (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic is He, will say on the Day of Resurrection to the believers: 'Did you love to meet Me?' They will say: 'Yes, O our Lord.' He will say: 'Why?' They will say: 'We hoped for Your pardon and forgiveness.' He will say: 'I have made My forgiveness obligatory for you.'" And he (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "God, Mighty and Majestic is He, will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Bring out of the Fire whoever remembered Me one day or feared Me in a situation.'" And the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "When the people of the Fire are gathered in the Fire, and with them, whomever God wills from the people of the Qiblah, the disbelievers will say to the Muslims: 'Were you not Muslims?' They will say: 'Yes.' They will say: 'What did your Islam avail you, since you are with us in the Fire?' They will say: 'We had sins, and we were taken for them.' Then God, Mighty and Majestic is He, hears what they said and orders those from the people of the Qiblah who are in the Fire to be brought out, and they are brought out. When the disbelievers see that, they will say: 'If only we had been Muslims, we would have been brought out as they were brought out.' Then the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) recited: 'Often those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims.'"

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God is more merciful to His believing servant than a compassionate mother is to her child." And Jabir ibn Abd Allah said: "On the Day of Resurrection, whoever's good deeds outweigh his evil deeds, he is the one who will enter Paradise without reckoning. And whoever's good deeds and evil deeds are equal, he is the one who will be given an easy reckoning, then will enter Paradise. Indeed, the intercession of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, is for the one who has doomed himself and burdened his back." It is narrated that God, Mighty and Majestic, said to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, Qarun sought your aid and you did not aid him. By My Might and Majesty, had he sought My aid, I would have aided him and forgiven him." And Sa'd ibn Bilal said: "On the Day of Resurrection, two men will be commanded to be brought out of the Fire. Then God, Blessed and Exalted, will say: 'This is for what your hands have sent forth, and I am not unjust to the servants.' Then He will command them to be returned to the Fire. One of them will rush in his chains until he plunges into it, while the other will hesitate. Then He will command them to be brought back and will ask them about their action. The one who rushed to the Fire will say: 'I was warned of the consequence of disobedience, so I would not expose myself to Your wrath a second time.' And the one who hesitated will say: 'My good opinion of You made me feel that You would not return me to it after You had brought me out of it.' Then He will command them both to Paradise." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A caller will call from beneath the Throne on the Day of Resurrection: 'O community of Muhammad! As for what was due to Me from you, I have forgiven it for you. What remains are the mutual claims among you, so forgive one another and enter Paradise by My mercy.'" It is narrated that a Bedouin heard Ibn Abbas reciting: '...and you were on the brink of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it...' The Bedouin said: "By God, He did not save you from it if He intends to cast you into it!" Ibn Abbas said: "Take it from one who is not a jurist." And al-Sanabihi said: "I entered upon Ubadah ibn al-Samit while he was in his death illness, and I wept. He said: 'Gently, why do you weep? By God, there is no beneficial tradition I heard from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, except that I have related it to you, except for one tradition, and I will relate it to you today, for my soul is about to depart. I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: "Whoever testifies that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, God has forbidden the Fire to him."'" And Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, God will single out a man from my community before all creation on the Day of Resurrection. Ninety-nine scrolls will be unfurled for him, each scroll as far as the eye can see. Then He will say: 'Do you deny anything of this? Have My recording scribes wronged you?' He will say: 'No, my Lord.' He will say: 'Do you have any excuse?' He will say: 'No, my Lord.' He will say: 'Rather, you have with Us a good deed, and there is no injustice upon you today.' Then a card will be brought out on which is written: 'I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.' He will say: 'My Lord, what is this card alongside these scrolls?' He will say: 'You will not be wronged.' He said: Then the scrolls will be placed in one scale and the card in the other scale. He said: The scrolls will be light and the card will be heavy, for nothing is weightier than the name of God." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said in the latter part of a long tradition in which he describes the Resurrection and the Bridge: "Indeed, God will say to the angels: 'Whoever you find in his heart a dinar's weight of good, bring him out of the Fire.' They will bring out a great multitude. Then they will say: 'Our Lord, we have left none in it of those You commanded us.' Then He will say: 'Go back. Whoever you find in his heart half a dinar's weight of good, bring him out.' They will bring out a great multitude. Then they will say: 'Our Lord, we have left none in it of those You commanded us.' He will say: 'Go back. Whoever you find in his heart an atom's weight of good, bring him out.' They will bring out a great multitude. Then they will say: 'Our Lord, we have left none in it of those You commanded us.'" Abu Sa'id used to say: "If you do not believe me regarding this tradition, then read if you wish: 'Indeed, God does not wrong [anyone] by an atom's weight; and if it is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.'" He said: Then God, Exalted is He, will say: "The angels have interceded, and the prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded, and none remains but the Most Merciful of the merciful." Then He will take a handful and bring out from it people who never did any good at all; they had become cinders. He will cast them into a river at the entrances of Paradise called the River of Life. They will emerge from it as a seed emerges in the silt of a flood. Do you not see it—what is towards the stone and the tree, what faces the sun is yellow and green, and what is in the shade is white? They said: "O Messenger of God, it is as if you used to tend livestock in the desert." He said: They will emerge like pearls, with seals on their necks. The people of Paradise will recognize them, saying: "These are the freed ones of the Merciful, whom He admitted to Paradise without any deed they did or good they sent forth." Then He will say: "Enter Paradise. Whatever you see is for you." They will say: "Our Lord, You have given us what You have not given anyone in the worlds." God, Exalted is He, will say: "I have for you with Me what is better than this." They will say: "Our Lord, what thing is better than this?" He will say: "My pleasure with you, for I shall never be angry with you after it." Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahih collections.

Al-Bukhari also narrates from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, came out to us one day and said: 'The nations were presented to me. A prophet would pass by with one man, a prophet with two men, and a prophet with no one. A prophet would pass by with a small group. Then I saw a great multitude and I hoped it would be my nation. It was said to me: "This is Moses and his people." Then it was said to me: "Look." I saw a great multitude filling the horizon. It was said to me: "Look this way and that." I saw a great multitude. It was said to me: "These are your nation, and with these are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning."' The people dispersed without the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, clarifying for them. The Companions discussed this, saying: 'As for us, we were born in polytheism, but we have believed in God and His Messenger. Perhaps these are our children?' This reached the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he said: 'They are those who do not practice cauterization, do not seek omens, do not believe in bad omens, and upon their Lord they rely.' Ukashah stood up and said: 'Pray to God to make me among them, O Messenger of God.' He said: 'You are among them.' Then another man stood and said the same as Ukashah. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'Ukashah has preceded you in it.'"

And from 'Umar ibn Hazm al-Ansari, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was absent from us for three days, only coming out for the obligatory prayer and then returning. On the fourth day, he came out to us and we said: 'O Messenger of God, you were detained from us until we thought something had happened.' He said: 'Nothing has happened except good. My Lord, Mighty and Majestic, promised me that He would admit seventy thousand from my nation into Paradise without reckoning, and I asked my Lord for an increase during these three days. I found my Lord to be Glorious, Self-Sufficient, and Generous, so He gave me, with each one of the seventy thousand, seventy thousand more.' I said: 'O Lord, will my nation reach this number?' He said: 'I will complete the number for you from the Bedouins.'"

And Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Gabriel appeared to me at the side of al-Harrah and said: 'Give glad tidings to your nation that whoever dies not associating anything with God will enter Paradise.' I said: 'O Gabriel, even if he steals and commits adultery?' He said: 'Yes, even if he steals and commits adultery.' I said: 'Even if he steals and commits adultery?' He said: 'Even if he steals, commits adultery, and drinks wine.'"

And Abu al-Darda' said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited: 'But for him who fears the standing before his Lord are two Gardens' (Quran 55:46). I said: 'Even if he steals and commits adultery, O Messenger of God?' He recited: 'But for him who fears the standing before his Lord are two Gardens.' I said: 'Even if he steals and commits adultery?' He recited: 'But for him who fears the standing before his Lord are two Gardens.' I said: 'Even if he steals and commits adultery, O Messenger of God?' He said: 'Even if, to the dismay of Abu al-Darda's nose.'"

And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "On the Day of Resurrection, a man from the People of the Book will be given to every believer, and it will be said to him: 'This is your ransom from the Fire.'"

Muslim narrates in his Sahih from Abu Burdah that he related to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz from his father, Abu Musa, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, who said: "No Muslim man dies but that God, Exalted is He, puts a Jew or a Christian in his place in the Fire." 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz made him swear by God, besides whom there is no deity, three times that his father had narrated it to him from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he swore to him.

And it is narrated: "A young boy stood in one of the military expeditions, being offered for sale on an extremely hot summer day. A woman in the people's tent saw him. She rushed forward, and her people followed behind her, until she took the boy, pressed him to her chest, then lay on her back on the ground and placed him on her stomach to shield him from the heat, saying: 'My son, my son!' The people wept and abandoned what they were doing. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, approached and stood before them. They informed him of the story. He was pleased with their mercy, then gave them glad tidings, saying: 'Are you amazed at this woman's mercy for her son?' They said: 'Yes.' He, peace be upon him, said: 'God, Blessed and Exalted, is more merciful to all of you than this woman is to her son.'"

Thus, the Muslims dispersed with the best joy and the greatest glad tidings. These hadiths, and what we have cited in the Book of Hope, give us glad tidings of the vastness of God's mercy, Exalted is He. So we hope from God, Exalted is He, that He will not deal with us as we deserve, but will bestow upon us from what is worthy of Him, by His grace, His abundant generosity, and His mercy.

[6] The hadith "Death is a gift for the believer" was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in his book "Al-Mawt" (Death), and by al-Tabarani and al-Hakim from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar as a *mursal* report with a *hasan* chain.

[7] The hadith "Death is an expiation for every Muslim" was transmitted by Abu Nu'aym in "Al-Hilyah", al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab", and al-Khatib in "Al-Tarikh" from the narration of Anas. Ibn al-'Arabi said in "Siraj al-Muridin" that it is *hasan sahih*, but Ibn al-Jawzi deemed it weak. I have compiled its chains in a separate treatise.

This hadith was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" in this manner as a *mursal* report. We also narrated it in the dictations of al-Jalal from the narration of Anas, but it is not authentic.

[9] The hadith of Anas: "Increase your remembrance of death, for it purifies sins and induces asceticism in the worldly life." This was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" with a very weak chain.

[10] The hadith "Sufficient is death as a separator" was transmitted by al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his *Musnad* from the narration of Anas and 'Irak ibn Malik with a weak chain. Ibn Abi al-Dunya also narrated it in "Al-Birr wa al-Silah" from the narration of Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hubli as a *mursal* report.

[11] The hadith "Sufficient is death as an admonisher" was transmitted by al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" from the narration of 'Ammar ibn Yasir with a weak chain. It is well-known as a saying of al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad, which al-Bayhaqi transmitted in "Al-Zuhd".

[12] The hadith: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) went out to the mosque and found some people conversing and laughing. He said, 'Remember death...'" This was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" from the narration of Ibn 'Umar with a weak chain.

[13] The hadith: "A man was mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and they praised him well. He said, 'How was your companion's remembrance of death?...'" This was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" from the narration of Anas with a weak chain, and by Ibn al-Mubarak in "Al-Zuhd". He said: Malik ibn Mighwal informed us, and he mentioned it as a *balaghah* report with an addition.

[14] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "I came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as the tenth among ten men. A man from the Ansar said, 'Who are the most prudent of people?...'" This was transmitted by Ibn Majah in an abridged form and by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in its complete form with a sound (*jayyid*) chain.

[15] The hadith: He said to 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, "When you reach the morning, do not expect the evening..." This was transmitted by Ibn Hibban. Al-Bukhari narrated it as a saying of Ibn 'Umar at the end of the hadith, "Be in the world as if you are a stranger."

[16] The hadith of 'Ali: "Verily, the things I fear most for you are two traits: following desires and having long hopes..." in its full length, was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in his book "Shortening Hopes". He also narrated it from the narration of Jabir in a similar manner, and both are weak.

[17] The hadith of Umm al-Mundhir: "O people, do you not feel shame before God, the Exalted?" They said, "And what is that, O Messenger of God?" He said, "You amass wealth you do not eat..." This was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya, and through his chain in "Al-Shu'ab" with a weak chain, and it has been mentioned previously.

[18] The hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Usamah ibn Zid purchased from Zaid ibn Thabit a slave-girl for one hundred dinars to be paid in a month. I heard the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) say, 'Are you not astonished at Usamah?...'" This was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes", al-Tabarani in "Musnad al-Shamiyyin", Abu Nu'aym in "Al-Hilyah", and al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" with a weak chain.

[19] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "He would go out to pour water and would wipe [his hands] with dust. I would say, 'The water is close to you.' He would say, 'How do I know? Perhaps I will not reach it.'" This was transmitted by Ibn al-Mubarak in "Al-Zuhd", Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes", and al-Bazzar with a weak chain.

[20] The hadith: "He took three sticks and planted one in front of him..." This was transmitted by Ahmad and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes", and the wording is his.

[22] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) drew a square line for us, and drew a line in its middle..." This was narrated by al-Bukhari.

[23] The hadith of Anas: "The son of Adam grows old, yet two things remain with him: greed and hope." In another narration: "And they grow strong with him..."

Two are greed for wealth and greed for life, and Muslim narrated it with the wording "the second," while Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes" narrated it with the first wording through a sound chain.

[24] The hadith: The first of this community was saved by certainty and asceticism, and the last of this community will be ruined by stinginess and hope. Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah from 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather.

[25] The hadith of al-Hasan: "All of you love to enter Paradise." They said, "Yes, O Messenger of God." He said, "Shorten your hopes..." The hadith was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in this manner from the hadith of al-Hasan as mursal.

[26] The hadith: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication: "O God, I seek refuge in You from a hope that prevents the good of the Hereafter, and I seek refuge in You from a life that prevents the good of death, and I seek refuge in You from a hope that prevents the good of deeds." Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it from the narration of Hawshab from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and in its chain there is weakness and obscurity, and I do not know who Hawshab is.

[27] The hadith: "Love whom you love, for you will part from them." The hadith has preceded multiple times.

[28] The hadith: "An old man is youthful in love of the world, and even if his collarbones tremble from old age, except for those who are God-fearing, and few they are." I did not find it with this wording. In the two Sahihs, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The heart of an old man remains youthful with love for two things: long life and love of wealth."

[29] The hadith of his asking Mu'adh about the reality of his faith, and he said: "I did not take a step except that I thought I would not take another after it." Abu Nu'aym transmitted it in "Al-Hilyah" from the hadith of Anas, and it is weak.

[30] The hadith: "What does any of you expect from the world except wealth that leads to transgression or poverty that causes forgetfulness?" Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording: "Do they expect except affluence?" and he said it is hasan. Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in "Al-Zuhd," and through his route Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes" with the wording of the author, and in it is an unnamed narrator.

[31] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "Take advantage of five before five: your youth before your old age..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it with a hasan chain, and Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in "Al-Zuhd" from the narration of 'Amr ibn Maymun al-Azdi as mursal.

[32] The hadith: "Two blessings are taken for granted by many people: health and free time." Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and it has preceded.

[33] The hadith: "Whoever fears sets out at night, and whoever sets out at night reaches the destination." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and it has preceded. And he said: "The hadith 'Whoever fears sets out at night, and whoever sets out at night reaches the destination' was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is hasan."

[34] The hadith: "The quake came, followed by the aftershock..." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it and graded it hasan from the hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b.

[35] The hadith: "When he noticed heedlessness or negligence among his companions, he would call out to them in a loud voice: 'Death has come to you...'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it in "Shortening Hopes" from the hadith of Zayd al-Sulami as mursal.

[36] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "I am the warner, and death is the raider, and the Hour is the appointment." Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it in "Shortening Hopes," and Abu al-Qasim al-Baghawi with a chain containing leniency.

[37] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, went out while the sun was on the tips of the palm branches, and he said: 'What remains of the world is only like what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it with a hasan chain, and al-Tirmidhi transmitted something similar from the hadith of Abu Sa'id and graded it hasan.

[38] The hadith: "The likeness of the world is like a garment torn from its beginning to its end..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya transmitted it from the hadith of Anas, and it is not authentic.

[39] The hadith of Jabir: "When he delivered a sermon and mentioned the Hour, his voice would rise and his cheeks would redden..." Muslim transmitted it, and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes," and the wording is his.

[40] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited: {'So whoever God wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam'} and said: "When light enters the breast, it expands." It was said: "O Messenger of God, is there a sign for that which is recognized?" He said: "Yes, turning away from the abode of deception and turning to the abode of eternity."

Eternal Life and Preparation for Death Before Its Arrival" – narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes" and al-Hakim in "al-Mustadrak," as previously mentioned.

[41] The narration of Abu 'Ubaydah al-Baji: We visited al-Hasan during the illness from which he died, and he said: "Welcome to you, and greetings. May God grant you life in peace and settle us and you in the Abode of Permanence. This is a good public admonition if you are patient, truthful, and God-fearing. So, may God have mercy on you, let not your portion of this news be merely hearing it with this ear and letting it out from this ear. For whoever saw Muhammad, peace be upon him, saw him coming and going, not laying brick upon brick nor reed upon reed, but a banner was raised for him, so he hastened toward it: 'Hasten, hasten! Salvation, salvation! Why do you delay? You have come, by the Lord of the Ka'bah, as if you and the matter are together.' May God have mercy on a servant who made life a single life, so he ate a morsel, wore worn garments, clung to the earth, strove in worship, wept over sin, fled from punishment, and sought mercy until his term comes to him while he is upon that." – Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Shortening Hopes," Ibn Hibban in "al-Thiqat," and Abu Nu'aym in "al-Hilyah" from this chain.

[42] The narration that God accepts the repentance of a servant as long as the death rattle has not reached the throat – narrated by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of Ibn 'Umar, and Ibn Majah graded it as good.

[43] The narration that he used to say: "O God, make easy for Muhammad the agonies of death" – previously mentioned.

[44] The narration that he used to say: "O God, take the soul from between the nerves, the marrow, and the fingertips" – the full narration. Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Book of Death" from the narration of Sa'idah ibn Ghaylan al-Ju'fi, and it is interrupted (mu'dal), the Companion being omitted from its chain, though it reaches a Follower.

[45] The narration of al-Hasan that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, mentioned death, its choking, and its pain, and said: "It is equivalent to three hundred strikes with a sword." – Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya therein thus, as a mursal narration, and its narrators are trustworthy.

[46] The narration that he was asked about death and its severity, and he said: "Indeed, the easiest death is like a thorn" – the full narration. Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya therein from the narration of Shahr ibn Hawshab, as a mursal narration.

[47] The narration that he visited a sick person and said: "Indeed, I do not know what he is experiencing; there is not a vein in him except that it aches for death due to its severity." – Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya therein from the narration of Salman with a weak chain, and he also narrated it in "Sickness and Expiation" from the narration of 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr as a mursal narration with some variation, and its narrators are trustworthy.

[48] The narration: "Sudden death is a mercy for the believer and a cause of regret for the wicked." – Narrated by Ahmad from the narration of 'A'ishah with a sound chain, and he said: "and its taking is regret." And by Abu Dawud from the narration of Khalid al-Sulami: "Sudden death is a taking of regret."

[49] The narration of Makhul: "If a single hair from the hair of the deceased were to be placed upon the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, they would die" – the full narration. Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Death" from the narration of Abu Maysarah, raised to the Prophet, and in it: "If the pain of a single hair..." and he added: "And indeed, on the Day of Resurrection there are ninety terrors, the least of which is a terror multiplied over death seventy thousand times." And Abu Maysarah is 'Amr ibn Shurahbil, and the narration is mursal with a good chain.

[50] The narration: "If a drop of death were placed upon all the mountains of the world, they would melt." I did not find a basis for it, and perhaps the author did not cite it as a hadith, for he said: "And it is narrated."

[51] The narration that there was a cup of water with him at the time of death, and he would put his hand in the water, then wipe his face with it and say: "O God, make easy for me the agonies of death." – Agreed upon from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[52] The narration that Fatimah said: "O, the grief for your grief, O my father!" – the full narration. Narrated by al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas with the wording: "O, the grief, O my father!" and in the narration of Ibn Khuzaymah: "O, my grief!"

[53] The narration: "Indeed, the servant struggles with the distress of death and the agonies of death, and they exchange greetings with one another" – the full narration. We narrated it in "The Forty" of Abu Haddabah Ibrahim ibn Haddabah from Anas, and Abu Haddabah is Malik.

[54] The narration of Abu Hurayrah that Dawud was a jealous man – the full narration. Narrated by Ahmad with a good chain similarly, and by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Book of Death" with the wording.

[55] The narration: "None of you will leave the world until he knows where his destination is and until he sees his place in Paradise or the Fire." – Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Death" from the narration of an unnamed man from 'Ali, as a mawquf narration.

No soul of a son of Adam departs from this world until it knows where its destination lies—to Paradise or to the Fire. In another narration: It is forbidden for a soul to depart from the world until it knows whether it is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire. In the two Sahih collections, from ‘Ubādah ibn al-Ṣāmit, there is evidence for this: When death approaches the believer, he is given glad tidings of God’s pleasure and honor; and when death approaches the disbeliever, he is given tidings of God’s punishment and chastisement. [Hadith]

[56] Hadith: Whoever loves to meet God, God loves to meet him; and whoever hates to meet God, God hates to meet him. The hadith is agreed upon, narrated from ‘Ubādah ibn al-Ṣāmit.

[57] Hadith: When God is pleased with His servant, He says: “O Angel of Death, go to so-and-so and bring me his soul, that I may show him mercy.” The hadith was reported by Ibn Abī al-Dunyā in the Book of Death, from Tamīm al-Dārī with a weak chain, containing many additions. It is not explicitly stated at the beginning of the hadith that it is raised [to the Prophet], though its end indicates it is raised. Al-Nasā’ī reports from Abū Hurayrah with a sound chain: When the deceased is present, the angels of mercy come to him with a white silk cloth and say: “Come forth pleased and pleasing, to God’s spirit and fragrance, and to a Lord who is pleased, not angry.” [Hadith]

[58] Hadith: Observe the deceased at three signs: when his forehead perspires, his eyes shed tears… The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhī al-Ḥakīm in Nawādir al-Uṣūl from Salmān, but it is not authentic.

[59] Hadith: Prompt your dying ones with “There is no god but God”—mentioned earlier.

[60] Hadith: Ḥudhayfah—for it demolishes what came before it—mentioned earlier.

[61] Hadith: Whoever dies while knowing that there is no god but God enters Paradise—mentioned earlier.

[62] Hadith: Abū Hurayrah—The Angel of Death came to a man who was dying, looked into his heart, and found nothing in it… The hadith was reported by Ibn Abī al-Dunyā in the Book of the Dying, al-Ṭabarānī, and al-Bayhaqī in al-Shu‘ab. Its chain is good, except that in al-Bayhaqī’s version the man is unnamed, while in al-Ṭabarānī’s version he is named Isḥāq ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ṭalḥah, who is weak.

[63] Hadith: Wāthilah ibn al-Asqa‘ visited a sick man and said: “Tell me, what is your expectation of God?” In it, God says: “I am as My servant expects of Me, so let him expect of Me what he will.” Reported by Ibn Ḥibbān as raised [to the Prophet], and previously mentioned; also by Aḥmad and al-Bayhaqī in al-Shu‘ab together.

[64] Hadith: He visited a youth who was dying and said: “How do you find yourself?” He replied: “I hope in God and fear my sins.” The hadith is previously mentioned.

[65] Hadith: Ibn Mas‘ūd—We entered upon the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) in the house of our mother ‘Ā’ishah when departure was near… The hadith was narrated by al-Bazzār, who said: “This speech has been reported from Murrah from ‘Abd Allāh from various channels, and their chains are close.” He said: “And ‘Abd al-Raḥmān al-Aṣbahānī did not hear this from Murrah; rather, it is from someone who informed him from Murrah.” He said: “I do not know anyone who reported it from ‘Abd Allāh except Murrah.” I say: It has been reported from other channels: Ibn Sa‘d reported it in al-Ṭabaqāt from the narration of Ibn ‘Awf from Ibn Mas‘ūd, and we reported it in the shaykh-list of Judge Abū Bakr al-Anṣārī from the narration of al-Ḥasan al-‘Arabī from Ibn Mas‘ūd, but both are interrupted and weak. Al-Ḥasan al-‘Arabī only reports it from Murrah, as reported by Ibn Abī al-Dunyā and al-Ṭabarānī in al-Awsaṭ.

[66] Hadith: He (peace be upon him) said to Gabriel at his death: “Who will take care of my community after me?” So God Almighty revealed to Gabriel: “Give My beloved the glad tidings that I will not abandon him regarding his community.” The hadith was reported by al-Ṭabarānī from Jābir and Ibn ‘Abbās in a long hadith in which he said: “Who will take care of my chosen community after me?” [Gabriel] said: “Rejoice, O beloved of God, for God Almighty says: ‘I have forbidden Paradise to all the prophets and communities until you and your community enter it.’” He said: “Now my soul is at peace.” Its chain is weak.

[67] Hadith: ‘Ā’ishah—We were commanded to wash him with seven waterskins from seven wells, so we did that, and he found relief. Then he went out and prayed with the people and sought forgiveness for the people of Uḥud. The hadith was reported by al-Dārimī in his Musnad, and in it is Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mukhtār, who is disputed, from Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq, and he was a mudallis, having reported it with ‘an‘anah.

[68] Hadith: ‘Ā’ishah—He was taken in my house, on my day, between my chest and my throat, and God joined my saliva with his at death. The hadith is agreed upon.

[69] A narration from Sa'id ibn 'Abdullah from his father who said: When the Ansar saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ growing increasingly weak, they gathered around the mosque. Al-'Abbas entered and informed him of their presence and their concern. The lengthy narration mentions his ﷺ coming out, leaning [on support], with his head bandaged, dragging his feet until he sat on the lowest step of the pulpit, and then mentions his sermon in full. This is a *mursal*, weak narration containing oddities, and I found no basis for it. His father, 'Abdullah ibn Darar ibn al-Azwar, is a *Tabi'i* who narrated from Ibn Mas'ud. Abu Hatim said about him and his son Sa'id: "They are not strong."

[70] A narration from Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet ﷺ said to Abu Bakr, "Ask, O Abu Bakr." He said, "O Messenger of Allah, the appointed time has drawn near." He ﷺ said, "The appointed time has indeed drawn near." The narration concerns their asking him about who should wash him, in what he should be shrouded, and the manner of praying over him. Ibn Sa'd narrated it in *al-Tabaqat* from Muhammad ibn 'Umar—who is al-Waqidi—with a weak chain to Ibn 'Awf from Ibn Mas'ud. It is *mursal* and weak, as previously mentioned.

[71] A narration from 'Abdullah ibn Zam'ah: Bilal came at the beginning of Rabi' al-Awwal and gave the call to prayer. The Prophet ﷺ said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." I went out and saw no one at the door except 'Umar and some men, Abu Bakr not being among them... Abu Dawud transmitted it with a good chain, similarly but abbreviated, without the statement, "Then 'A'ishah said, 'Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man...'" and he did not say "at the beginning of Rabi' al-Awwal." He said, "Tell someone to lead the people in prayer," and [the Prophet] said, "Allah refuses that, and so do the believers," twice. In another narration of his, he said, "No, no, no! Let the son of Abu Quhafah lead the people in prayer," saying that angrily. As for what is at its end from the statement of 'A'ishah, it is in the two *Sahih* collections from her narration: She said, "O Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man; if he stands in your place, the people will not hear him due to his weeping." He said, "You are like the companions of Yusuf. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer."

[72] A narration from 'A'ishah: On the day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away, they noticed some lightness [in his condition] in the early part of the day. The men dispersed to their homes and their affairs, rejoicing, and they left the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with the women. While we were in that state—we had never been in such a state of hope and joy before—the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, "Make way for me; this is an angel seeking permission..." The lengthy narration concerns the coming of the Angel of Death, then his departure, then the coming of Jibril, then the coming of the Angel of Death and his ﷺ passing. Al-Tabarani transmitted it in *al-Kabir* from the narration of Jabir and Ibn 'Abbas, with differences, in a long narration containing: When Monday came, the matter intensified, and Allah revealed to the Angel of Death: "Descend to My beloved and chosen one, Muhammad ﷺ, in the most beautiful form, and be gentle with him in taking his soul." It contains the Angel of Death entering and seeking permission to take it. He ﷺ said, "O Angel of Death, where did you leave my beloved Jibril?" He said, "I left him in the lowest heaven, with the angels consoling him over you." It was not long before Jibril came to him and sat at his head, and mentioned Jibril giving him glad tidings of what Allah had prepared for him. It contains: "Come closer, O Angel of Death, and proceed with what you have been commanded." The Angel of Death drew near, struggling to take the soul of the Prophet ﷺ, and mentioned distress over that, until he said: "Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away." It is a long narration spanning two large pages, and it is rejected. In it is 'Abd al-Mun'im ibn Idris ibn Sinan from his father from Wahb ibn Munabbih. Ahmad said he used to fabricate from Wahb ibn Munabbih, and Abu Idris is also abandoned, as al-Daraqutni said. Al-Tabarani also narrated it from the narration of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali that Jibril came to him first and said to him from his Lord, "How do you find yourself?" Then Jibril came to him on the third day with the Angel of Death and the Angel of the Air, Isma'il, and that Jibril entered first and asked him, then the Angel of Death sought permission and his statement, "Proceed with what you have been commanded." It is also rejected; in it is 'Abdullah ibn Maymun al-Qaddah. Al-Bukhari said, "His narrations are discarded." He also narrated it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas concerning the Angel of Death coming first, seeking permission, and his statement, "Your Lord sends you greetings of peace." He ﷺ said, "Where is Jibril?" He said, "He is close to me now; he will come." So the Angel of Death went out until Jibril descended upon him... The narration contains al-Mukhtar ibn Nafi', whose narrations are rejected.

[73] A narration from 'A'ishah: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away between the rising of the forenoon sun and midday on Monday. Narrated by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr.

[74] A narration from 'A'ishah: When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away, the people were overcome when the wailing rose, and the angels shrouded the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with his garment. They differed: some denied his death, others were struck dumb and did not speak for a long time afterwards, others became confused though they had their senses, and others were made to sit down. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab was among those who denied his death.

And concerning those who remained seated and those who were silenced, Umar came out to the people and said, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, has not died..." the narration continues until his statement, "with your Lord you are being shortened," I found no basis for it, and it is rejected.

[75] A narration reached Abu Bakr while he was among the Banu al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj, so he came and entered upon the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He looked at him, then leaned over him, kissed him, and wept. Then he said, "May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, God would not make you taste death twice..." the narration continues to the end of his statement, "and it was as if the people had not heard this verse until that day." Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported it from the narration of Aisha that Abu Bakr came on a horse from his dwelling at al-Sunh until he dismounted and entered the mosque. He did not speak to the people until he entered upon Aisha, then he turned toward the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, who was covered with a striped garment. He uncovered his face, then leaned over him, kissed him, and wept. Then he said, "May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, by God, God will not combine two deaths upon you. As for the death that was decreed for you, you have already died it." Both of them reported from the narration of Ibn Abbas that Abu Bakr came out while Umar was speaking to the people... the narration includes, "by God, and it was as if the people did not know that God had revealed this verse until Abu Bakr recited it." Al-Bukhari's wording is in both.

[76] A narration that when the news reached Abu Bakr, he entered the house of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, while he was praying over the Prophet, peace be upon him, his eyes overflowing and his sobs rising like the crackling of a fire, yet he remained firm in action and speech. He leaned over him and uncovered the garment from his face... the narration continues to his statement, "and preserve him among us." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in the Book of Consolation from the narration of Ibn Umar with a weak chain. Abu Bakr came while the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was shrouded, so he uncovered the garment from his face... the narration to its end.

[77] The narration of Ibn Umar regarding hearing consolation for him, peace be upon him: "Indeed, in God is a replacement for everyone, attainment for every desire, and salvation from every fear. So in God place your hope and in Him trust." Then they heard another after it: "Indeed, in God is solace from every calamity and compensation for every loss. So obey God and act by His command." Abu Bakr said, "This is al-Khidr and al-Yasa'." I did not find mention of al-Yasa' in it, but as for the mention of al-Khidr in consolation, al-Nawawi rejected it in the books of Hadith and said, "The companions only mentioned it." I say, rather, al-Hakim reported it in al-Mustadrak in the narration of Anas, but he did not authenticate it, and it is not authentic. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in the Book of Consolation from the narration of Anas as well, saying: When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was taken, his companions gathered around him weeping. A man entered upon them, tall with shoulder-length hair, wearing a waist-wrapper and cloak, stepping over the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until he took hold of the doorposts. He wept over the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, then turned to the companions and said, "Indeed, in God is solace from every calamity, compensation for every loss, and a replacement for every perished one. So turn in repentance to God Almighty, and look to Him in tribulation, so observe, for the afflicted is he who is not compensated by reward." Then the man left. Abu Bakr said, "Follow the man." They looked right and left but saw no one. Abu Bakr said, "Perhaps this is al-Khidr, the brother of our Prophet, upon him be peace, who came to console us." Al-Tabarani reported it in al-Awsat with a very weak chain. Ibn Abi al-Dunya also reported it from the narration of Ali ibn Abi Talib: When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was taken, a visitor came whose sound we heard but whose person we did not see. He said, "Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you. Indeed, in God is compensation for every calamity, a replacement for every perished one, and attainment for every loss. So trust in God and hope in Him, for the deprived is he who is deprived of reward. And peace be upon you." Ali said, "Do you know who this is? He is al-Khidr." In it is Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq, who has been criticized, and there is a break between Ali ibn al-Husayn and the grandfather of Ali. What is known from Ali ibn al-Husayn is transmitted as mursal without mention of Ali, as al-Shafi'i reported in al-Umm, and it contains no mention of al-Khidr.

[78] The narration of Abu Ja'far: "His grave was spread with his own spread and his quilt." In it: "He left behind no wealth after his death, nor did he build in his lifetime brick upon brick, nor place reed upon reed." As for placing the spread and his quilt, the one who placed the quilt was Shuqran, the freed slave of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Mention of that is not a condition of our book. As for him not leaving wealth, that has preceded from the narration of Aisha and others. As for him not building in his lifetime, that has also preceded.

[79] A narration: Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to me, "At your service, Islam, upon the death of Umar." Abu Bakr al-Ajurri reported it in the Book of the Law from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b with a very weak chain, and Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned it in al-Mawdu'at.

[80] The narration of Ibn Abbas: "Umar was placed on his bed, and the people surrounded him supplicating and praying..." he mentioned.

Ali ibn Abi Talib said: I often heard the Prophet, peace be upon him, say, "I, Abu Bakr, and Umar went..." The hadith is agreed upon.

[81] The hadith of Thumamah ibn Hazn al-Fushairi: "I witnessed the people of the house, and Uthman looked down upon them..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan, and by al-Nasa'i.

[82] The hadith: When Salman was near death, he wept, and in it is: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, made a covenant with us that the portion of any of us from this world should be like the provision of a rider." Reported by Ahmad and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, and it has preceded.

[83] The hadith of al-Dahhak: A man said, "O Messenger of God, who are the most ascetic of people?" He said, "He who does not forget the graves and the..." The hadith has preceded.

[84] The hadith: "I have not seen a sight except that the grave is more dreadful than it." Preceded in the third chapter on the Etiquette of Companionship.

[85] The hadith of Umar: "We went out with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, to the graveyards, and he sat by a grave, and I was the closest of the people..." In it is: "This is the grave of Aminah bint Wahb. I sought permission from my Lord to visit her, and He permitted me." Preceded in the Etiquette of Companionship as well. Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in the Book of Graves from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, in which there is mention of Umar ibn al-Khattab. Its end in Ibn Majah is abbreviated, and in it is Ayyub ibn Hani', whom Ibn Ma'in weakened, while Abu Hatim said he is salih.

[86] The hadith of Uthman: He would, when he stood by a grave, weep until his beard became wet. In it is: "The grave is the first of the abodes of the Hereafter." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it hasan, and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated it. Preceded in the Etiquette of Companionship.

[87] The hadith: "That I advance a miscarried fetus is more beloved to me than leaving behind a hundred horsemen, all of whom fight in the way of God." I did not find in it mention of a hundred horsemen. Ibn Majah reported from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "A miscarried fetus I advance before me is more beloved to me than a horseman I leave behind me."

[88] The hadith: "No one of the Muslims loses three children and they are withheld..." Preceded in the chapter on Marriage.

[89] The hadith of his prohibition against visiting graves, then his permission for that. Reported by Muslim from the hadith of Buraydah, and it has preceded.

[90] The hadith of Ali: "I had forbidden you from visiting graves, but visit them, for they remind you of the Hereafter, but do not speak foolishly." Reported by Ahmad and Abu Ya'la in his Musnad, and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the Book of Graves, and the wording is his. Ahmad and Abu Ya'la did not say, "but do not speak foolishly." In it is Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an from Rabi'ah ibn al-Nabighah. Al-Bukhari did not authenticate it, and Rabi'ah was mentioned by Ibn Hibban among the reliable narrators.

[91] The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, visited the grave of his mother with a thousand cloaked ones, and no day was seen with more weeping than that day." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the Book of Graves from the hadith of Buraydah, and his shaykh, Ahmad ibn Imran al-Akhnas, is abandoned. It is reported similarly from another route: "We were with him, nearly a thousand riders." In it is that he was not given permission to seek forgiveness for her.

[92] The hadith: And he said on that day, "I was given permission for the visit, but not for seeking forgiveness." Preceded in the hadith before it from the hadith of Buraydah, that he was not given permission to seek forgiveness for her. Muslim reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "I sought permission from my Lord to seek forgiveness for my mother, but He did not permit me, and I sought permission to visit her grave, and He permitted me."

[93] The hadith of Ibn Abi Mulaikah: Aisha came one day from the graveyards, so I said, "O Mother of the Believers, from where have you come?" She said, "From the grave of my brother Abd al-Rahman." I said, "Did not the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, forbid it?" She said, "Yes, then he commanded it." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the Graves with a good chain.

[94] The hadith of Abu Dharr: "Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter, and wash the dead, for handling an empty body is an eloquent admonition." The hadith of Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the Graves and al-Hakim with a good chain.

[95] The hadith of Ibn Abi Mulaikah: "Visit your dead, greet them, and pray for them." The hadith of Ibn Abi al-Dunya in it is like this, mursal, and its chain is hasan.

[96] Hadith: Whoever visits the grave of his parents or one of them every Friday, he will be forgiven and recorded as dutiful. Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Saghir and al-Awsat from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Qubur from the narration of Muhammad ibn al-Nu'man, who attributed it to the Prophet (marfu'), but it is problematic (mu'dal) and Muhammad ibn al-Nu'man is unknown, and his shaykh in al-Tabarani's chain, Yahya ibn al-'Ala' al-Bajali, is abandoned (matruk).

[97] Hadith of Ibn Sirin: A man may die while his parents are alive and he is undutiful to them, then he supplicates to Allah for them after their death, so Allah records him among the dutiful. Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in his book, and it is a sound chain but interrupted (mursal). It was also narrated by Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Yahya ibn 'Uqbah Abu al-Ghayzaran from Muhammad ibn Jahadah from Anas. He said: And it was narrated by al-Salt ibn al-Hajjaj from Ibn Jahadah from Qatadah from Anas. Both Yahya ibn 'Uqbah and al-Salt ibn al-Hajjaj are weak.

[98] Hadith: Whoever visits my grave, my intercession becomes incumbent for him. Previously mentioned in the chapter on the secrets of Hajj.

[99] Hadith: Whoever visits me in Madinah seeking reward, I will be an intercessor and a witness for him on the Day of Resurrection. Previously mentioned there.

[100] Hadith of 'A'ishah: No man visits the grave of his brother and sits by it except that he finds solace with him and receives a response until he departs. Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Qubur, and in its chain is 'Abdullah ibn Sam'an, whose condition I have not ascertained. It was narrated by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in al-Tamhid from a hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with similar meaning, and 'Abd al-Haqq al-Ishbili authenticated it.

[101] Hadith: The deceased in his grave is but like a drowning man calling for help, awaiting a supplication that reaches him from his father, or his brother, or a friend of his... The hadith. Reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from a hadith of Ibn 'Abbas. In its chain is al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn 'Abd al-Wahid. Al-Dhahabi said: He narrated from Hisham ibn 'Ammar a baseless hadith.

[102] Hadith of Sa'id ibn 'Abdullah al-Azdi: I was present with Abu Umamah al-Bahili while he was in the throes of death, and he said: O Sa'id, when I die, do with me as the Messenger of Allah commanded us. He said: When one of you dies and you have leveled the earth over him, let one of you stand at the head of his grave and say: O so-and-so, son of so-and-so... The hadith concerning prompting the deceased in his grave. Al-Tabarani reported it thus with a weak chain.

[103] Hadith: When your companion dies, leave him and do not disturb him. Reported by Abu Dawud from a hadith of 'A'ishah with a sound (jayyid) chain.

[104] Hadith: Do not revile the dead, for they have gone forward to what they have sent forth. Reported by al-Bukhari also from a hadith of 'A'ishah.

[105] Hadith: Do not mention your dead except with good... The hadith. Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Mawt thus with a weak chain from a hadith of 'A'ishah. It is in al-Nasa'i from a hadith of 'A'ishah with a sound (jayyid) chain, supported. The wording mentioned here is 'your perished ones'. The compiler of Musnad al-Firdaws mentioned the addition and marked it with the sign of al-Nasa'i and al-Tabarani.

[106] Hadith of Anas: A funeral passed by the Messenger of Allah and they praised the deceased with evil, so he said: "It has become incumbent..." Agreed upon (muttafaq 'alayh).

[107] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: A servant may die and the people praise him with praise, while Allah knows otherwise from him... The hadith. Reported by Ahmad from the narration of a shaykh from the people of Basrah from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet: He attributes to his Lord, Mighty and Majestic: There is no Muslim servant who dies and three households of his closest neighbors testify to his goodness except that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: I have accepted the testimony of My servants concerning what they knew, and I have forgiven him for what I know.

[108] Hadith: Permission was not given to the Messenger of Allah to speak concerning the soul. Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud concerning the Jews' question about the soul and the revelation of His saying, Exalted is He: "And they ask you about the soul..." Previously mentioned.

[110] Hadith: The grave is either a pit from the pits of the Fire or a garden from the gardens of Paradise. Reported by al-Tirmidhi.

From the narration of Abu Sa'id, previously mentioned in the chapter on Hope and Fear.

[111] Narration of Anas: "Death is the Resurrection; whoever dies, his resurrection has come." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" with a weak chain, and it has been previously mentioned.

[112] Narration: "When one of you dies, his place is shown to him morning and evening." Agreed upon as authentic from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[113] Narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever dies as a stranger dies a martyr and is protected from the trial of the grave." Reported by Ibn Majah with a weak chain, and he said: "the trial of the grave." Ibn Abi al-Dunya said: "the two testers."

[114] Narration of 'A'ishah: "Shall I not give you glad tidings, O Jabir?" The narration includes: "Indeed, God revived your father and seated him before Him." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" with a chain containing weakness, and by al-Tirmidhi who graded it as good, and by Ibn Majah from the narration of Jabir: "Shall I not give you glad tidings of what God has done for your father?" He said: "Yes, O Messenger of God." The narration includes: "So He said: 'O My servant, ask of Me, I will grant you.' He said: 'My Lord, revive me so that I may be killed for You again.' The Lord, Glorified is He, said: 'It has already preceded from Me that they do not return.'"

[115] Narration: He said to a man who had died: "This one has become vacant from the world and left it for its people. If he was pleased, it would not please him to return to the world, just as it does not please any of you to return to his mother's womb." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of 'Amr ibn Dinar as a mursal report, and its narrators are trustworthy.

[116] Narration: "The likeness of the believer in the world is like a fetus in its mother's womb. When it emerges from her womb, it cries over its exit until, when it sees the light and is placed down, it does not desire to return to its place." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya therein from the narration of Baqiyyah from Jabir ibn Ghanim al-Salafi from Sulaym ibn 'Amir al-Jana'izi as a mursal report like this.

[117] Narration: It was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "So-and-so has died." He said: "Is he relieved, or are others relieved of him?" Agreed upon as authentic from the narration of Abu Qatadah with the wording: "A funeral passed by him, and he said that." It is in Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-Mawt" with the wording cited by the author.

[118] Narration of al-Nu'man ibn Bashir: "Behold, nothing remains of the world except like a fly buzzing in its interior. So fear God, fear God concerning your brothers among the people of the graves, for your deeds are presented to them." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya, Abu Bakr ibn Lal, from the narration of Malik ibn Adi from al-Nu'man as his saying: "Fear God, fear God." Al-Azdi reported it in full in "Al-Du'afa" and said its chain is not sound. Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned it in full in "Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil" in the biography of Abu Isma'il al-Sakuni, a narration from Malik ibn Adi, and he transmitted from his father that both of them are unknown. Al-Azdi said: "Its chain is not sound." Ibn Hibban mentioned Malik ibn Adi in "Al-Thiqat."

[119] Narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Do not disgrace your dead with the evils of your deeds, for they are presented to your loved ones among the people of the graves." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya and al-Mahamili with a weak chain. Ahmad has it from the narration of one who heard a man from Anas: "Your deeds are presented to your relatives and kin among the dead."

[120] Narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "The deceased recognizes the one who washes him, the one who carries him, and the one who lowers him into his grave." Reported by Ahmad from the narration of a man from him whose name is Mu'awiyah or Ibn Mu'awiyah—'Abd al-Malik ibn Hasan forgot it.

[121] Narration of Abu Ayyub: "When the soul of a believer is taken, the people of mercy from God's presence receive it as one receives a bearer of glad tidings, saying: 'Look after your brother until he finds rest.'" Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Kitab al-Mawt" and al-Tabarani in "Musnad al-Shamiyyin" with a weak chain. Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in "Al-Zuhd" as a mawquf report stopping at Abu Ayyub with a sound chain. Ibn Sa'id elevated it to marfu' in his additions to "Al-Zuhd," and in it is Salam al-Tawil, who is weak. It is found in al-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban similarly from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a sound chain.

[122] Narration: "The grave says to the deceased when he is placed in it: 'Woe to you, O son of Adam! What deluded you concerning me? Did you not know that I am the abode of trial?'" Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Kitab al-Qubur," al-Tabarani in "Musnad al-Shamiyyin," and Abu Ahmad al-Hakim in "Al-Sukuni" from the narration of Abu al-Hajjaj al-Tamali with a chain.

[123] A weak narration. The hadith of Abdullah ibn 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr: It reached me that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The deceased sits up and hears the footsteps of those escorting him, and none speaks to him except his grave, which says: 'Woe to you, O son of Adam...'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in "Al-Qubur" in this manner as a mursal narration, and its narrators are trustworthy. Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in "Al-Zuhd," except he said: "It reached me," and did not attribute it directly to the Prophet.

[124] The hadith of al-Bara': We went out with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, for the funeral of a man from the Ansar. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sat at his grave, his head bowed, then said: "O God, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the grave..." in its full length. Abu Dawud and al-Hakim reported it in full, the latter saying it is sound according to the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Ibn Hibban deemed it weak. Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah reported it in an abbreviated form.

[125] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When the believer is present (at death), the angels come to him with a silk cloth containing musk and bundles of sweet basil..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya and Ibn Hibban reported it with variations, and al-Bazzar with the wording of the author.

[126] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The believer in his grave is in a verdant meadow, and his grave is expanded for him seventy cubits..." Ibn Hibban also reported it.

[127] The hadith: "The possessor of one dirham will have an easier reckoning than the possessor of two dirhams." I found no basis for it.

[128] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When a servant dies, two black, blue-eyed angels come to him. One is called Munkar and the other Nakir..." Al-Tirmidhi reported it and deemed it fair, and Ibn Hibban with variations.

[129] The hadith of 'Ata' ibn Yasar: He said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: "O 'Umar, how will it be with you when you die and your people take you and measure for you three cubits by a cubit and a span..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in "Kitab al-Qubur" in this manner as a mursal narration, and its narrators are trustworthy. Al-Bayhaqi said in "Al-I'tiqad": We reported it through a sound chain from 'Ata' ibn Yasar as mursal. I say: Ibn Battah connected it in "Al-Ibanah" through a narration from Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Bayhaqi reported it in "Al-I'tiqad" through a narration from 'Umar and said it is rare with this chain; Mufaddal alone narrated it. Ahmad and Ibn Hibban have it from a narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, where 'Umar said: "Will our intellects be returned to us?" He said: "Yes, just as you are today." 'Umar said: "Then with his mouth, the stone."

[130] The hadith of Hudhayfah: I was with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, at a funeral, and he sat at the head of the grave, then began to look into it... Ahmad reported it with a weak chain.

[131] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "The grave has a pressure; if anyone were to be saved or delivered from it, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh would have been saved." Ahmad reported it with a sound chain.

[132] The hadith of Anas: Zaynab, the daughter of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, died, and she was a woman often ill... In it: "She was indeed pressed with a pressure whose sound was heard between the two horizons." Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in "Al-Mawt" from the narration of Sulayman al-A'mash from Anas, but he did not hear it directly from him.

[133] The hadith: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw the pressure of the grave in the case of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh and in the case of his daughter Zaynab, and likewise was the state of Abu Jadir when he was martyred. The three preceding hadiths were mentioned in the previous chapter.

[134] The hadith: "A good dream is one part of forty-six parts of prophethood." Previously mentioned.

[135] The hadith concerning the command for purification before sleep, agreed upon as sound, from the hadith of al-Bara': "When you go to your bed, perform ablution as you would for prayer..."

[136] The hadith: The conquest of Makkah was revealed to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in a dream. Ibn Abi Hatim reported it in his Tafsir from the narration of Mujahid as mursal.

[137] The hadith: "The Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: Love whom you love, for you shall part from him..." Previously mentioned.

[138] The hadith: "He left not brick upon brick nor reed upon reed." Also previously mentioned.

[139] The hadith: "He left neither dinar nor dirham." Also previously mentioned.

[140] The hadith: "If I were to take an intimate friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr, but your companion is the intimate friend of the Merciful." Also previously mentioned.

[141] The hadith: "Whoever sees me in a dream has indeed seen me, for Satan cannot assume my form," agreed upon as sound from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[142] A narration from Ibn 'Uyaynah, from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, from Jabir: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) was never asked for anything but that he said, 'No.'" Reported by Muslim, and it has preceded.

[143] A narration: Allah the Exalted said, "The son of Adam reviles Me, though it is not fitting for him to revile Me. And he denies Me, though it is not fitting for him to deny Me..." The hadith was reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[144] A narration: "How can I be at ease when the bearer of the Trumpet has already placed it to his mouth, inclined his forehead, and is listening for when he will be commanded?" Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id, who said it is *hasan* (good). Ibn Majah reported it with the wording: "Indeed my two companions (or: in their hands are two trumpets), they are gazing intently, awaiting when they will be commanded." In the narration of Ibn Majah: al-Hajjaj ibn Arta'ah is disputed.

[145] A narration: "When He sent to the bearer of the Trumpet, he gestured with it to his mouth, putting one foot forward and the other back..." I have not found it exactly like this. Rather, it has been reported that Israfil has been thus since the beginning of creation. As reported by al-Bukhari in *al-Tarikh* and Abu al-Shaykh in *Kitab al-'Azamah* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "When Allah, Blessed and Exalted, finished creating the heavens and the earth, He created the Trumpet and gave it to Israfil. So he has it placed at his mouth, his gaze fixed towards the Throne, awaiting when he will be commanded." Al-Bukhari said: "It is not established (*sahih*)." In a narration of Abu al-Shaykh: "The bearer of the Trumpet has not blinked since he was entrusted with it, prepared, looking towards the Throne, fearing that he might be commanded before his glance returns to him. It is as if his two eyes are two shining stars." Its chain is good.

[146] A narration: "People will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection on a white, reddish-white earth, like a pure loaf of bread, wherein there is no landmark for anyone." Agreed upon from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd. Al-Bukhari separated the statement "wherein there is no landmark for anyone," making it from the words of Sahl or another, while Muslim included it within the hadith.

[147] A narration: "People will be resurrected barefoot, naked, uncircumcised. Sweat will bridle them, reaching to the fat of their ears." Sawdah, the narrator of the hadith, said, "Oh, how wretched!" The hadith was reported by al-Tha'labi and al-Baghawi, and it is in the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of 'A'ishah, and she is the one who said, "Oh, how wretched!" Al-Tabarani reported it in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Umm Salamah, and she is the one who said, "Oh, how wretched!"

[148] A narration from Abu Hurayrah: "People will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection riding, walking, and on their faces..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi who graded it *hasan*. In the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of Anas: A man said, "O Prophet of Allah, how will the disbeliever be gathered on his face?" He said, "Is not He Who made him walk on two legs in this world able to make him walk on his face on the Day of Resurrection?"

[149] A narration from Ibn 'Umar: "On the Day when people will stand before the Lord of the worlds, until one of them is submerged in his sweat up to the middle of his ears." Agreed upon.

[150] A narration from Abu Hurayrah: "People will sweat on the Day of Resurrection until their sweat goes into the earth seventy cubits." The two (al-Bukhari and Muslim) reported it in the two *Sahih* collections, as mentioned by the author.

[151] A narration: "Standing, their eyes fixed for forty years towards the sky. Sweat will bridle them from the intensity of the distress." Reported by Ibn 'Adi from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud. In it is Abu Taybah 'Isa ibn Sulayman al-Jurjani. Ibn Ma'in weakened him, and Ibn 'Adi said, "I do not think he would intentionally lie, but perhaps he was mistaken."

[152] A narration from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir: "The sun will draw near to the earth on the Day of Resurrection, and people will sweat. Among them will be one whose sweat reaches his ankles..." Reported by Ahmad. In it is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[153] A narration from Ibn 'Umar: He recited this verse: "On the Day when people will stand before the Lord of the worlds..." Then he said, "How will you be when Allah gathers you as arrows are gathered in a quiver, for fifty thousand years, without looking at you?" I (the compiler) say: It is only 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar. Al-Tabarani reported it in *al-Kabir*. In it is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Maysarah. Ibn Abi Hatim did not mention a narrator for it other than Ibn Wahb. They have, other than 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Maysarah al-Hadrami, four; this one is an Egyptian, and the other three are Syrians.

[154] A narration: He was asked about the length of that day. He said, "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it will be lightened for the believer until it becomes easier for him than a prescribed prayer he prays in this world." Reported by Abu Ya'la and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. In it is Ibn Lahi'ah. Ibn Wahb reported it from 'Amr ibn al-Harith instead of Ibn Lahi'ah, and it is *hasan* (good). Abu Ya'la has it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a good chain: "That will be made light for the believer like the descent of the sun at sunset until it sets." Al-Bayhaqi reported it in...

The people continued until he said, I believe it is raised with the wording: Indeed, Allah lightens for whom He wills among His servants its length, like the time of an obligatory prayer.

[155] The hadith: "Surah Hud, Al-Waqi'ah, Al-Mursalat, 'Amma Yatasa'alun, and Idha Ash-Shamsu Kuwwirat have aged me." Reported by At-Tirmidhi who graded it hasan, and Al-Hakim who authenticated it, and it has preceded.

[156] The hadith: "Indeed, for Allah, Mighty and Majestic, is an angel between the two edges of his eyes is a distance of one hundred years." I have not seen it with this wording.

[157] The hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when there is no cloud?" The hadith is agreed upon, except for his saying "Then the servant is cast..." for which Muslim reported it uniquely.

[158] The hadith of Anas: "Do you know what He laughs from?" We said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." He said, "From the servant addressing his Lord..." The hadith is reported by Muslim.

[159] The hadith: A man asked Ibn 'Umar, saying, "How did you hear the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say concerning the private conversation?" The hadith is reported by Muslim.

[160] The hadith: "Whoever conceals the fault of a believer, Allah will conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection." It has preceded.

[161] The hadith: "There is not one of you except that the Lord of the worlds will question him..." The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Adiyy from Abu Hatim with the wording "except that He will speak to him..."

[162] The hadith: "One of you will certainly stand before Allah, Mighty and Majestic, with no interpreter between him and Him..." Reported by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of 'Adiyy ibn Hatim.

[163] The hadith of Al-Hasan: That 'A'ishah mentioned the Hereafter and wept... The hadith includes: So he said, "What makes you weep, O 'A'ishah?" She said, "I remembered the Hereafter. Will you remember your families on the Day of Resurrection?" Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of Al-Hasan that she mentioned the Fire and wept, so he said, "What makes you weep?" without mentioning that his head, peace be upon him, was in her lap and that he was drowsy, and its chain is *jayyid* (sound).

[164] The hadith: "Allah will say: 'O Adam, arise and send forth the contingent to the Fire.' He will say: 'And how many is the contingent to the Fire?' He will say: 'From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.'" The hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, and Al-Bukhari reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurairah similarly, and it has preceded.

[165] The hadith of Abu Hurairah: "Do you know who the bankrupt is?" They said, "The bankrupt, O Messenger of Allah, is one who has no dirham nor any property." It has preceded.

[166] The hadith: "O Abu Dharr, do you know what they are butting heads over?" I said, "No." He said, "But your Lord knows, and He will judge between them." Reported by Ahmad from the narration of shaykhs who were not named, from Abu Dharr.

[167] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Indeed, Satan has despaired that idols will be worshipped in the land of the Arabs, but he will be content with you having less than that: the minor sins, and they are the destructive sins." The hadith, and at its end: "And the likeness of that is like travelers who alight in a desert..." Reported by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi in *Ash-Shu'ab*, limited to its end: "Beware of the minor sins, for they gather upon a man until they destroy him. And indeed, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, gave a parable for them..." and its chain is *jayyid*. As for the first part of the hadith, Muslim reported it concisely from the hadith of Jabir: "Indeed, Satan has despaired that those who pray will worship him in the Arabian Peninsula, but [he is content] with inciting strife among them."

[168] The hadith: When the verse was revealed: "Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die. Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute" (Az-Zumar: 30-31), Az-Zubayr said, "O Messenger of Allah, will what was between us be repeated for us?" Reported by Ahmad with this wording, and At-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Az-Zubayr, and he said: Hasan Sahih.

[169] The hadith of Anas: "The servants will be gathered naked, *ghurran*, *buhman*." We said, "What are *buhman*?" He said, "With nothing with them..." I say: It is not from the hadith of Anas; rather it is from 'Ubaydullah ibn Unays. Ahmad reported it with a *hasan* chain and said "*ghurla*" instead of "*ghurran*."

[170] The hadith of Anas: While the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was sitting, we saw him laugh until his front teeth showed. 'Umar said, "What makes you laugh, O Messenger of Allah? May my father and mother be sacrificed for you!" He said, "Two men from my nation knelt before the Lord of the worlds..." the hadith at length. Reported by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya in *Husn Az-Zann Billah* and Al-Hakim in *Al-Mustadrak*, and it has preceded.

[171] A Hadith states: The Sirat (Bridge) will be erected across the midst of Hellfire, and I will be the first to cross it. Agreed upon, from the lengthy Hadith of Abu Hurairah.

[172] A Hadith of Abu Sa'id: Mankind will be gathered upon a bridge over Hell, upon which are thorns, hooks, and barbed spikes. The Hadith is agreed upon, with differences in wording.

[173] A Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: Allah will gather the first and the last for an appointed Day, standing for forty years, their gazes fixed towards the sky, awaiting the decree. He said: And he mentioned the Hadith up to the mention of the believers prostrating. The lengthy Hadith was narrated by Ibn 'Adi and Al-Hakim; a portion of it has preceded in an abbreviated form.

[174] A Hadith of Anas: The Sirat is like the edge of a sword or like the edge of a hair. Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab reported it and said: This chain is weak. He said: And it is narrated from Ziyad al-Numayri from Anas, raised to the Prophet: The Sirat is like the edge of a hair or like the edge of a sword. He said: And this narration is sound. Ahmad narrated it from the Hadith of 'A'ishah, and in its chain is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[175] A Hadith of 'Amr ibn al-'As: That the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, recited the saying of Ibrahim, peace be upon him: "My Lord, indeed they have led astray many of the people. So whoever follows me, then he is of me; and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are Forgiving and Merciful." And the saying of 'Isa, peace be upon him: "If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants." Then he raised his hands and said: "My Ummah, my Ummah," and wept. The Hadith includes: O Jibril, go to Muhammad and say: We shall please you and not grieve you concerning your Ummah. I say: It is not from the Hadith of 'Amr ibn al-'As, but rather from the Hadith of his son 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As, as Muslim narrated it. Perhaps the mention of 'Abdullah was omitted from some copies of the Ihya'.

[176] A Hadith: I have been given five things not given to anyone before me... and among them: I have been given Intercession. Agreed upon, from the Hadith of Jabir: On the Day of Resurrection, I will be the Imam of the Prophets, their orator, and the possessor of their intercession, without boasting. Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah reported it from the Hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka'b. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan Sahih.

[177] A Hadith: I am the master of the children of Adam, without boasting. Al-Tirmidhi reported it and said: Hasan, and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.

[178] A Hadith: For every Prophet is a supplication that is answered. I wish to reserve my supplication as intercession for my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection. Agreed upon, from the Hadith of Anas. Muslim narrated it from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah.

[179] A Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: Pulpits of gold will be set up for the Prophets, and they will sit upon them, but my pulpit will remain; I will not sit upon it, standing before my Lord, erect. Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat reported it. In its chain are Muhammad ibn Thabit and Al-Banani, who are weak.

[180] A Hadith: Indeed, I will intercede on the Day of Resurrection for more than the stones and clay upon the face of the earth. Ahmad and Al-Tabarani reported it from the Hadith of Buraidah with a Hasan chain.

[181] A Hadith of Abu Hurairah: That the Prophet, peace be upon him, was brought some meat, and the foreleg was raised to him—and he liked it—so he took a bite from it. Then he said: I am the master of mankind... the lengthy Hadith concerning Intercession. He said: And in another Hadith with this context, the sins of Ibrahim are mentioned. Agreed upon. This second narration was reported by Muslim.

[182] A Hadith: A man from my Ummah will cause more people to enter Paradise by his intercession than (the tribes of) Rabi'ah and Mudar. We narrated it in the compilation of Abu 'Umar ibn al-Sammak from the Hadith of Abu Umamah, except he said: Like one of the two communities, Rabi'ah and Mudar. In it: It is as if the elders consider that man to be 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, and its chain is Hasan. Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Al-Hakim have from the Hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Abi al-Jad'a: A man from my Ummah will cause more people to enter Paradise by his intercession than (the tribe of) Banu Tamim. They said: Other than you? He said: Other than me. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan Sahih, and Al-Hakim said: Sahih. It is said he meant by "the man": Uways.

[183] A Hadith: It will be said to a man: Stand, O so-and-so, and intercede. So he will stand and intercede for the tribe, for the household, for one man and two men, according to the measure of his deeds. Al-Tirmidhi reported it from the Hadith of Abu Sa'id: That among my Ummah are those who will intercede for large groups, and among them are those who will intercede for a tribe... and he said: Hasan. Al-Bazzar has from the Hadith of Anas: That a man will intercede for two or three.

[184] A Hadith of Anas: That a man from the people of Paradise will look down from a height on the Day of Resurrection upon the people of the Fire. A man from the people of the Fire will call to him and say: O so-and-so, do you recognize me? He will say: No, by Allah, I do not recognize you. Who are you?

He says: I am the one whom you passed by in the world one day and asked me for a drink, so I gave you to drink. The hadith concerning his intercession in this matter and his extraction from the Fire was reported by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws with a weak chain.

[185] The hadith of Anas: I will be the first of the people to emerge when they are resurrected. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan gharib.

[186] The hadith: Then I will be clothed in a garment from the garments of Paradise, then I will stand at the right side of the Throne. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is hasan gharib sahih.

[187] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: Some people from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, were sitting waiting for him. He came out, and when he drew near to them, he heard them conversing and heard their talk. Some of them said: How amazing! Allah has taken from His creation a close friend; He took Ibrahim as a close friend. The hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is gharib.

[188] The hadith of Anas: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, dozed off lightly, then raised his head smiling. They said to him: O Messenger of Allah, what made you smile? He said: A verse was just revealed to me, and he recited: "In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar." Reported by Muslim.

[189] The hadith of Anas: While I was walking in Paradise, I came upon a river whose banks were domes of hollow pearl. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih, and al-Bukhari reported it from the statement of Anas concerning when the Prophet, peace be upon him, was ascended to the heaven. The hadith is elevated (marfu'), even though it was not explicitly stated as being from the Prophet, peace be upon him.

[190] The hadith of Anas: The distance between the two sides of my Basin is like the distance between al-Madinah and Sana'a, or like the distance between al-Madinah and 'Amman. Reported by Muslim.

[191] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: When the verse was revealed: "Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar," the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: It is a river in Paradise, its banks are of gold. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi with a difference in wording, and he said it is hasan sahih. Al-Darimi reported it in his Musnad, and it is closer to the wording of the author.

[192] The hadith of Thawban: Indeed, my Basin is from 'Aden to 'Amman al-Balqa'. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is gharib, and by Ibn Majah.

[193] The hadith of Abu Dharr: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the vessels of the Basin? He said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, its vessels are more numerous than the stars of the sky. Reported by Muslim.

[194] The hadith of Samurah: Indeed, every prophet has a basin, and they vie with one another as to which of them has more arrivals. The hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is gharib. He said: Al-Ash'ath ibn 'Abd al-Malik narrated this hadith from al-Hasan from the Prophet, peace be upon him, as mursal, and he did not mention Samurah in it, and that is more sound.

[195] The hadith: Indeed, in Hellfire there are seventy thousand valleys; in every valley are seventy thousand ravines; in every ravine are seventy thousand serpents and seventy thousand scorpions. The disbeliever and the hypocrite will not cease until all of that befalls him. I have not found it exactly like this in its entirety. What has been reported concerning the mention of serpents and scorpions will come after this.

[196] The hadith of 'Ali: Seek refuge with Allah from the Pit of Sorrow or the Valley of Sorrow. The hadith was reported by Ibn 'Adi with the wording "Valley of Sorrow," and he said it is batil (false). Abu Nu'aym and al-Asbahani reported it with a weak chain. Al-Tirmidhi reported it and said it is gharib, and Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording "Pit of Sorrow." Ibn 'Adi weakened it. It was mentioned previously in the condemnation of arrogance and ostentation.

[197] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: We were with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when we heard a loud crash. The hadith includes: This is a stone that was cast into Hellfire. Reported by Muslim.

[198] The hadith: The person among the people of the Fire with the lightest punishment on the Day of Resurrection is one who will be given two sandals of fire. The hadith is agreed upon from the hadith of al-Nu'man ibn Bashir.

[199] The hadith: Indeed, the fire of this world was washed seventy times with the waters of mercy until the people of this world could bear it. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr mentioned it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: This fire was struck with the water of the sea seven times, and were it not for that, no one would have benefited from it. Al-Bazzar reported it from the hadith of Anas, and it is weak: "It did not reach you until—I think he said—it was sprinkled with water, so it gives you light."

[200] The hadith: Allah commanded that the Fire be kindled for a thousand years until it became red. This was mentioned previously.

[201] The hadith: The Fire complained to its Lord, saying: O my Lord, part of me consumes another part. So He permitted it two breaths.

[202] Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "If a bucket of foul pus were poured upon the world, it would cause the people of the earth to stink." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said we only know it from the narration of Rushd ibn Sa'd, and there is weakness in it.

[203] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "If a single drop of the tree of Zaqqum were to drip into the dwellings of the world, it would ruin the livelihood of the people of the earth." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan sahih, and by Ibn Majah.

[204] Hadith of Anas: "Desire that for which He has made you desire, and beware and fear that from which He has warned you—the punishment and chastisement of God from Hellfire." I did not find a chain of transmission for this hadith.

[205] Hadith of Abu al-Darda': "Hunger will be cast upon the people of the Fire until it equals the torment they are in, so they will cry out for food." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Samurah ibn 'Atiyyah from Shahr ibn Hawshab from Umm al-Darda' from Abu al-Darda'. Al-Darimi said, "The people do not know this hadith; it is only narrated from al-A'mash from Samurah ibn 'Atiyyah from Shahr from Umm al-Darda' from Abu al-Darda', his saying."

[206] Hadith of Abu Umamah concerning His saying, the Exalted: 'And he will be given to drink from boiling water, which he will gulp but can scarcely swallow' (Quran 14:16-17). He said, "It is brought near to him..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is ghareeb.

[207] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever is given wealth by God and does not pay its Zakat, his wealth will be made to appear to him on the Day of Resurrection as a bald-headed poisonous snake." Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and by Muslim from the hadith of Jabir, similarly.

[208] Hadith: "Indeed, in the Fire are snakes like the necks of Bactrian camels; their sting..." Reported by Ahmad from the narration of Ibn Lahi'ah from Diraj from 'Abdullah ibn al-Harith ibn Juz'.

[209] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The molar tooth of the disbeliever in the Fire is like (Mount) Uhud." Reported by Muslim.

[210] Hadith: "His lower lip will be drooping onto his chest, and the upper one will be raised, covering his face." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and he said it is hasan sahih ghareeb.

[211] Hadith: "Indeed, the tongue of the disbeliever will be dragged for two parasangs on the Day of Resurrection, and the people will tread upon it." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu al-Mukhariq from Ibn 'Umar, and he said it is ghareeb, and Abu al-Mukhariq is unknown.

[212] Hadith: "Hellfire will be brought on that Day with seventy thousand reins..." Reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud.

[213] Hadith of Anas: "Weeping will be sent upon the people of the Fire, and they will weep until their tears are exhausted." Reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Yazid al-Raqashi from Anas, and al-Raqashi is weak.

[214] Hadith: "Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection as if it were a speckled ram, and it will be slaughtered." Reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar and by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and it has preceded.

[215] Hadith: "On the Day of Resurrection, a group of people will be commanded from the Fire to Paradise. When they draw near to it and inhale its fragrance..." We have narrated it in the 'Forty' of Abu Hadiyah from Anas, and Abu Hadiyah, Ibrahim ibn Hadiyah, is lost/perished.

[216] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "A caller will call out, 'Indeed, you have health, so you shall never fall ill.'" Reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and Abu Sa'id.

[217] Hadith: "Two gardens of silver—their vessels and what is in them—and two gardens of gold—their vessels and what is in them..." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa.

[218] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever spends a pair from his wealth in the cause of God will be called from the gates of Paradise..." Agreed upon.

[219] Hadith: "I will come on the Day of Resurrection to the gate of Paradise and seek to open it. The keeper will say, 'Who are you?' I will say, 'Muhammad.'" Reported by Muslim from the hadith of Anas.

[220] Hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Indeed, the people of Paradise will see the people of the chambers above them as you see the shining star." Agreed upon, and it has preceded.

[221] Hadith: "Indeed, the people of the highest degrees will be seen by those beneath them as they see the rising star." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it hasan, and by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Sa'id.

[222] Hadith of Jabir: "Shall I not inform you of the chambers of Paradise?" I said, "Yes, O Messenger of God, may my father and mother be your ransom." He said, "In Paradise there are chambers made of various types of jewels..." The hadith was reported by Abu Nu'aym from the narration of al-Hasan from Jabir.

[223] Hadith: He was asked about the saying of the Exalted, "And pleasant dwellings in Gardens of perpetual residence" [9:72]. He said, "Palaces of pearl..." The hadith was reported by Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban in *Kitab al-'Azamah* and al-Ajurri in *Kitab al-Nasihah* from the narration of al-Hasan ibn Khalifah from al-Hasan, who said: I asked Abu Hurayrah and 'Imran ibn Husayn about this verse. It is not sound, and al-Hasan ibn Khalifah was not recognized by Ibn Abi Hatim, and al-Hasan al-Basri did not hear from Abu Hurayrah according to the majority opinion.

[224] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The wall of Paradise is a brick of silver and a brick of gold; its dust is saffron and its clay is musk." Al-Tirmidhi reported it with the wording, "and its mortar is musk," and said its chain is not that strong and it is not, in my view, continuous. Al-Bazzar reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with a chain containing criticism, and reported it as a *mawquf* statement [attributed to a Companion] with a sound chain.

[225] Hadith: He was asked about the soil of Paradise. He said, "White camphor, pure musk." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id that Ibn Sayyad asked the Prophet ﷺ about that, and he mentioned it.

[226] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever is pleased that God gives him wine to drink in the Hereafter, let him abandon it in this world. And whoever is pleased that God clothes him in silk in the Hereafter, let him abandon it in this world." Al-Tabarani reported it in *al-Awsat* with a good chain. Al-Nasa'i reported with a sound chain: "Whoever wears silk in this world will not wear it in the Hereafter, and whoever drinks wine in this world will not drink it in the Hereafter."

[227] Hadith: "The rivers of Paradise gush forth from beneath hills or beneath mountains of musk." Al-'Uqayli reported it in *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[228] Hadith: "If the adornment of the lowest of the people of Paradise were compared to the adornment of all the people of this world, what God adorns him with in the Hereafter would be better than the adornment of all the people of this world." Al-Tabarani reported it in *al-Awsat* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a good chain.

[229] Hadith: "In Paradise there is a tree in whose shade a rider travels for a hundred years without traversing it..." Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[230] Hadith of Abu Umamah: A Bedouin came and said, "O Messenger of God, God has mentioned in the Qur'an a harmful tree." He said, "What is it?" He said, "The lote-tree (al-Sidr)..." Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in *al-Zuhd* from Safwan ibn 'Amr from Sulaym ibn 'Amir as a *mursal* report, without mention of Abu Umamah.

[231] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever enters Paradise enjoys bliss and does not suffer misery; his garments do not wear out..." Muslim reported it without the phrase, "In Paradise is what no eye has seen..." The two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] agreed upon it from another hadith of Abu Hurayrah: God Almighty said, "I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen..."

[232] Hadith: A man said, "O Messenger of God, inform us about the garments of the people of Paradise. Are they created or woven?" ... Al-Nasa'i reported it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

[233] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The first group to enter Paradise will be in the likeness of the moon on the night of the full moon..." Agreed upon.

[234] Hadith concerning His saying, the Exalted, "They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold" [18:31]. He said, "Upon them are crowns; the smallest pearl therein illuminates what is between the east and the west." Al-Tirmidhi reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id without mentioning the verse, and said, "We do not know it except from the hadith of Rashid ibn Sa'd."

[235] Hadith: "The tent is a hollow pearl, its height in the sky is sixty miles..." The author attributed it to al-Bukhari, and it is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari.

[236] Hadith of Abu Sa'id concerning His saying, the Exalted, "And raised couches" [88:13]. He said, "The distance between two couches is like the distance between the heaven and the earth." Al-Tirmidhi reported it with the wording, "their height is like the distance between the heaven and the earth," and said it is *gharib*; we do not know it except from the hadith of Rashid ibn Sa'd.

[237] Hadith of Thawban: "A scholar from the scholars of the Jews came..." and he mentioned his question until he said, "So who are the first people to cross, meaning over the Bridge (al-Sirat)?" He said, "The poor emigrants." The Jew said, "Then what is their gift when..."

They will enter Paradise. Ziyadah said: "The hadith narrated by Muslim includes additions at its beginning and end."

[238] Hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam: A man from the Jews came and said, "O Abu al-Qasim, do you not claim that the people of Paradise will eat and drink therein?" ... In it is mentioned: "Their need is a sweat that flows from their skins like musk." Narrated by al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra with a sound chain.

[239] Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "You will indeed see a bird in Paradise and desire it, and it will fall before you roasted." Narrated by al-Bazzar with a sound chain. [In it is 'sa'f' (a type of drink).]

[240] Hadith of Hudhayfah: "In Paradise there are birds like al-Bukhati (camels)..." A rare narration from Hudhayfah. Ahmad has from the hadith of Anas with a sound chain: "The birds of Paradise are like al-Bukht (a type of camel), grazing in the trees of Paradise." Abu Bakr said, "O Messenger of Allah, these birds are delightful." He said, "Those who eat them are more delightful than them." He said this three times. "And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them." It is also with al-Tirmidhi from another source, mentioning the River Kawthar and stating: "Birds whose necks are like the necks of camels." 'Umar said, "These are indeed delightful..." It does not mention Abu Bakr. He (al-Tirmidhi) said it is *hasan*.

[241] Hadith: "A morning or an evening in the path of Allah is better than the world and all that is in it." Narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Anas.

[242] Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri regarding His saying, the Exalted: "As if they were rubies and coral." He said: "You look at her face in her veil, clearer than a mirror..." Narrated by Abu Ya'la from the narration of Abu al-Haytham from Abu Sa'id with a *hasan* chain. Ahmad also narrated it, containing Ibn Lahi'ah. Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in *al-Zuhd wa al-Raqa'iq* from the narration of Abu al-Haytham from the Prophet (ﷺ) as a *mursal* report without mentioning Abu Sa'id. Al-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "The woman from the women of the people of Paradise—the whiteness of the marrow of her shinbone is seen from behind seventy garments..." He also narrated it from him as a *mawquf* report and said, "This is more authentic." In the two *Sahihs* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "For every man among them are two wives; the marrow of their shins is seen from behind the flesh."

[243] Hadith of Anas: "When I was taken on the Night Journey, I entered a place in Paradise called al-Sarh, upon which were tents of pearl, green chrysolite, and red ruby..." In it, Jibril said, "These are the secluded ones in the tents," and they began to say, "We are the pleased ones, so we are not displeased." I did not find it complete like this. Al-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of 'Ali: "In Paradise is a gathering place for the *hur al-'in*; they raise voices the like of which creation has never heard, saying, 'We are the everlasting ones, so we do not perish; we are the blissful ones, so we do not grieve; we are the pleased ones, so we are not displeased. Blessed is he for whom we are, and we are for him.'" He said it is *gharib*. Abu al-Shaykh has in *Kitab al-'Azamah* a hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa with a weak chain: "They gather every seven days and say with voices..." [similar to the above].

[244] Hadith: A man said, "O Messenger of Allah, do the people of Paradise have intercourse?" He said, "A man among them is given, in a single day, strength better than that of seventy of you." Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it *sahih*, and by Ibn Hibban from the hadith of Anas: "The believer in Paradise is given the strength for such-and-such amount of intercourse." It was said, "Will he be able for that?" He said, "He is given the strength of a hundred."

[245] Hadith: "A man from the people of Paradise will marry five hundred *huris*, four thousand virgins, and eight thousand previously married women; he will embrace each one of them for the measure of his lifespan in the world." Narrated by Abu al-Shaykh in *Tabaqat al-Muhaddithin* and in *Kitab al-'Azamah* from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa, except that he said "one hundred *huris*" and did not mention his embracing them. Its chain is weak, and it was preceded earlier by a hadith.

[246] Hadith: "In Paradise there is a market in which there is no buying or selling, except images of men and women..." Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in two places from the hadith of 'Ali. Some of it was mentioned earlier, two hadiths before this.

[247] Hadith of Anas: "The *huris* in Paradise sing, saying, 'We are the beautiful *huris*, kept for noble husbands.'" Narrated by al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat*. In it is al-Hasan ibn Dawud ibn al-Munkadir. Al-Bukhari said, "They speak about him." Ibn 'Adi said, "I hope there is no harm in him."

[248] Hadith of Abu Umamah: "There is no servant who enters Paradise except that two from the *hur al-'in* sit at his head and at his feet, singing to him with the most beautiful sound heard by mankind and jinn, and it is not with the flute of Satan, but with the praise and glorification of Allah." Narrated by al-Tabarani with a *hasan* chain.

[249] The hadith of Usamah ibn Zayd: "Is there not one who strives for Paradise? For Paradise has no equal..." Reported by Ibn Majah and Ibn Hibban.

[250] The hadith: A man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "Are there horses in Paradise? For they amaze me..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Buraydah with a difference in wording, and in it is al-Mas'udi, who is disputed. Ibn al-Mubarak reported it in al-Zuhd with the wording of the author from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sabit, as a mursal report. Al-Tirmidhi said, "This is more sound." Abu Musa al-Madini mentioned 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sabit in the supplement to Ibn Mandah's work on the Companions, but his companionship is not established.

[251] The hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Verily, a man among the people of Paradise will have a child born to him as he desires, and its pregnancy, weaning, and growth will be in a single hour." Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan gharib. He said, "The scholars have differed concerning this. Some said there is intercourse in Paradise but no offspring." Ahmad has from the hadith of Abu Razin: "They will enjoy and touch like your enjoyments in this world, and they will take pleasure in you, except that there is no procreation."

[252] The hadith: "When the people of Paradise are settled, friends will long for friends, so the couch of this one will journey to the couch of that one." Reported by al-Bazzar from the narration of al-Rabi' ibn Sabih from al-Hasan from Anas, who said, "We do not know it to be narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) except by this chain; Anas alone narrated it." Al-Rabi' ibn Sabih is very weak. Al-Isfahani reported it in al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib as a mursal report without mentioning Anas.

[253] The hadith: "The people of Paradise are hairless, beardless, fair, with curly hair and kohl-lined eyes, like sons of thirty-three..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Mu'adh, and he graded it hasan, except for the phrases "fair, with curly hair" and "in the form of Adam..." to the end. He also reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah in a concise form: "The people of Paradise are hairless, beardless, with kohl-lined eyes," and said it is gharib. In the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "...in the form of their father Adam, sixty cubits tall."

[254] The hadith: "The lowest in station among the people of Paradise is he who has eighty thousand servants..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id, disconnected from its beginning to his saying, "...and upon them are crowns," and from here with its chain also. He said, "We do not know it except from the hadith of Rashd ibn Sa'd."

[255] The hadith: "I looked into Paradise and saw that a pomegranate from its pomegranates was like the hide of a laden camel, and its birds were like al-Bukht..." Reported by al-Tha'labi in his Tafsir from the narration of Abu Harun al-'Abdi from Abu Sa'id. Abu Harun's name is 'Imarah ibn Jurayth, who is very weak. In the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Allah says, 'I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human being.'"

[256] The hadith of Jarir: "We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) when he saw the moon on the night of the full moon and said, 'You will see your Lord...'" It is in the two Sahih collections as mentioned by the author.

[257] The hadith of Suhayb concerning His saying, Exalted is He: "For those who do good is the best reward and extra..." Reported by Muslim as mentioned by the author.

[258] The hadith: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) loved optimism." Agreed upon from the narration of Anas within a hadith: "...and I love good optimism and a good word." Both have from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "...and the better of them is the one with good optimism." He said, "The good word one of you hears."

[259] The hadith: "Verily, Allah, Exalted is He, has one hundred mercies. He sent down one mercy among the jinn and mankind..." Reported by Muslim from the narrations of Abu Hurayrah and Salman.

[260] The hadith: "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring out a book from beneath the Throne, in which is: 'My mercy has preceded My wrath...'" Agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "When Allah decreed the creation, He wrote with Him above the Throne: 'My mercy has preceded My wrath'"—the wording of al-Bukhari. Muslim said: "He wrote in His Book concerning Himself: 'My mercy overcomes My wrath.'"

[261] The hadith: "Allah will reveal Himself to us on the Day of Resurrection, smiling, and will say, 'Receive glad tidings, O community of Muslims, for there is not one of you except that I have placed in his stead in the Fire a Jew or a Christian.'" Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Musa: "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will give to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say, 'This is your ransom from the Fire.'" Abu Dawud has: "My nation is a nation shown mercy; there is no punishment for it in the Hereafter."

As for the beginning of the Hadith, Al-Tabarani narrated it from the narration of Abu Musa as well: "Our Lord, God, will reveal Himself to us on the Day of Resurrection, smiling, until they look upon His Countenance, and they will fall down in prostration to Him. Then He will say: 'Raise your heads; this is not a day for worship.'" In its chain is 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an.

[262] Hadith: "God will grant Adam intercession on the Day of Resurrection for one hundred thousand thousand and ten thousand thousand of his progeny." Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the narration of Anas with a weak chain.

[263] Hadith: "Indeed, God the Exalted will say on the Day of Resurrection to the believers: 'Did you love to meet Me?' They will say: 'Yes.'" The Hadith was transmitted by Ahmad and Al-Tabarani from the narration of Mu'adh with a weak chain.

[264] Hadith: "God, Mighty and Majestic, will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Bring out from the Fire whoever remembered Me for a day or feared Me in a standing.'" Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the narration of Anas and said it is Hasan Gharib.

[265] Hadith: "When the people of the Fire are gathered in the Fire, and among them, by God's will, are some from the people of the Qiblah, the disbelievers will say to the Muslims: 'Were you not Muslims?' They will say: 'Yes.' They will say: 'What did your Islam avail you, since you are with us in the Fire?'" The Hadith is concerning the extraction of the people of the Qiblah from the Fire. Then the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) recited: "Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims." Al-Nasa'i transmitted it in Al-Kubra from the narration of Jabir, something similar, with a sound chain.

[266] Hadith: "God is more merciful to His believing servant than a compassionate mother is to her child." Agreed upon from the narration of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab. At its beginning is the story of the woman from the captives who found an infant among the captives, took him, pressed him to her belly, and suckled him.

[267] Hadith: "A caller from beneath the Throne will call out on the Day of Resurrection: 'O community of Muhammad! As for what was due to Me from you, I have forgiven it for you. But the mutual claims remain, so forgive one another and enter Paradise by My mercy.'" We narrated it in the *Sab'iyyat* of Abu al-As'ad al-Qushayri from the narration of Anas. In its chain is al-Husayn ibn Dawud al-Balkhi. Al-Khatib said: "He is not trustworthy."

[268] Hadith of al-Sunabihi from 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: "Whoever testifies that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, God has forbidden him to the Fire." Muslim transmitted it from this avenue, and the two Shaykhs agreed upon it from other than the narration of al-Sunabihi with a different wording.

[269] Hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "Indeed, God will single out a man from my community before all creation on the Day of Resurrection, and ninety-nine scrolls will be unfurled for him..." Then he mentioned the Hadith of the Card (al-Bitaqah). Ibn Majah and Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and he said it is Hasan Gharib.

[270] Hadith: "Indeed, God will say to the angels: 'Whoever you find in his heart an atom's weight of good, bring him out from the Fire.' So they will bring out a great multitude." The Hadith is concerning the extraction of the monotheists, and His saying, Exalted is He: "Then I shall never be displeased with you thereafter forever." The two transmitted it in the *Sahihayn* as mentioned by the author from the narration of Abu Sa'id.

[271] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "The nations were presented to me. A prophet would pass by with one man, and a prophet with two men, and a prophet with no one with him..." The Hadith up to his saying: "'Ukkashah has preceded you with it." Al-Bukhari narrated it.

[272] Hadith of 'Amr ibn Hazm al-Ansari: "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was absent from us for three days; he would not go out except for the obligatory prayer, then he would return." In it: "Indeed, my Lord promised me that He would admit from my community into Paradise seventy thousand without any reckoning against them." And in it: "He gave me, with each one of the seventy thousand, seventy thousand." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in *Al-Ba'th wa al-Nushur*. And in the version of Ahmad and Abu Ya'la from the narration of Abu Bakr: "He increased me, with each one, seventy thousand." In its chain is an unnamed man. And in the version of Ahmad and Al-Tabarani in *Al-Awsat* from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr: "So 'Umar said: 'Why did you not ask for more?' He said: 'I did ask for more, and He gave me, with each man, seventy thousand.' 'Umar said: 'Why did you not ask for more?' He said: 'I did ask for more, and He gave me like this'—and 'Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr spread his hands before him." 'Abdullah said: "And he spread his forearms and scooped with them." In its chain is Musa ibn 'Ubaydah al-Randi, who is weak.

[273] Hadith of Abu Dharr: "Gabriel met me on the side of Al-Harrah and said: 'Give glad tidings to your community that whoever dies not associating anything with God will enter Paradise.'" Agreed upon with the wording: "Gabriel came to me and gave me glad tidings." And in a narration of the two: "A messenger from my Lord came to me."

[274] Hadith of Abu al-Darda': "The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) recited: 'But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.' So I said..."

And if he commits adultery or steals—a hadith narrated by Ahmad with a sound chain.

[275] A hadith: On the Day of Resurrection, a man from the people of other religions will be delivered to every believer, and it will be said to him, "This is your ransom from the Fire." Narrated by Muslim in a similar version from Abu Musa, as previously mentioned.

[276] A hadith from Abu Burdah: He reported to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz from his father Abu Musa from the Prophet (peace be upon him), who said, "No Muslim dies but that God places a Jew or a Christian in his stead in the Fire." The author attributed it to Muslim's narration, and so it is.

[277] A hadith: A boy was standing in one of the military expeditions, being offered for bidding on an extremely hot summer day. A woman caught sight of him—the hadith—and in it: "God is more merciful to all of you than this woman is to her son." Agreed upon in a concise form with variations. From the hadith of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab: He said, "Some captives were brought to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), and among them was a woman from the captives running about. When she found a boy among the captives, she took him, pressed him to her belly, and breastfed him. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to us, 'Do you think this woman would cast her child into the Fire?' We said, 'No, by God, she would not, while she is able not to cast him.' The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, 'God is more merciful to His servants than this woman is to her child.'" The wording is from Muslim. Al-Bukhari said: "And there was a woman from the captives whose breast was flowing with milk, running about when she found a boy"—the hadith.

And praise be to God Almighty, returning to the beginning, and prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad in every movement and stillness.
