The Book of Patience and Gratitude  
Which is the Second Book of the Quarter of Deliverances from The Revival of the Religious Sciences  

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  

Praise be to God, the Worthy of praise and commendation, the Unique in the mantle of majesty, the One in attributes of glory and exaltation, Who supports the chosen saints with the strength of patience in ease and hardship, and gratitude in trial and blessing. And blessings upon Muhammad, master of the prophets, and upon his companions, leaders of the pure, and upon his family, guides of the righteous and pious—a blessing preserved perpetually from extinction and safeguarded in succession from interruption and cessation.  

Now then: Faith is two halves: one half patience and one half gratitude, as transmitted in the traditions and attested by the reports. They are also two attributes from the attributes of God Most High and two names from His beautiful names, for He named Himself the Patient and the Thankful. Thus, ignorance of the reality of patience and gratitude is ignorance of both halves of faith, and it is heedlessness of two attributes of the Merciful. There is no way to attain nearness to God Most High except through faith, and how can traversing the path of faith be conceived without knowing that by which faith exists and He by whom faith exists? Neglecting the knowledge of patience and gratitude is neglecting the knowledge of He by whom faith exists and the realization of that by which faith exists. How great is the need for both halves to be clarified and explained! We shall clarify both halves in one book due to their interconnection, God willing.  

The first half concerns patience, and within it is an exposition of the virtue of patience, an explanation of its definition and reality, an explanation of it being half of faith, an explanation of the variation of its names according to its referents, an explanation of its categories based on differences in strength and weakness, an explanation of the occasions requiring patience, and an explanation of the remedy of patience and what aids in it. These are seven chapters encompassing all its purposes, God willing.  

(Exposition of the Virtue of Patience)  

God Most High has described the patient with attributes and mentioned patience in the Qur’an in over seventy places. He ascribed most degrees and blessings to patience and made them its fruit, saying, exalted is He: “And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient” (32:24). And He said: “And the best word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were patient” (7:137). And He said: “And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do” (16:96). And He said: “Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured” (28:54). And He said: “Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account” (39:10). Thus, there is no act of devotion except that its reward is by measure and reckoning—except patience. Due to fasting being from patience and that it is half of patience, God said: “Fasting is for Me, and I will reward it,” attributing it to Himself among all other acts of worship. And He promised the patient that He is with them, saying: “And be patient, indeed God is with the patient” (2:153). And He made victory contingent upon patience, saying: “Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of God and they come upon you suddenly, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks” (3:125). And He combined for the patient matters not combined for others, saying: “Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is they who are the guided” (2:157). Thus, guidance, mercy, and blessings are combined for the patient. Exhausting all verses regarding the station of patience would be lengthy.  

As for the reports, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Patience is half of faith,” as will come the explanation of it being half. And he said: “Among the least you have been given is certainty and resolve of patience. Whoever is given his share of these two, he will not care what he missed of night prayer and daytime fasting. And that you remain patient upon what you are upon is more beloved to me than that each of you meets me with the like of the deeds of all of you. But I fear that the world will open up to you after me, and then some of you will deny others, and the people of heaven will deny you. At that time, whoever is patient and expects reward will attain the perfection of his reward.” Then he recited the saying of God Most High: “Whatever you have will end, but what God has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward” (16:96).  

Jabir reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about faith, and he said: “Patience and magnanimity.” He also said: “Patience is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise.” And he was once asked, “What is faith?” He said: “Patience.” This resembles his saying: “The Hajj is ‘Arafah,” meaning the essence of Hajj is ‘Arafah. He also said: “The best of deeds are those that the souls are averse to.”  

It is said that God Most High revealed to David (peace be upon him): “Adorn yourself with My attributes, and among My attributes is that I am the Patient.” In a narration from ‘Ata’ from Ibn ‘Abbas, when the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) visited the Ansar, he said: “Are you believers?” They remained silent. ‘Umar said: “Yes, O Messenger of God.” He said: “What is the sign of your faith?” They said: “We are grateful in prosperity, patient in adversity, and content with decree.” He said: “Believers, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah.”

(Kaaba)[9] And He, exalted be He, said: "In patience over what you dislike is much good."[10] And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "You will not attain what you love except through your patience with what you dislike." And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If patience were a man, he would be noble, and God loves the patient."[11] The reports on this are innumerable.

As for the narrations, it is found in the letter of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: "Hold fast to patience, and know that patience is of two kinds, one better than the other: Patience in calamity is good, but better than it is patience in abstaining from what God, exalted be He, has forbidden. And know that patience is the mainstay of faith, for piety is the best of righteousness, and piety is attained through patience." And 'Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: "Faith is built upon four pillars: certainty, patience, striving, and justice." He also said: "Patience in relation to faith is like the head to the body. There is no body for one who has no head, and no faith for one who has no patience." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to say: "How excellent are the two just dues, and how excellent is the bonus for the patient," meaning by the two just dues: prayer and mercy, and by the bonus: guidance. The 'bonus' is what is carried atop the two just dues on a camel, alluding to the saying of God, exalted be He: "Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and it is they who are the [rightly] guided." {2:157} And Habib ibn Abi Habib, when he recited this verse: "Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back [to Allah]." {38:44} would weep and say: "How wondrous! He gave and He praised," meaning He is the Giver of patience and He is the Praiser. And Abu al-Darda' said: "The pinnacle of faith is patience with the decree and contentment with destiny." This is the exposition of the virtue of patience from the standpoint of transmitted texts.

As for from the standpoint of intellectual consideration, you will not understand it except after understanding the reality and meaning of patience, for knowing the virtue and rank is knowing an attribute, and it is not attained before knowing the described entity. Therefore, let us mention its reality and meaning, and with God is success.

(Exposition of the Reality and Meaning of Patience)

Know that patience is a station among the stations of religion and a stage among the stages of the wayfarers. All stations of religion are only organized from three matters: cognitions, states, and works. The cognitions are the foundations, and they beget the states, and the states yield the works. Thus, the cognitions are like trees, the states like branches, and the works like fruits. This pattern holds for all the stages of the wayfarers to God, exalted be He. The name 'faith' is sometimes specific to the cognitions and sometimes applied to the whole, as we mentioned regarding the difference between the names 'faith' and 'Islam' in the book "The Foundations of Beliefs." Likewise, patience is not complete except with a preceding cognition and an established state, for patience, in truth, is an expression of them, and the work is like the fruit that issues from them. This is not known except by knowing the manner of arrangement between the angels, humans, and beasts, for patience is a particular characteristic of humans and is not conceivable in beasts or angels. As for beasts, it is due to their deficiency. As for angels, it is due to their perfection. The explanation is that beasts are subjected to appetites and become subservient to them. They have no motivator for movement or stillness except appetite, and there is no power within them that opposes the appetite and restrains it from its demand, such that the steadfastness of that power in confronting the demand of the appetite could be called patience.

As for the angels, peace be upon them, they are purified for yearning towards the presence of Lordship and rejoicing in the degree of proximity to it. Appetite that diverts or hinders from it has not been given authority over them, such that they would need to combat what diverts them from the presence of Majesty with another force that overcomes the diverters. As for the human, he is created at the beginning of childhood deficient, like a beast. Nothing is created in him except the appetite for nourishment, which he needs. Then appears in him the appetite for play and adornment, then the appetite for marriage, in sequence. He has no power of patience whatsoever, for patience is an expression of the steadfastness of one force in opposition to another force, between which combat has arisen due to the contradiction of their demands and requirements. In the child, there is only the force of caprice, as in beasts. However, God, exalted be He, by His grace and vast generosity, honored the children of Adam and elevated their rank above the rank of beasts. He assigned to him, upon the completion of his personhood near puberty, two angels: one guides him, and the other strengthens him. Thus, he became distinguished, with the help of the two angels, from the beasts, and was endowed with two characteristics: One is the knowledge of God, exalted be He, knowledge of His Messenger, and knowledge of the benefits pertaining to ultimate outcomes—all of this attained from the angel to whom guidance and instruction belong. The beast has no knowledge and no guidance towards the benefit of ultimate outcomes, but only towards the demand of its appetites in the immediate moment. Therefore, it seeks only what is pleasurable. As for beneficial medicine, even if it is harmful in the immediate moment, it does not seek it nor know it. Thus, the human, by the light of guidance, knows that following appetites has disliked consequences in the ultimate outcome. But this guidance was not sufficient as long as there was not...

He possesses the capacity to abandon what is harmful, yet how many harmful things a person recognizes—such as an affliction befalling him, for example—but has no power to repel it? Thus he becomes in need of a power and strength by which to strike at the throat of desires, striving against them with that strength until he severs their enmity from himself. Therefore, God Almighty has assigned to him another angel who guides him, supports him, and strengthens him with troops you have not seen, and He has commanded this host to fight the host of desire. At times this host weakens, and at times that one strengthens, according to how God Almighty supplies His servant with divine support. Just as the light of guidance also varies among creation in a boundless diversity, let us name this quality by which man differs from beasts in suppressing and subduing desires the "religious impulse," and let us name the demands of desires according to their exigencies the "impulse of passion." Understand that a battle is ongoing between the religious impulse and the impulse of passion, and the war between them is back-and-forth; the battlefield of this combat is the heart of the servant. The reinforcements for the religious impulse come from the angels who aid the party of God Almighty, while the reinforcements for the impulse of desire come from the devils who aid the enemies of God Almighty. Patience, then, is the steadfastness of the religious impulse in confronting the impulse of desire. If it remains firm until it overcomes it and persists in opposing desire, then the servant has aided the party of God and joined the patient ones. But if he falters and weakens until desire overcomes him and he does not persevere in repelling it, he joins the followers of devils. For abandoning desired actions is a deed that yields a state called patience, which is the steadfastness of the religious impulse in opposition to the impulse of desire. And the steadfastness of the religious impulse is a state produced by knowledge of the enmity of desires and their opposition to the causes of happiness in this world and the next. When his certainty—meaning the knowledge called faith, which is conviction that desire is an enemy cutting off the path to God Almighty—strengthens, then the steadfastness of the religious impulse strengthens. And when its steadfastness strengthens, actions are completed contrary to what desire demands. Thus, abandoning desire is only achieved through the strength of the religious impulse opposing the impulse of desire, and through the strength of knowledge and faith that make the consequences of desires ugly and their end evil. These two angels are the ones entrusted with these two hosts by the permission and subjugation of God Almighty, and they are among the noble recorders—the two angels assigned to every human being. And when you know that the rank of the guiding angel is higher than that of the strengthening angel, it becomes clear to you that the right side is the nobler of the two sides of the ledger, which should be submitted to; thus he is the companion of the right, and the other is the companion of the left. The servant has two phases: heedlessness and reflection, indulgence and struggle. In heedlessness, he turns away from the companion of the right and wrongs him, so his offenses are recorded as evil deeds. In reflection, he turns to him to obtain guidance, thus doing good to him, so his turning is recorded as a good deed. Likewise, in indulgence, he turns away from the companion of the left, abandoning seeking aid from him, thus wronging him, and an evil deed is recorded against him. In struggle, he seeks aid from his troops, so a good deed is recorded for him. These good and evil deeds are recorded by their inscription, hence they are called noble recorders—"noble" because the servant benefits from their nobility and because all angels are noble and righteous, and "recorders" because they record the good and evil deeds. They write on scrolls folded within the secret of the heart and hidden from the secret of the heart, so that none may perceive them in this world, for they, their writing, their script, their attributes, and all that pertains to them belong to the realm of the unseen and the dominion, not to the visible world. Everything from the realm of dominion is not beheld by eyes in this world. Then these scrolls folded away from him are unfolded twice: once at the minor resurrection and once at the major resurrection. By the minor resurrection, I mean the state of death, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever dies, his resurrection has come." In this resurrection, the servant is alone, and then it is said: "You have come to Us alone, as We created you the first time," and it is said: "Sufficient is yourself this day as a reckoner against you." As for the major resurrection, which gathers all creation, he is not alone but may be called to account before an assembly of creatures, and therein the righteous are led to Paradise and the criminals to the Fire in groups, not individually. The first terror is the terror of the minor resurrection, and all the terrors of the major resurrection have a counterpart in the minor resurrection—such as the quaking of the earth, for example. Your own personal earth quakes in death, for you know that if a quake befalls a town, it is truthfully said that their earth has quaked, even if the surrounding lands have not quaked. Indeed, if only a person's dwelling quakes, the quaking has occurred in his regard, because he is only harmed by the quaking of his own dwelling, not by the quaking of another's dwelling. Thus is his portion.

From the quaking, it has been fully realized without diminishment. Know that you are the most content creature formed from dust, and your exclusive portion from the dust is solely your body. As for the body of another, it is not your portion. The earth upon which you sit is, in relation to that, merely a setting and a place. You only fear its quaking because your body might quake on account of it; otherwise, the air is perpetually quivering, yet you do not dread it, since your body does not quake from it. Thus, your portion from the quaking of the entire earth is only the quaking of your body. It is your earth and your private dust. Your bones are the mountains of your earth, your head is the sky of your earth, your heart is the sun of your earth, your hearing and sight and all your faculties are the stars of your sky, the sweat flowing from your body is the sea of your earth, your hair is the vegetation of your earth, your limbs are the trees of your earth, and so on for all your parts. So when the pillars of your body collapse in death, then the earth has quaked its quaking. When the bones separate from the flesh, then the earth and the mountains are borne and crushed with a single crushing. When the bones are scattered, then the mountains are blown away as dust. When your heart darkens at death, then the sun is coiled up. When your hearing, sight, and all your senses cease, then the stars are dimmed. When your brain splits, then the sky is rent asunder. When sweat bursts from your brow from the terror of death, then the seas are made to gush forth. When one of your legs twists around the other—and they are your mounts—then the pregnant camels are neglected. When the spirit departs the body, then the earth is borne and stretched forth until it casts out what is within it and empties itself. I will not prolong with all the balancing of states and terrors, but I say: by mere death, this lesser resurrection rises upon you, and nothing of the greater resurrection that pertains to you escapes you—only what pertains to others. For the persistence of the celestial bodies in relation to others—what benefits you when your senses, by which you benefit from gazing at them, have been scattered? The blind man finds night and day, the eclipse of the sun and its clearing, equal, for it has been eclipsed for him all at once—that is his portion from it. The clearing after that is the portion of another. And for whom his head is split, his sky is rent, for the sky is an expression for what lies in the direction of the head. So he who has no head has no sky; whence then does the persistence of the sky for another benefit him? This is the lesser resurrection, and fear is below and terror is behind. That is when the great catastrophe comes, particularity is lifted, the heavens and the earth are nullified, the mountains are blown away, and terrors grow. Know that this lesser one, though we have elaborated in describing it, we have not mentioned a tenth of its descriptions. And it, in relation to the greater resurrection, is like the minor birth in relation to the major birth. For man has two births: one is the emergence from the loins and ribs into the repository of wombs. He is in the womb in a secure lodging for a known term, and in his journey to completion he has stages and phases—from a drop, to a clinging clot, to a chewed lump, and others—until he emerges from the narrowness of the womb into the expanse of the world. The proportion of the universality of the greater resurrection to the particularity of the lesser resurrection is like the proportion of the vastness of the world's expanse to the vastness of the womb's expanse. And the proportion of the vastness of the world which the servant advances upon at death to the vastness of the worldly expanse is also like the proportion of the worldly expanse to the womb—indeed, wider and greater. So judge the Hereafter by the first. Your creation and your resurrection are but as a single soul. The second genesis is only according to the measure of the first genesis. Nay, the number of geneses is not confined to two, and to this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "And We shall bring you forth in a fashion you do not know." So he who affirms the two resurrections is a believer in the unseen and the seen, and convinced of the dominion and the sovereignty. He who affirms the lesser resurrection but not the greater is looking with a defective eye at one of the two worlds, and that is ignorance and misguidance, and following the one-eyed deceiver. How great is your heedlessness, O wretched one—and all of us are that wretched one—while these terrors are before you. If you, out of ignorance and misguidance, do not believe in the greater resurrection, does not the indication of the lesser resurrection suffice you? Or have you not heard the saying of the master of the prophets: "Sufficient is death as an admonisher"? Or have you not heard how he, peace be upon him, would turn pale at death until he said: "O Allah, make the pangs of death easy for Muhammad"? Or are you not ashamed of your slowness in anticipating death's assault, following the heedless rabble who look not except for a single blast that seizes them while they are disputing, so they can make no bequest, nor to their people do they return? Then illness comes to them as a warner from death, yet they take no warning; and grey hair comes to them as a messenger from it, yet they reflect not. So, alas for the servants! There comes not to them a messenger but they mock him. Do they think they will be immortal in this world? Or have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? They will not return to them. Or do they reckon that the dead have journeyed away from them, so they are deprived? Nay! Verily, all are gathered.

We have them present, yet whenever a sign from their Lord's signs comes to them, they turn away from it. This is because We have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and We have covered them, so they do not see. It is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them—they will not believe. Let us return to the purpose, for these are allusions pointing to matters higher than the sciences of transaction. We say: It has become clear that patience is an expression for the steadfastness of the motive of religion in resisting the motive of base desire. This resistance is a particular characteristic of human beings, due to the Noble Recorders assigned to them, for they do not record anything concerning children or the insane, as we have mentioned that the good deed lies in turning towards benefiting from them, and the sin lies in turning away from them. Children and the insane have no means to benefit, so turning towards or away is not conceivable from them, and they only record the turning towards and turning away from those capable of it. By my life, indeed the beginnings of the illumination of the light of guidance may appear at the age of discernment and grow gradually until the age of maturity, just as the light of dawn appears until the sun's disc rises. But this is a limited guidance that does not lead to the harms of the Hereafter, only to the harms of this world. Therefore, one is struck immediately for neglecting prayers, but is not punished for neglecting them in the Hereafter, nor is anything written on his scrolls to be unfolded in the Hereafter. Rather, it is upon the just guardian and the compassionate, righteous protector—if he is among the righteous and follows the conduct of the Noble, Righteous, Good Recorders—to write the child's good and evil deeds upon the scroll of his heart. He writes it upon him through preservation, then unfolds it upon him through recognition, then punishes him for it with a strike. Every guardian who follows this conduct regarding the child has indeed inherited the character of the angels and employed it regarding the child, thereby attaining a degree of nearness to the Lord of the Worlds, just as the angels attained it. Thus, he will be with the Prophets, those brought near, and the truthful. To this, the allusion is in His saying, peace be upon him: "I and the guardian of the orphan will be like these two in Paradise," and he pointed to his two noble fingers, peace be upon him.

(Explanation that Patience is Half of Faith)
Know that faith is sometimes specifically used to denote affirmation of the fundamentals of religion, sometimes specifically for righteous actions emanating from it, and sometimes it denotes both together. There are chapters for knowledge and chapters for actions. Since the term 'faith' encompasses all of them, faith comprises more than seventy chapters. We have mentioned the differences in these usages in the book 'The Foundations of Beliefs' from the quarter of worship. However, patience is half of faith based on two considerations and according to two usages. The first is that it denotes both affirmations and actions together, so faith has two pillars: one is certainty, and the other is patience. What is meant by certainty is the definitive knowledge attained by God Almighty guiding His servant to the fundamentals of religion. What is meant by patience is acting according to the requirement of certainty, for certainty informs him that disobedience is harmful and obedience is beneficial, and it is impossible to abandon disobedience and persist in obedience except through patience, which is employing the motive of religion to overcome the motive of base desire and laziness. Thus, patience is half of faith by this consideration. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, combined them, saying: "Among the least you have been given is certainty and the resolve of patience," and the rest of the hadith. The second consideration is that it denotes the states that yield actions, not the knowledge. At that point, all that the servant encounters is divided into what benefits him in this world and the Hereafter or harms him in both. In relation to what harms him, the state is patience; in relation to what benefits him, the state is gratitude. Thus, gratitude becomes one of the two halves of faith by this consideration, just as certainty is one of the two halves by the first consideration. With this perspective, Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "Faith is two halves: half patience and half gratitude." It has also been attributed to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. Since patience is patience from the motive of base desire through the steadfastness of the motive of religion, and the motive of base desire is of two kinds: a motive from the side of lust, and a motive from the side of anger—lust being for seeking pleasure and anger for fleeing from pain—and since fasting is patience from the requirement of lust only, which is the lust of the stomach and private parts, not from the requirement of anger, it is said by this consideration: "Fasting is half of patience." Because the perfection of patience lies in patience from the incitements of lust and the incitements of anger together, thus fasting by this consideration becomes a quarter of faith. This is how one should understand the estimations of the Sacred Law regarding the limits of actions and states and their relation to faith. The foundation of this is to know the numerous chapters of faith, for the name 'faith' is used in different ways.

(Explanation of the Names that are Renewed for Patience in Relation to What One is Patient About)
Know that patience is of two kinds: One is a physical kind, such as enduring hardships with the body and remaining steadfast upon them.

It is either through action, such as undertaking arduous works—be they acts of worship or otherwise—or through endurance, such as patience under severe beating, grave illness, and grievous wounds. This may be praiseworthy if it conforms to the Sacred Law, but the complete and praiseworthy form is the other kind, which is the patience of the soul in abstaining from the desires of natural disposition and the demands of caprice. This latter kind, if it is patience against the appetites of the belly and the private parts, is called chastity. If it is in enduring something disliked, its names among people differ according to the disliked thing over which patience prevails. If it is in a calamity, it is confined to the name 'patience,' and its opposite state is called agitation and panic, which is to let the caller of caprice run loose in raising the voice, striking the cheeks, tearing the collars, and the like. If it is in enduring wealth, it is called self-restraint, and its opposite state is called insolence. If it is in war and combat, it is called courage, and its opposite is cowardice. If it is in suppressing rage and anger, it is called forbearance, and its opposite is complaint. If it is in a vexing tribulation of time, it is called breadth of the chest, and its opposite is weariness, annoyance, and narrowness of the chest. If it is in concealing speech, it is called keeping a secret, and its possessor is called secretive. If it is abstaining from the superfluities of life, it is called asceticism, and its opposite is greed. If it is patience with a meager portion of shares, it is called contentment, and its opposite is voracity. Thus, most of the traits of faith are encompassed within patience. For this reason, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was once asked about faith, he said, "It is patience," because its acts are many and most noble, as he said, "Perform the pilgrimage to 'Arafah." God, exalted is He, has gathered all these divisions and named the whole 'patience,' saying, exalted is He: "And those who are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous." Therefore, these are the divisions of patience according to their different objects. He who derives meanings from names may think these states differ in their essences and realities because he sees the names as different. But he who follows the straight path and looks with the light of God, exalted is He, observes the meanings first, thus discerning their realities, then observes the names, for they were coined to indicate meanings. Thus, the meanings are the foundations and the words are the subsidiaries. He who seeks the foundations from the subsidiaries is bound to slip. To these two groups is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Then is he who walks fallen on his face better guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path?" For the disbelievers only erred in what they erred in due to such inversions. We ask God for good success through His generosity and gentleness.

(Explanation of the divisions of patience according to the difference of strength and weakness)
Know that the motivator of religion, in relation to the motivator of caprice, has three states. The first is that it overpowers the caller of caprice, leaving it no strength to contend, and this is reached through constant patience. At this point, it is said, "Whoever is patient, prevails." Those who attain this rank are the fewest; no wonder they are the truthful ones brought near, who said, "Our Lord is God," and then remained steadfast. These have adhered to the straight path and stood firm on the upright way, and their souls have found tranquility in accordance with the demand of the motivator of religion. It is to them the caller calls: "O reassured soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him]." The second state is that the callers of caprice prevail and the contention of the motivator of religion drops completely, so he surrenders himself to the troops of satans and does not struggle due to his despair of struggling. These are the heedless, and they are the majority. They are those whose desires have enslaved them and whose wretchedness has overcome them, so they have given God's enemies authority over their hearts, which are a secret among God's secrets and a matter among God's matters. To them is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come true: 'I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together.'" These are they who have purchased the worldly life at the expense of the Hereafter, so their transaction has incurred loss. To one who intends to guide them, it is said: "So turn away from he who turns away from Our remembrance and desires not except the worldly life. That is their sum of knowledge." The sign of this state is despair, hopelessness, and delusion by wishes, which is the height of foolishness, as it is said: "The intelligent one is he who holds his soul to account and works for what is after death, and the fool is he who follows his soul its caprice and places hopes in God." The possessor of this state, when admonished, says: "I long for repentance, but it has become impossible for me, so I have no hope in it," or he does not long for repentance but says: "God is Forgiving, Merciful, Generous, so He has no need of my repentance." This wretched one has made his intellect subservient to his desire, so he uses his intellect only to deduce subtle stratagems by which he may attain the fulfillment of his desire. Thus, his intellect has become in the hands of his desires like a Muslim captive in the hands of disbelievers, who employ him for

Tending to swine, safeguarding and transporting wine, and the one who does so occupies with God Almighty the same position as one who subdues a Muslim and delivers him to the disbelievers, making him a captive among them. For by his grievous transgression, he resembles one who has subjugated what by right should not be subjugated and empowered what by right should not be empowered over it. The Muslim is deserving of being the one in authority due to what he possesses of the knowledge of God and the impetus of religion. The disbeliever is deserving of being subjected to authority due to what he possesses of ignorance of religion and the incitement of devils. The right of the Muslim over his own self is more obligatory than the right of others over him. Therefore, whenever the noble faculty, which is from the party of God and the host of angels, is subjugated to the base faculty, which is from the party of devils distanced from God Almighty, it is as if one has enslaved a Muslim for a disbeliever. Nay, it is as if one sought out the king who had bestowed favor upon him, then took his most precious child and delivered him to his most hated enemy. Consider, then, how such an act constitutes ingratitude for His favor and warrants His chastisement. For passion is the most detested deity worshipped on earth in the sight of God Almighty, and intellect is the most honored being created on the face of the earth.

The third state is when the war is seesawing between the two hosts, so at times he has the upper hand over it, and at times it has the upper hand over him. Among the strugglers, his like is counted, not among the triumphant. The people of this state are those who have mixed a righteous deed with another evil one; perhaps God will turn to them in forgiveness. This is with consideration of strength and weakness. Three states also pertain to it with consideration of the number of desires one abstains from. For either he overcomes all desires, or he overcomes none of them, or he overcomes some but not others. Applying the word of God Almighty, "They have mixed a righteous deed with another evil one," to one who is incapable of overcoming some desires but not others is more fitting. Those who abandon struggle against desires entirely are likened to cattle; rather, they are more astray in path, for the beast was not created with the knowledge and capability by which to struggle against the demands of desires, whereas this one was created with that and left it idle. He is truly deficient, assuredly ruined. Thus it has been said:
         "And I have not seen among the faults of people a fault like the deficiency of those capable of perfection."

Patience is also divided, with consideration of ease and difficulty, into that which is hard upon the soul, so that constancy in it is not possible except with immense effort and severe toil—this is called 'forcing patience'—and into that which occurs without severe toil, but is attained with the slightest exertion upon the soul, and this is specifically named 'patience'. When God-consciousness becomes constant and conviction in the ultimate good outcome is strengthened, patience is made easy. Therefore, God Almighty said, "As for he who gives and fears God and believes in the best [reward], We will ease him toward ease." An example of this division is the ability of a wrestler against another. The strong man is able to throw the weak one with the slightest charge and easiest effort, such that he meets no weariness or fatigue in wrestling him, nor is his soul disturbed, nor is he bewildered. But he is not able to throw the powerful one except with toil, increased effort, and sweat upon the brow. Thus is the wrestling between the impetus of religion and the impetus of passion, for in truth it is a wrestling between the hosts of angels and the hosts of devils. Whenever desires submit and are subdued, and the impetus of religion gains mastery and prevails, and patience is eased through prolonged perseverance, that bequeaths the station of contentment, as will come in the Book of Contentment. Thus contentment is higher than patience. Therefore, He (peace be upon him) said, "Worship God in a state of contentment. If you are not able, then in patience over what you dislike there is much good." And one of the knowers said: The people of patience are upon three stations: The first is abandoning desire—this is the degree of the repentant. The second is contentment with what is decreed—this is the degree of the ascetics. The third is love for what one's Master does with him—this is the degree of the truthful. We will clarify in the Book of Love that the station of love is higher than contentment, just as the station of contentment is higher than the station of patience. This division pertains specifically to patience over calamities and tribulations.

Know that patience is also divided, with consideration of its ruling, into obligatory, supererogatory, disliked, and forbidden. Patience in abstaining from prohibitions is obligatory. Patience over disliked matters is supererogatory. Patience in enduring a forbidden harm is forbidden, such as one whose hand or the hand of his child is cut off and he remains patient and silent about it, or one who intends one's protected kin with a forbidden desire, provoking his protective jealousy, yet he patiently refrains from showing his jealousy and remains silent about what befalls his family—this patience is forbidden. The disliked patience is patience in enduring a harm that befalls him through a means disliked in the Sacred Law. Therefore, let the Sacred Law be the criterion for patience. That patience is half of faith should not delude you into thinking all of it is praiseworthy; rather, what is meant by it are specific types of patience.

(Clarification of the situations requiring patience and that the servant cannot do without it in any state)
Know that all that befalls the servant in this life does not escape two types: one is that which conforms to his passion, and the other is that which does not conform to it but is disliked by him. He is in need of patience in each one.

From these two, man in all circumstances is not free from one of these two types or from both. Therefore, he can never do without patience. The first type is that which conforms to desire: namely, health, safety, wealth, status, numerous kin, ample means, many followers and supporters, and all worldly pleasures. How greatly the servant needs patience concerning these matters! For if he does not restrain himself from indulging, relying upon them, and immersing himself in their permissible pleasures, this will lead him to arrogance and transgression. Indeed, man becomes transgressing when he sees himself self-sufficient. Thus, some of the knowers of God have said: "Affliction is borne patiently by the believer, but well-being is not borne patiently except by the sincere." Sahl said: "Patience in well-being is more difficult than patience in affliction." When the doors of the world were opened upon the Companions, may God be pleased with them, they said: "We were tested with the trial of hardship and we were patient, then we were tested with the trial of ease and we were not patient." Therefore, God warned His servants of the trial of wealth, spouse, and children, saying, Exalted is He: "O you who have believed, let not your wealth and your children divert you from the remembrance of God." And He, Mighty and Majestic, said: "Indeed, among your spouses and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A child is a cause of miserliness, cowardice, and grief." And when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, saw his son al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, stumbling in his shirt, he descended from the pulpit, embraced him, and said: "God has spoken the truth: 'Your wealth and your children are but a trial.' Verily, when I saw my son stumbling, I could not restrain myself from taking him." In this is a lesson for those of insight. The true man is he who is patient in well-being. The meaning of patience in it is not to rely upon it, knowing that all of it is a trust deposited with him, and it is likely to be reclaimed soon; and not to let himself go in rejoicing over it, nor to immerse himself in enjoyment, pleasure, amusement, and play; and to observe the rights of God in his wealth by spending, in his body by offering help to creation, in his tongue by offering truthfulness, and likewise in all that God has bestowed upon him. This patience is connected to gratitude; it is not complete except by fulfilling the right of gratitude, as will come. Patience in ease is more severe because it is coupled with ability, and part of preservation is not to have power. Patience on being cupped and bled when someone else performs it is easier than patience on bleeding and cupping yourself. The hungry person in the absence of food is more capable of patience than when delicious, appetizing foods are present before him and he has power over them. For this reason, the trial of ease is great.

The second type is that which does not conform to desire and natural disposition. This is not free from either being connected to the servant's choice, like acts of obedience and disobedience, or not being connected to choice, like calamities and adversities, or not being connected to his choice but he has a choice in removing it, like seeking redress from a wrongdoer by taking revenge on him. These are three categories. The first category is what is connected to his choice, which are all his actions described as being obedience or disobedience, and these are two kinds. The first kind: obedience, and the servant needs patience in it. Patience in obedience is difficult because the soul by its nature recoils from servitude and desires lordship. Therefore, some of the knowers said: "There is no soul except that it conceals what Pharaoh manifested from his saying: 'I am your lord, most high.' But Pharaoh found for it an opportunity and acceptance, so he manifested it when he deemed his people weak and they obeyed him. There is no one except that he calls to that with his slave, servant, followers, and everyone under his coercion and obedience, even if he refrains from manifesting it. For his rage and fury when they fall short in his service and enslavement of them issues only from the concealment of arrogance and contesting lordship in the garment of pride." Therefore, servitude is burdensome to the soul absolutely. Then among acts of worship are those disliked due to laziness, like prayer; those disliked due to stinginess, like zakah; and those disliked due to both, like pilgrimage and jihad. Thus, patience in obedience is patience in hardships. The obedient one needs patience in his obedience in three states: The first is before the obedience, which is in correcting the intention, sincerity, and patience from the blemishes of ostentation and the incitements of corruptions, and resolving upon sincerity and fulfillment. This is among the severe patience for one who knows the reality of intention, sincerity, the corruptions of ostentation, and the stratagems of the soul. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, alerted to this when he said: "Actions are but by intentions, and every man shall have only what he intended." And God, Exalted is He, said: "And they were not commanded except to worship God, sincere to Him in religion." For this reason, God, Exalted is He, gave precedence to patience over action, saying: "Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds." The second state is the state of action, so that he is not heedless of God during his action nor lazy in realizing its manners and practices.

And he persists in observing the condition of proper conduct until the final completion of the work, thus adhering to patience against the incitements of lassitude until finishing. This too is among the severe trials of patience, and perhaps it is what is intended by the saying of the Exalted: "Excellent is the reward of the workers, those who are patient" — meaning they are patient until the work is complete. The third state is after finishing the work, for one then needs patience against disclosing it and displaying it for reputation and ostentation, and patience against viewing it with the eye of self-admiration, and against all that would nullify his deed and invalidate its effect, as the Exalted has said: "And do not invalidate your deeds," and as the Exalted has said: "Do not invalidate your charities with reminders of generosity and injury." So whoever is not patient after charity against reminders and injury has indeed nullified his deed. Acts of obedience are divided into obligatory and supererogatory, and one needs patience for both of them. God the Exalted has combined them in His saying: "Indeed, God commands justice, excellence, and giving to relatives." So justice is the obligatory, excellence is the supererogatory, and giving to relatives is chivalry and maintaining kinship ties, all of which require patience. The second category is sins; how greatly the servant needs patience against them! God the Exalted has gathered the types of sins in His saying: "And He forbids indecency, wrong, and oppression," and He said, peace be upon him: "The emigrant is he who abandons evil, and the striver is he who strives against his desire." Sins are the demand of the prompting of desire. The most severe type of patience is patience against sins that have become familiar through habit, for habit is a second nature. When habit is added to appetite, two soldiers from the soldiers of Satan ally against the soldiers of God the Exalted, and the motive of religion is not strong enough to suppress them. Then, if that action is something easy to do, patience against it is heavier upon the soul, such as patience against sins of the tongue like backbiting, lying, argumentation, and praising oneself either indirectly or explicitly, and the types of jesting that hurt hearts, and the kinds of words intended for disparagement and contempt, and mentioning the dead and criticizing them, their knowledge, their conduct, and their positions. For that is outwardly backbiting and inwardly self-praise. The soul has in it two appetites: one is negating others, and the other is affirming itself, and through them is completed for it the lordship that is in its nature, which is contrary to what it has been commanded regarding servitude. Due to the combination of the two appetites, the ease of moving the tongue, and that becoming habitual in conversations, patience against it becomes difficult, and it is among the greatest destructive sins, to the point that its reprehensibility and ugliness are nullified in hearts due to its frequent repetition and widespread familiarity with it. Thus you see a person, for example, wearing silk and finding it extremely objectionable, yet he lets his tongue loose all day long concerning people's honor and does not find that objectionable, despite what has come in the report: "Indeed, backbiting is more severe than fornication." And whoever cannot control his tongue in conversations and is incapable of patience against that, then seclusion and solitude are obligatory for him; nothing else will save him. So patience in solitude is easier than patience in silence while mixing with others. The severity of patience varies among individual sins according to the strength or weakness of the motive for that sin. The easiest of the tongue's movements is the movement of thoughts with varying whisperings. Thus, inevitably, the inner discourse remains in solitude, and it is impossible to have patience against it at all except by overwhelming the heart with another concern in religion that consumes it, like one who wakes with his concerns being a single concern. Otherwise, if he does not employ his thought in something specific, he cannot imagine a cessation of the whispering from it. The second category: that whose assault is not connected to his choice, but he has a choice in repelling it, as when he is harmed by an action or word, and wrong is done to him concerning his person or his wealth. Patience in that, by abandoning retaliation, is sometimes obligatory and sometimes a virtue. Some of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, said: "We did not consider a man's faith to be faith if he did not have patience against harm." And the Exalted said: "And we will surely be patient over whatever harm you cause us, and upon God let the reliant rely." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, once distributed some wealth, and a Bedouin among the Muslims said, "This is a distribution not intended for the sake of God." The Messenger of God was informed, and his cheeks reddened, then he said: "May God have mercy on my brother Moses; he was harmed more than this and was patient." And the Exalted said: "And leave their harm and rely upon God." And the Exalted said: "And be patient over what they say and leave them with gracious avoidance." And the Exalted said: "And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say. So exalt [God] with praise of your Lord." And the Exalted said: "And you will surely hear much abuse from those who were given the Scripture before you and from the polytheists. But if you are patient and fear God – indeed, that is of the matters of resolve" — meaning you are patient against retaliation. For that reason, God the Exalted praised those who pardon their rights in retribution and otherwise, saying: "And if you punish..."

So repay with the like of what you were afflicted with, but if you are patient, it is indeed better for the patient ones. And it is said: "Reconcile with the one who cuts you off, give to the one who deprives you, and pardon the one who wrongs you." I saw in the Gospel that Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, said: "It was said to you of old: 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you: Do not resist evil. Rather, whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And whoever takes your cloak, give him your tunic as well. And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two." All of this is a command to be patient with harm, for patience with the harm of people is among the highest ranks of patience, because in it the motive of religion and the motive of desire and anger all cooperate.

The third category is that which does not fall under the scope of choice, neither at its beginning nor its end, such as calamities: the death of loved ones, the loss of wealth, the removal of health through illness, blindness of the eye, corruption of the limbs, and in summary, all types of affliction. Patience upon that is among the highest stations of patience. Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Patience in the Quran is of three kinds: Patience in performing the obligations of God Almighty, for which there are three hundred degrees; patience in abstaining from the prohibitions of God Almighty, for which there are six hundred degrees; and patience upon a calamity at the moment of the first shock, for which there are nine hundred degrees." This rank is superior, even though it is from the virtues, to what preceded it, which is from the obligations, because every believer is capable of patience in abstaining from prohibitions. As for patience upon the affliction of God Almighty, none can bear it except the Prophets, for it is the merchandise of the truthful ones, for that is severe upon the soul. Therefore, it is said: "I ask You for such certainty that the calamities of this world are made light for me through it." This is patience whose foundation is sound certainty.

Abu Sulayman said: "By God, we are not patient with what we love, so how can we be patient with what we dislike?" And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "God Almighty said: 'When I direct a calamity to one of My servants concerning his body, his wealth, or his child, and he meets it with beautiful patience, I will be ashamed on the Day of Resurrection to set up a scale for him or to open a record for him.'" And he said: "Awaiting relief with patience is an act of worship." And he said: "There is no believing servant afflicted by a calamity who says, as God Almighty has commanded: 'Indeed we belong to God, and indeed to Him we return. O God, reward me for my calamity and give me better than it,' except that God will do that for him."

And Anas reported to me that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God Almighty said: 'O Gabriel, what is the reward for one whose two precious ones I have taken?' He said: 'Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.' God Almighty said: 'His reward is abiding in My abode and gazing upon My Countenance.'"

And he said: "God Almighty says: 'When I test My servant with an affliction and he is patient and does not complain of Me to his visitors, I replace his flesh with flesh better than his flesh and his blood with blood better than his blood. And when I heal him, I heal him with no sin upon him. And if I cause him to die, then he is to My mercy.'"

And David, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, what is the reward of the sorrowful one who is patient with calamities seeking Your pleasure?" He said: "His reward is that I clothe him in the garment of faith and never remove it from him."

And Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, may God have mercy on him, said in his sermon: "God has not bestowed a blessing upon a servant, then taken it from him and compensated him with patience for it, except that what He compensated him with was better than what He took from him." And he recited: "Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account."

And Fudayl was asked about patience. He said: "It is contentment with the decree of God." It was said: "How is that?" He said: "The contented one does not wish for a station above his own."

And it is said that al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, was confined in the hospital. A group entered upon him. He said: "Who are you?" They said: "Your lovers, we have come to visit you." He began to throw stones at them, and they fled. He said: "If you were my lovers, you would have been patient with my affliction."

And one of the knowers had a note in his pocket. He would take it out every hour and look at it. On it was written: "And be patient for the decree of your Lord, for indeed, you are in Our eyes."

And it is said that a woman from the family of al-Fath al-Mawsili stumbled and her fingernail was torn off. She laughed. It was said to her: "Do you not feel the pain?" She said: "The delight of its reward has removed from my heart the bitterness of its pain."

And David said to Solomon, peace be upon them both: "The piety of the believer is known by three things: good reliance upon God for what has not been attained, good contentment with what has been attained, and good patience for what has passed."

And our Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "From honoring God and knowing His right is that you do not complain of your pain nor mention your calamity."

And it is narrated from one of the righteous that he went out one day with a purse in his sleeve, then missed it, finding it had been taken from his sleeve. He said: "May God bless him in it; perhaps he is in greater need of it than I."

And it is narrated from one of them that he said: "I passed by Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah, among the slain, and he had a last breath. I said to him: 'Shall I give you water to drink?' He said: 'Drag me a little toward the enemy and put the water in the shield, for I am fasting. If I live until night, I will drink it.' Thus was the patience of those who tread the path of the Hereafter upon the affliction of God Almighty."

If you ask: "How does one attain the rank of patience in afflictions when the matter is not within one's choice, for one is compelled, willing or unwilling? If what is intended is that there be no dislike of the affliction in one's soul, that is not within one's choice." Then know that one only departs from the station of the patient through despair, tearing collars, striking cheeks, excessive complaint, displaying gloom, and altering one's customary dress, furnishings, and food. These matters are within one's choice, so one must avoid them all, show contentment with the decree of God Almighty, remain steadfast in one's usual practice, and believe that it was a trust that has been reclaimed. As narrated from al-Rumaysa', the mother of Sulaym, may God have mercy on her, who said: "A son of mine died while my husband Abu Talha was absent. I arose, shrouded him, and placed him in a corner of the house. Abu Talha arrived, so I arose and prepared his breakfast. He began to eat and said, 'How is the boy?' I said, 'In the best state, praise be to God.' For indeed, since he fell ill, he has not been quieter than this night.' Then I adorned myself for him in the best manner I used to adorn myself before that, until he fulfilled his need from me. Then I said, 'Are you not amazed by our neighbors?' He said, 'What about them?' I said, 'They lent something on loan, and when it was requested back and reclaimed, they despaired.' He said, 'How evil is what they did!' I said, 'This son of yours was a trust from God Almighty, and God has taken him back.' So he praised God and said, 'To God we belong and to Him we return.' Then he went in the morning to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and informed him. He said, 'O God, bless them in their night.'" The narrator said: "I later saw for them in the mosque seven, all of whom had recited the Qur'an." And Jabir narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "I saw myself entering Paradise, and there I was with al-Rumaysa', the wife of Abu Talha." And it has been said: "Beautiful patience is that the one afflicted is not distinguished from others, nor does heartfelt grief or the overflowing of tears remove him from the bounds of the patient," since that occurs equally among all present due to death, and because weeping is heartfelt grief for the deceased, for that is a requirement of human nature and does not leave a person until death. Thus, when Ibrahim, the son of the Prophet, peace be upon him, died, his eyes overflowed, and it was said to him: "Did you not forbid us from this?" He said: "This is mercy, and God only shows mercy to the merciful among His servants." Rather, that also does not remove one from the station of contentment. For one who undergoes cupping or bloodletting is content with it, yet is inevitably pained by it, and his eyes may overflow if his pain is severe. This will come, God willing, in the Book of Contentment. And Ibn Abi Najih wrote, consoling one of the caliphs: "The most deserving to recognize the right of God Almighty in what He has taken is one who recognizes the greatness of God's right upon him in what He has left for him. And know that what has passed before you is what remains for you, and what remains after you is what is rewarded for you." And know that the reward of the patient for what befalls them is greater than the blessing upon them for what they are spared from. Therefore, whenever one repels dislike by reflecting on God Almighty's favor upon him through reward, he attains the rank of the patient. Indeed, part of the perfection of patience is concealing illness, poverty, and all afflictions. It has been said: "Among the treasures of righteousness are concealing afflictions and pains, and charity." Thus, it has become clear to you through these divisions that the obligation of patience is general in all states and actions. For he who has restrained all appetites and secluded himself alone cannot do without patience in solitude and isolation outwardly, and patience against the whisperings of Satan inwardly. For the agitation of thoughts does not subside, and most wandering of thoughts is either about a past that cannot be recovered or a future from which what is decreed must inevitably occur. Thus, however it may be, it is a waste of the servant's time, whose instrument is his heart and whose capital is his lifespan. If the heart is heedless for a single moment from a remembrance by which it gains intimacy with God Almighty, or from a reflection by which it gains knowledge of God Almighty to thereby gain love of God Almighty through knowledge, then it is cheated. This is if his thought and whisperings are confined to permissible matters, but that is not usually the case. Rather, he reflects on devising means to fulfill appetites, for he continually contends with everyone who acts contrary to his desire throughout his entire life, or with whom he imagines contends and opposes his command or desire by showing some sign from him. Indeed, he anticipates opposition from the most sincere people in his love, even from his family and children, and imagines their opposition to him. Then he reflects on how to rebuke them, how to overpower them, and their reply to what they excuse themselves with in opposing him. And he remains constantly occupied. For Satan has two armies: an army that flies and an army that walks. Whispering is the movement of his flying army, and appetite is the movement of his walking army. This is because Satan was created from fire, and man was created from clay like pottery. Pottery combines within it clay and fire. Clay's nature is stillness, and fire's nature is movement. Thus, one cannot conceive of a burning fire that does not move; rather, it continually moves by its nature. And the accursed one, created from fire, has been tasked to find rest.

Regarding his movement in prostration when God created from clay, he refused, grew arrogant, and rebelled, expressing the reason for his rebellion by saying: "You created me from fire and created him from clay." Therefore, since the accursed one did not prostrate to our father Adam—upon him be prayers and peace—it is not fitting to hope for his prostration to Adam's children. Whenever he refrains from the heart's whisperings, aggression, fluttering, and wandering, he has indeed shown submission and compliance. His submission through compliance is a prostration from him; it is the spirit of prostration. Placing the forehead on the ground is merely its mold and its conventional indicative sign. If placing the forehead on the ground were taken as a sign of disrespect by convention, it could be imagined as such, just as lying prostrate before a revered and honored person is seen as disrespect by custom. So let not the shell of the essence distract you from the essence, nor the mold of the spirit from the spirit, nor the husk of the core from the core, lest you be among those whom the realm of the visible completely confines from the realm of the unseen. Realize that Satan is among those granted respite; he will not humble himself to you by ceasing whisperings until the Day of Judgment, unless you become such that your concerns are a single concern, occupying your heart with God alone, leaving the accursed one no avenue within you. Then you will be among God's sincere servants, included in the exception from the dominion of this vile one. Do not think that an empty heart is free from him; rather, he flows through the son of Adam like blood flows, and his flow is like air in a cup. If you wish the cup to be empty of air without filling it with water or something else, you have hoped for the impossible. For as much as it empties of water, air inevitably enters. Similarly, a heart occupied with a significant religious thought is not free from Satan's wandering; otherwise, whoever is heedless of God Almighty, even for a moment, has in that moment no companion but Satan. Thus, God Almighty said: "And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful, We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion." And He said—glory to Him—: "Indeed, God Almighty despises the idle youth." This is because when a youth is idle from work that occupies his inner self with something permissible to aid him in his religion, he appears idle, but his heart is not empty; rather, Satan nests in it, lays eggs, hatches them, then his offspring also mate, lay eggs again, and hatch, and thus Satan's progeny multiplies faster than that of other animals, for his nature is from fire, and when he finds dry tinder, his multiplication increases. Fire continually begets fire without ceasing, spreading gradually and continuously. Desire in the youth's soul is for Satan like dry tinder for fire, and just as fire does not remain if it has no fuel—which is firewood—so Satan has no opportunity if there is no desire. Therefore, if you reflect, you know that your fiercest enemy is your desire, which is an attribute of your soul. Hence, Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj, when he was crucified and asked what Sufism is, said: "It is your soul; if you do not occupy it, it occupies you." Thus, the reality and perfection of patience is patience from every blameworthy movement, and the movement of the inner self is more deserving of patience from that. This is a constant patience, severed only by death. We ask God for good success through His grace and generosity.

(Explanation of the Remedy of Patience and What Aids in It)
Know that He who sent down the ailment also sent down the remedy and promised healing. So patience, even if difficult or seemingly impossible, is attainable through the mixture of knowledge and action. Knowledge and action are the humors from which remedies for all heart ailments are compounded, but each ailment requires different knowledge and different action. And just as the types of patience vary, the types of impediments preventing it vary, and when the ailments differ, the treatment differs, for the meaning of treatment is opposing the ailment and suppressing it. Exhausting this would be lengthy, but we indicate the way through some examples. We say: If one needs patience from the desire for intercourse, for example, and desire has overpowered him such that he cannot control his private part, or he can control his private part but cannot control his eye, or he can control his eye but cannot control his heart and soul, as they continually prompt him according to desires, diverting him from consistency in remembrance, reflection, and righteous deeds. We say: We have previously stated that patience is an expression of the struggle between the impulse of religion and the impulse of desire. Whenever two contenders struggle, if we want one to overcome the other, we have no way but to strengthen the one we want to have the upper hand and weaken the other. Thus, here we must strengthen the impulse of religion and weaken the impulse of desire. As for the impulse of desire, the way to weaken it is three matters. First: Look to the substance of its strength, which is delicious foods that stir desire, both in type and quantity. It is necessary to cut them off through constant fasting, coupled with moderation when breaking the fast with little food that is inherently weak in kind, avoiding...

Meat and foods that stimulate desire. The second: cutting off its immediate stimulating causes, for it is only aroused by looking at the sources of desire, since the gaze stirs the heart, and the heart stirs desire. This is achieved through seclusion and guarding against the places where the sight might fall upon desired images, and fleeing from them entirely. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A glance is an arrow from the arrows of Satan," and it is an arrow that the accursed one aims, and there is no shield to protect from it except closing the eyelids or fleeing from the direction of its shot, for this arrow is only shot from the bow of images; so if you turn away from the direction of the images, his arrow will not strike you. The third: consoling the self with the permissible of the kind it desires, and that is through marriage, for everything the natural disposition desires, there is among the permissible things of its kind what suffices in place of the forbidden from it. This is the most beneficial treatment for most people, for cutting off nourishment weakens one for all other works, and it may not suppress desire for most men. For this reason, he, peace be upon him, said: "You should marry, and whoever is unable, then upon him is fasting, for fasting is a shield for him." These are three causes. So the treatment: the first, which is cutting off food, resembles cutting off fodder from a refractory beast and a predatory dog so that it weakens and its strength diminishes. The second resembles hiding meat from the dog and concealing barley from the beast so that their inner selves are not stirred by seeing it. The third resembles consoling it with a little of what its nature inclines to, so that it retains enough strength to endure discipline. As for strengthening the motive of religion, it is only through two ways: one is enticing it with the benefits of striving and its fruits in religion and this world, by increasing reflection on the reports we have mentioned regarding the merit of patience and its good outcomes in this world and the hereafter. And in the tradition: "The reward for patience over calamity is greater than what was lost," and that because of it, one is envied for the calamity, for what he lost does not remain with him except for the duration of life, and he gains what remains after his death forever. Whoever exchanges something base for something precious should not grieve for the loss of the base in the moment. This is from the realm of spiritual knowledge, and it is from faith, which at times weakens and at times strengthens. If it strengthens, the motive of religion strengthens and is intensely stirred; if it weakens, it weakens it. The strength of faith is expressed by certainty, which is what moves the resolve of patience, and the least that people are given is certainty and the resolve of patience. The second is to accustom this motive to gradually wrestle with the motive of desire, little by little, until it experiences the delight of overcoming it, thus becoming emboldened against it and its power in wrestling it strengthens. For habituation and practice of difficult works confirm the faculties from which those works issue; thus, the strength of porters, farmers, and fighters increases. In sum, the strength of those who practice difficult works increases over the strength of tailors, perfumers, jurists, and the pious, because their faculties have not been confirmed by practice. So the first treatment resembles enticing the wrestler with a robe of honor upon victory and promising him various honors, as Pharaoh promised his magicians when inciting them against Moses, where he said: "And indeed, you will then be among those brought near." The second resembles accustoming the boy who is intended for wrestling and fighting by engaging in its causes from childhood until he becomes familiar with it and emboldened in it, and his power in it strengthens. Whoever entirely abandons striving through patience weakens in him the motive of religion and cannot overcome desire, even if it weakens. And whoever accustoms himself to oppose desire overcomes it whenever he wills. This is the method of treatment in all types of patience, and it cannot be fully detailed. The most severe of them is restraining the inner self from the whisperings of the soul, and this becomes most severe for one who devotes himself to it by suppressing apparent desires, chooses seclusion, and sits for vigilance, remembrance, and reflection. For the insinuations continually pull him from one side to another, and this has no treatment at all except cutting off all attachments, outwardly and inwardly, by fleeing from family, children, wealth, status, companions, and friends, then secluding oneself in a corner after securing a modest amount of sustenance and being content with it. Yet all that is insufficient unless concerns become a single concern, which is God, exalted is He. Then, when that dominates the heart, it is still insufficient unless it has scope in thought and inner journeying through the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and the wonders of God's creation and all the doors of knowing God, exalted is He, until when that takes possession of his heart, it repels the engagement with the tugging of Satan and his insinuations. If he has no inner journeying, nothing will save him except continuous, regularly arranged litanies in every moment of recitation, remembrances, and prayers. Along with that, he needs to oblige the heart to be present, for inner thought is...

He who immerses his heart beyond the outward litanies, even after doing all that, will not have all his moments secured for him, save for a portion of them. For he is not free, in all his times, from newly occurring incidents that distract him from reflection and remembrance—such as illness, fear, harm from others, or aggression from a companion, since he cannot do without associating with those who assist him in some necessities of livelihood. This is one type of distraction.

As for the second type, it is more essential and of greater necessity than the first: his preoccupation with food, clothing, and the means of subsistence. Preparing these also requires engagement, whether he undertakes it himself or another does it for him; he is not free from a heart preoccupied with whoever manages it. However, after severing all attachments, most of his moments become secure for him, unless a calamity or event befalls him. In those moments, the heart becomes clear, reflection becomes easy for him, and there is unveiled within it from the secrets of God Almighty in the dominion of the heavens and the earth what he could not attain a tenth of in a long period, had his heart been preoccupied with attachments. Attaining this is the utmost of the stations that can be reached through acquisition and effort.

As for the measures of what is unveiled and the extent of what comes from the grace of God Almighty in states and deeds, that proceeds like hunting, and it is according to provision. The effort may be little and the catch great, or the effort may be prolonged and the fortune small. Reliance beyond this striving is upon a pull from the pulls of the All-Merciful, for they equal the works of the two weighty creations (jinn and mankind), and that is not by the choice of the servant. Indeed, the servant's choice lies in exposing himself to that pull by cutting off from his heart the attractions of the world, for one pulled toward the lowest of the low is not drawn to the highest high. Everyone anxious about the world is drawn to it. Thus, severing the attracting attachments is what is meant by His saying (in a hadith qudsi): "Verily, your Lord has breezes in the days of your time; so expose yourselves to them." This is because those breezes and pulls have celestial causes, as God Almighty said: "And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised" (51:22). This is among the highest types of provision.

Celestial matters are hidden from us, so we do not know when God Almighty facilitates the causes of provision. It is incumbent upon us only to empty the place and await the descent of mercy and the reaching of the book's appointed term—like one who prepares the land, clears it of weeds, and scatters seed in it. All that does not benefit him except with rain, and he does not know when God decrees the causes of rain, except that he trusts in the bounty and mercy of God Almighty that He does not leave a year without rain. Likewise, when a year, month, or day passes without a pull from the pulls or a breeze from the breezes, the servant should have purified the heart from the weeds of desires, sown within it the seed of intention and sincerity, and exposed it to the blowing winds of mercy. And just as the anticipation of rains strengthens in the times of spring and at the appearance of clouds, so does the anticipation of those breezes strengthen in the noble times and when aspirations gather and hearts assist one another, as on the Day of Arafah, Friday, and the days of Ramadan. For aspirations and breaths are causes, by the decree of God Almighty, to draw forth His mercy, just as rains are drawn forth in times of seeking rain. They are more suited to drawing forth the rains of unveilings and subtleties of knowledge from the treasuries of the dominion than to drawing forth droplets of water and gathering clouds from the corners of mountains and seas.

Rather, the states and unveilings are present with you in your heart, but you are distracted from them by your attachments and desires, so that becomes a veil between you and them. You need only for the desire to be broken and the veil lifted, then the lights of knowledge shine from the inward heart. Bringing forth the water of the earth by digging channels is easier and nearer than letting it flow from a distant place lower than it. And because it is present in the heart yet forgotten due to preoccupation away from it, God Almighty named all the knowledges of faith "remembrance," saying: "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Remembrance, and indeed, We will be its guardian" (15:9). And He said: "That those of understanding may be reminded" (14:52). And He said: "And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?" (54:17).

This is the remedy for patience against whisperings and distractions, and it is the final degree of patience. Indeed, patience in severing all attachments takes precedence over patience against passing thoughts. Junayd, mercy of God upon him, said: "The journey from this world to the Hereafter is easy for the believer, but abandoning people for the love of the Truth is severe. The journey from the self to God Almighty is difficult and severe, and patience with God is more severe." He mentioned the severity of patience against the distractions of the heart, then the severity of abandoning people, and the most severe attachment upon the soul is attachment to people and love of status. For the pleasure of leadership, dominance, exaltation, and having followers is the most overpowering of pleasures in this world upon the souls of the rational. How could it not be the most overpowering, when its object is an attribute from the attributes of God Almighty, which is Lordship?

The heart naturally loves and seeks this, due to its correspondence with matters of divine lordship. This is alluded to in the saying of God, exalted is He: "Say, 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord.'" The heart is not blameworthy for loving that. Rather, it is blameworthy for an error that befalls it due to the deception of the accursed Satan, who is distanced from the world of the Command, for he envied it for being from the world of the Command, so he misled and seduced it. How could it be blameworthy for it, when it seeks the happiness of the Hereafter? It seeks nothing but an everlasting life in which there is no annihilation, a might in which there is no humiliation, a security in which there is no fear, a richness in which there is no poverty, and a perfection in which there is no deficiency. All of these are from the attributes of divine lordship. It is not blameworthy for seeking that. Rather, it is the right of every servant to seek a great dominion that has no end. And the seeker of dominion inevitably seeks elevation, might, and perfection. However, dominion is of two kinds: a dominion mixed with various pains and followed by swift termination, but it is immediate, and it is in this world; and an everlasting, permanent dominion, not sullied by any trouble or pain, nor cut off by any cutter, but it is deferred.

Man was created hasty, desirous of the immediate. So Satan came and approached him through the medium of the haste inherent in his nature, and seduced him with the immediate, and made the present world appealing to him. And he approached him through the medium of folly, and promised him delusion regarding the Hereafter, and made him covet the dominion of the Hereafter along with the dominion of this world, as He said: "And the fool is he who follows his soul's caprice and wishes upon God vain wishes." So the forsaken one was deceived by his delusion and busied himself with seeking the might and dominion of this world to the extent of his ability. But the divinely-guided one did not grasp the rope of his delusion, for he knew the avenues of his guile, so he turned away from the immediate. He described the forsaken ones with His saying, exalted is He: "No! But you love the immediate and neglect the Hereafter." And He said, exalted is He: "Indeed, these love the immediate and leave behind them a heavy Day." And He said, exalted is He: "So turn away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires not but the life of this world. That is their attainment of knowledge."

When the guile of Satan spread among all creation, God sent the angels to the messengers, and they revealed to them what had befallen creation from the destruction and seduction of the enemy. So they busied themselves with calling creation to the true dominion, away from the metaphorical dominion which has no reality if it is safe, and no permanence at all. So they called out among them: "O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when it is said to you, 'Go forth in the cause of God,' you adhere heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a little."

Thus, the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, the Criterion, the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham, and every revealed book were sent for nothing but to call creation to the permanent, everlasting dominion. What is intended for them is that they be kings in this world and kings in the Hereafter. As for kingship in this world, it is through asceticism in it and contentment with little from it. As for kingship in the Hereafter, it is through proximity to God, exalted is He, attaining an everlasting life in which there is no annihilation, a might in which there is no humiliation, and a coolness of the eye which is hidden in this world, which no soul knows. And Satan calls them to the dominion of this world, knowing that the dominion of the Hereafter is thereby missed, for this world and the Hereafter are co-wives, and knowing that this world will not be safe for him either—for if it were safe for him, he would envy him for it as well—but the dominion of this world is not free from disputes, troubles, prolonged anxieties in management, and likewise all the causes of status. Then, however much one attains safety and the causes are complete, the lifespan ends: "Until, when the earth has taken its ornament and is adorned and its people suppose that they have capability over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday."

So God, exalted is He, struck a similitude for it, saying: "And present to them the similitude of the life of this world: [It is] like water which We send down from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it, then it becomes dry stubble which the winds scatter."

And asceticism in this world, since it is a present dominion, Satan envied him for it and turned him away from it. The meaning of asceticism is that the servant masters his passion and his anger, so that they submit to the motive of religion and the indication of faith. This is a dominion by deserving, for by it its possessor becomes free, and by the domination of passion over him he becomes a slave to his private parts, his stomach, and all his other desires, thus being driven like a beast, owned, with the reins of passion pulling him by his throat to where it wills and desires. How great is the delusion of man when he thought he attains dominion by becoming owned, and attains lordship by becoming a slave! Can such a one be anything but inverted in this world and overturned in the Hereafter? For this reason, a certain king said to a certain ascetic: "Do you have a need?" He said: "How can I ask you for a need when my dominion is greater than your dominion?" He said: "How is that?" He said: "Whoever you are a slave to, he is a slave to me." He said: "How is that?" He said: "You are a slave to your passion, your anger, your private parts, and your stomach, and I have mastered all of these, so they are slaves to me." This, then, is the dominion in this world, and it is what leads to the dominion in the Hereafter.

As for the Hereafter, those deceived by the devil's delusion have lost both this world and the next, while those who were granted success in holding fast to the Straight Path have won both this world and the Hereafter. Now, if you have come to understand the meaning of sovereignty and lordship, the meaning of subjugation and servitude, the point of error therein, and the manner of the devil's blinding and deception, it will become easy for you to turn away from sovereignty and status, to avert yourself from it, and to be patient when it is lost. For by abandoning it, you become a sovereign in the present moment and hope for sovereignty in the Hereafter. As for one to whom these matters are unveiled after he has become accustomed to status, familiar with it, and firmly rooted in it through the habitual practice of its means, mere knowledge and unveiling will not suffice for his cure. Rather, he must add action to it. His action lies in three matters:

First, that he flee from the place of status so as not to witness its means, for patience in the presence of its means becomes difficult, just as one overpowered by lust flees from gazing upon arousing images. Whoever does not do this has been ungrateful for God's favor in the vastness of the earth, as He, Exalted is He, said: "Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" (Qur'an 4:97). Second, that he compel himself in his actions to perform deeds contrary to what he is accustomed to, thus replacing affectation with simplicity, and the attire of dignity with the attire of humility. Likewise, every posture, state, and action in dwelling, clothing, food, standing, and sitting that he was accustomed to in fulfillment of the demands of his status, he should replace with their opposites, until through habituation to that, the opposite of what was previously ingrained in him through habituation to its contrary becomes firmly rooted. For there is no meaning to treatment except through opposition. Third, that he observe gentleness and gradual progression in this, not shifting all at once to the extreme limit of simplicity, for human nature is averse and cannot be shifted from its dispositions except gradually. So he leaves off some and consoles himself with some. Then, when his soul is content with that some, he begins by leaving off some of that some until it is content with the remainder. He does this little by little until he subdues those traits that were ingrained in him. To this gradual progression points the saying (of the Prophet, peace be upon him): "Verily, this religion is firm, so enter into it gently, and do not make the worship of God hateful to yourself, for the one who overburdens (his mount) neither covers ground nor spares his riding beast." And to it points his saying, peace be upon him: "Do not be harsh with this religion, for whoever is harsh with it will be overcome by it."

Therefore, add what we have mentioned concerning the treatment of patience against insinuating thoughts, against lust, and against status, to what we have mentioned of the governing principles of the paths of spiritual struggle in the Book of "Disciplining the Soul" from the Quarter of the Destructive Matters. Take it as your guide to know thereby the treatment of patience in all the categories we previously detailed, for detailing each one would be lengthy. Whoever observes gradual progression, patience will elevate him to a state where being patient without it becomes difficult for him, just as being patient with it was difficult before. Thus his affairs are reversed: what was beloved to him becomes detested, and what was disliked becomes a pleasant drink from which he cannot bear to be patient. This is known only through experience and taste. It has a parallel in habits, for a child is compelled to learn in the beginning by force, and patience from play and patience with learning become difficult for him. Until, when his insight is opened and he becomes familiar with knowledge, the matter is reversed: patience from knowledge and patience with play become difficult for him. To this points what is narrated from one of the knowers, that he asked al-Shibli about patience: "Which is the most severe?" He said: "Patience in God, Exalted is He." He said: "No." He said: "Patience for God." He said: "No." He said: "Patience with God." He said: "No." He said: "Then what?" He said: "Patience from God." Al-Shibli let out a cry such that his soul was nearly destroyed. It has been said concerning the meaning of His saying, Exalted is He: "Be patient, and outdo others in patience, and be steadfast" (Qur'an 3:200): "Be patient in God, outdo others in patience by God, and be steadfast with God." And it is said: Patience for God is sufficiency, patience by God is permanence, patience with God is fidelity, and patience from God is estrangement. It has been said in its meaning:

"Patience from You has blameworthy consequences,
While patience in all other things is praiseworthy."

And it is also said:

"Patience is borne in all situations,
Except concerning You, for it is not becoming."

This is the end of what we wished to explain concerning the sciences and secrets of patience.

The Second Half of the Book is on Gratitude, and it has three pillars:
The First: On the virtue of gratitude, its reality, its divisions, and its rulings.
The Second: On the reality of blessing and its specific and general divisions.
The Third: On clarifying which is superior: gratitude or patience.

The First Pillar: Concerning Gratitude Itself
(Clarifying the Virtue of Gratitude)

Know that God, Exalted is He, coupled gratitude with remembrance in His Book, even though He said: "And the remembrance of God is greater" (Qur'an 29:45). So He, Exalted is He, said: "So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me" (Qur'an 2:152). And He, Exalted is He, said: "What would God do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe?" (Qur'an 4:147). And He, Exalted is He, said: "And We will reward..."

And He, the Exalted, said, informing about the accursed Iblis: "I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path." It is said this is the path of gratitude. Due to the elevated rank of gratitude, the accursed one attacked creation, saying: "And you will not find most of them grateful." And He, the Exalted, said: "And few of My servants are grateful." And Allah, the Exalted, has decreed increase with gratitude without exception, saying: "If you are grateful, I will surely increase you." He made exceptions in five things: enrichment, response, provision, forgiveness, and repentance. He, the Exalted, said: "Then Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills," and said: "He removes that for which you supplicate Him, if He wills," and said: "He provides for whom He wills without account," and said: "And He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills," and said: "And Allah turns in forgiveness to whom He wills." And it is a created attribute from the attributes of Lordship, as He, the Exalted, said: "And Allah is Appreciative and Forbearing." And Allah has made gratitude the key speech of the people of Paradise, as He, the Exalted, said: "And they will say, 'Praise to Allah, who has fulfilled for us His promise,'" and said: "And their final call will be, 'Praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds.'"

As for the narrations, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: "The grateful eater is in the status of the patient faster." It is narrated from 'Ata that he said: "I entered upon 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and said, 'Inform us of the most amazing thing you saw from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him.' She wept and said, 'And which of his affairs was not amazing? He came to me one night and entered with me in my bed'—or she said, 'in my cover'—until his skin touched my skin. Then he said, 'O daughter of Abu Bakr, allow me to worship my Lord.' She said, 'I said, "I love your closeness, but I prefer your desire." So I permitted him. He stood up to a water skin, performed ablution without using much water, then stood to pray. He wept until his tears flowed onto his chest. Then he bowed and wept, then prostrated and wept, then raised his head and wept. He continued like that, weeping, until Bilal came to give the call to prayer. I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, what makes you weep when Allah has forgiven your past and future sins?' He said, 'Should I not be a grateful servant? And why should I not do that when Allah, the Exalted, has revealed to me, "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth..."' the verse." This indicates that weeping should never cease. To this secret points what is narrated that one of the prophets passed by a small stone from which much water was flowing. He was amazed by it, so Allah, the Exalted, gave it speech. It said, 'Since I heard His saying, "Its fuel is people and stones," I weep from fear of it.' He asked it to seek refuge for him from the Fire, so it did. Then he saw it after a period in the same state and said, 'Why do you weep now?' It said, 'That was weeping of fear, and this is weeping of gratitude and joy.' The heart of the servant is like stone, or harder, and its hardness does not depart except by weeping in states of both fear and gratitude. And it is narrated from him, peace be upon him, that he said: "It will be proclaimed on the Day of Resurrection, 'Let the praisers stand.' So a group will stand, and a banner will be erected for them, and they will enter Paradise." It was said, "Who are the praisers?" He said, "Those who thank Allah, the Exalted, in every circumstance." In another wording: "Those who thank Allah in ease and hardship." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Praise is the cloak of the Most Merciful." And Allah, the Exalted, revealed to Job, peace be upon him: "I am pleased with gratitude as recompense for My allies," in a lengthy discourse. And Allah, the Exalted, also revealed to him regarding the attribute of the patient that their abode is the Abode of Peace; when they enter it, He inspires them with gratitude, which is the best of speech, and at gratitude, He increases them more, and by looking at His increase. And when what was revealed about treasures was revealed, 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "What wealth should we acquire?" He, peace be upon him, said, "Let one of you acquire a remembering tongue or a grateful heart." So he commanded acquiring a grateful heart instead of wealth. And Ibn Mas'ud said, "Gratitude is half of faith."

(Explanation of the Definition and Reality of Gratitude)
Know that gratitude is among the stations of the wayfarers, and it also comprises knowledge, state, and action. Knowledge is the foundation, which begets the state, and the state begets action. As for knowledge, it is recognition of the blessing from the Bestower. The state is the joy resulting from His bestowal. The action is the fulfillment of what is intended and beloved by the Bestower. That action pertains to the heart, the limbs, and the tongue. All of that must be explained so that comprehension of the reality of gratitude is achieved through their combination, for everything said in defining gratitude falls short of encompassing the perfection of its meanings. The first foundation: knowledge, which is knowledge of three matters specifically: the blessing itself, the aspect by which it is a blessing for him, and the essence of the Bestower and the existence of His attributes through which bestowal is perfected and issued from Him upon him. For there must be a blessing, a Bestower, and one upon whom the blessing is bestowed, to whom the blessing reaches from the Bestower by intent and will. These matters must be known. This is regarding other than Allah, the Exalted. As for regarding Allah, the Exalted, it is not complete except by knowing that all blessings are from Allah, and He is the Bestower.

The intermediaries are subjugated by His command, and this knowledge lies beyond sanctification and divine unity, for sanctification and divine unity are encompassed within it. Indeed, the first rank in the knowledge of faith is sanctification. Then, when one recognizes a sacred essence, he knows that there is none sanctified except the One, and all else is not sanctified—this is divine unity. Then he learns that everything in the universe exists solely from that One, so all is a blessing from Him. This knowledge falls into the third rank, as it enfolds within it, along with sanctification and divine unity, the perfection of power and exclusive agency. Concerning this, the Messenger of God ﷺ expressed when he said: "Whoever says 'Glory be to God' receives ten good deeds, and whoever says 'There is no god but God' receives twenty good deeds, and whoever says 'Praise be to God' receives thirty good deeds." And he ﷺ said: "The best remembrance is 'There is no god but God,' and the best supplication is 'Praise be to God.'" And he said: "No remembrance is multiplied as 'Praise be to God' is multiplied." Do not suppose that these good deeds correspond merely to moving the tongue with these words without their meanings taking root in the heart. For 'Glory be to God' is a phrase indicating sanctification, 'There is no god but God' is a phrase indicating divine unity, and 'Praise be to God' is a phrase indicating gratitude for blessings from the One True God. The good deeds correspond to these knowledges, which are among the gates of faith and certainty.

Know that the completion of this knowledge lies in negating partnership in actions. For if a king among kings bestows a favor upon someone with something, and that person sees that his minister or agent had a role in facilitating and delivering it to him, this is associating partners with the king in the blessing. Thus, he does not see the blessing as entirely from the king, but partly from him and partly from another, dividing his joy between them, and he is not a monotheist in relation to the king. However, it does not diminish his monotheism regarding the king or the perfection of his gratitude to recognize that the blessing reached him through the decree written with his pen and on the paper he wrote upon, for he does not rejoice in the pen and paper nor thank them, because he does not attribute to them any independent role as self-existing entities, but rather as instruments subjugated under the king's power. He may also know that the delivering agent and the treasurer are compelled by the king's command in the delivery, and that if the matter were referred to him without the king's authority, he would face coercion and a decisive order whose consequences he fears, and thus he would not hand over anything. When one knows this, his view of the delivering treasurer is like his view of the pen and paper, and this does not lead to partnership in his monotheism by attributing the blessing to the king. The same applies to the scribe. Indeed, animals with free will are subjugated in their very choice, for God Almighty is the One who imposes motives upon them to act, whether they will or not, like the compelled treasurer who finds no way to disobey the king. If left to himself, he would not give you a speck of what is in his hand. Thus, everyone through whom a blessing from God Almighty reaches you is compelled, for God has imposed the will upon him, stirred motives within him, and placed in his heart that his good in this world and the next lies in giving you what he gave, and that his desired objective in status and wealth is not attained except through it. After God has created this belief in him, he finds no way to abandon it. Therefore, he gives you for his own purpose, not for yours. If he had no purpose in giving, he would not give, and if he did not know that his benefit lies in your benefit, he would not benefit you. Thus, he seeks his own benefit through benefiting you; he is not a benefactor to you but rather takes you as a means to another blessing he hopes for. The One who has bestowed favor upon you is He who subjugated him for you and placed in his heart beliefs and desires that compel him to deliver to you. If you understand matters thus, you have known God Almighty and His action, and you are a monotheist, capable of thanking Him. Indeed, with this knowledge alone, you are grateful. For this reason, Moses, peace be upon him, said in his intimate discourse: "My God, You created Adam with Your hand and did such and such, so how can I thank You?" God Almighty said: "He knew that all of that is from Me, so his knowledge was gratitude." Therefore, you do not give thanks except by knowing that all is from Him. If doubt assails you in this, you are not knowledgeable of the blessing nor the Benefactor, so you do not rejoice in the Benefactor alone but also in others. With the deficiency of your knowledge, your state of joy diminishes, and with the deficiency of your joy, your action diminishes. This is the explanation of this principle.

The second principle: The state derived from the root of knowledge, which is joy in the Benefactor with an attitude of submission and humility. This in itself is gratitude in its pure form, just as knowledge is gratitude, but it only becomes gratitude when it fulfills its condition. Its condition is that your joy be in the Benefactor, not in the blessing nor in the act of bestowal. Perhaps this is difficult for you to comprehend, so we present an example: A king who intends to depart on a journey bestows a horse upon a person. It can be imagined that the recipient rejoices in the horse from three aspects:

The first is when one rejoices in the horse merely because it is a horse, as property to benefit from, a mount that suits his purpose, and a noble steed of value. This is the joy of one who has no regard for the king; his desire is solely for the horse. Had he found it in a wilderness and taken it, his joy would be akin to that joy. The second aspect is when one rejoices in it not because it is a horse, but because it serves as evidence of the king's care for him, his compassion toward him, and his concern for his standing. Had he found this horse in a wilderness or received it from someone other than the king, he would not rejoice in it at all, either because he has no need for the horse whatsoever or because he deems it insignificant compared to his objective of attaining a place in the king's heart. The third aspect is when one rejoices in it in order to ride it to go out in service to the king and endure the hardship of travel to attain closeness to him through that service, perhaps even rising to the rank of vizier. For he is not content merely that his place in the king's heart is such that the king gives him a horse and shows him this measure of care; rather, he desires that the king bestow no favor from his wealth upon anyone except through his mediation. Moreover, he does not desire the vizierate for the sake of the vizierate itself, but desires to behold the king and be near him, such that if he were given the choice between closeness without the vizierate and the vizierate without closeness, he would choose closeness. These are three degrees.

The first involves no meaning of gratitude whatsoever, because its possessor's consideration is confined to the horse; his joy is in the horse, not in the Giver. This is the condition of everyone who rejoices in a blessing because it is pleasurable and conforms to his desire—he is far from the meaning of gratitude. The second enters into the meaning of gratitude because he rejoices in the Benefactor, yet not for His Essence, but for the awareness of His care that prompts Him to bestow favors in the future. This is the condition of the righteous who worship God and thank Him out of fear of His punishment and hope for His reward. However, complete gratitude lies in the third joy, which is that the servant's joy in the blessing of God Almighty stems from being enabled by it to draw near to Him, to abide in His proximity, and to gaze upon His Face perpetually. This is the highest rank. Its sign is that he rejoices in nothing of this world except what is a seedbed for the Hereafter and assists him in it, and he grieves over any blessing that distracts him from the remembrance of God Almighty and turns him away from His path. For he does not desire the blessing because it is pleasurable, as the one who desires the horse desires it because it is a noble and swift steed, but rather because it carries him in the company of the king so that his beholding him and closeness to him may endure. Therefore, al-Shibli, mercy of God upon him, said: "Gratitude is seeing the Benefactor, not seeing the blessing." And al-Khawwas, mercy of God upon him, said: "The gratitude of the common folk is for food, clothing, and drink, while the gratitude of the elect is for what enters the hearts." This is a rank not attained by anyone whose pleasures are confined to the belly and private parts and the perceptions of the senses—colors and sounds—and who is devoid of the heart's delight. For the heart, in a state of health, finds delight only in the remembrance of God Almighty, knowledge of Him, and meeting Him. It delights in other than Him only when it is sick through corrupt habits, just as some people delight in eating clay, and just as some sick persons find sweet things repulsive and bitter things delicious, as it is said:
"And whoever has a sick, bitter mouth / Finds even pure water bitter."
Thus, this is the condition for rejoicing in the blessing of God Almighty. If this is not attained, then there is the second degree. As for the first, it is outside all reckoning. For how great is the difference between one who desires the king for the horse and one who desires the horse for the king! And how great is the difference between one who desires God that He may bestow favors upon him and one who desires the favors of God that he may reach Him through them!

The third principle: Acting in accordance with the joy arising from knowledge of the Benefactor. This action pertains to the heart, the tongue, and the limbs. As for the heart: intending good and wishing it for all creation. As for the tongue: manifesting gratitude to God Almighty through praises that indicate it. As for the limbs: employing the blessings of God Almighty in obeying Him and guarding against using them to aid in disobeying Him. So much so that the gratitude of the eyes is to conceal every fault they see in a Muslim, and the gratitude of the ears is to conceal every fault they hear about him. This enters into the totality of thanking God Almighty for these limbs. Gratitude with the tongue is to manifest contentment with God Almighty, and it is commanded. For the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man: "How are you this morning?" The man said: "Well." He repeated the question until on the third time the man said: "Well, I praise God and thank Him." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "This is what I wanted from you." The early generations would inquire after one another with the intention of eliciting gratitude to God, so that the one thanking would be obedient and the one prompting him to it would be obedient. Their aim was not ostentation by displaying longing. Every servant asked about his condition is between thanking and complaining; if he remains silent, then gratitude is obedience and complaint is disobedience—ugly from the people of religion. And how could complaint to a king not be ugly?

Kings, who hold all things in their hands, to a servant who owns nothing and can do nothing? It is more fitting for the servant, if he cannot endure affliction and divine decree with grace, and weakness leads him to complain, that his complaint be directed to God Almighty. For He is the One who afflicts and has the power to remove affliction. The servant's humility before his Master is glory, while complaining to other than Him is disgrace. Displaying one's lowliness to a servant, who is himself a servant like you, is an ugly disgrace. God Almighty says: "Indeed, those you worship besides God do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek provision from God and worship Him and be grateful to Him." And He says: "Indeed, those you invoke besides God are servants like you." Gratitude expressed by the tongue is part of gratitude. It has been narrated that a delegation came to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy on him. A young man stood to speak, so 'Umar said, "Seniority, seniority!" The young man said, "O Commander of the Faithful, if the matter were by age, there are among the Muslims those older than you." He said, "Speak." The young man said, "We are not a delegation of desire nor a delegation of fear. As for desire, your generosity has already delivered it to us. As for fear, your justice has secured us from it. We have only come to you to give thanks; we thank you with our tongues and depart." These are the foundational meanings of gratitude that encompass the totality of its reality. As for the statement of one who said that gratitude is the acknowledgment of the benefactor's favor in a manner of humility, this looks to the action of the tongue along with some states of the heart. The statement of one who said that gratitude is praising the benefactor by mentioning his kindness looks merely to the action of the tongue. The statement of one who said that gratitude is devotion upon the carpet of witnessing through constant preservation of sanctity gathers most meanings of gratitude, excepting only the action of the tongue. The statement of Hamdun al-Qassar, "Gratitude for a blessing is that you see yourself in gratitude as a parasite," points to the fact that the meaning of recognition is among the meanings of gratitude only. The statement of al-Junayd, "Gratitude is that you do not see yourself as worthy of the blessing," points to a specific state of the heart. These statements express their authors' conditions, hence their answers differ and do not agree. Moreover, the answer of each one may differ in two states, for they speak only from their present, predominant condition, occupied with what concerns them over what does not, or they speak with what they see as suitable to the questioner's condition, limiting themselves to mentioning the amount needed and turning away from what is not needed. Therefore, you should not think that what we have mentioned is a criticism of them, or that if all the meanings we have explained were presented to them, they would deny them. Indeed, no rational person would think so at all, unless there is a dispute regarding the term—whether the name 'gratitude' in linguistic convention encompasses all these meanings or applies to some of them as the primary intent, while the remaining meanings are among its concomitants and necessities. We do not intend in this book to explain linguistic subjects, for that has nothing to do with the knowledge of the path to the Hereafter. And God grants success through His mercy.

(Clarifying the way to remove the veil from gratitude in relation to God Almighty)

Perhaps it occurs to your mind that gratitude is only done for a benefactor who has a share in the gratitude, for we thank kings either with praise to increase their station in hearts and manifest their generosity among people, thereby increasing their fame and prestige; or with service, which is an aid to them for some of their aims; or by presenting ourselves before them in the form of service, which multiplies their retinue and is a cause for increasing their prestige. Thus, they are not thanked except with something of this sort. This is impossible in relation to God Almighty for two reasons: First, God Almighty is transcendent above shares and aims, sanctified from need for service and aid, and from spreading prestige and dignity through praise and extolling, and from multiplying the retinue of servants by presenting oneself before Him bowing and prostrating. So our thanking Him with that in which there is no share resembles our thanking a king who has bestowed favor upon us by sleeping in our houses or prostrating or bowing, since there is no share in it for the king who is absent, having no knowledge of it, and there is no share for God Almighty in all our actions. The second reason is that everything we undertake by our choice is another blessing from God's blessings upon us, for our limbs, our capability, our will, our motive, and all the matters that are the causes of our movement, and the movement itself, are from the creation and favor of God Almighty. So how can we thank one blessing with another? If a king gave us a mount, and we took another mount belonging to him and rode it, or the king gave us another mount, the second would not be gratitude from us for the first. Rather, the second would itself require gratitude just as the first does. Then gratitude for gratitude is only possible through another blessing, leading to gratitude being impossible in relation to God Almighty from these two perspectives. Yet we have no doubt about both matters, and the Sacred Law has come with it. So what is the way to reconcile? Know that this thought occurred to David, peace be upon him.

Likewise, to Moses, peace be upon him, he said: "O Lord, how can I thank You when I am unable to thank You except through a second favor from Your favors?" And in another wording: "And my gratitude to You is another favor from You, obliging me to gratitude toward You." So God Almighty revealed to him: "If you have recognized this, then you have thanked Me." And in another report: "If you have recognized that the favor is from Me, I am pleased with you for that as gratitude."

If you say: "I have understood the question, but my understanding falls short of grasping the meaning of what was revealed to them. For I know the impossibility of thanking God Almighty. However, I do not understand how the knowledge of this impossibility constitutes gratitude, for this knowledge is also a favor from Him. So how did it become gratitude? It is as if the outcome reverts to the idea that whoever has not thanked has indeed thanked, and that accepting the second robe from the king is gratitude for the first robe. My understanding is insufficient to grasp the secret therein. If it is possible to explain this with an example, it is important in itself."

Know then that this knocks on a door of spiritual knowledges, which are higher than the sciences of transaction. Yet we shall point from them to glimpses and say: Here are two perspectives. The first perspective is with the eye of pure monotheism. This perspective will certainly make you know that He is the One who gives thanks, and He is the One thanked; He is the Lover, and He is the Beloved. This is the perspective of one who knows that there is none in existence but Him, and that everything perishes except His Face, and that this is true in every state, eternally and forever. For the "other" is that which is imagined to have subsistence by itself, and such an "other" has no existence; rather, it is impossible for it to exist. For the true existent is that which subsists by itself, and that which has no subsistence by itself has no existence by itself; rather, it subsists through another. Thus it exists through another. If its essence is considered without regard to another, it has no existence whatsoever. The existent is only that which subsists by itself, and that which subsists by itself is that which, were the nonexistence of another conceived, would remain existent. If, along with subsisting by itself, the existence of another subsists through its existence, then it is the Sustainer, and there is no Sustainer except One, and it is inconceivable to be otherwise. Therefore, there is in existence no "other" than the Ever-Living, the Sustainer, who is the One, the Eternal. So when you look from this station, you know that all originates from Him and returns to Him. Thus He is the One who gives thanks, and He is the One thanked; He is the Lover, and He is the Beloved. From here is the perspective of Habib ibn Abi Habib when he recited: "Indeed, We found him patient. An excellent servant! Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back [to Us]." He said: "How wondrous! He gave and praised," indicating that when He praises His giving, He praises Himself. He is the Praiser and the One praised.

From here is the perspective of Shaykh Abu Sa'id al-Mihani when it was recited before him: "He loves them, and they love Him." He said: "By my life, He loves them, and let Him love them! By right, He loves them, for He only loves Himself," alluding by this that He is the Lover and He is the Beloved. This is a high station that you will not understand except through an example within the scope of your intellect. So it should not be hidden from you that when an author loves his composition, he has loved himself; when a craftsman loves his craft, he has loved himself; when a parent loves his child insofar as he is his child, he has loved himself. And all that exists besides God Almighty is the composition of God Almighty and His craft. So if He loves it, He loves nothing but Himself. And if He does not love Himself, then by right He loves what He loves, and this is what He loves. All of this is the perspective with the eye of monotheism. The Sufis express this state as the annihilation of the self—that is, he annihilated from himself and from other than God, so he saw nothing but God Almighty. Whoever does not understand this denies them and says: "How has he annihilated when his shadow's length is four cubits, and perhaps he eats pounds of bread every day?" Thus the ignorant laugh at them due to their ignorance of the meanings of their speech, and it is necessary for the knowers to be a laughingstock for the ignorant. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Indeed, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed. And when they passed by them, they would exchange derisive glances. And when they returned to their people, they would return jesting. And when they saw them, they would say, 'Indeed, those are truly lost.' But they had not been sent as guardians over them." Then He clarified that the laughter of the knowers at them tomorrow is greater, as He said, exalted is He: "So today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers, on couches, observing." Likewise, the people of Noah, peace be upon him, used to laugh at him when he was occupied with building the ark. He said: "If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule." So this is one of the two perspectives.

The second perspective is that of one who has not attained the station of annihilation from himself. These are of two kinds: a kind who affirmed only the existence of themselves and denied that they have a Lord to worship. These are the inverted blind, and their blindness is in both eyes, for they denied what is truly established—the Sustainer, who subsists by Himself and oversees every soul for what it has earned, and every subsisting thing subsists through Him. They did not limit themselves to this but even affirmed themselves. Had they known, they would have realized that from the standpoint of being themselves, they have no stability and no existence. Their existence is from the standpoint of being brought into existence, not from the standpoint of being existent. There is a difference between the existent and the One who brings into existence.

There is no existence except one Existent and one Originator. Thus the Existent is real, and the Originator is unreal from the perspective of its own essence. The Existent is Self-Subsisting and Self-Sustaining, while the originator is perishable and vanishing. Since everything upon it perishes, nothing remains except the Countenance of your Lord, Possessor of Majesty and Honor. The second group are not blind, but they are one-eyed, for they see with one eye the existence of the True Existent and do not deny it. Yet if the other eye were to open from its blindness, they would not perceive through it the annihilation of anything other than the True Existent. Thus they affirm another existent alongside God Almighty, and this is pure polytheism, just as the stance before it was pure denial. If one passes beyond the limit of blindness to dim-sightedness, one perceives a distinction between the two existents, affirming a servant and a Lord. With this measure of affirming distinction and deficiency in the other existent, one enters the precinct of Divine Oneness. Then, if one applies kohl to his insight with what increases its light, his dim-sightedness diminishes. In proportion to the increase in his insight, the deficiency of what he affirmed besides God Almighty becomes apparent to him. If he continues his journey thus, the deficiency will inevitably lead him to effacement, so he becomes effaced from seeing anything besides God, seeing nothing but God, thereby attaining the perfection of Oneness. Wherever one perceives deficiency in the existence of anything besides God Almighty, one enters the beginnings of Oneness. Between these two are countless degrees; thus vary the ranks of the affirmers of Oneness. The revealed Books of God upon the tongues of His messengers are the kohl by which the lights of insight are attained, and the prophets are the appliers of kohl. They came calling to pure Oneness, its translation being the statement "There is no god but God," its meaning that nothing is seen but the One True Reality. Those who reach the perfection of Oneness are the fewest, and the deniers and polytheists are also few, being at the farthest extreme opposite the extreme of Oneness, for the idol-worshippers said, "We worship them only that they may bring us nearer to God in proximity," thus being within the first gates of Oneness, albeit with a weak entry. The intermediate are the majority. Among them are those whose inner sight opens in some states, so the realities of Oneness flash to them, but like a fleeting lightning bolt, it does not remain. Among them are those to whom it flashes and remains for a time, but does not endure, and endurance therein is rare: "For every seeker of the heights are movements, but rare among men is steadfastness."

When God Almighty commanded His Prophet to seek nearness, and it was said to him, "Prostrate and draw near," he said in his prostration: "I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment, and I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your displeasure, and I seek refuge in You from You. I cannot enumerate praise of You; You are as You have praised Yourself." His statement, "I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment," is speech arising from witnessing only God's acts, as if he saw nothing but God and His acts, so he sought refuge in His act from His act. Then he drew nearer and was annihilated from witnessing the acts, ascending to the sources of the acts, which are the attributes, and said: "I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your displeasure"—these being two attributes. Then he saw that as a deficiency in Oneness, so he drew nearer and ascended from the station of witnessing the attributes to witnessing the Essence, saying: "And I seek refuge in You from You." This is fleeing from Him to Him, without seeing act or attribute. But he saw himself fleeing from Him to Him, seeking refuge and praising, so he was annihilated from witnessing himself, seeing that as a deficiency, and drew nearer, saying: "I cannot enumerate praise of You; You are as You have praised Yourself." His statement, "I cannot enumerate," is a report of the annihilation of his self and emergence from witnessing it. His statement, "You are as You have praised Yourself," clarifies that He is the One praised and the One upon whom praise is bestowed, that all begins from Him and to Him returns, and that "Everything will perish except His Countenance." Thus, his first station was the ultimate station of the affirmers of Oneness, which is to see nothing but God Almighty and His acts, seeking refuge in one act from another. Consider then to what his ultimate end concluded, for it concluded with the One True Reality until there rose from his sight and witnessing anything besides the True Essence. He would not ascend from one rank to another without seeing the former as distant in comparison to the latter, so he would seek God's forgiveness for the former, seeing it as a deficiency in his journey and a shortcoming in his station. To this is the allusion in his saying: "Indeed, a veil comes over my heart until I seek God's forgiveness seventy times a day and night." This was for ascension through seventy stations, some above others; the first, even though it surpassed the furthest limits of creation, was a deficiency in comparison to the last, so his seeking forgiveness was for that. When Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said, "Has God not forgiven you your past and future sins? What is this weeping in prostration and this intense striving?" He said, "Should I not be a thankful servant?" meaning, "Should I not be a seeker of increase in stations?" For thankfulness is a cause of increase, as God Almighty said: "If you are grateful, I will surely increase you." If we delve into the oceans of unveiling, let us rein in the reins and return to what befits the sciences of spiritual conduct. We say: The prophets...

Upon them be peace, they were sent to call to the truth of perfect divine unity as we have described. However, between them and the attainment of it lies a great distance and formidable obstacles. The entirety of the Sacred Law is but a definition of the path for traversing that distance and overcoming those obstacles. At that point, perception arises from another witnessing and another station. In that station, in addition to that witnessing, gratitude, the grateful one, and the One thanked become manifest. This can only be known by an example. I say: You can understand that if a king sent to a servant who was far from him a mount, a garment, and provisions for the journey, so that by them he might traverse the distance of separation and draw near to the king's presence, then there are two possibilities for the servant. The first is that the king's purpose in the servant reaching his presence is for him to perform some of his important tasks and to have a share in serving him. The second is that the king has no personal interest in the servant, nor any need of him. Rather, his presence adds nothing to his kingdom, for he is incapable of performing a service that would benefit him in any meaningful way, and his absence detracts nothing from his kingdom. Thus, the purpose of bestowing the mount and provisions upon him is so that the servant may attain the blessing of proximity to him and obtain the felicity of his presence, for the servant's own benefit, not for the king to benefit from him or his service. The station of the servants with God, Exalted is He, is the second station, not the first, for the first is impossible for God, Exalted is He, and the second is not impossible. Know then that the servant in the first scenario is not grateful merely by riding and arriving at his presence, unless he performs the service the king desired from him. As for the second scenario, he has no need for service at all. Yet, it is conceivable that he could be either grateful or ungrateful. His gratitude would be by using what his Master has sent to him for what He loves, for His sake, not for his own sake. His ingratitude would be by not using it for that purpose, either by neglecting it or by using it in a way that increases his distance from Him. Whenever the servant wears the garment, rides the steed, and spends the provisions only on the path, he has shown gratitude to his Master, for he has used His favor in what He loves—that is, in what He loves for His servant, not for Himself. If he rides it and turns his back on His presence, moving away from Him, he has been ungrateful for His favor—that is, he has used it in what his Master dislikes for His servant, not for Himself. If he sits and does not ride, neither seeking proximity nor seeking distance, he has also been ungrateful for His favor by neglecting and wasting it, though this is less severe than actively distancing himself. Similarly, God, Glorified is He, created creation, and they, in the beginning of their primordial nature, need to use their appetites to perfect their bodies, yet by them they distance themselves from His presence. Their felicity lies in proximity to Him. So He has prepared for them from His favors that which they can use to attain the degree of proximity. Concerning their distance and proximity, God, Exalted is He, has said: "We have certainly created man in the best of stature; then We return him to the lowest of the low, except for those who believe" (Quran 95:4-6). Therefore, the favors of God, Exalted is He, are instruments by which the servant ascends from the lowest of the low. God, Exalted is He, created them for the sake of the servant so that he may attain by them the felicity of proximity. God, Exalted is He, is independent of him, whether near or far. The servant, regarding these favors, is either to use them in obedience, thus being grateful by conforming to what his Master loves, or to use them in disobedience, thus being ungrateful by plunging into what his Master dislikes and does not approve for him, for God does not approve disbelief and disobedience for His servants. If he neglects them and does not use them in either obedience or disobedience, that too is ingratitude—ingratitude for the favor through waste. Everything created in this world was created as an instrument for the servant so that he may attain through it the felicity of the Hereafter and the attainment of proximity to God, Exalted is He. Thus, every obedient person is, to the extent of his obedience, grateful for God's favor in the means he used for obedience. Every slothful person who abandoned their use, or every disobedient person who used them on the path of distance, is ungrateful, straying outside the love of God, Exalted is He. Disobedience and obedience are both encompassed by the Divine Will, but they are not both encompassed by Divine Love and Dislike. For a willed thing may be beloved, and a willed thing may be disliked. Beyond the clarification of this subtle point lies the secret of Divine Decree, which has been prohibited from being divulged. By this, the first difficulty is resolved—namely, if the One thanked has no personal interest, how can there be gratitude? By this, the second is also resolved, for we intended by gratitude nothing other than the channeling of God's favor in the direction of God's love. When the favor is channeled in the direction of love by God's act, the purpose is achieved. Your action is a gift from God, Exalted is He, and from your perspective as its locus, He has praised you, and His praise is another favor from Him to you. Thus, He is the One who gives and He is the One who praises. One of His acts becomes a cause for the channeling of His second act toward the direction of His love. So to Him belongs gratitude in every circumstance, and you are described as being grateful in the sense that you are the locus of the meaning which gratitude expresses, not in the sense that you are its necessitating cause—just as you are described as being knowing and learned, not in the sense that you are the creator or originator of knowledge, but rather...

In meaning, you are a locus for Him, and He has found through the eternal power in you, so describing you as being grateful affirms a thingness for you. And you are a thing since the Creator of things made you a thing. Yet you are truly nothing if you suppose yourself to be something from your own essence. As for considering the view toward Him who made things into things, you are a thing since He made you a thing. But if the view is cut off from His making, you are nothing in reality. To this He, peace be upon him, alluded when he said: “Work, for everyone is facilitated for what he was created for.” This was when it was said to him, O Messenger of God, “Then why work if things have already been concluded beforehand?” Thus it became clear that creation are the courses of God’s power, exalted is He, and the loci of His acts—even though they themselves are also from His acts—but some of His acts are the locus for others. And His saying “Work,” even though it proceeds upon the tongue of the Messenger, peace be upon him, is an act from His acts, and it is a cause for the creation’s knowing that work is beneficial. And their knowing is an act from the acts of God, exalted is He, and knowledge is a cause for the arising of a decisive motive toward movement and obedience. And the arising of the motive is also from the acts of God, exalted is He, and it is a cause for the movement of the limbs, which are also from the acts of God, exalted is He. But some of His acts are a cause for others—that is, the first is a condition for the second, just as creating the body was a cause for creating the accident, since the accident is not created before it; and creating life is a condition for creating knowledge; and creating knowledge is a condition for creating will; and all are from the acts of God, exalted is He, and some are a cause for others. That is, it is a condition, and the meaning of its being a condition is that nothing is prepared to receive the act of life except a substance; and nothing is prepared to receive knowledge except one possessing life; and nothing is prepared to receive will except one possessing knowledge. Thus some of His acts are a cause for others in this sense—not in the sense that some of His acts bring others into existence, but rather that they prepare the condition for the occurrence of others. And when this is realized, one ascends to the degree of unification that we have mentioned.

If you say: Then why did God, exalted is He, say “Work, otherwise you will be punished, blamed for disobedience,” when nothing is up to us? How can we be blamed when everything belongs to God, exalted is He? Know that this statement from God, exalted is He, is a cause for the attainment of a belief within us, and belief is a cause for the stirring of fear, and the stirring of fear is a cause for abandoning desires and turning away from the abode of delusion, and that is a cause for arriving at the proximity of God. And God, exalted is He, is the Causer of causes and their Arranger. So for whom happiness was decreed in eternity, He facilitates these causes for him until they lead him by their chain to Paradise. And its like is expressed by “everyone is facilitated for what he was created for.” And for whom the good was not decreed by God, he is kept from hearing the speech of God, exalted is He, and the speech of His Messenger, peace be upon him, and the speech of the scholars. So if he does not hear, he does not know; and if he does not know, he does not fear; and if he does not fear, he does not abandon reliance on this world; and if he does not abandon reliance on this world, he remains in the party of Satan—and indeed Hell is their promised place, all together. So when you know this, you will marvel at a people who are led to Paradise by chains. There is no one except that he is led to Paradise by the chains of causes, which is the imposition of knowledge and fear upon him. And there is no forsaken one except that he is led to the Fire by chains, which is the imposition of heedlessness, false security, and delusion upon him. Thus the God-fearing are driven to Paradise by compulsion, and the criminals are dragged to the Fire by compulsion. And there is no compeller except God, the One, the Subduer; and there is no powerful one except the Sovereign, the Compeller. And when the veil is lifted from the eyes of the heedless and they witness the matter as such, they will then hear the call of the caller: “To whom belongs the dominion this Day? To God, the One, the Subduer.” And indeed the dominion belonged to God, the One, the Subduer, every day—not that day in particular—but the heedless do not hear this call except on that Day. So it is news of what is newly revealed to the heedless from the uncovering of states, when the uncovering will not benefit them. So we seek refuge with God, the Forbearing, the Generous, from ignorance and blindness, for it is the root of the causes of perdition.

(Clarification of Distinguishing What God Loves from What He Hates)

Know that the act of thankfulness and the abandonment of ingratitude are not complete except by knowing what God, exalted is He, loves from what He hates. For the meaning of thankfulness is using His blessings, exalted is He, in what He loves, and the meaning of ingratitude is the opposite of that—either by abandoning their use or by using them in what He hates. And for distinguishing what God, exalted is He, loves from what He hates, there are two means of perception: one is hearing, whose basis is the verses and reports. The second is the insight of the heart, which is looking with the eye of consideration. This latter is difficult and, because of that, rare. Therefore, God, exalted is He, sent the messengers and made the path easy for creation through them. And knowing this is built upon knowing all the rulings of the Sacred Law regarding the acts of the servants. So whoever does not become acquainted with the rulings of the Sacred Law in all his actions cannot possibly fulfill the right of thankfulness at all. As for the second, which is looking with the eye of consideration, it is perceiving the wisdom of God, exalted is He, in every existent He created, for He did not create anything in the world except that there is wisdom in it, and beneath the wisdom...

The intended purpose is the beloved, and that wisdom is divided into manifest and hidden. As for the manifest, such as knowing that the wisdom in creating the sun is to achieve through it the distinction between night and day, so that day becomes a livelihood and night a garment, thus facilitating movement during visibility and rest during concealment. This is among the wisdoms of the sun, not all of its wisdoms, for it contains many other subtle wisdoms. Likewise, knowing the wisdom in clouds and the descent of rain, which is for the earth to split with various plants as sustenance for creation and pasture for cattle. The Qur'an encompasses a totality of magnificent wisdoms that the understandings of creation can bear, not the subtle ones they fall short of comprehending, as God Almighty said: "We poured down water in torrents, then We split the earth asunder, and caused to grow therein grain, and grapes" (Qur'an 80:25-28). As for the wisdom in all the celestial bodies, both the wandering planets and the fixed stars, it is hidden, not disclosed to all of creation. The extent that the understanding of creation can bear is that they are an adornment for the heaven so that the eye may delight in gazing upon them, as indicated by His saying, Almighty: "We have adorned the lowest heaven with the adornment of the stars" (Qur'an 37:6). Thus, all parts of the world—its heaven, stars, winds, seas, mountains, minerals, plants, animals, and the limbs of animals—not a single atom among its atoms is devoid of many wisdoms, from one to ten to a thousand to ten thousand. Similarly, the limbs of an animal are divided, except for what is known of their wisdom, such as knowing that the eye is for sight, not for striking; the hand for striking, not for walking; and the foot for walking, not for smelling. As for the internal organs—the intestines, gallbladder, liver, kidney, individual veins, nerves, muscles, and what they contain of cavities, convolutions, intertwinings, deviations, fineness, thickness, and all other attributes—their wisdom is not known by most people. Those who know them know only a small amount in comparison to what is in the knowledge of God Almighty: "You have been given but little knowledge" (Qur'an 17:85). Therefore, whoever uses something in a direction other than the one for which it was created, and not in the manner intended for it, has indeed been ungrateful for the blessing of God Almighty. Thus, whoever strikes another with his hand has been ungrateful for the blessing of the hand, for the hand was created for him to repel with it what would destroy him and to take what benefits him, not to destroy another with it. And whoever looks at a face that is not forbidden has been ungrateful for the blessing of the eye and the blessing of the sun, for sight is accomplished through them, and they were created only to see with them what benefits him in his religion and his worldly life and to guard with them against what harms him in both. He has used them for other than what was intended. This is because the purpose of creating creation and creating the world and its means is for creation to be aided by them in attaining God Almighty, and there is no attainment of Him except through love of Him and intimacy with Him in this world, and turning away from the deception of the world. There is no intimacy except through constant remembrance, and no love except through the knowledge attained through constant reflection. Constant remembrance and reflection are not possible except through the permanence of the body, and the body does not remain except through nourishment, and nourishment is not complete except through the earth, water, and air, and that is not complete except through the creation of the heaven and the earth and the creation of all limbs, external and internal. All of that is for the sake of the body, and the body is the mount of the soul, and what returns to God Almighty is the soul at peace through prolonged worship and knowledge. Therefore, God Almighty said: "I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I seek no provision from them" (Qur'an 51:56-57). Thus, whoever uses something in other than obedience to God has been ungrateful for the blessing of God in all the necessary means that enabled him to commit that disobedience. To mention a single example of the hidden wisdoms that are not in the utmost concealment, so that you may reflect upon it and know the way of gratitude and ingratitude for blessings, we say: Among the blessings of God Almighty is the creation of dirhams and dinars, through which the world is sustained. They are two stones with no inherent benefit in their essences, but creation is compelled to them because every person is in need of many tangible things for his food, clothing, and all his needs. He may be incapable of obtaining what he needs while possessing what he can do without, such as one who possesses saffron, for example, while needing a camel to ride, and one who possesses a camel may have no need for it but needs saffron. An exchange between them is necessary, and a valuation of the equivalent is necessary, for the owner of the camel will not give his camel for any amount of saffron, and there is no correlation between saffron and a camel such that one could say to give its equivalent in weight or form. Likewise, one who buys a house with clothes, or a slave with a shoe, or flour with a donkey—these things are not commensurate, so one does not know how much the camel is worth in saffron, making transactions extremely difficult. These disparate, distant tangible things thus required an intermediary.

Between them, He judges with a just ruling, so that from each one his rank and station become known. When the stations are established and the ranks are ordered, then the equivalent is distinguished from the non-equivalent. Thus, Allah the Exalted created dinars and dirhams as arbiters and intermediaries among all forms of wealth, so that properties may be valued by them. It is said: this camel is worth a hundred dinars, and this amount of saffron is worth a hundred. Thus, from the perspective that they are equivalent to one thing, they are equal. Adjustment through the two currencies is possible precisely because there is no inherent desire for their specific forms. If there were desire for their forms, that particular desire might necessitate preference for the one who has that desire, but not for one who has no such desire, and order would not be maintained. Therefore, Allah the Exalted created them to circulate among hands and to be just arbiters between properties, and for another wisdom: to serve as a means to all other things, because they are precious in themselves yet no desire lies in their specific forms, and their relation to all conditions is uniform. Thus, whoever possesses them is as if he possesses everything, unlike one who owns a garment, for he owns only the garment. If he needs food, the owner of the food may not desire the garment, because his desire may be for a mount, for instance. Thus, something is needed which in its form is as if nothing, yet in its meaning is as if all things. A thing’s relation to different matters is equal only when it has no specific form that it confers uniquely—like a mirror that has no color yet reflects every color. Similarly, currency has no inherent desire and is a means to every desire; like a particle that has no meaning in itself yet through it meanings appear in others. This is the second wisdom. In them also lies wisdom too lengthy to mention. So whoever uses them in a manner unbefitting their purpose, indeed opposing the intended aim of their creation, has shown ingratitude for Allah’s blessing in them. Thus, whoever hoards them has wronged them and nullified the wisdom in them, and is like one who imprisons the judge of the Muslims in a prison, preventing him from judging thereby. For by hoarding, he wastes the judgment and the intended purpose is not achieved. Dirhams and dinars were not created for Zayd specifically nor for ‘Amr specifically, since individuals have no desire for their specific forms—they are but stones. Rather, they were created to circulate among hands, so that they may be arbiters among people and a measure for knowing quantities, evaluating the fixed. So Allah the Exalted informed those incapable of reading the divine lines written on the pages of existence in a divine script without letter or sound—which is perceived not with the eye of sight but with the eye of insight—He informed these incapable ones through words they heard from His Messenger (peace be upon him), conveyed to them via letter and sound, the meaning they were unable to grasp. Thus He said: “And those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah—give them tidings of a painful punishment.” And whoever makes from dirhams and dinars vessels of gold or silver has shown ingratitude for the blessing and is in a worse state than the hoarder, for this is like one who employs the judge of the land in weaving, tax-collecting, and tasks performed by the lowly among people. Imprisonment is more trivial than that, for pottery, iron, lead, and copper can substitute for gold and silver in containing liquids from spilling; vessels are for preserving liquids, and pottery and iron suffice for the purpose intended for them, but not for the purpose intended for currency. Whoever does not perceive this will perceive it through the divine translation, and it is said to him: “Whoever drinks from a vessel of gold or silver, it is as if he is swallowing the fire of Hell into his belly.” And whoever engages in usurious transactions with dirhams and dinars has shown ingratitude for the blessing and committed wrong, for they were created for other things, not for themselves, since there is no desire in their specific forms. So if one trades in their specific forms, he has taken them as an end contrary to the wisdom of their creation, for seeking currency for other than what it was created for is wrong. He who has a garment but no currency may not be able to buy food or a mount with it, for perhaps food and mounts are not sold for garments. He is excused in selling it for another currency to obtain currency, through which he may attain his aim, for they are means to other things, with no desire in their specific forms. Their position among properties is like the position of particles in speech, as grammarians say: the particle is that which comes for a meaning in something else; and like the position of a mirror among colors. As for one who has currency, if it were permissible for him to sell it for currency and make dealing in currency the ultimate goal of his work, then currency would remain bound with him and assume the status of hoarded wealth. Restricting the judge and the courier who delivers to others is wrong, just as imprisoning him is wrong. Thus, there is no meaning in selling currency for currency except taking currency as an object for hoarding, and that is wrong.

If you say: Why then is it permitted to sell one of the two currencies for the other, and why is it permitted to sell a dirham for its like? Know that...

One of the two currencies contradicts the other in the aim of facilitation, for it may be possible to facilitate with one of them due to its abundance, like dirhams that are dispersed for needs little by little, so prohibiting it disrupts its specific purpose, which is the ease of using it to obtain other things. As for selling a dirham for an identical dirham, it is permissible because no rational person desires it when they are equal, nor does a merchant engage in it, for it is frivolous, akin to placing a dirham on the ground and picking up the same one. We do not fear that rational people would spend their time placing a dirham on the ground and picking up the same one, so we do not prohibit what souls have no inclination toward, unless one is of better quality than the other, which is also inconceivable to occur, since the owner of the good one would not accept its like from the inferior, so the contract would not be valid. If an increase in the inferior is sought, that is something that may be intended, so we rightly prohibit it and rule that its good and bad are equal, because quality and inferiority should be considered in what is intended in its essence, and what has no purpose in its essence should only be considered for subtle additions in its attributes. The one who wronged is the one who struck coins differing in quality and inferiority until they became intended for their essences, while their right is not to be intended. As for selling a dirham for an identical dirham on credit, it is not permitted because only one who is indulgent, intending kindness in a loan, would proceed with this, and it is a virtue that can be dispensed with, so that the form of indulgence remains and he receives praise and reward. In exchange, there is no praise or reward, so it is also wrong because it wastes the particularity of indulgence and brings it into the arena of opposition. Likewise, foods were created to be nourished by or treated with, so they should not be diverted from their purpose, for opening the door of transaction in them necessitates their restriction in hands and delays the eating for which they were intended. God did not create food except to be eaten, and the need for food is intense, so it should pass from the hand of one who has no need to the one in need, and transactions should not be made over food except by one who has no need for it. For whoever has food, why does he not eat it if he is in need, and why does he not make it a commodity for trade? If he makes it a commodity for trade, let him sell it to one who seeks it for a compensation other than food, which he needs. As for one who seeks it for the same food, he also has no need for it, and for this reason, the law has cursed the hoarder and included the strictures we mentioned in the Book of the Etiquettes of Earning. Indeed, the seller of wheat for dates is excused because one does not substitute for the other in purpose, but the seller of a measure of wheat for an identical measure of it is not excused, yet he is frivolous and does not need prohibition because souls do not permit it except when there is disparity in quality, and matching the good with its like from the inferior is not accepted by the owner of the good. As for good for two inferior, it may be intended, but since foods are necessities and the good equals the inferior in the core benefit and differs in aspects of enjoyment, the law disregarded the aim of enjoyment in what is the sustenance. This is the ruling of the law in prohibiting usury, and this has become clear to us after turning away from the art of jurisprudence, so let us attach this to the art of legal rulings, for it is more comprehensive than all we presented in matters of disagreement. By this, the preeminence of Imam al-Shafi'i's school—may God have mercy on him—in specifying foods over measurable items becomes clear, for if plaster were included, then cloth and animals would be more deserving of inclusion. Were it not for salt, the school of Imam Malik—may God have mercy on him—would be the most upright of schools in it, as he specified it for times, but every meaning upheld by the law must be defined by a limit, and defining this was possible with sustenance and possible with what is eaten, so the law saw the definition by the genus of what is eaten as more fitting for all that is essential for survival. The definitions of the law may encompass aspects where the original meaning motivating the ruling is not strong, but the definition occurs thus out of necessity, and if it were not defined, creation would be perplexed in following the essence of the meaning with its variation according to circumstances and individuals, for the exact meaning in its full strength varies with circumstances and individuals, so the limit is necessary. Therefore, God Almighty said: "And whoever transgresses the limits of God has wronged himself." Because the foundations of these meanings do not differ among the laws, but they differ in aspects of definition, as the law of Jesus son of Mary—peace be upon him—defined the prohibition of wine by intoxication, while our law defined it by being of the intoxicating genus, because a little of it leads to much, and what falls within the limits falls within prohibition by the ruling of the genus, just as the original meaning entered through the foundational whole. This is one example of its hidden ruling from the ruling of the two currencies, so gratitude for blessings and ingratitude should be considered by this example. Everything created for a wisdom should be directed toward it, and none knows this except one who has known.

Wisdom—"To whomsoever wisdom is granted, he has been granted abundant good"—yet the jewels of divine judgment do not alight in hearts that are dunghills of desires and playgrounds of devils. Rather, only the possessors of understanding take heed. Therefore, He, exalted is He, said: "Were it not that the devils hover around the hearts of the children of Adam, they would gaze upon the kingdom of the heavens." Once you comprehend this example, apply it to your every movement and stillness, your speech and silence, and every action issuing from you, for it is either gratitude or ingratitude, as it is inconceivable to be free from these two. Some of this is termed in the language of jurisprudence, which the common folk speak of, as "disliked," and some as "perilous," yet all of it is described by the people of hearts as perilous.

I say, for example: if you cleanse yourself with the right hand, you have shown ingratitude for the blessing of the hands, for God created for you two hands and made one stronger than the other, so the stronger, due to its preponderance in most matters, deserves honor and preference. To prefer the deficient is a deviation from justice, and God does not command justice then constrain you—He who gave you the hands—to tasks, some noble like taking the Quran, and some base like removing filth. If you take the Quran with the left and remove filth with the right, you have assigned the noble to what is base, thus diminishing its right, wronging it, and deviating from justice. Likewise, if you spit, for instance, toward the direction of prayer or face it while relieving yourself, you have shown ingratitude for the blessing of God, exalted is He, in creating directions and the expanse of the world, for He created directions to be your space in movement and divided them into what He did not ennoble and what He ennobled by placing therein a House, attributing it to Himself to attract your heart toward it, so that your heart may be bound to it, and thereby your body constrained in that direction with composure and dignity when you worship your Lord. Similarly, your actions are divided into what is noble, like acts of obedience, and what is base, like relieving oneself and spitting. If you cast your spittle toward the direction of prayer, you have wronged it and shown ingratitude for the blessing of God, exalted is He, in establishing the qibla, through which the perfection of your worship is achieved.

Likewise, if you put on your shoe beginning with the left, you have wronged, for the shoe is a protection for the foot, so the foot has a share in it, and precedence in shares ought to be given to the more noble—that is justice and fulfillment of wisdom. Its opposite is injustice and ingratitude for the blessing of the shoe and the foot. This, in the view of the knowers, is a major sin, even if the jurist terms it disliked. Indeed, one of them had gathered a measure of wheat and was giving it in charity; when asked about the reason, he said: "I put on my shoes once and began with the left foot by mistake, so I wished to atone for it with charity." Indeed, the jurist cannot magnify the matter in these affairs, for he is constrained by reforming the common folk, whose rank is close to the rank of blessing, and they are immersed in darknesses too vast and immense for such darknesses to appear in comparison. Thus, it is ugly to say that one who drank wine and took the cup with his left hand has transgressed in two aspects: one is the drinking, and the other is taking with the left. And one who sells wine at the time of the call to prayer on Friday—it is ugly to say he betrayed in two aspects: one is selling wine, and the other is selling at the time of the call. And one who relieves himself in the mosque's prayer niche, turning his back to the qibla—it is ugly to mention his lack of etiquette in relieving himself from the aspect that he did not place the qibla to his right. All sins are darknesses, some above others, so some are obscured beside others. A master may punish his servant if he uses his knife without permission, but if he killed with that knife his dearest child, the ruling for using the knife without permission would remain, yet its sting in himself would not. All the etiquettes observed by the prophets and the saints, which we are lenient about in jurisprudence with the common folk, are due to this necessity; otherwise, all these disliked matters are deviations from justice and ingratitude for blessings, and a shortfall from the degree that conveys the servant to the degrees of nearness. Some affect the servant by diminishing nearness and lowering his station, and some remove him entirely from the bounds of nearness to the realm of distance, which is the abode of devils.

Likewise, one who breaks a branch from a tree without an immediate, pressing need or a sound, legitimate purpose has shown ingratitude for the blessing of God, exalted is He, in creating trees and creating the hand. As for the hand, it was not created for frivolity but for obedience and acts that aid in obedience. As for the tree, God, exalted is He, created it and created roots for it, conveyed water to it, and placed within it the power of nourishment and growth so that it may reach the peak of its vigor and His servants benefit from it. To break it before the peak of its vigor, not in a manner that benefits His servants, is contrary to the aim of wisdom and a deviation from justice. If one has a sound, legitimate purpose, then it is permissible, for trees and animals are made as ransom for human purposes, as both are perishable, vanishing. To expend the lower for the preservation of the higher for a time is closer to justice than wasting both.

All together, and to this the verse of God Almighty alludes: "And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, all together from Him." Indeed, if someone were to break that from the dominion of another, he would also be an oppressor, even if he were in need, because each specific tree does not fulfill the needs of all God's servants; rather, it fulfills only one need. And if one person were to appropriate it for himself without any prior claim or specific right, it would be oppression. The one with the specific right is he who obtained the seed, placed it in the earth, channeled water to it, and undertook its care; he is more entitled to it than others, and his claim is thereby established. If that tree grew in barren land without human effort, the right belongs to the one who planted it or to the one who sowed it. Another specific right must then be sought, which is precedence in taking it, for the one who precedes has the particularity of precedence. Justice is that he be the most entitled to it. The poor have expressed this precedence as ownership, but this is purely metaphorical, for there is no ownership except for the King of Kings, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. How can a servant be an owner when he himself does not own his own self, but is rather owned by another? Indeed, creation are the servants of God, and the earth is God's table. He has permitted them to eat from His table according to their need, like a king who sets a table for his servants. If one takes a morsel with his right hand and encloses it within his fingers, and then another servant comes and wants to snatch it from his hand, he cannot be allowed to do so—not because the morsel has become his property by taking it in hand, for the hand and its owner are also owned—but because each specific morsel does not fulfill the need of every servant. Justice in specification occurs when a kind of precedence, specific right, and taking arises—a right specific to the servant—and thus one who cannot establish such a specific right is prevented from contending with him. This is how God's command concerning His servants should be understood. Therefore, we say: Whoever takes from the worldly wealth more than his need, hoards it, and withholds it while among God's servants are those who need it, he is an oppressor and is among those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of God. The way of God is obedience to Him, and the provision for creation in His obedience is worldly wealth, for through it their necessities are repelled and their needs are elevated. However, this does not enter into the scope of legal rulings, because the measures of needs are hidden, souls differ in their perception of future poverty, and the ends of lifespans are unknown. To impose this upon the common people would be like imposing dignity, gravity, and silence about unimportant speech upon children; due to their deficiency, they cannot bear it. Thus, we refrain from objecting to them in play and amusement, and our permitting that to them does not indicate that amusement and play are inherently right. Similarly, our permitting the common people to preserve wealth and restrict their spending to the amount of zakah, due to the miserliness ingrained in their nature, does not indicate that it is the ultimate truth. The Qur'an alluded to this when God Almighty said: "If He were to ask you for it and press you, you would withhold." Rather, the unblemished truth and the justice devoid of oppression is that none of God's servants should take from God's wealth except the amount of a traveler's provision, for all God's servants are riders upon the mounts of their bodies to the presence of the Just King. So whoever takes more than that and then withholds it from another rider in need of it is an oppressor, abandoning justice, departing from the intended wisdom, and ungrateful for the favor of God Almighty upon him through the Qur'an, the Messenger, intellect, and all the means by which he knows that whatever exceeds a traveler's provision is a burden upon him in this world and the next. Whoever understands the wisdom of God Almighty in all types of existent things is able to fulfill the duty of gratitude. Exhausting this subject would require volumes, and even then it would only cover a little. We have mentioned this amount only so that the reason for the truthfulness in God Almighty's saying may be known: "And few of My servants are grateful." And Iblis, may God curse him, rejoiced in His saying: "And you will not find most of them grateful." One who does not know the meaning of all this and other matters beyond it—whose principles lifetimes would end before exhausting—does not know the meaning of this verse. As for the explanation of the verse and the meaning of its wording, anyone who knows the language knows it. By this, the difference between meaning and explanation becomes clear to you.

If you say: The essence of this discourse returns to the fact that God Almighty is the Judge in everything, and that He has made some actions of the servants a cause for the perfection of wisdom and its reaching its intended purpose, and He has made some of their actions a preventer of the perfection of wisdom. Thus, every action that conforms to the requirement of wisdom, so that wisdom flows to its purpose, is gratitude; and everything that opposes and prevents the causes from flowing to their intended purpose is ingratitude. All this is understood, but the difficulty remains: The action of the servant, divided into what completes wisdom and what removes it, is also from the action of God Almighty. So where is the servant in between, such that he is grateful at one time and ungrateful at another? Know that the completion of certainty in this is drawn from the current...

A vast ocean of unveiling sciences, to whose principles we have previously alluded with subtle hints. Now we express in brief words its ultimate end and goal, which is understood by one who knows the language of the birds, and denied by one who is incapable of even setting out on the journey, let alone soaring in the realm of the Kingdom like the birds. So we say:

Allah, Mighty and Majestic is He, in His Majesty and Grandeur, has an Attribute from which creation and origination issue forth. That Attribute is too exalted and sublime for the eye of a language-coiner to perceive it, such that he could express it with a phrase indicating the essence of its Majesty and the specific reality of its truth. Thus, in the world, there exists no expression for it due to the loftiness of its station and the lowliness of the rank of language-coiners, whose understanding cannot extend to the beginnings of its radiance. Their sight falls short of its pinnacle, just as the sight of bats falls short of the light of the sun—not due to any obscurity in the sun's light, but due to weakness in the bats' sight.

Therefore, those whose eyes were opened to observe its Majesty were compelled to borrow, from the lowly world of those who articulate languages, a phrase that conveys from the beginnings of its realities something very feeble. So they borrowed for it the name "Power" (al-Qudrah). Due to their borrowing, we ventured to speak and said: Allah, Exalted is He, has an Attribute which is Power, from which creation and origination issue forth.

Then, creation divides in existence into divisions, each with specific attributes. The source of the division of these divisions and their specification with their particular attributes is another Attribute. For it, by a similar necessity as before, the expression "Will" (al-Mashiyyah) was borrowed. It suggests from it a meaning understood by those who articulate languages, which are letters and sounds used for mutual understanding. The inadequacy of the term "Will" to indicate the essence of that Attribute and its reality is like the inadequacy of the term "Power."

Then, the actions issuing from Power divided into that which proceeds to the ultimate end, which is the goal of its wisdom, and that which stops short of the goal. Each had a relation to the attribute of Will, since they refer back to the specificities by which the division and differences are completed. For the relation of that which reaches its goal, the expression "Love" (al-Mahabbah) was borrowed. For the relation of that which stops short of its goal, the expression "Dislike" (al-Karahah) was borrowed. It is said that both are included within the description of Will, but each has another specific characteristic in the relation, which the terms "Love" and "Dislike" suggest as a general meaning for those seeking understanding from words and languages.

Then, His servants—who are also from His creation and origination—divided into those for whom the Eternal Will preceded that He would use them to halt His wisdom short of its goal, and that would be a compulsion upon them by unleashing inclinations and motives upon them; and into those for whom it was pre-eternally decreed that He would use them to conduct His wisdom to its goal in some matters. Thus, each of the two groups had a specific relation to the Will. For the relation of those used to complete wisdom through them, the expression "Pleasure" (al-Rida) was borrowed. For those by whom the means of wisdom were halted short of its goal, the expression "Wrath" (al-Ghadab) was borrowed.

Thus, upon the one upon whom wrath was decreed pre-eternally appeared an action by which wisdom was halted short of its goal, so "Ingratitude" (al-Kufran) was borrowed for him, and that was followed by the punishment of curse and blame as an increase in retribution. And upon the one whom He was pleased with pre-eternally appeared an action by which wisdom, because of it, proceeded to its goal, so the expression "Gratitude" (al-Shukr) was borrowed for him, and it was followed by the robe of praise and commendation as an increase in pleasure, acceptance, and favor.

The result was that He, Exalted is He, bestowed beauty, then praised; and bestowed punishment, then deemed ugly and cast down. Its similitude is that a king cleans his dirty servant from his filth, then clothes him from the finest of his garments. When he completes his adornment, he says, "O beautiful one, how beautiful you are, and how beautiful your garments, and how clean your face!" In reality, He is the Beautifier and the One who praises the beauty. Thus, He is the One praised in every state. It is as if, from the perspective of meaning, He praised none but Himself, while the servant is the target of praise from the perspective of outward appearance and form.

Thus were the matters in pre-eternity, and thus do causes and effects proceed in sequence by the decree of the Lord of lords, the Originator of causes. This was not by chance or inquiry, but by a Will, Wisdom, true Judgment, and decisive Command, for which the term "Decree" (al-Qada') was borrowed. It is said it is like a glance of the eye, or closer, whence the seas of measures flowed by the ruling of that decisive Decree with what pre-eternal determination had ordained. Then, for the ordering of the individual destined things one upon another, the term "Divine Measure" (al-Qadar) was borrowed. Thus, the term "Decree" corresponds to the single, universal Command, and the term "Divine Measure" corresponds to the detailed, endless succession.

It is said that nothing of that is outside of Decree and Divine Measure. It occurred to some servants: "Why did the division necessitate this detail, and how is justice consistent with this disparity and preferential treatment?" Some of them, due to their incapacity, could not bear to observe the essence of this matter and encompass its totality. So they were restrained from what they could not fathom plunging into, by the bridle of prohibition, and it was said to them: "Be still, for..."

For this were you created. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. And the niche of some of them was filled with a light, kindled from the light of God, Most High, in the heavens and the earth. And their oil was, at first, pure, so that it would almost give light even if no fire touched it. Then a fire touched it, and it blazed with light upon light. So the regions of the dominion shone before them with the light of their Lord, and they perceived all matters as they truly are. Then it was said to them: "Adorn yourselves with the manners of God, Most High, and be at peace. And when Predestination is mentioned, be silent." For walls have ears, and around you are the weak of vision. So proceed at the pace of your weakest, and do not lift the veil of the sun for the eyes of bats, for that would be a cause of their destruction. Therefore, embody the character traits of God, Most High, and descend from the zenith of your ascent to the heaven of this world, so that the weak may find comfort in you and may kindle from the remnants of your shining lights from behind your veil, just as bats kindle from the remnants of the light of the sun and the stars in the darkness of night. Thus, they live by it a life that their person and state can bear, even if they do not live by it the life of those who move about in the full light of the sun.

And be like those of whom it was said:
"We drank a pure drink in the presence of the Pure,
Thus is the drink of the pure made pure.
We drank and poured upon the earth what remained,
And for the earth from the cup of the generous is a share."

Thus was the beginning of this affair and its end. You will not understand it unless you are worthy of it. And if you are worthy of it, the eye is opened and you see, so you have no need for a guide to lead you. The blind can be led, but only to a limit. When the path narrows and becomes sharper than a sword's edge and finer than a hair, the bird may be able to fly upon it, but it cannot drag a blind man behind it. And when the passage becomes subtle and fine, like water for example, and crossing is only possible by swimming, the one skilled in the art of swimming may be able to cross by himself, but perhaps he cannot pull another behind him. These are matters wherein the act of traversing them, compared to traversing what is the state of the commonality of creation, is like walking on water compared to walking on land. Swimming can be learned, but as for walking on water, it is not acquired by teaching; rather, it is attained by the strength of certainty. Therefore, it was said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "It is said that Jesus (peace be upon him) walked on water." He (peace be upon him) said, "Had he increased in certainty, he would have walked on air." These are symbols and allusions to the meaning of aversion and love, pleasure and anger, gratitude and ingratitude. It is not fitting for the science of spiritual transaction to exceed this. And God, Most High, has set forth a similitude for this, bringing it near to the understandings of creation, for He knew that He created the jinn and mankind only to worship Him. Thus, their worship is the ultimate wisdom in their regard. Then He informed that He has two servants: He loves one of them, whose name is Gabriel, the Spirit of Holiness, and the Trustworthy, and he is with Him beloved, obeyed, trustworthy, and firmly established. And He detests the other, whose name is Iblis, and he is the accursed, granted respite until the Day of Recompense. Then He attributed guidance to Gabriel, saying, Most High, "Say, 'The Spirit of Holiness has brought it down from your Lord in truth.'" And He, Most High, said, "He sends down the Spirit from His command upon whom He wills of His servants." And He attributed misguidance to Iblis, saying, Most High, "To lead astray from His path." And misguidance is preventing the servants from reaching the ultimate wisdom. So see how He attributed it to the servant upon whom He is angry. And guidance is His conveying them to the ultimate end, so see how He attributed it to the servant whom He loved.

You have a customary example for this: If a king needed someone to serve him drink and someone to perform cupping and clean the courtyard of his house from filth, and he had two servants, he would not appoint for the cupping and cleaning except the ugliest and basest of them. And he would not entrust the carrying of the drink and perfume except to the best, most perfect, and most beloved of them to him. And you should not say, "This is my doing, and was his action not without my doing?" For you have erred by attributing that to yourself. Rather, it is He who directed your motive for specifying the detested action with the detested person and the beloved action with the beloved person, in completion of justice. For His justice is sometimes completed through matters in which you have no part, and sometimes it is completed within you, for you too are from His actions. Thus, your motive, your power, your knowledge, your action, and all the causes of your movements in expression are His action, which He arranged with justice, an arrangement from which balanced actions proceed. However, you see only yourself, so you imagine that what appears upon you in the world of testimony has no cause from the world of the unseen and the dominion. Therefore, you attribute it to yourself. You are but like a child who looks at night at the play of the puppeteer, who brings out forms from behind a veil that dance, cry out, stand, and sit. They are composed of rags that do not move by themselves; rather, they are moved by fine, hair-like strings that do not appear in the darkness of the night, and their ends are in the hand of the puppeteer, who is concealed from the sight of the children. So they rejoice and marvel, thinking that those forms...

The foolish dance and play, rising and sitting, while the wise know that this is movement, yet not movement in itself. However, they may not know its detailed nature, and even one who knows some of its details does not know it as the illusionist knows, who has command over it and holds the strings in his hand. Similarly, the children of this world—indeed, all creation are like children compared to the learned—look upon these figures and suppose they are the ones moving, attributing the motion to them. The learned know they are being moved, yet they do not know the manner of the moving, and they are the majority, save for the knowers, the learned, and the firmly rooted. For they have perceived with the eyes of their insight fine, spider-web threads—nay, far finer—suspended from the heavens, their ends attached to the persons of the people of earth. Those threads are not perceived by these outward eyes due to their fineness. Then they witnessed the heads of those threads in their points of suspension, by which they are hung, and they witnessed for those points of suspension handles that are in the hands of the angels who move the heavens. They also witnessed the angels of the heavens directed toward the bearers of the Throne, awaiting from them what descends upon them of command from the presence of Lordship, so that they do not disobey God in what He commands them and they do as they are ordered. These visions are alluded to in the Qur’an, where it is said: "And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised." (51:22) And it alludes to the waiting of the angels of the heavens for what descends to them of decree and command, as it is said: "He created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof. The command descends between them, that you may know that God has power over all things and that God encompasses all things in knowledge." (65:12) These are matters whose interpretation none knows save God and those firmly rooted in knowledge. Ibn ‘Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, alluded to the exclusive possession by those firmly rooted in knowledge of sciences that the understandings of creation cannot bear when he recited the words of the Exalted: "The command descends between them," and said, "If I mentioned what I know of the meaning of this verse, you would stone me," and in another wording, "you would say he is an unbeliever." Let us confine ourselves to this measure, for the reins of speech have slipped from the grasp of choice and have mingled with the science of spiritual transaction what is not of it. Let us return to the purposes of gratitude.

We say: If the reality of gratitude reverts to the servant being an instrument in the completion of God’s wisdom, then the most grateful of servants are the most beloved to God and the closest to Him. The closest to God are the angels, and they too have an order; there is not one among them but that he has a known station. The highest of them in rank of proximity is an angel named Israfil, peace be upon him. The loftiness of their degree is because they are in themselves noble and righteous, and God has rectified the prophets, peace be upon them, through them. They are the noblest creation on the face of the earth. Next to their degree is the degree of the prophets, for they are in themselves excellent, and God has guided the rest of creation through them and completed His wisdom through them. The highest of them in rank is our Prophet, upon whom be peace, for through him God perfected the religion and sealed the prophets. Next to them are the learned who are the heirs of the prophets, for they are in themselves righteous, and God has rectified the rest of creation through them. The degree of each of them is according to what he has rectified of himself and of others. Then next to them are the just rulers, for they have rectified the worldly affairs of creation as the learned have rectified their religion. Due to the combination of religion, kingship, and authority for our Prophet Muhammad, upon whom be peace, he is superior to the rest of the prophets, for God perfected through him the rectification of their religion and their world, and the sword and kingship were not for other prophets. Then next to the learned and the rulers are the righteous who have rectified only their religion and their own souls, so the wisdom of God was not completed through them, but it is in them. Apart from these are the rabble and the common herd.

Know that the ruler is the mainstay of religion; he should not be belittled even if he is oppressive and sinful. ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, may God have mercy on him, said: "A tyrannical imam is better than lasting sedition." And the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: "There will come upon you rulers whom you will recognize and disapprove of, and they will cause corruption, yet God will bring about more good through them. If they do good, they have the reward and upon you is gratitude; and if they do evil, upon them is the burden and upon you is patience." Sahl said: "Whoever rejects his imam, the ruler, is a heretic; and whom the ruler calls and does not answer is an innovator; and who comes to him without being summoned is ignorant." He was asked, "Who are the best of people?" He said, "The ruler." It was said, "We used to think the worst of people was the ruler." He said, "Gently! Verily, God has for him every day two glances: a glance at the safety of the Muslims’ wealth and a glance at the safety of their bodies. Then He looks into his record and forgives him all his sin." And he used to say, "The black wooden beams hung at their doors are better than seventy preachers preaching."

(The Second Pillar of the Pillars of Gratitude: That Upon Which Gratitude is Rendered)
It is the blessing. Let us mention therein the reality of blessing, its divisions, its degrees, its kinds, and its aggregates in what is specific and general, for enumerating the blessings of God upon His servants is beyond the capacity of humankind, as He said...

Exalted is He: "And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them." Therefore, we shall first present comprehensive principles that serve as foundational laws for recognizing blessings, and then we will devote ourselves to enumerating them individually. And Allah is the Granter of success to what is correct.
                        (Clarifying the True Nature of Blessings and Their Categories)

Know that every good, pleasure, and happiness—indeed, every object of desire and pursuit—is termed a blessing. However, the blessing in its true reality is the happiness of the Hereafter. To call anything else a blessing or happiness is either an error or a metaphorical usage, like calling worldly happiness that does not aid in attaining the Hereafter a blessing, for that is pure error. The term 'blessing' may be applied to a thing truthfully, but its application to the happiness of the Hereafter is the most truthful. Thus, every cause that leads to and assists in attaining the happiness of the Hereafter, whether through a single means or multiple intermediaries, its designation as a blessing is correct and true, because it culminates in the true blessing. We shall explain the causes, aids, and pleasures termed blessings through classifications.

The First Classification: All matters, in relation to us, are divided into: 1) That which is beneficial in both this world and the Hereafter, such as knowledge and good character; 2) That which is harmful in both, such as ignorance and bad character; 3) That which is beneficial in the immediate situation but harmful in the ultimate outcome, such as indulging in following desires; 4) That which is harmful and painful in the immediate situation but beneficial in the ultimate outcome, such as suppressing desires and opposing the lower self. That which is beneficial in both the immediate and ultimate sense is truly a blessing, like knowledge and good character. That which is harmful in both is truly a calamity, being their opposite. That which is beneficial in the immediate situation but harmful in the ultimate outcome is, in the sight of the insightful, a pure calamity, though the ignorant deem it a blessing. Its example is a hungry person who finds honey containing poison; if ignorant, he considers it a blessing, but if he knows, he understands it is a calamity that has befallen him. That which is harmful in the immediate situation but beneficial in the ultimate outcome is a blessing in the sight of the wise, but a calamity to the ignorant. Its example is bitter-tasting medicine in the moment, yet it cures diseases and ailments and brings health and well-being. An ignorant child, if compelled to drink it, considers it a calamity, while the wise person considers it a blessing and feels indebted to whoever guides him to it, brings it near, and prepares its means. Therefore, a mother prevents her child from cupping, while the father calls him to it. For the father, due to his perfect intellect, perceives the consequence, while the mother, due to her excessive love and deficiency, focuses on the immediate situation. The child, due to his ignorance, feels indebted to his mother rather than his father, feels comfort with her and her compassion, and considers the father an enemy. If he were wise, he would know that the mother is a hidden enemy in the guise of a friend, for her preventing him from cupping leads him to diseases and pains more severe than cupping. However, an ignorant friend is worse than a wise enemy. Every person is a friend to himself, but he is an ignorant friend, and thus he does to himself what even an enemy would not do.

A Second Classification: Know that all worldly causes are mixed, their good blended with their evil, so their good is seldom pure, such as wealth, family, children, relatives, status, and all other means. However, they are divided into: 1) That whose benefit outweighs its harm, like a sufficient amount of wealth, status, and other means; 2) That whose harm outweighs its benefit for most people, like abundant wealth and extensive status; 3) That whose harm and benefit are equivalent. These matters differ according to individuals. For one righteous person may benefit from lawful wealth, even if abundant, by spending it in the way of Allah and directing it to good deeds; with such divine facilitation, it is a blessing for him. Another person may be harmed even by a little, constantly belittling it, complaining to his Lord, and seeking increase in it; with such divine abandonment, it is a calamity for him.

A Third Classification: Know that, from another perspective, good things are divided into: 1) That which is sought for its own sake, not for something else; 2) That which is sought for the sake of something else; 3) That which is sought for both its own sake and for something else. The first is what is sought for its own sake, not for something else, like the pleasure of gazing upon the Countenance of Allah, the Exalted, and the happiness of meeting Him—in sum, the everlasting happiness of the Hereafter. It is not sought to attain another intended goal beyond it; rather, it is sought for its own essence. The second is what is intended for something else, with no purpose in its essence at all, like dirhams and dinars. If needs were not fulfilled by them, they would be equivalent to pebbles. But because they are a means to pleasures, quickly delivering to them, they become beloved in themselves to the ignorant, so they hoard and treasure them, trade in usury over them, and think they are the intended goal. Their example is like one who loves a person, and because of him loves the messenger who brings them together, then forgets, in his love for the messenger, the love for the original person, turns away from him for his entire life, and remains preoccupied with tending to, observing, and checking on the messenger. This is the height of ignorance and misguidance. The third is what is sought for its own sake and for something else, like health and well-being. They are sought so that one may, because of them, be capable of the remembrance and reflection that lead to meeting Allah, the Exalted, or to attain through them...

To the attainment of worldly pleasures and the pursuit of their essence, for even if a person is independent of a thing for which a man's well-being is sought, he still desires the man's well-being insofar as it is well-being. Therefore, that which is chosen for its own sake alone is goodness and blessing in reality. That which is chosen for its own sake and for the sake of something else is also a blessing, but lesser than the first. As for that which is chosen only for the sake of something else, like the two currencies (gold and silver), they are not described in themselves, as they are substances, as being a blessing. Rather, from the perspective that they are means, they become a blessing for one who intends a matter he cannot attain except through them. If his objective were knowledge and worship, and he possessed the sufficiency which is a necessity for his life, gold and clay would be equal to him; their existence and non-existence would be of one level to him. Indeed, perhaps their existence might preoccupy him from reflection and worship, so they would be an affliction for him and not a blessing.

A fourth division: Know that goods, from another consideration, are divided into the beneficial, the pleasurable, and the beautiful. The pleasurable is that whose comfort is perceived immediately. The beneficial is that which yields benefit in the ultimate end. The beautiful is that which is deemed good in all circumstances. Evils are also divided into the harmful, the ugly, and the painful. Each of these two categories has two types: absolute and conditional. The absolute is that in which the three attributes are combined. In good, such as knowledge and wisdom, for they are beneficial, beautiful, and pleasurable to the people of knowledge and wisdom. In evil, such as ignorance, for it is harmful, ugly, and painful. The ignorant one only feels the pain of his ignorance when he knows he is ignorant, which is by seeing others as knowledgeable and seeing himself as ignorant, thus perceiving the pain of deficiency. Then a desire for the pleasurable knowledge arises within him. Yet, envy, pride, and bodily appetites may prevent him from learning, so two opposites pull at him, and his pain intensifies. For if he abandons learning, he suffers from ignorance and perceives deficiency. If he occupies himself with learning, he suffers from abandoning appetites or from abandoning pride and the humility of learning. Such a person remains inevitably in constant torment. The second type is the conditional, which combines some of these attributes but not others. Sometimes a thing is beneficial yet painful, like amputating a gangrenous finger or removing a tumor from the body. Sometimes a thing is beneficial yet ugly, like foolishness, for relative to some circumstances it is beneficial. It has been said, "He who has no intellect rests," for he is not concerned with consequences and thus finds rest in the present until the time of his destruction arrives. Sometimes a thing is beneficial from one aspect and harmful from another, like throwing wealth into the sea when fearing drowning, for it is harmful to the wealth but beneficial to the soul in its salvation. The beneficial is of two kinds: essential, like faith and good character in attaining the happiness of the Hereafter—and I mean by these knowledge and action, for nothing whatsoever can take their place—and non-essential, like oxymel for calming yellow bile, for it may also be possible to calm it with something that can take its place.

A fifth division: Know that "blessing" is expressed as every pleasurable thing. Pleasures, relative to man in terms of his exclusive possession of them or his sharing them with others, are of three types: intellectual, bodily shared with some animals, and bodily shared with all animals. As for the intellectual, such as the pleasure of knowledge and wisdom, for the ear, sight, smell, taste, the belly, and the private parts do not find pleasure in them. Only the heart finds pleasure in them due to a quality specific to it expressed as intellect. These are the least prevalent of pleasures and the most noble. As for their scarcity, it is because only a knowledgeable person finds pleasure in knowledge, and only a wise person finds pleasure in wisdom. How few are the people of knowledge and wisdom, and how many are those who merely bear their name and imitate their outward forms. As for their nobility, it is because they are inherent and never vanish, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter, and are perpetual without causing weariness. Food brings satiety, then weariness; the appetite for intercourse is spent, then becomes burdensome. Knowledge and wisdom can never be conceived to cause weariness or become burdensome. He who is capable of the noble, everlasting eternal, yet is content with the base, perishable in the nearest of times, is afflicted in his intellect, deprived due to his wretchedness and misfortune. The least of it is that knowledge and intellect do not need assistants and guards, unlike wealth, for knowledge guards you while you guard wealth. Knowledge increases through spending, while wealth decreases through spending. Wealth can be stolen, and authority can be removed, but knowledge cannot be reached by the hands of thieves for taking, nor by the hands of rulers for removal. Thus, its possessor is in a spirit of security forever, while the possessor of wealth and status is in the distress of fear forever. Furthermore, knowledge is beneficial, pleasurable, and beautiful in every state forever. Wealth, at times, pulls toward destruction and at times pulls toward salvation. Therefore, God Almighty censured wealth in the Quran in several places, though He called it good in other places. As for the failure of most of creation to perceive the pleasure of knowledge, it is either due to lack of taste, for he who has not tasted does not know and does not yearn, since...

Longing follows taste. As for those who fail to perceive it, it is either due to the corruption of their temperaments and the sickness of their hearts from following base desires, like a sick person who cannot perceive the sweetness of honey and finds it bitter; or due to a deficiency in their innate perception, for the quality by which knowledge is relished has not yet been created within them, like an infant who cannot perceive the delight of honey and fat birds and finds pleasure only in milk. This does not indicate that these things are not delightful, nor does the infant's enjoyment of milk prove it to be the most delightful of things. Thus, those deficient in perceiving the delight of knowledge and wisdom are of three kinds: one whose inner self has not yet come to life, like a child; one who died after having lived, by following base desires; and one who became sick due to following base desires. His statement, exalted is He, "in their hearts is a disease" (Qur'an 2:10) alludes to the sickness of intellects. And His statement, mighty and majestic, "that he may warn whoever is alive" (Qur'an 36:70) alludes to one who has not attained an inner life. Every being physically alive but dead in heart is among the dead in the sight of God, even if considered among the living by the ignorant. For this reason, the martyrs are alive with their Lord, receiving provision, rejoicing, even though they are dead in their bodies.

The second kind is a delight in which man shares with some animals, such as the delight of leadership, domination, and mastery. This exists in the lion, the tiger, and some animals. The third is what he shares with all other animals, such as the delight of the belly and the private parts. This is the most prevalent and the basest of them, which is why every class partakes in it, even worms and insects. Whoever transcends this rank becomes attached to the delight of domination, which is the most tenacious for the heedless. If he transcends that, he ascends to the third, and the delight that predominates over him becomes the delight of knowledge and wisdom, especially the delight of knowing God, exalted is He, and knowing His attributes and His acts. This is the rank of the truthful ones (al-siddiqin), and its perfection is not attained except by the expulsion of the love of leadership from the heart. The last thing to leave the heads of the truthful ones is the love of leadership. As for the greed of the belly and private parts, its breaking is something the righteous can achieve, but the desire for leadership, none can break except the truthful ones. As for suppressing it completely so that one does not feel it at all times and in varying states, this seems to be beyond human capability. Indeed, the delight of knowing God, exalted is He, overpowers in states where one does not feel the delight of leadership and domination, but this does not last a lifetime; rather, periods of lassitude befall it, and one returns to human attributes, so they exist but are subdued, unable to compel the soul to deviate from justice.

At this point, hearts are divided into four categories: a heart that loves nothing but God, exalted is He, and finds rest only in increasing knowledge of Him and contemplation of Him; a heart that knows not the delight of knowledge nor the meaning of intimacy with God, its delight being only in status, leadership, wealth, and other bodily desires; a heart whose predominant state is intimacy with God, glorified is He, and delight in knowing Him and contemplating Him, though it may occasionally revert to human attributes; and a heart whose predominant state is delight in human attributes, though it may occasionally experience delight in knowledge and gnosis. As for the first, if it is possible in existence, it is extremely rare. The second, the world is teeming with it. The third and fourth exist, but are exceedingly scarce. It is inconceivable for this to be rare and anomalous, yet despite its rarity, it varies in degree of scarcity and abundance. Its abundance occurs only in eras close to the eras of the prophets, peace be upon them. The interval continues to lengthen, and such hearts become fewer until the Hour draws near and God accomplishes His decree. This must be rare because it is the inception of the kingdom of the Hereafter, and sovereignty is precious, and sovereigns are not numerous. Just as the preeminent in sovereignty and beauty are but rare, and most people are beneath them, so it is with the sovereignty of the Hereafter. For this world is a mirror of the Hereafter; it is an expression of the world of witness, and the Hereafter is an expression of the world of the unseen. The world of witness follows the world of the unseen, just as the image in the mirror follows the image of the viewer. The image in the mirror, though secondary in the order of existence, is primary in relation to your vision, for you do not see yourself, but you see your image in the mirror first, and thereby know your image which is inherent to you secondarily, by way of similitude. Thus, the heart that is secondary in existence is primary in relation to knowledge, and the heart that is later is earlier. This is a kind of inversion, but inversion and reversal are necessities of this world. Likewise, the world of dominion and witness is a similitude of the world of the unseen and the sovereign realm. Among people are those for whom reflective consideration is made easy, so he looks at nothing in the world of dominion without interpreting it to the world of the sovereign realm; his interpretation is called a lesson, and the Truth has commanded it.

He said: "So take heed, O you of insight." Yet among them are those whose inner vision is blinded and do not take heed, so they are confined in the realm of sovereignty and the visible world, and the gates of Hell will be opened to their confinement. This confinement is filled with a fire whose nature is to assail the hearts, save that between it and the perception of its pain is a veil. When that veil is lifted by death, he perceives it. Concerning this, God Almighty manifested the truth upon the tongues of a people whom He caused to speak the truth, and they said: Paradise and Hell are created, but Hellfire is perceived once by a perception called the knowledge of certainty, and once by another perception called the vision of certainty. The vision of certainty occurs only in the Hereafter, while the knowledge of certainty may occur in this world, but only for those who have received their share of the light of certainty. Therefore, God Almighty said: "Nay, if you knew with the knowledge of certainty, you would surely see Hellfire" — that is, in this world — "Then you would surely see it with the vision of certainty" — that is, in the Hereafter. Thus, it has become clear that the sound heart for the sovereignty of the Hereafter can only be noble, just as the sound person is for the sovereignty of this world.

Know that blessings are divided into those which are an end sought for itself and those which are sought for the sake of the end. As for the end, it is the happiness of the Hereafter, and its essence reverts to four matters: everlasting life without perishing, joy without grief, knowledge without ignorance accompanying it, and wealth without poverty thereafter. This is the true blessing. Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "There is no life except the life of the Hereafter." He said this during hardship to console the soul, and that was at the time of digging the trench in severe distress. And he said it once during joy to prevent the soul from inclining to the joys of this world, and that was when people thronged around him during the Farewell Pilgrimage. A man said: "O God, I ask You for the perfection of blessing." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Do you know what the perfection of blessing is?" He said: "No." He said: "The perfection of blessing is entry into Paradise." As for the means, they are divided into the nearest and most specific, such as the virtues of the soul; and what follows it in proximity, such as the virtues of the body, which is the second; and what follows that in proximity and extends beyond the body, such as the causes surrounding the body like wealth, family, and tribe; and what combines these external causes with those attained by the soul, such as divine facilitation and guidance. They are, therefore, four types: The first type, which is the most specific, is the spiritual virtues, and their essence, despite the branching of their aspects, reverts to faith and good character. Faith is divided into the knowledge of unveiling, which is knowledge of God Almighty, His attributes, His angels, and His messengers; and the sciences of conduct. Good character is divided into two parts: abandoning the demands of desires and anger, which is called chastity; and observing justice in refraining from the demands of desires and in proceeding, such that one does not abstain entirely nor proceed however one wishes, but rather his proceeding and holding back are by the just balance that God Almighty revealed upon the tongue of His Messenger, peace be upon him, when God Almighty said: "That you do not transgress in the balance, and establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance." Thus, whoever castrates himself to remove the desire for marriage, or forsakes marriage despite capability and safety from harm, or forsakes eating until he becomes too weak for worship, remembrance, and reflection, has indeed made deficient the balance. And whoever plunges into the desires of the belly and private parts has transgressed in the balance. Justice is only that his weighing and estimation be free from transgression and deficiency, so that the two scales of the balance are balanced by it. Therefore, the specific virtues of the soul that draw near to God Almighty are four: the knowledge of unveiling, the knowledge of conduct, chastity, and justice. This is not fully realized in most cases except through the second type, which is the bodily virtues, and they are four: health, strength, beauty, and long life. These four matters are not made available except through the third type, which are the external blessings surrounding the body, and they are four: wealth, family, status, and noble lineage. And one benefits from none of these external and bodily causes except through the fourth type, which are the causes that combine them with what corresponds to the internal spiritual virtues, and they are four: God's guidance, His direction, His correction, and His support. Thus, the total of these blessings is sixteen when we divide them into four and divide each of the four into four. This totality requires some parts for others, whether out of essential need or beneficial need. As for the essential need, it is like the need of the happiness of the Hereafter for faith and good character, for there is absolutely no way to attain the happiness of the Hereafter except through them. Man has only what he strives for, and no one has in the Hereafter except what he provisioned from this world. Likewise, the need of the spiritual virtues, which acquire these sciences and refine character, for the health of the body is essential. As for the beneficial need in general, it is like the need of these...

The inner blessings of the soul and body, as well as the external blessings such as wealth, honor, and family—if these were lacking, deficiency might encroach upon some of the internal blessings.

If you ask: What is the need for the path of the Hereafter for external blessings like wealth, family, status, and kinship? Know that these causes function like wings that carry one to the goal and tools that facilitate the objective. As for wealth, a poor person seeking knowledge and perfection without sufficiency is like one rushing into battle without weapons, or a falcon attempting to hunt without wings. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ said: "Excellent is righteous wealth for a righteous man," and he ﷺ said: "Wealth is an excellent aid for God-consciousness." How could it not be so? For one deprived of wealth becomes consumed in seeking sustenance, arranging clothing, shelter, and life's necessities, then exposed to various harms that distract from remembrance and reflection—harms only repelled by the weapon of wealth. Moreover, such a one is deprived of the virtues of pilgrimage, almsgiving, charity, and spreading good deeds.

A sage was asked: "What is bliss?" He replied: "Wealth, for I have seen the poor have no life." He was asked: "Tell us more." He said: "Security, for I have seen the fearful have no life." He was asked: "Tell us more." He said: "Health, for I have seen the sick have no life." He was asked: "Tell us more." He said: "Youth, for I have seen the elderly have no life." What he mentioned alludes to worldly bliss, but insofar as it aids the Hereafter, it is a blessing. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever wakes up secure in his home, healthy in his body, with his daily provision, it is as if the entire world has been gathered for him."

As for a righteous spouse and children, the need for them is evident, as the Prophet ﷺ said: "An excellent aid to religion is a righteous wife," and regarding children, he ﷺ said: "When a person dies, his deeds cease except for three: a righteous child who prays for him." We have mentioned the benefits of family and children in the Book of Marriage.

As for relatives, the more children and kin a man has, they become like eyes and hands for him, facilitating through them worldly matters important for his religion—matters that, if he were alone, would occupy him greatly. Anything that frees your heart from worldly necessities aids you in religion and is thus a blessing.

As for honor and status, through them a person repels humiliation and oppression from himself, and no Muslim can do without them, for he is never free from an enemy who harms him or an oppressor who disrupts his knowledge, work, and peace, occupying his heart—and his heart is his capital. These distractions are only repelled by honor and status. Thus, it is said: "Religion and sovereignty are twins." God Almighty said: "If God did not repel some people by means of others, the earth would be corrupted." Status means nothing but mastery over hearts, just as wealth means nothing but mastery over coins. Whoever masters coins, the possessors of hearts are subservient to repel harm from him. Just as one needs a roof to repel rain, a garment to repel cold, and a dog to repel wolves from his flock, so too does one need someone to repel evil from himself through them. With this intent, the prophets—who had no kingdom or dominion—would observe rulers and seek status with them, as do religious scholars, not with the aim of taking from their treasuries or seeking abundance and excess in this world by following them. Do not think that God's blessing upon the Prophet ﷺ when He granted him victory, perfected his religion, made him prevail over all his enemies, and established love for him in hearts—so that his honor and status expanded—was less than His blessing upon him when he was harmed and beaten until he was compelled to flee and emigrate.

If you ask: Is the nobility of kinship and the honor of family among the blessings or not? I say yes, and thus the Prophet ﷺ said: "The leaders are from Quraysh," and for this reason, the Prophet ﷺ was of the noblest lineage among the descendants of Adam, peace be upon him. He ﷺ said: "Choose suitable matches for your offspring," and he ﷺ said: "Beware of the green growth on dung heaps." It was asked: "What is the green growth on dung heaps?" He said: "A beautiful woman from a corrupt lineage." This too is among the blessings, and I do not mean by it affiliation with oppressors and worldly people, but rather affiliation with the tree of prophethood, with the leaders of scholars, and with the righteous and pious distinguished in knowledge and action.

If you ask: What is the meaning of bodily virtues? I say there is no obscurity in the intense need for health, strength, and long life, for knowledge and action are only perfected through them. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ said: "The greatest happiness is a long life spent in obedience to God Almighty." Among these, beauty is considered minor, and it is said: It suffices that the body is free from diseases that distract from pursuing good deeds. By my life, beauty is of little benefit, but it is also among the good things. As for this world, its benefit therein is evident; as for the Hereafter, it is from two aspects: First, the ugly is blameworthy, and natural dispositions recoil from it, and needs...

The comely countenance is nearer to acceptance, and its esteem in hearts is broader; thus from this aspect, it is like a wing that reaches as far as wealth and status, since it is a form of power. For the fair-faced is able to accomplish needs that the ill-favored cannot, and every aid in fulfilling worldly needs is an aid to the Hereafter through it.

Secondly, beauty for the most part indicates virtue of the soul, because when the light of the soul shines most completely, it is conveyed to the body. Appearance and inner character often correspond, which is why practitioners of physiognomy relied on bodily forms to know the soul's noble traits, saying the face and eye are the mirror of the inner self. Therefore, the effects of anger, joy, and grief appear in it. Hence it is said: "An open countenance is a sign of what is within the soul," and it is said: "There is nothing ugly on earth but that its most beautiful part is its face." Al-Ma'mun once reviewed an army, and an ugly man was presented to him. He questioned him and found him to be inarticulate, so he struck his name from the register, saying: "When the spirit shines upon the outward, it is comeliness; or upon the inward, it is eloquence. This one has neither outward nor inward."

It is said: "Seek good from the radiant of face." And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "When you send an envoy, seek one with a handsome face and a good name." Jurists said: "When the ranks of worshippers are equal, the fairest of face is most deserving of leading the prayer." And God the Exalted, bestowing favor thereby, said: "And He increased him in knowledge and stature." We do not mean by beauty what stirs desire, for that is femininity; rather, we mean tallness with uprightness, moderation in flesh, proportionality of limbs, and symmetry in the face's creation such that temperaments do not recoil from looking upon it.

If you say: "You have included wealth, status, lineage, family, and children within the scope of blessings, yet God the Exalted has censured wealth and status, as did the Messenger and the scholars. God said: 'Indeed, among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them,' and He said: 'Your wealth and your children are but a trial.' And 'Ali, may God honor his face, said in censuring lineage: 'People are the children of what they excel in, and a person's worth is what he excels at.' It is said: 'A man is by himself, not by his father.' So what is the meaning of them being blessings while they are censured by the Law?"

Know that whoever takes knowledge from transmitted, interpreted expressions and generalities requiring specification, misguidance is more likely for him unless he is guided by God's light to grasp the sciences as they truly are, then applies the transmission in accordance with what has become clear to him—through interpretation at times and specification at others. These are blessings that assist in the matter of the Hereafter; there is no way to deny them except that within them are trials and dangers. The example of wealth is like a snake containing both beneficial antidote and harmful poison. If it is obtained by the charmer who knows how to guard against its poison and extract its beneficial antidote, it is a blessing. But if it is obtained by the ignorant commoner, it is a calamity and ruin for him. It is like the sea beneath which are varieties of jewels and pearls. Whoever attains the sea, if he knows swimming, diving, and how to guard against the sea's perils, has attained its blessings. But if he plunges into it ignorant of that, he is destroyed.

For this reason, God the Exalted praised wealth and called it good, and the Messenger praised it, saying: "How excellent an aid toward God-consciousness is wealth." Likewise, He praised status and honor, for God bestowed upon His Messenger by making him prevail over all religion and endearing him to the hearts of creation—which is the meaning of status. However, what is transmitted in praise of them is little, and what is transmitted in censure of wealth and status is much. And where ostentation is censured, it is censure of status, for ostentation aims to attract hearts, and the meaning of status is mastery over hearts.

This is abundant and that is scarce because most people are ignorant of the method of charming the snake of wealth and diving into the sea of status, so warning them is obligatory, for they are destroyed by the poison of wealth before reaching its antidote, and the crocodile of the sea of status destroys them before discovering its jewels. If they were inherently blameworthy for everyone, it would be inconceivable for kingship to be joined to prophethood as it was for our Messenger, or for wealth to be joined to it as it was for Solomon, peace be upon him. All people are children, and wealths are snakes; the prophets and the knowers are charmers. What harms the child may not harm the charmer. Indeed, if a charmer had a child whose continued existence and rectitude he desired, and he found a snake, knowing that if he took it for its antidote, his child would imitate him and take the snake upon seeing it to play with it and thus perish, he would have an interest in the antidote and an interest in protecting the child. It is incumbent upon him to weigh his interest in the antidote against his interest in protecting the child. If he is able to abstain from the antidote without suffering great harm, and if he took it, his child would take it...

The child, and the harm is magnified by their destruction, so it is incumbent upon him to flee from the serpent when he sees it, and to instruct the child to flee, and to make its form ugly in his sight, and to inform him that within it is a lethal poison from which none are saved. And he must not relate to him at all the benefit of the antidote contained within it, for that might entice him to approach it without complete knowledge. Likewise, the diver, if he knows that were he to dive into the sea within sight of his child, the child would follow him and perish, it is incumbent upon him to warn the child away from the seashore and the riverbank. If the child is not deterred by mere warning whenever he sees his father lingering around the shore, then it is incumbent upon him to distance himself from the shore with the child and not to approach it in his presence. Similarly, the community within the care of the Prophets, peace be upon them, are like foolish children. For this reason He, peace be upon him, said: "I am to you only like a father to his child." And He, peace be upon him, said: "You are but plunging into the Fire like moths, and I am seizing you by your garments." Their greatest share is in preserving their children from destruction, for they were not sent except for that. They have no share in wealth except to the measure of sustenance. Thus, they restricted themselves to the measure of sustenance, and what remained beyond that they did not hoard but spent it, for in spending is the antidote and in hoarding is the poison. If the door of acquiring wealth were opened for people and they were inclined to it, they would lean towards the poison of hoarding and turn away from the antidote of spending. Therefore, wealth was made repugnant, and the meaning is the repugnance of hoarding it and being greedy for it, for amassing it and indulging in its pleasures, which necessitates leaning towards this world and its delights. As for taking it to the measure of sufficiency and directing the surplus to good works, that is not blameworthy. It is the right of every traveler to carry only the measure of his provision for the journey, if he resolves firmly to confine himself to what he carries. However, if his soul is generous in feeding others and expanding the provision for his companions, then there is no harm in acquiring more. His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Let the provision of any one of you from this world be like the provision of a rider," means for yourselves specifically. Indeed, among those who narrated this hadith and acted upon it were those who would take one hundred thousand dirhams in one place and distribute them in another, not keeping a single grain from it. And when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, mentioned that the wealthy enter Paradise with difficulty, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, may God be pleased with him, sought his permission to give away all that he owned. He permitted him, and Gabriel, peace be upon him, descended and said: "Command him to feed the poor, clothe the naked, and host the guest." So, worldly blessings are mixed; their remedy is blended with their malady, their hope with their fear, and their benefit with their harm. Whoever trusts in his insight and the perfection of his knowledge, for him is to draw near to them, warding off their malady and extracting their remedy. But whoever does not trust in them, then distance, distance, and flight, flight from the places of danger. Nothing equals safety for these people, and they are all of creation except whom God, the Exalted, protects and guides to the path.

If you say: What then is the meaning of the preponderant, facilitating blessings that lead to guidance, right conduct, support, and rectification? Know that none can dispense with facilitation. It is an expression for the composition and joining between the will of the servant and the decree and destiny of God. This encompasses good and evil, what constitutes happiness and what constitutes misery. But custom has restricted the name 'facilitation' to that part of God's decree and destiny which conforms to happiness, just as 'deviation' is an expression for inclining, but is specified for one who inclines to falsehood over truth, and likewise 'apostasy.' The need for facilitation is evident, and for this reason it is said:
"If there is no aid from God for a youth, then the most his striving gathers is against him."

As for guidance, there is no way for anyone to seek happiness except through it, for a person's inclination may lean towards what contains the rectification of his Hereafter. But if he does not know what contains the rectification of his Hereafter, to the point that he considers corruption to be rectification, then how can mere will benefit him? There is no benefit in will, capability, and means except after guidance. For this reason, God, the Exalted, said: "Our Lord is He who gave everything its creation, then guided." And He, the Exalted, said: "And were it not for the favor of God upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure, but God purifies whom He wills." And He, peace be upon him, said: "No one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of God, the Exalted," meaning by His guidance. It was said: "Not even you, O Messenger of God?" He said: "Not even I." Guidance has three stations: The first is knowledge of the path of good and evil, alluded to in His saying, the Exalted: "And We have shown him the two ways." God, the Exalted, has bestowed this upon all His servants, some of it through intellect and some of it upon the tongues of the messengers. For this reason He, the Exalted, said: "And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance." So the means of guidance are the Book, the messengers, and the insights of the intellects. They are offered, and none are prevented from them except...

Envy, arrogance, and love of this world are among the causes that blind the hearts, even if they do not blind the eyes. God Almighty has said: "Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts within the breasts." Among the blinding veils are familiarity and habit, and the love of adhering to them. This is expressed in His saying: "Indeed, we found our forefathers following a creed." Regarding arrogance and envy, it is expressed in His saying: "And they said, 'Why was this Qur'an not sent down upon a great man from one of the two cities?'" and His saying: "Shall we follow a single human being from among us?" These are the veils that prevented guidance, and the second guidance lies beyond this general guidance. It is that which God Almighty grants the servant state after state, and it is the fruit of spiritual struggle, as He said: "And those who strive in Our cause – We will surely guide them to Our paths." This is what is meant by His saying: "And those who are guided, He increases them in guidance." The third guidance lies beyond the second; it is the light that shines in the realm of prophethood and sainthood after the perfection of spiritual struggle within it. One is guided by it except for that which cannot be attained by the intellect, which is the basis for religious obligation and the possibility of learning sciences, which is the absolute desire, and everything else is a veil and preliminary for it. It is that which God Almighty honored by specifying its attribution to Him, even though all guidance is from Him, as He said: "Say, 'Indeed, the guidance of God is the [true] guidance.'" It is called life in His saying: "Or is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one in darkness?" And the meaning of His saying: "So is one whose breast God has expanded to Islam, so that he is upon a light from his Lord [like one whose heart is constrained]?" As for *rushd* (right judgment), we mean by it the divine care that assists a person when he turns toward his objectives, so it guides him to what is good for him and averts him from what corrupts him, and this is from the inward, as He said: "And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgment before, and We were of him Knowing." Thus, *rushd* is an expression for a motivating guidance toward the direction of happiness, moving one toward it. For a child, when he reaches maturity and is knowledgeable about safeguarding wealth, methods of trade, and increasing it, but despite that he squanders and does not desire to increase it, he is not called *rashid* (judicious), not for lacking guidance, but because his guidance is insufficient to move his innate drive. How many a person proceeds with what he knows harms him; he has been given guidance and is distinguished by it from the ignorant one who does not know it harms him, but he has not been given *rushd*. Thus, *rushd*, by this consideration, is more complete than mere guidance to the aspects of actions, and it is a great blessing. As for *tasdid* (setting aright), it is the directing of one's movements toward the aim and facilitating them for him, so that he proceeds firmly toward correctness in the shortest time. For guidance alone is not sufficient; rather, there must be a guidance that motivates the innate drive, and that is *rushd*. And *rushd* is not sufficient; rather, there must be facilitation of movements with the assistance of the limbs and instruments, so that what the innate drive was aroused for is accomplished. Thus, guidance is pure instruction; *rushd* is the awakening of the innate drive so it stirs and moves; and *tasdid* is aid and support by moving the limbs toward correctness. As for *ta'yid* (divine support), it is as if it gathers all; it is an expression for strengthening his affair with insight from within, and strengthening his grasp and the assistance of means from without. This is what is meant by His saying, Mighty and Majestic: "When I supported you with the Holy Spirit." Close to it is *'ismah* (divine protection), which is an expression for a divine presence that flows in the inward, by which a person is strengthened to pursue good and avoid evil, becoming as if prevented by an unseen inward barrier. This is what is meant by His saying: "And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his Lord." These are the aggregates of blessings, and they will not be established except by what God grants of pure, penetrating understanding, attentive hearing, a vigilant, humble, and observant heart, a sincere teacher, wealth that is surplus beyond what falls short of necessities due to its scantness, yet is not so abundant as to distract from religion, and honor that protects one from the folly of fools and the injustice of enemies. Each one of these sixteen causes requires causes, and those causes require causes, until they ultimately end with the Last, the Guide of the perplexed and the Refuge of the desperate, and that is the Lord of lords and the Causer of causes. Since these causes are lengthy and a book such as this cannot bear their exhaustive treatment, we shall mention from them a model, so that the meaning of His saying may be known: "And if you should count the favors of God, you could not enumerate them." And with God is success.

(Clarifying the aspect of the model in the multitude of God's blessings, their sequence, and their being beyond enumeration and counting)

Know that we have gathered the blessings into sixteen kinds, and we have made bodily health a blessing among the blessings occurring in the later rank. This single blessing, if we wished to exhaustively trace its causes...

Through which this blessing is perfected, we have no power over it, but eating is one of the causes of health. So let us mention a selection from the totality of causes by which the blessing of eating is perfected. It is not hidden that eating is an action, and every action of this type is a movement, and every movement necessarily requires a moving body which is its instrument, and necessarily requires a capability for movement, and necessarily requires a will for movement, and necessarily requires knowledge of what is intended and perception of it. And eating necessarily requires something to be eaten, and the thing eaten necessarily requires an origin from which it is obtained, and necessarily requires a maker who prepares it. So let us mention the causes of perception, then the causes of wills, then the causes of capability, then the causes of the thing eaten, by way of indication, not by way of exhaustive detail.

(The First Part: On God Most High's Blessings in Creating the Causes of Perception)

Know that God Most High created plants, which are more perfect in existence than stone, clay, iron, copper, and all other minerals which do not grow and are not nourished. For the plant was created with a power by which it draws nourishment to itself from the direction of its root and its roots which are in the earth, and they are its instruments. Through them it draws nourishment; they are the delicate roots you see in every leaf, then their bases thicken, then they branch out, and they continue to become finer and branch out into hair-like roots spreading through the parts of the leaf until they disappear from sight. However, the plant, with all this, is deficient. For if it lacks nourishment brought to it and touching its root, it dries and withers, and it cannot seek nourishment from another location. For seeking only occurs with knowledge of what is sought and by moving towards it, and the plant is incapable of that. So from God Most High's blessing upon you is that He created for you the instruments of sensation and the instrument of movement for seeking nourishment. So look at the arrangement of God Most High's wisdom in creating the five senses, which are the instrument of perception. The first of them is the sense of touch. It was created for you so that if a burning fire or a cutting sword touches you, you feel it and flee from it. This is the first sense created for an animal, and no animal is conceivable except that it has this sense, for if it does not feel at all, it is not an animal. The lowest degree of sensation is to feel what does not adhere to and touch it, for sensation of what is distant from it is undoubtedly a more complete sensation. This sense exists for every animal, even the worm in the mud, for if a needle is stuck into it, it contracts to flee, unlike the plant, for the plant is cut and does not contract, as it does not feel the cutting. Yet, if only this sense were created for you, you would be deficient like the worm, unable to seek nourishment from where it is distant from you. Rather, only what touches you, you feel and draw to yourself. So you were in need of a sense by which you perceive what is distant from you. Thus He created for you smell, except that you perceive with it the scent but do not know from which direction it came. So you would need to wander much from various sides; perhaps you would stumble upon the nourishment whose scent you smelled, and perhaps you would not, so you would be in the utmost deficiency if only this were created for you. So He created for you sight, to perceive with it what is distant from you and perceive its direction, so you aim for that specific direction. Except that if only this were created for you, you would be deficient, for you would not perceive with it what is behind walls and veils. You would see nourishment with no veil between you and it, and you would see an enemy with no veil between you and him. But what has a veil between you and it, you would not see, and the veil might not be lifted except when the enemy is near, so you would be unable to flee. So He created for you hearing, so that you perceive with it sounds from behind walls and veils upon the occurrence of movements, because you perceive with sight only something present, but the absent you cannot know except through speech composed of letters and sounds perceived by the sense of hearing. So your need for it was great, and He created that for you, and you were distinguished by understanding speech from all other animals. Yet all that would not suffice you if the sense of taste were not created for you, for when nourishment reaches you, you would not perceive that it is agreeable or disagreeable to you, so you would eat it and perish, like a tree into whose root every liquid is poured, and it has no taste, so it draws it, and perhaps that becomes the cause of its drying up. Then, all that would not suffice you if another perception, called the common sense, were not created in the forefront of your brain, to which these five sensed things are conveyed and in which they gather. Were it not for it, the matter would be prolonged for you. For if you ate something yellow, for example, and found it bitter and disagreeable to you, so you left it, then if you saw it again, you would not know it is bitter and harmful unless you tasted it a second time, were it not for the common sense. For the eye sees the yellowness but does not perceive the bitterness, so how would you abstain? And taste perceives the bitterness but does not perceive the yellowness. So a judge is necessary, before whom the yellowness and the bitterness gather together, so that when you desire the yellowness, it judges that it is bitter, and thus you abstain from consuming it a second time. All this you share with the animals, for the sheep has all these senses. So if you had only this, you would be deficient, for the beast is tricked, so it is captured and does not know how to repel the trick.

Concerning the soul and how it may free itself when bound—it may even cast itself into a well without realizing that this will destroy it. For this reason, a beast may eat what it finds pleasing in the moment, only to be harmed thereafter, falling ill and dying, since it possesses only sensation of the present, while perception of consequences it lacks. But God, exalted be He, has distinguished and honored you with another attribute, nobler than all others: the intellect. Through it you perceive the harm and benefit of foods in both the immediate and the ultimate sense; through it you grasp how to cook and combine foods and prepare their means, thus benefiting through your intellect in eating, which is the cause of your health. This is among the finest benefits of the intellect and the least of its judgments—indeed, the greatest wisdom within it is the knowledge of God, exalted be He, knowledge of His acts, and knowledge of the wisdom in His creation. At that point, the benefit of the five senses in your regard is transformed, and the five senses become like spies and informants assigned to the regions of a kingdom, each entrusted with a specific matter: one with reports of colors, another with reports of sounds, another with reports of scents, another with reports of tastes, and another with reports of heat and cold, roughness and smoothness, softness and hardness, and the like. These spies and informants seize reports from the far reaches of the kingdom and deliver them to the common sense, which sits at the forefront of the brain like a keeper of records and dispatches at the king’s gate, gathering the reports and dispatches arriving from the regions of the world. It receives them sealed and passes them on, for it has no capacity except to receive, gather, and preserve them. As for knowing the realities within, it cannot. But when it encounters the discerning heart, which is the commander and king, it delivers the sealed reports to him. The king then examines them, uncovers from them the secrets of the kingdom, and rules within them with wondrous judgments that cannot be exhaustively detailed in this place. According to what becomes apparent to him of judgments and interests, he mobilizes the soldiers—which are the limbs—sometimes in pursuit, sometimes in flight, and sometimes in executing the plans that occur to him. This is the manner of God’s favor upon you in perceptions. Do not suppose that we have exhausted them, for the outward senses are but a portion of perceptions, and sight is one among the senses. The eye is a single instrument for it, yet the eye is composed of ten distinct layers: some are moistures, some are membranes—some membranes like a spider’s web, some like the chorion—and some of those moistures like egg white, some like jelly. Each of these ten layers has a quality, form, shape, configuration, accident, curvature, and composition. If a single layer among the ten or a single quality among the qualities of each layer were disturbed, sight would be impaired, and all physicians and oculists would be powerless regarding it. This is concerning one sense; judge by it the sense of hearing and the rest of the senses. Indeed, it is impossible to exhaust the judgment of God, exalted be He, and the varieties of His favor in the structure of sight and its layers, even in many volumes, while its entirety does not exceed a small walnut. So what is your thought concerning the entire body and its other members and wonders? These are but hints to the favors of God, exalted be He, in creating perceptions.

(The Second Aspect: On the Varieties of Favors in Creating Desires)

Know that if He had created sight for you so that you might perceive nourishment from a distance, but had not created in you an inclination in nature, a longing for it, and an appetite that urges you to movement, then the faculty would be idle. How many a sick person sees food, which is the most beneficial thing for him, yet his appetite has vanished, so he does not partake of it, and thus sight and perception remain idle in his regard. Therefore, it was necessary that you have an inclination toward what agrees with you, called appetite, and an aversion to what disagrees with you, called dislike, so that you might seek through appetite and flee through dislike. So God, exalted be He, created within you an appetite for food, subjected you to it, and entrusted it to you like a creditor who compels you to partake until you eat and are nourished, and thus survive through nourishment. This is something you share with animals, but not with plants. Then, this appetite, if it did not subside once the needed amount is taken, would lead to excess and destroy you. So God created for you dislike upon satiety, so that you might cease eating through it—unlike crops, which continually draw water if it flows at their base until they spoil, requiring a human to measure their nourishment according to need, watering them at one time and cutting off water at another. And just as He created this appetite in you so that you might eat and thereby your body endures, He created in you the appetite for intercourse so that you might engage in it and thereby your progeny endures. If we were to recount to you the wonders of God’s craftsmanship in creating the womb, creating menstrual blood, composing the fetus from semen and menstrual blood, the manner of creating the testicles and the vessels leading to them from the spine, which is the resting place of the sperm, the manner of the flow of the woman’s fluid from the chest by means of vessels, and the manner of the division of the concave uterus into molds into which the sperm falls...

Some of them take on male forms and fall into others taking on female forms, and the manner of managing them through the stages of their creation—as a clinging clot, then a lump of flesh, then bones, flesh, and blood—and the division of their parts into head, hand, leg, belly, back, and other limbs, would alone fill you with utter wonder at the varieties of God’s blessings upon you at the beginning of your creation, let alone what you see now. But we only intend to address God’s blessings in eating alone, so as not to prolong the discourse. Thus, the appetite for food is one type of desire, yet that alone does not suffice you, for destructive forces assail you from all sides. Had He not created anger within you, by which you repel all that opposes and displeases you, you would remain vulnerable to afflictions, and all you have acquired of nourishment would be taken from you, for everyone desires what is in your hands. You therefore need an impetus to repel and combat it, which is the impetus of anger, by which you repel all that opposes and displeases you. Yet even this does not suffice, for appetite and anger only urge toward what harms or benefits in the immediate present; as for the ultimate outcome, these desires are insufficient therein. So God created for you another desire, subservient to the direction of the intellect that discerns consequences, just as He created appetite and anger subservient to the perception of the senses that perceive the present state. Thus, you benefit by the intellect, for mere knowledge that this appetite, for example, harms you does not suffice to guard against it unless you have an inclination to act according to that knowledge. This desire is uniquely granted to you apart from beasts, as an honor to the children of Adam, just as you are uniquely granted knowledge of consequences. We have named this desire the religious impetus and elaborated on it in the Book of Patience more fully than here.

(Third Aspect: On God’s Blessings in Creating the Capacity and Instruments of Movement)

Know that sensation only yields perception, and desire has no meaning except inclination toward pursuit or avoidance. This is insufficient unless you possess the instruments of pursuit and avoidance. How many a sick person longs for something distant, perceiving it, yet cannot walk to it due to loss of a leg, or cannot take it due to loss of a hand or paralysis and numbness therein. Thus, instruments of movement and a capacity within those instruments for motion are necessary, so that their movement follows appetite in pursuit and aversion in avoidance. For this, God created for you limbs whose outward appearance you observe but whose secrets you do not know. Among them are those for pursuit and avoidance, such as legs for humans, wings for birds, and limbs for beasts; and among them are those for defense, such as weapons for humans and horns for animals. In this, animals differ greatly: some have many enemies and distant sustenance, needing swift movement, so He created wings for them to fly swiftly; some have four limbs, some two legs, some crawl. Mentioning this would be lengthy, so let us mention only the limbs by which eating is completed, that others may be inferred therefrom.

We say: Your sight of food from afar and your movement toward it do not suffice unless you are able to take it, so you needed a grasping instrument. Thus, God bestowed upon you the creation of two hands, long and extended toward things, containing many joints to move in directions, extending and bending toward you, unlike a fixed plank. Then He made the end of the hand broad by creating the palm, and divided the end of the palm into five parts, which are the fingers, arranging them in two rows so that the thumb is on one side and rotates around the remaining four. Had they been joined or stacked, your purpose would not be fully achieved. He positioned them such that if you spread them, they become a scoop for you; if you close them, they become a ladle; if you gather them, they become an instrument for striking; if you open then close them, they become an instrument for grasping. Then He created nails for them and supported the fingertips with them, so they do not fray and so you can pick up delicate things that fingers cannot contain, taking them with the tips of your nails.

Now suppose you take food with your hands—how does this suffice unless it reaches the stomach, which is internal? There must be a vestibule from the exterior to it, so that food may enter through it. Thus, He made the mouth a passage to the stomach, with many wisdoms besides being a passage for food to the stomach. Then, if you place food in the mouth as a single piece, swallowing is not easy, so you need a mill to grind the food. Thus, He created for you two jaws from bones and set in them teeth, aligning the upper molars with the lower to grind the food. Food sometimes needs breaking, sometimes cutting, then grinding thereafter. So He divided the teeth into broad grinders like molars and sharp cutters like incisors.

And to what is suitable for crushing, like the canines, then He made the joint of the jaws loose so that the lower jaw advances and recedes, rotating upon the upper jaw like the rotation of a millstone. Were it not for that, it would only be possible for one to strike against the other, like the clapping of hands, for example, and with that, grinding would not be accomplished. So He made the lower jaw move with a circular motion and the upper jaw fixed, not moving. So look at the wondrous craftsmanship of God, exalted is He, for every millstone made by creation has its lower stone fixed and its upper stone rotating, except this millstone which God, exalted is He, made, for its lower part rotates upon its upper part. Glory be to Him, how magnificent is His affair, how mighty His dominion, how perfect His proof, and how vast His favor.

Then consider, if you placed the food in the cavity of the mouth, how would the food move to beneath the teeth, or how would the teeth draw it to themselves, and how could the hand maneuver inside the mouth? So look how God has bestowed favor upon you by creating the tongue, for it circulates in the sides of the mouth and returns the food from the center to the teeth as needed, like a shovel that returns food to the millstone. This is besides its benefit for taste and the wonders of the power of speech and judgment, which we do not elaborate in mentioning.

Then consider, if you cut and ground the food while it is dry, you would not be able to swallow it except by it slipping into the throat with some moisture. So look how God, exalted is He, created beneath the tongue a spring from which saliva flows and pours forth according to need, until the food is kneaded with it. So look how He subjugated it for this matter, for you see the food from a distance, then the jaws stir for service and the saliva pours forth until your cheeks water, and the food is still far from you.

Then, this ground and kneaded food—who conveys it to the stomach while it is in the mouth? You cannot push it with your hand, nor is there a hand in the stomach to extend and pull the food. So look how God, exalted is He, prepared the esophagus and the larynx and placed upon its head layers that open to take the food, then constrict so that the food turns over by its pressure and falls into the stomach through the passage of the esophagus.

When the food reaches the stomach, being bread and cut fruit, it is not suitable to become flesh, bone, and blood in this state. Rather, it must be cooked completely until its parts become homogeneous. So God, exalted is He, created the stomach in the form of a cooking pot. The food falls into it, and it contains it, and the doors close upon it. It remains residing within until digestion and ripening are complete through the heat that surrounds the stomach from the internal organs, for on its right side is the liver, on its left the spleen, in front the chest, and behind the flesh of the back. The heat reaches it from the heating of these organs from the sides until the food is cooked and becomes a fluid, homogeneous substance suitable for permeating the cavities of the veins. At that time, it resembles barley water in the homogeneity of its parts and its state, yet it is still not suitable for nourishment.

So God, exalted is He, created between it and the liver passages from the veins and made for it many openings so that the food pours into them and ends at the liver. The liver is a compound from the clay of blood, as if it were blood, and in it are many hair-like veins spread throughout the parts of the liver. The thin, permeating food pours into them and spreads through its parts until the power of the liver takes control of it and dyes it with the color of blood. It settles there until it attains another ripening and acquires the form of pure blood suitable for nourishing the organs, except that the heat of the liver is what ripens this blood.

From this blood, two residues are generated, as is generated in all that is cooked: one resembling the dregs and sediment, which is the black bile, and the other resembling the froth, which is the yellow bile. If the two residues were not separated from it, the temperament of the organs would spoil. So God, exalted is He, created the gallbladder and the spleen and gave each of them a neck extended to the liver, entering into its cavity. The gallbladder draws the bilious residue, and the spleen draws the black, sedimented residue, leaving the blood pure, containing nothing but increased thinness and moisture due to its wateriness. Were it not for that, it would not spread in those hair-like veins nor emerge from them ascending to the organs.

So God, glorified is He, created the two kidneys and brought out from each of them a long neck to the liver. Among the wonders of God's wisdom, exalted is He, is that their neck is not inside the cavity of the liver but connected to the veins rising from the hump of the liver—among the wonders of God's wisdom, exalted is He, is that their neck is not inside the cavity of the liver but connected to the veins rising from the hump of the liver—so that it draws what is adjacent to it after rising from the fine veins in the liver, for if it drew before that, it would be thick and would not exit the veins. When the wateriness is separated from it, the blood has become pure from...

The three waste products are purified from all that corrupts nourishment. Then God, exalted be He, caused veins to emerge from the liver, then divided them after their emergence into sections and branches, each section with its branches, and that spread throughout the entire body, from the crown of the head to the foot, outwardly and inwardly. Pure blood flows therein and reaches all the limbs, until the divided veins become hair-like, like the veins of leaves and trees, such that they cannot be perceived by sight. Nourishment reaches from them by seepage to all the limbs. If an affliction befalls the gallbladder so that it does not attract the bilious waste, the blood becomes corrupt and from it arise bilious diseases such as jaundice, pustules, and erysipelas. If an affliction befalls the spleen so that it does not attract the melancholic humor, melancholic diseases occur, such as vitiligo, leprosy, melancholy, and others. If the watery [waste] is not driven toward the kidneys, dropsy and other [ailments] arise from it.

Then observe the wisdom of the Wise Creator, how He arranged benefits upon these three base waste products. As for the gallbladder, it attracts with one of its necks and casts out with the other neck into the intestines, so that a slippery moisture is obtained for it in the food residue, and a pungency occurs in the intestines which moves them for expulsion, so they contract until the residue is expelled and slips out, and its bile is for that purpose. As for the spleen, it transforms that waste with a transformation by which acidity and astringency are produced within it, then it sends from it something each day to the mouth of the stomach, which stirs the appetite with its acidity, alerts it, and arouses it, and it expels the remainder with the residue. As for the kidney, it is nourished by the blood within that watery [waste] and sends the remainder to the bladder.

Let us confine ourselves to this extent in clarifying the blessings of God, exalted be He, in the means He prepared for eating. If we were to mention how the liver needs the heart and the brain, and how each one of these principal organs needs its companion, and the manner of the branching of the pulsating veins from the heart to the rest of the body, and through them sensation reaches, and the manner of the branching of the quiescent veins from the liver to the rest of the body, and through them nourishment reaches, and then the manner of the composition of the limbs and the number of their bones, muscles, veins, tendons, ligaments, cartilages, and humors, the discourse would be prolonged. All of that is needed for eating and for other matters besides. Indeed, in the human being are thousands of muscles, veins, and nerves, differing in smallness and largeness, fineness and coarseness, and abundance and paucity of division. There is not a single one of them except that within it is one wisdom, or two, or three, or four, up to ten and more. All of that is a blessing from God, exalted be He, upon you. If from among them a moving vein were to become still, or a still vein were to move, you would perish, O wretched one. So look at the blessing of God, exalted be He, upon you—or will you not thereby be strengthened for gratitude? For you know of the blessing of God, glorified be He, only eating, and it is the basest of them. Then you know of it only that you hunger, so you eat. The donkey also knows that it hungers so it eats, tires so it sleeps, desires so it copulates, is roused so it rises, and gallops. If you know of yourself only what the donkey knows, how will you fulfill gratitude for God's blessing upon you? This to which we have alluded with brevity is but a drop from one sea of the seas of God's blessings. So extrapolate generally what we have omitted from the totality of what we have known, for fear of prolixity. And the totality of what we have known and what all creation has known, in comparison to what they have not known of the blessings of God, exalted be He, is less than a drop from a sea. Yet, whoever knows something of this perceives a whiff of the meanings of His saying, exalted be He: "And if you should count the favors of God, you could not enumerate them."

Then observe how God, exalted be He, linked the soundness of these limbs and the soundness of their benefits, perceptions, and powers to a subtle vapor that ascends from the four humors and has its resting place in the heart, and courses through the entire body by means of the pulsating veins. It does not reach any part of the body's parts except that it occasions within those parts what is needed of sensory and perceptive power, power of movement, and others—like a lamp that is carried to the corners of a house; no part is reached except that light is obtained for the parts of the house because of its arrival, by the creation and invention of God, exalted be He, but He made the lamp a cause for it by His wisdom. This subtle vapor is what the physicians call the spirit (rūḥ). Its place is the heart. Its likeness is the fiery substance of the lamp. The heart is like the lamp-holder. The black blood within the interior of the heart is like the wick. Nourishment is like the oil. The apparent life in the rest of the body's limbs because of it is like the light of the lamp for the entirety of the house. And just as the lamp is extinguished if its oil is cut off, so too the lamp of the spirit is extinguished whenever its nourishment is cut off. And just as the wick may burn and become ash such that it does not accept oil, so the lamp is extinguished despite an abundance of oil. Likewise, the blood upon which this vapor depends...

The heart may burn with excessive heat of the heart and be extinguished while nourishment is present, for it does not accept the nourishment by which the spirit remains, just as ashes do not accept oil in a way that fire clings to it. And just as a lamp is sometimes extinguished due to an internal cause, as we have mentioned, and sometimes due to an external cause, like a violent wind, so too the spirit is sometimes extinguished due to an internal cause and sometimes due to an external cause, which is killing. And just as the extinguishing of a lamp—by the depletion of oil, the corruption of the wick, a violent wind, or a person putting it out—occurs only by causes decreed in God’s knowledge, arranged, and all of that is by divine measure, so too is the extinguishing of the spirit. And just as the extinguishing of the lamp is the end of its time of existence, making that its appointed term which was decreed for it in the Mother of the Book, so too is the extinguishing of the spirit. And just as when the lamp is extinguished, the entire house becomes dark, so when the spirit is extinguished, the entire body becomes dark and the lights it used to derive from the spirit depart from it—these being the lights of sensations, power, volitions, and all else gathered by the meaning of the word “life.” This, too, is a concise symbol pointing to another realm among the realms of God’s blessings and the wonders of His creation and wisdom, so that one may know that “if the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted,” glorified and exalted is He. So woe to him who disbelieves in God, woe and perdition to him who disbelieves in His blessings, perdition.

If you say: You have described the spirit and likened it, yet the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), when asked about the spirit, did not add more than saying, “Say, ‘The spirit is from the command of my Lord,’” and did not describe it to them in this manner. Know that this is an oversight regarding the homonymy present in the term “spirit,” for “spirit” is applied to many meanings, which we shall not prolong in enumerating. We have only described, among them, a subtle body that physicians call “spirit,” and they have known its attributes, existence, how it flows through the limbs, and how sensation and faculties occur in the limbs through it—so much so that when some limb becomes numb, they know that is due to a blockage occurring in the passage of this spirit. Thus, they do not treat the site of numbness but rather the origins of the nerves and the locations of the blockage within them, treating them with what opens the blockage. For this subtle body, due to its fineness, permeates the network of nerves, and through it is conveyed from the heart to all the limbs. What physicians’ knowledge ascends to concerning it is an easy, lowly matter. As for the spirit that is the origin, which when corrupted corrupts the entire body for it, that is a secret among the secrets of God, exalted is He. We have not described it, nor is there permission to describe it, except by saying it is a divine command, as He, exalted is He, said: “Say, ‘The spirit is from the command of my Lord.’” Divine commands cannot be comprehended by intellects; rather, the intellects of most creation are bewildered by them. As for fancies and delusions, they are necessarily deficient in grasping them, just as sight is deficient in perceiving sounds. Intellects bound by substance and accident, confined within their narrow confines, tremble at mentioning the principles of describing it. Nothing of its description is grasped by the intellect, but rather by another light, higher and nobler than intellect, which shines in the realm of prophethood and saintliness. Its relation to intellect is like the relation of intellect to fancy and imagination. God has created creation in stages. Just as a child perceives sensible things but does not perceive intelligible things because that is a stage he has not yet reached, so too does the mature person perceive intelligible things but does not perceive what is beyond them because that is a stage he has not yet reached. Indeed, it is a noble station, a sweet drink, and a high rank wherein one gazes upon the gardens of Truth with the light of faith and certainty. That drink is too precious to be a common path for every comer; rather, only one after another is granted insight into it. For the Presence of Truth there is a forecourt, and at the forefront of the forecourt there is a spacious field and arena. At the beginning of the arena is a threshold that is the abode of that divine command. Whoever has no pass to this threshold, nor a witnessing from the guardian of the threshold, finds it impossible to reach the arena, let alone attain what lies beyond it of lofty visions. Therefore, it is said: “Whoever does not know himself does not know his Lord.” How could this be found in the storehouse of physicians? And from where would a physician observe it? Rather, the meaning called “spirit” by the physician, in relation to this divine command, is like the ball moved by the king’s scepter in relation to the king. So whoever knows the medical spirit and thinks he has grasped the divine command is like one who sees the ball moved by the king’s scepter and thinks he has seen the king, and there is no doubt that his error is grave, and this error is far graver. And since the intellects by which obligation is established and by which worldly interests are perceived are intellects deficient in contemplating the essence of this matter, God did not permit His Messenger (peace be upon him) to speak about it; rather, He commanded him to speak to people according to their intellects. God did not mention anything of the reality of this matter in His Book, but He mentioned its relation.

His action is mentioned, though His essence is not. As for His attribution, it is in His saying, exalted is He: "From the command of my Lord." As for His action, it is mentioned in His saying, exalted is He: "O soul at peace, return to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing. Enter among My servants, and enter My Paradise." Let us now return to the purpose, for the intent is to mention the blessings of God, exalted is He, in eating. We have already mentioned some of God's blessings, exalted is He, in the instruments of eating.

(The Fourth Aspect: Concerning the blessings of God, exalted is He, in the sources from which foods are obtained and become suitable for man to subsequently prepare through his craft.)

Know that foods are many, and God, exalted is He, has created in them countless wonders and successive, endless causes. To mention this for every food would be lengthy, for foods are either medicines, or fruits, or nourishments. Let us take the nourishments, for they are the foundation, and from their totality, let us take a single grain of wheat, leaving aside all other nourishments. We say: If you found a grain or grains and ate them, they would perish and you would remain hungry. How greatly you would need that grain to grow in itself, increase, and multiply until it suffices for your complete need. So God, exalted is He, created within the grain of wheat powers by which it is nourished, just as He created within you. For the plant only differs from you in sensation and movement; it does not differ from you in nourishment, for it is nourished by water and draws it into its interior via roots, just as you are nourished and draw sustenance. We will not elaborate on describing the plant's instruments for drawing nourishment to itself, but will allude to its nourishment. We say: Just as wood and earth do not nourish you, but you require specific food, so too the grain is not nourished by everything; rather, it requires something specific. This is evidenced by the fact that if you left it in a house, it would not increase, for only air surrounds it, and mere air is not suitable for its nourishment. If you left it in water, it would not increase. If you left it in earth with no water, it would not increase. Rather, it must be in earth containing water, so that its water mixes with the earth and becomes mud. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "Then let man look at his food: We poured down water in abundance, then We split the earth wide open, and caused to grow therein grain, and vines, and herbs, and olives, and palms." Then water and earth alone are not sufficient, for if it were left in damp, solid, compacted earth, it would not sprout due to the lack of air. Thus, it needs to be placed in loose, crumbly earth into which air can penetrate. Then, the air does not move to it by itself, so it needs a wind to move the air and strike it with force and violence upon the earth so that it penetrates it. To this is the allusion in His saying, exalted is He: "And We send the fertilizing winds." Their fertilization lies in effecting the coupling between air, water, and earth. Yet all of that would not benefit you if it were in extreme cold and harsh winter, so you need the heat of spring and summer. Thus, the need of its nourishment for these four [elements] has become clear. Consider what each one requires. Water needs to flow to the land of cultivation from seas, springs, rivers, and streams. Consider how God created the seas, made springs gush forth, and caused rivers to flow from them. Then the land may be elevated, and the waters do not rise to it. Consider how God, exalted is He, created the clouds and how He subjected the winds to drive them, by His leave, to the regions of the earth—clouds heavy and laden with water. Then consider how He sends it down pouring upon the lands in the time of spring and autumn according to need. Consider how He created the mountains as reservoirs for water, from which springs gush forth gradually. Had they emerged all at once, the lands would have flooded, and crops and livestock perished. The blessings of God in the mountains, clouds, seas, and rains cannot be enumerated. As for heat, it does not arise between water and earth, for both are cold. Consider how He subjugated the sun and how He created it, despite its distance from the earth, to heat the earth at one time and not another, so that cold occurs when cold is needed and heat when heat is needed. This is one of the wisdoms of the sun, and the wisdoms in it are too numerous to count. Then, when the plant rises above the earth, the fruits require firmness and solidity to form, so they need moisture to ripen them. Consider how He created the moon and made among its specific properties moistening, just as He made among the specific properties of the sun heating. Thus, it ripens the fruits and colors them by the decree of the Creator, the Wise. For this reason, if trees were in a shade that prevented the rising of the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies upon them, they would be corrupt and deficient. Indeed, a small tree becomes corrupt if a large tree shades it. You may recognize the moistening of the moon by exposing your head to it at night; moisture, expressed as a cold, will overcome your head. Just as it moistens your head, it also moistens the fruit. We shall not prolong discussion of what cannot be fully encompassed, but say: Every celestial body in the sky...

Indeed, He has subjugated each kind for a benefit, just as the sun is subjugated for heating and the moon for moistening, so not one of them is devoid of numerous wisdoms which human strength cannot enumerate. Were it not so, their creation would have been in vain and futile, and the saying of the Exalted would not hold true: "Our Lord, You have not created this in vain" (Qur'an 3:191), and His Mighty and Majestic saying: "We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in play" (Qur'an 21:16). And just as there is no limb in the limbs of your body except for a benefit, so there is no limb in the limbs of the body of the world except for a benefit. The entire world is like a single person, and its individual bodies are like limbs for it, cooperating as the limbs of your body cooperate within the totality of your body. Elaborating on this would be lengthy.

You should not think that believing the stars, the sun, and the moon are subjugated by the command of God, the Exalted, in matters made to be causes for them by the decree of Wisdom, contradicts the Sacred Law due to what is reported therein of the prohibition against believing the astrologers and against the science of the stars. Rather, what is prohibited regarding the stars is two matters: First, that you believe they are agents producing their effects independently and that they are not subjugated under the management of a Manager who created and overpowered them—this is disbelief. Second, believing the astrologers in the details of what they inform about of effects which all of creation does not commonly perceive, for they say that out of ignorance. Indeed, the knowledge of the decrees of the stars was a miracle for some of the prophets, peace be upon them, then that knowledge became effaced, so nothing remained except what is mixed, wherein correctness is not distinguished from error. Thus, believing the planets are causes for effects that occur by the creation of God, the Exalted, on earth, in plants, and in animals, is not detrimental to the religion; rather, it is true. But claiming knowledge of those effects in detail while being ignorant is detrimental to the religion.

Therefore, if you have a garment you washed and wish to dry it, and someone else says to you, "Take out the garment and spread it, for the sun has risen and the day has grown hot, and the air [is favorable]," you are not obliged to disbelieve him, nor are you obliged to deny him by attributing the heat of the air to the rising of the sun. And if you ask about a change in a person's face and he says, "The sun struck me on the road, so my face darkened," you are not obliged to disbelieve him in that. Judge by this all other effects, except that some effects are known and some are unknown. The unknown is not permissible to claim knowledge of. The known: some of it is known to all people, like the occurrence of light and heat with the rising of the sun; and some of it is known to some people, like the occurrence of a cold with the rising of the moon. Therefore, the celestial bodies were not created in vain; rather, within them are numerous, uncountable wisdoms.

For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, looked at the sky and recited the saying of the Exalted: "Our Lord, You have not created this in vain; glory be to You! So protect us from the punishment of the Fire" (Qur'an 3:191). Then he, peace be upon him, said: "Woe to one who recites this verse and then wipes his mustache with it." Its meaning is that he recites and leaves off contemplation, limiting his understanding of the dominion of the heavens to knowing the color of the sky and the light of the stars—and that is something even beasts know. So whoever is content with knowing only that is the one who has wiped his mustache with it. For God, the Exalted, in the dominion of the heavens, the horizons, the souls, and the animals, has wonders which those who love God, the Exalted, seek to know. For whoever loves a scholar is constantly occupied with seeking his compositions to increase, by further standing before the wonders of his knowledge, in love for him. Such is the affair with the wonders of God's, the Exalted, craftsmanship, for the entire world is from His composition. Indeed, the composition of composers is from His composition which He composed by means of the hearts of His servants. So if you marvel at a composition, do not marvel at the composer, but at the One who subjugated the composer for his composition by what He bestowed upon him of His guidance, correction, and instruction. Just as if you see the puppets of a magician dancing and moving in measured, proportionate movements, do not marvel at the puppets, for they are moved puppets, not movers. But marvel at the skill of the magician who moves them by subtle, hidden strings. Therefore, the intended meaning is that the nourishment of plants is not complete except by water, air, the sun, the moon, and the stars, and that is not complete except by the celestial spheres in which they are fixed, and the spheres are not complete except by their movements, and their movements are not complete except by celestial angels who move them. And so this continues to distant causes which we have omitted mentioning, indicating by what we have mentioned what we have omitted. Let us limit ourselves to this in mentioning the causes of plant nourishment.

(The Fifth Aspect: On the Graces of God, the Exalted, in the Means that Convey Food to You)
Know that all these foods are not found in every place; rather, they have specific conditions for which they exist in some places and not others. People are spread across the face of the earth, and foods may be distant from them, with seas and deserts intervening between them and the food. So observe how God, the Exalted, has subjugated the merchants and imposed upon them the greed of love for wealth and the desire for profit, while in most cases nothing suffices them, but...

They gather wealth, only for ships to sink with it, or for highway robbers to plunder it, or for them to die in some lands, whereupon rulers seize it. The best of their situations is that their heirs take it—and they are their fiercest enemies, if only they knew. So observe how God has subjected them to ignorance and heedlessness, such that they endure hardships in pursuit of profit, risk dangers, and gamble with their lives by sailing the seas. They carry foods and various necessities from the farthest East and West to you. And observe how God, exalted is He, taught them the craft of shipbuilding and the manner of sailing them. And observe how He created animals and subdued them for riding and carrying loads across deserts. Look at the camel, how it was created; at the horse, how it was endowed with swift movement; at the donkey, how it was made patient with fatigue; and at the camels, how they traverse deserts and cover stages under heavy burdens while hungry and thirsty. And observe how God, exalted is He, set them in motion by means of ships and animals on land and sea, to carry to you foods and all other necessities. Ponder what the animals require in terms of their provisions, tools, and fodder, and what the ships require. Indeed, God, exalted is He, created all of that to the extent of need and beyond need. Enumerating it is not possible, and this extends to matters beyond counting, which we omit for the sake of brevity.

(Sixth Aspect: On the Preparation of Foods)
Know that what grows in the earth from plants and what is created of animals cannot be bitten and eaten as they are. Rather, each one inevitably requires preparation, cooking, combining, and cleaning by discarding some parts and keeping others, among countless other matters. To detail this for every food would be lengthy, so let us take a single loaf of bread and consider what is needed for that one loaf to become round and suitable for eating, from after the seed is cast into the earth. First, the farmer is needed to plow and prepare the earth, then the ox that tills the soil, the plow, and all its implements. Then, after that, the tending by watering for a period, then clearing the earth of weeds, then harvesting, then threshing and cleaning, then grinding, then kneading the dough, then baking. So reflect on the number of these actions we have mentioned and those we have not, and the number of persons performing them, and the number of tools required from iron, wood, stone, and other materials. And look at the work of craftsmen in preparing the tools of plowing, grinding, and baking—from carpenter and blacksmith and others. And consider the blacksmith’s need for iron, lead, and copper. And observe how God, exalted is He, created mountains, stones, and minerals, and how He made the earth in adjoining, varied pieces. If you investigate, you will know that a single loaf does not become round and suitable for your eating, O poor one, unless more than a thousand craftsmen have worked upon it. Begin from the King who drives the clouds to release water, down to the last of the works from the side of the angels, until the turn reaches the work of man. When it becomes round, its requirement approaches nearly seven thousand craftsmen, each craftsman a foundation among the foundations of crafts by which the welfare of creation is perfected. Then ponder the multitude of human actions in those tools, to the extent that the needle—a small tool whose benefit is sewing the garment that protects you from cold—its form is not completed from iron suitable for a needle except after passing through the hands of the needle-maker twenty-five times, undertaking a task each time. If God, exalted is He, had not gathered the lands and subdued the servants, and you were in need of making the sickle with which you harvest wheat, for example, after it grows, your lifetime would expire and you would be incapable of it. Do you not see how God has guided His servant, whom He created from a filthy drop, to perform these wondrous works and strange crafts? Look at the scissors, for example: two matching blades, one closing upon the other, so they take the thing together and cut it swiftly. Had God, exalted is He, not unveiled the way of making it through His grace and generosity to those before us, and we were in need of deducing the method for it through our thought, then extracting iron from stone, and obtaining the tools with which the scissors are made—even if one of us had the lifespan of Noah and were given the most complete intellects, his life would fall short of deducing the method for perfecting this tool alone, let alone others. So glory be to Him who joined the sighted with the blind, and glory be to Him who withheld [prophethood] from the prophets despite this clarity. Now consider if your town were devoid of, for example, the miller, or the blacksmith, or the cupper—who is the lowliest of workers—or the weaver, or any one from the totality of craftsmen, what harm would befall you and how all your affairs would be thrown into disorder. So glory be to Him who subdued some servants to others, such that His will is accomplished through them and His wisdom is perfected. Let us also be brief in this class, for the purpose is to alert to the blessings.

Without exhaustive enumeration.
                      (The Seventh Aspect: On the Reformers of Affairs)

Know that these craftsmen who reform foods and other matters—if their opinions were to diverge and their natures were to clash, clashing like the natures of wild beasts, they would be scattered and distanced, and none would benefit from another. Rather, they would be like wild beasts, not contained in a single place nor united by a single purpose. So observe how God, Exalted is He, has harmonized their hearts and subjected them to familiarity and love: "If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have harmonized their hearts, but God harmonized them." Thus, for the sake of harmony and the mutual recognition of spirits, they gathered and united, building cities and towns, arranging dwellings and houses close and neighboring, and organizing markets, caravanserais, and all other kinds of places, the enumeration of which would be lengthy. Then, this love vanishes due to objectives they compete for and vie over, for in human nature lie anger, envy, and rivalry, which lead to fighting and discord. So observe how God, Exalted is He, empowered rulers and supported them with strength, preparation, and means, casting their awe into the hearts of the subjects until they submitted to them willingly and unwillingly, and how He guided the rulers to the path of reforming the lands until they arranged the parts of a land as if they were parts of a single person, cooperating for a single purpose, each part benefiting from the others. Thus, they appointed chiefs, judges, prisons, and market overseers, compelling the creation to the law of justice and obliging them to mutual assistance and cooperation, until the blacksmith benefits from the butcher, the baker, and all the people of the town, and all of them benefit from the blacksmith; and the cupper benefits from the plowman, and the plowman from the cupper, and each one benefits from every other due to their arrangement, gathering, and discipline under the order and gathering of the ruler, just as all the limbs of the body cooperate and some benefit from others. And observe how He sent the prophets, peace be upon them, until they reformed the rulers who reform the subjects, and taught them the laws of the Sacred Law in preserving justice among creation and the laws of governance in controlling them, and they unveiled from the rulings of leadership and sovereignty and the rulings of jurisprudence that by which they were guided to reforming the world, let alone what they directed them to in reforming religion. And observe how God, Exalted is He, reformed the prophets through the angels, and how the angels reformed one another until it culminates in the intimate angel who has no intermediary between him and God, Exalted is He. Thus, the baker bakes the dough, the miller reforms the grain by grinding, the plowman reforms it by harvesting, the blacksmith reforms the tools of the plowman, the carpenter reforms the tools of the blacksmith, and likewise all masters of crafts who reform the tools of foods; and the ruler reforms the craftsmen, and the prophets reform the scholars who are their heirs, and the scholars reform the rulers, and the angels reform the prophets until it culminates in the presence of Lordship, which is the fountainhead of every order, the dawning place of every beauty and comeliness, and the origin of every arrangement and composition. All of that is a favor from the Lord of lords and the Causer of causes. Were it not for His grace and generosity when He, Exalted is He, said: "And those who strive in Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways," we would not have been guided to this small portion of the favors of God, Exalted is He. And were it not that He prevented us from aspiring with the eye of greed to encompass the reality of His favors, we would have yearned to seek encompassing and exhaustive enumeration. But He, Exalted is He, prevented us by the decree of overpowering might and power, as He, Exalted is He, said: "And if you should count the favors of God, you could not enumerate them." So if we speak, it is by His permission we expand; and if we are silent, it is by His overpowering we contract. For there is no giver of what He withholds, and no withholder of what He gives, for in every moment of life before death we hear with the hearing of the hearts the call of the Compelling Sovereign: "To whom belongs the dominion this day? To God, the One, the Overpowering." So praise be to God who distinguished us from the disbelievers and made us hear this call before the expiration of lifespans.

    (The Eighth Aspect: On Clarifying the Favor of God, Exalted is He, in Creating the Angels, peace be upon them)

What has preceded concerning the favor of God in creating the angels by reforming the prophets, peace be upon them, guiding them, and delivering revelation to them is not hidden from you. And do not think that their actions are limited to that extent alone. Rather, the categories of angels, despite their multitude and the ordering of their ranks, are generally confined to three categories: the earthly angels, the heavenly angels, and the bearers of the Throne. So observe how God, Exalted is He, has entrusted them with you concerning what relates to eating and nourishment that we have mentioned, apart from what goes beyond that of guidance, instruction, and others. And know that every part of your body, indeed every part of a plant, does not receive nourishment except that seven angels are entrusted with it—that being the least—up to ten, up to a hundred, up to beyond that.

The explanation is that nourishment means one part of the food replaces another part that has perished. That food ultimately becomes blood, then turns into flesh and bone. Once it becomes flesh and bone, your nourishment is complete. Blood and flesh are bodies without power, knowledge, or choice; they do not move by themselves nor change by themselves. Mere natural disposition is insufficient for their progression through stages, just as wheat by itself does not become flour, then dough, then a round, baked loaf except through a craftsman. Similarly, blood by itself does not become flesh, bone, veins, and nerves except through a craftsman. The craftsmen inwardly are the angels, just as the craftsmen outwardly are the people of the town. God Almighty has bestowed upon you blessings both apparent and hidden, so you should not be heedless of His hidden blessings.

I say there must be an angel who draws the nourishment to the vicinity of the flesh and bone, for nourishment does not move by itself. There must be another angel who holds the nourishment in its place. There must be a third who clothes it with the form of blood. There must be a fourth who covers it with the form of flesh and veins or bone. There must be a fifth who expels the excess beyond the need of the nourishment. There must be a sixth who attaches what has acquired the quality of bone to the bone and what has acquired the quality of flesh to the flesh, so that it is not separated. There must be a seventh who oversees the measures in attachment, joining to the round what does not nullify its roundness, to the broad what does not remove its breadth, and to the hollow what does not void its hollowness, preserving for each its due measure of need. For if, for example, nourishment were gathered on the child’s nose as much as is gathered on his thigh, his nose would become large, its hollowness would be nullified, and its form and creation would be deformed. Rather, it must be conveyed to the eyelids despite their thinness, to the pupil despite its clarity, to the thighs despite their thickness, and to the bone despite its hardness, what is suitable for each in terms of measure and shape; otherwise the form would be corrupted, some places would swell, and some would weaken. Indeed, if this just angel did not observe this distribution and apportioning, and conveyed to the child’s head and the rest of his body from the nourishment what causes growth, except to one leg for example, that leg would remain as it was in its state of smallness while the entire body grew large. Then you would see a person with the bulk of a man but with one leg like that of a child, so he would not benefit from himself at all. The observance of this geometry in this distribution is entrusted to an angel from the angels. Do not think that blood by its nature engineers its own form, for one who attributes these matters to nature is ignorant and does not know what he says. These are the earthly angels, and they are occupied with you while you rest in sleep and wander in heedlessness, yet they rectify the nourishment within you without you having any awareness of them. This is in every part of your being that is indivisible, until some parts like the eye and the heart require more than a hundred angels—we have omitted detailing that for brevity.

The earthly angels receive support from the heavenly angels in a known order, whose essence is comprehended only by God Almighty. The heavenly angels receive support from the bearers of the Throne, and the Benefactor upon all of them with empowerment, guidance, and rectification is the Guardian, the Holy, the One unique in sovereignty and dominion, might and majesty, the Compeller of the heavens and the earth, the Owner of the Kingdom, Possessor of Glory and Honor. The reports concerning the angels entrusted with the heavens and the earth, and the parts of plants and animals—even every drop of rain and every cloud drifting from one side to another—are too numerous to count, so we have omitted citing them.

If you say: Why were these actions not entrusted to a single angel, and why do I need seven angels? Wheat also needs one to grind it first, then one to separate the bran from it and expel the waste second, then one to pour water on it third, then one to knead it fourth, then one to divide it into round lumps fifth, then one to flatten them into broad loaves sixth, then one to stick them to the oven seventh. Yet all that may be undertaken by a single man who manages it alone. So why are the works of the angels inwardly not like the works of humans outwardly? Know that the creation of the angels differs from the creation of humans. There is not one of them except that he is singular in attribute, with no mixture or composition at all. Thus each of them has only one action, alluded to in His saying, exalted is He: "And there is none of us except that he has a known station." Therefore, there is no rivalry or fighting among them. Rather, their example in the specification of each one’s rank and action is like the example of the five senses: sight does not compete with hearing in perceiving sounds, nor does smell compete with them, nor do they contend over smell. It is not like the hand and foot, for you may strike weakly with the toes of the foot and thereby compete with the hand, or you may strike another with your head and thereby compete with the hand.

It is an instrument for striking, unlike a single human who personally undertakes grinding, kneading, and baking. This represents a kind of deviation and swerving from justice, caused by the differing attributes and varying motives of man. For he is not singular in attribute, and thus cannot be singular in action. Therefore, we see man obeying God at one time and disobeying Him at another, due to the variance of his motives and attributes. This is not possible in the nature of the angels; rather, they are created for obedience—may God be pleased with him, peace be upon him, may God be pleased with him, may God be pleased with him, may God be pleased with him—there is no scope for disobedience in their case. Thus, they do not disobey God in what He commands them, and they do what they are commanded, glorifying Him night and day without ceasing. The one bowing among them is ever bowing, the one prostrating is ever prostrating, the one standing is ever standing; there is no variation in their actions, nor any weariness. Each one has a known station which he does not transgress, and their obedience to God Almighty, from a place where there is no scope for opposition within them, can be likened to the obedience of your limbs to you. For whenever you decisively will to open the eyelids, the sound eyelid does not hesitate or differ, obeying you at one time and disobeying you at another; rather, it is as if it awaits your command, and thus it opens and closes continuously at your signal. This resembles it in one aspect but differs in another, for the eyelid has no knowledge of the movement it performs, whether opening or closing, while the angels are living beings who know what they do. Therefore, this is God's blessing upon you in the earthly and heavenly angels, and your need for them is only for the purpose of eating, apart from all other movements and needs. We have not prolonged mentioning them, for this is another category of blessings, and the totality of categories cannot be enumerated, let alone the individual items encompassed within the totalities of categories. Thus, God Almighty has showered His blessings upon you, both apparent and hidden. Then He said: "And leave the outward sin and the inward." (Qur'an 6:120) Abandoning the inward sin, which the creation does not recognize—such as envy, ill thoughts, innovation, harboring malice towards people, and other sins of the hearts—is gratitude for the hidden blessings. And abandoning outward sin with the limbs is gratitude for the apparent blessing. Nay, I say: whoever disobeys God Almighty, even in a single trifle, such as opening his eyelid where lowering the gaze is obligatory, has indeed disbelieved in every blessing of God Almighty upon him in the heavens and the earth and what is between them. For everything God Almighty has created, even the angels, the heavens, the earth, animals, and plants in their entirety, is a blessing upon every one of the servants, by which his benefit is perfected, even if others also benefit from it. For God Almighty has in every trifle of the eyelid two blessings: in the eyelid itself, for He created beneath each eyelid muscles with tendons and ligaments connected to the nerves of the brain, by which the lowering of the upper lid and the raising of the lower lid is accomplished; and on each eyelid are black lashes, and God's blessing in their blackness is that they gather the light of the eye, for whiteness scatters light and blackness gathers it; and God's blessing in their arrangement in a single row is that it is a barrier against creeping insects from crawling into the inner eye and a trap for the specks that scatter in the air. And in each hair of them are two blessings: from the softness of its root, and with the softness, the firmness of its erectness. And in the interlocking of the lashes is a blessing greater than all: that the dust of the air might prevent the opening of the eye, and if it were closed, one would not see; so the eyelids gather to the extent that the lashes interlace, and one looks from behind the lattice of hair, so the lattice of hair prevents the reach of debris from outside, yet does not prevent the extension of sight from within. Then, if dust reaches the pupil, the edges of the eyelids are created as servants, closing over the pupil like a polisher for a mirror, so it closes once or twice, and the pupil is polished from the dust, and the debris exits to the corners of the eye. And the fly, since its pupil has no eyelid, He created for it two hands, so you see it constantly wiping its pupils with them to polish them from dust. Since we have left off exhaustive detail of the blessings due to its need for elaboration exceeding the original scope of this book—and perhaps we will resume for it a dedicated book if time permits and success aids, which we shall call "The Wonders of God Almighty's Creation"—let us return to our purpose and say: Whoever looks at what is forbidden has disbelieved, by the opening of the eye, in God Almighty's blessing in the eyelids. And the eyelids are not sustained except by the eye, nor the eye except by the head, nor the head except by the entire body, nor the body except by nourishment, nor nourishment except by water, earth, air, rain, clouds, the sun, and the moon, nor does anything of that stand except by the heavens, nor the heavens except by the angels. For the whole is like a single thing, its parts interconnected like the limbs of the body, one with another. Thus, he has disbelieved in every blessing in existence from...

The farthest reaches of the Pleiades to the farthest depths of the earth—there remains no celestial sphere nor dominion, no animal nor plant nor inanimate object, except that it curses him. Hence, it is reported in the traditions: "The place where people gather will either curse them when they disperse or seek forgiveness for them." Likewise, it is reported that everything seeks forgiveness for the scholar, even the fish in the sea, and that the angels curse the disobedient in numerous expressions beyond enumeration. All this indicates that the disobedient, in a single instant, has wronged all that is in the dominion and the kingdom, and has destroyed himself—unless he follows a misdeed with a good deed that erases it, so the curse is exchanged for forgiveness. Then perhaps God will accept his repentance and pardon him.

And God Almighty revealed to Job, peace be upon him: "O Job, there is no servant of Mine from among the children of Adam except that two angels are with him. When he thanks Me for My blessings, the two angels say: 'O God, increase him in blessings upon blessings, for You are worthy of praise and thanks. Be near to the thankful.' Sufficient is the high station of the thankful, and with Me, I thank their thanks, and My angels supplicate for them, and the places love them, and the traces weep for them."

And just as you know that in every blink of an eye there are many blessings, know that in every breath that expands and contracts there are two blessings: with its expansion, the burnt smoke exits from the heart, and were it not to exit, he would perish; and with its contraction, it gathers the spirit of air to the heart, and were its passage blocked, his heart would burn from the cessation of the spirit of air and its coolness from it, and he would perish. Indeed, the day and night are twenty-four hours, and in every hour there are nearly a thousand breaths, and every breath is nearly ten instants. Thus, upon you in every instant are thousands upon thousands of blessings in every part of your body—nay, in every part of the world. Consider, then, can enumerating that be conceived or not?

And when the reality of God's saying, exalted is He, "And if you should count the favors of God, you could not enumerate them" was unveiled to Moses, peace be upon him, he said: "My Lord, how can I thank You when for every hair on my body there are two blessings: that You softened its root and that You smoothed its tip?" Likewise, it is reported in the tradition: "Whoever does not recognize God's blessings in his food and drink, his knowledge is little and his punishment is imminent." All that we have mentioned returns to food and drink, so consider other blessings by them, for the insightful one does not cast his eye upon anything in the world, nor does his thought touch upon any existent, except that he realizes God has a blessing for him therein. So let us leave exhaustive detail, for that is aspiring to the unattainable.

(Explanation of the Reason Turning Creation Away from Gratitude)

Know that nothing has caused creation to fall short in gratitude for blessings except ignorance and heedlessness. For they are prevented by ignorance and heedlessness from recognizing the blessings, and gratitude for a blessing cannot be conceived except after recognizing it. Then, if they recognize a blessing, they think that gratitude for it is to say with their tongue, 'Praise be to God, thanks be to God,' and they do not know that the meaning of gratitude is to employ the blessing in fulfilling the wisdom for which it was intended, which is obedience to God, mighty and majestic. So nothing prevents gratitude after attaining these two recognitions except the overpowering of desire and the domination of Satan.

As for heedlessness toward blessings, it has causes. One of its causes is that people, due to their ignorance, do not count as a blessing that which is common to creation and granted to them in all their states. Therefore, they are not grateful for the totality of blessings we mentioned, because they are general for creation, lavished upon them in all their states. So each individual among them does not see a particular distinction for himself, thus he does not count it as a blessing. You do not see them thanking God for the spirit of air, yet if their breath were seized for a moment until air was cut off from them, they would die. If they were confined in a steam room with hot air or in a well with air heavy from water's moisture, they would die of distress. If one of them were afflicted with something of that, then delivered, he might consider that a blessing and thank God for it. This is the height of ignorance, for their gratitude becomes contingent upon the blessing being stripped from them, then returned to them in some circumstances, while the blessing in all circumstances is more deserving of gratitude in some of them. Thus, you do not see the insightful one grateful for the health of his sight until his eyes go blind. Then, if his sight were restored to him, he would perceive it, be grateful for it, and count it a blessing. Since God's mercy is vast, He generalized it for creation and lavished it upon them in all circumstances, but the ignorant one does not count it a blessing.

This ignorant one is like a wicked servant whose due is to be beaten constantly, so that if he is left unbeaten for an hour, he considers it a favor. If he is left unbeaten perpetually, insolence overcomes him and he leaves off gratitude. Thus, people only give thanks for wealth, due to the specificity that comes from its abundance or scarcity, and they forget all the blessings of God Almighty upon them. As one complained of his poverty to a person of insight and showed intense grief over it, he said to him: "Would it please you to be blind and have ten thousand dirhams?" He said: "No." He said: "Would it please you to be mute and have ten thousand dirhams?" He said: "No." He said: "Would it please you that I cut off your hands and feet and you have...

Twenty thousand, to which he said no. Then he was asked, "Would you be pleased to be insane and have ten thousand dirhams?" He said no. Then it was said, "Are you not ashamed to complain against your Lord when He has fifty thousand worth of goods in your possession?" It is related that a certain reciter was so severely afflicted by poverty that he became utterly distressed. In a dream, he saw a speaker saying to him, "Would you like us to make you forget Surah al-An'am and give you a thousand dinars?" He said no. "Then Surah Hud?" He said no. "Then Surah Yusuf?" He said no. The speaker enumerated surahs to him, then said, "So you possess the equivalent of a hundred thousand dinars, yet you complain?" He awoke relieved. Ibn al-Sammak entered upon a caliph who was holding a cup of water to drink. He said to him, "Admonish me." Ibn al-Sammak said, "If this drink were not given to you except in exchange for all your wealth, and otherwise you would remain thirsty, would you give it?" He said yes. "And if it were not given except for your entire kingdom, would you relinquish it?" He said yes. He said, "Then do not rejoice in a kingdom that is not worth a drink of water." This shows that God's blessing upon a servant in a drink of water when thirsty is greater than possessing the entire earth. Since human nature tends to value specific blessings over general ones, and we have mentioned the general blessings, let us briefly indicate the specific blessings. We say: There is no servant who, if he reflects deeply on his own conditions, does not see from God a blessing or many blessings specific to him, not shared by all people, but shared by a small number, or perhaps by no one else. Every servant acknowledges this in three matters: in intellect, character, and knowledge. As for intellect, there is no servant of God but that he is content with God regarding his intellect, believing himself to be the most intelligent of people. Few ask God for intellect. Among the nobility of intellect is that one who lacks it rejoices in it just as one endowed with it does. If he believes he is the most intelligent of people, it is incumbent upon him to give thanks, for if it is so, gratitude is obligatory, and if it is not but he believes it to be so, it is a blessing for him. If someone places a treasure underground, he rejoices in it and is grateful for it. If the treasure is taken without his knowledge, his joy remains according to his belief, and his gratitude remains because in his view it is as if it still exists. As for character, there is no servant who does not see in others faults he dislikes and traits he condemns; he condemns them because he sees himself free from them. If he is not occupied with condemning others, he ought to occupy himself with thanking God Almighty for the goodness of his character and for testing others with bad character. As for knowledge, there is no one who does not know the inner aspects of his own affairs and the hidden thoughts he alone possesses. If the veil were lifted so that any creature became aware of it, he would be disgraced—how much more if all people were to see? Therefore, every servant has knowledge of a private matter not shared by any of God's servants. Why then does he not thank God for the beautiful covering He has cast over his faults, revealing the good and concealing the ugly, hiding it from people's eyes and making its knowledge specific to him so that no one becomes aware? These are three specific blessings that every servant acknowledges, either absolutely or in some matters. Let us descend from this level to another, slightly more general level, and say: There is no servant but that God has provided him, in his form, his person, his character, his attributes, his family, his children, his dwelling, his country, his companion, his relatives, his honor, his status, or in all his likes, with things that if they were taken from him and he were given what specifically belongs to another, he would not be content. This is like being made a believer not an unbeliever, alive not inanimate, human not beast, male not female, healthy not sick, sound not defective. All these are specificities, even if they also have generality. If these conditions were exchanged for their opposites, he would not be content. Moreover, he has matters he would not exchange for the conditions of other humans either. That is, either he would not exchange it for what any creature has been specifically given, or he would not exchange it for what the majority have been given. If he would not exchange his own state for that of another, then his state is better than another's. If he does not know a person whose condition he would accept for himself in place of his own, either in general or in a specific matter, then God has blessings upon him that He does not have upon any of His servants besides him. If he would exchange his own state for that of some but not others, let him look at the number of those he considers fortunate; inevitably he will see them as fewer compared to others. Thus, those below him in condition are far more numerous than those above him. Why then does he look at those above him to belittle God's blessings upon himself, and not look at those below him to magnify God's blessings upon him? Why does he not equate his worldly state with his religious state? Does not his soul, when reproaching him for an evil he commits, excuse itself by saying that among the wicked there are many? He always looks in religion at those below him, not above him. Why then does he not look similarly in worldly matters? If the condition of most people in...

If one's religion is better than another's and their worldly condition is superior to that of most people, how can gratitude not be incumbent upon them? For this reason, the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever looks in worldly matters to those below him and in religious matters to those above him, God will record him as patient and grateful. And whoever looks in worldly matters to those above him and in religious matters to those below him, God will not record him as patient or grateful." Therefore, whoever reflects upon their own state and examines the many blessings which God Almighty has specifically bestowed upon them—especially those granted the Sunnah, faith, knowledge, the Qur'an, then leisure, health, security, and the like—will understand. Hence it is said:

            Whoever desires a spacious life, extending
            In his religion and then in his world with prosperity,
            Let him look to one above him in piety,
            And let him look to one below him in wealth.

And the Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever is not enriched by the signs of God, God will not enrich him." This points to the blessing of knowledge. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, the Qur'an is the richness after which there is no need and with which there is no poverty." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever is given the Qur'an by God and thinks that anyone is richer than him has mocked the signs of God." And he ﷺ said: "He is not of us who does not chant the Qur'an." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Certainty suffices as wealth." Some of the early pious said that God Almighty says in some of the revealed scriptures: "A servant whom I have made independent of three things, I have indeed perfected My favor upon him: from a ruler who comes to him, a physician who treats him, and from what is in his brother's hand." A poet expressed this, saying:

            When sustenance comes to you,
            Likewise health and security,
            And you become a brother of grief,
            Then may grief never leave you.

Rather, the most eloquent expressions and the most articulate words are the speech of the most eloquent of those who spoke Arabic, when he ﷺ conveyed this meaning, saying: "Whoever wakes up secure in his home, healthy in his body, with his daily sustenance, it is as if the entire world has been gathered for him." However much you contemplate people, you find them complaining and suffering from matters beyond these three, even though these are detrimental to them, and they do not thank God for these three blessings, nor do they thank God for the blessing of faith, through which they attain eternal bliss and the great dominion. Rather, the insightful person should only rejoice in knowledge, certainty, and faith. Indeed, we know of scholars who, if all that lies within the power of the kings of the earth from east to west—wealth, followers, and supporters—were handed to them and they were told, "Take it in exchange for your knowledge, nay, for a tenth of a tenth of your knowledge," they would not take it, due to their hope that the blessing of knowledge will lead them to nearness to God Almighty in the Hereafter. Indeed, if it were said to them, "You will have in the Hereafter what you hope for in its entirety, so take these worldly pleasures in exchange for your delight in knowledge in this world and your joy in it," they would not take it, knowing that the pleasure of knowledge is everlasting, uninterrupted, enduring—it cannot be stolen, usurped, or competed for—and it is pure, without any impurity. All worldly pleasures are deficient, tainted, and troubled; their hoped-for benefit does not match their feared harm, their pleasure does not match their pain, nor their joy their sorrow. Thus it has been until now, and thus it will be for as long as time remains. For worldly pleasures were only created to attract deficient intellects and deceive them, until, when they are deceived and bound by them, they turn against them and become recalcitrant, like a beautiful woman whose outward appearance adorns herself for a lustful, wealthy youth until, when his heart is bound to her, she becomes recalcitrant and veils herself from him, leaving him in constant toil and perpetual hardship—all due to his delusion by the pleasure of looking at her for a moment. Had he been wise and lowered his gaze, disdaining that pleasure, he would have been safe for his entire life. Thus have the people of the world fallen into the snares and traps of the world. We should not say that the one who turns away from the world suffers patiently from abstaining from it, for the one who inclines toward it also suffers patiently in preserving it, acquiring it, and defending it from thieves. The suffering of the one who turns away leads to pleasure in the Hereafter, while the suffering of the one who inclines leads to pain in the Hereafter. So let the one who turns away from the world recite upon himself the words of God Almighty: "Do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you are suffering, they are suffering as you are suffering, but you hope from God what they do not hope." Therefore, the path of gratitude has been blocked for creation only due to their ignorance of the varieties of blessings, both apparent and hidden, specific and general.

If you ask: "What is the remedy for these heedless hearts so that they may feel the blessings of God Almighty and perhaps give thanks?" I say: As for insightful hearts, their remedy is contemplation upon what we have alluded to regarding the categories of God Almighty's general blessings. As for the dull hearts that do not consider a blessing a blessing unless it specifically benefits them or they feel affliction alongside it, their way is to always look at those below them and do as some of the pious did.

The Sufis, since they would daily visit the houses of the sick, the graveyards, and the places where legal punishments were carried out, would attend the houses of the sick to witness the various tribulations God Almighty had placed upon them. Then they would reflect upon their own health and well-being, causing their hearts to feel the blessing of health when sensing the affliction of diseases, and thus thank God Almighty. They would witness the criminals who were being executed, had their limbs amputated, and were tortured with various punishments, in order to thank God Almighty for His protection from such crimes and those penalties, and to thank Him for the blessing of security. They would attend the graveyards and learn that the dearest thing to the dead would be to return to this world, even for a single day. As for the one who disobeyed God Almighty, let him seek to make amends; and as for the one who obeyed, let him increase in his obedience. For the Day of Resurrection is the Day of Mutual Loss; the obedient one is at a loss when he sees the reward for his obedience and says, "I was capable of more than these acts of obedience, so how great is my loss for having wasted some of my time in permissible matters!" As for the disobedient one, his loss is evident. When he observes the graves and learns that the dearest thing to them is to have remaining from their lifespan what remains for him, he should spend the remainder of his life on that for which the inhabitants of the graves desire to return, so that this becomes a recognition of God Almighty's blessings in the remainder of his life—indeed, in the respite granted with every single breath. When he recognizes that blessing, he gives thanks by spending his life on that for which life was created: provisioning from this world for the Hereafter. This is the remedy for these heedless hearts, so that they may feel the blessings of God Almighty, and perhaps they will give thanks. Indeed, Rabi‘ ibn Khuthaym, despite his complete insight, would seek aid through this method to confirm his recognition. He had dug a grave in his house, would place a collar around his neck, and sleep in his grave. Then he would say, "My Lord, send me back, that I might do righteous deeds." Then he would rise and say, "O Rabi‘, you have been given what you asked for, so act before you ask to return, lest you be sent back and not." Among the things by which hearts distant from gratitude should be treated is to know that a blessing, if not thanked for, will depart and not return. For this reason, al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad, may God have mercy on him, used to say, "You must adhere to gratitude for blessings, for rarely does a blessing depart from a people and then return to them." Some of the pious predecessors said, "Blessings are wild; so restrain them with gratitude." And in the report: "Whenever God Almighty's blessing upon a servant becomes great, the needs of people toward him increase." So whoever is negligent toward them exposes that blessing to removal. And God, glorified and exalted, says: "Indeed, God will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." This completes this pillar. The third pillar from the Book of Patience and Gratitude concerns what is shared between patience and gratitude and how they are interconnected.

(Clarifying the Manner in Which Patience and Gratitude Converge Upon a Single Matter)

Perhaps you will say: What you have mentioned regarding blessings indicates that God Almighty has a blessing in every existent thing, and this suggests that tribulation has no existence at all. So what, then, is the meaning of patience? And if tribulation does exist, what is the meaning of gratitude for tribulation? Some claimants have asserted that we give thanks for tribulation, let alone for blessings. So how can gratitude for tribulation be conceived, and how can one give thanks for that upon which one must be patient? Patience in tribulation necessitates pain, while gratitude necessitates joy, and the two are opposites. And what is the meaning of your statement that God Almighty has a blessing upon His servants in everything He has brought into existence? Know that tribulation exists just as blessings exist. The assertion of the affirmation of blessings necessitates the assertion of the affirmation of tribulation, for they are opposites. Thus, the absence of tribulation is a blessing, and the absence of a blessing is a tribulation. However, it has preceded that blessings are divided into an absolute blessing from every aspect—such as in the Hereafter, like the servant's bliss in dwelling in the proximity of God Almighty, and in this world, like faith, good character, and what aids in them—and into a restricted blessing, from one aspect and not another, like wealth which is sound for religion from one aspect and corrupts it from another. Likewise, tribulation is divided into absolute and restricted. As for the absolute in the Hereafter, it is distance from God Almighty, either for a period or forever. As for in this world, it is disbelief, disobedience, and bad character, which lead to absolute tribulation. As for the restricted, it is like poverty, illness, fear, and all other types of tribulation that are not tribulation in religion but in worldly life. Absolute gratitude is for absolute blessings. As for absolute tribulation in this world, one may not be commanded to have patience upon it, for disbelief is a tribulation and there is no meaning to patience upon it; likewise for disobedience. Rather, it is the right of the disbeliever to abandon his disbelief, and likewise the right of the disobedient. Yes, a disbeliever may not know he is a disbeliever, being like one with an ailment who feels no pain due to unconsciousness or the like, so there is no patience upon it. The disobedient one knows he is disobedient, so upon him is to abandon disobedience. Indeed, for every tribulation that a person is capable of repelling, he is not commanded to have patience upon it. For if...

When a person refrains from water despite prolonged thirst until his suffering becomes severe, he is not commanded to endure it patiently; rather, he is commanded to remove the pain. Patience is only for pain that the servant cannot remove. Therefore, patience in this world pertains to what is not an absolute affliction, for it may be a blessing in one respect. Thus, it is conceivable that the duties of patience and gratitude converge upon it. For instance, wealth may become a cause of a person’s ruin—so much so that he is targeted because of what he possesses and is killed, and his children are killed. Health is likewise: there is no worldly blessing among these blessings that cannot potentially become an affliction, though relative to the individual. Similarly, there is no affliction that cannot potentially become a blessing, but relative to a particular state. For there may be a servant for whom what is best lies in poverty and illness; were his body healthy and his wealth abundant, he would become arrogant and transgress. God Almighty has said: “If God were to expand provision for His servants, they would surely transgress on earth” (42:27). And He said: “No indeed! Truly man becomes insolent when he considers himself self-sufficient” (96:6–7). And He said—glory be to Him: “Indeed, God protects His believing servant from the world while He loves him, just as one of you protects his sick one.” Likewise, a wife, child, relative, and everything we have mentioned among the sixteen categories of blessings—except faith and good character—can be imagined to be an affliction for some people, so their opposites would then be blessings for them. For it was previously established that knowledge is a perfection and a blessing, as it is an attribute of God Almighty. Yet it may be an affliction upon the servant in certain matters, and its absence a blessing. An example is a person’s ignorance of his appointed term, for that is a blessing upon him; were he to know it, his life might become bitter and his grief prolonged thereby. Similarly, his ignorance of what his acquaintances and relatives harbor against him is a blessing upon him; were the veil lifted and he became aware of it, his pain, resentment, envy, and preoccupation with retaliation would increase. Likewise, his ignorance of the blameworthy traits in others is a blessing upon him; were he to know them, he would despise and harm them, and that would be a calamity for him in this world and the hereafter. Indeed, even his ignorance of the praiseworthy traits in others may be a blessing upon him, for perhaps the other is a saint of God Almighty, and he is compelled to harm and insult him. If he knew that and still harmed him, his sin would undoubtedly be greater; for one who harms a prophet or a saint while knowing is not like one who harms while not knowing. Among these is God Almighty’s obscuring of the matter of the Resurrection, His obscuring of the Night of Decree, the hour on Friday, and His obscuring of some major sins—all of that is a blessing, because this ignorance intensifies your motives for seeking and striving. These are aspects of God Almighty’s blessings in ignorance, so what about in knowledge? Since we have said that God Almighty has a blessing in every existent thing, that is true, and it applies to everyone without exception by mere conjecture—except the pains He creates in some people. These too may be a blessing for the one suffering them. If they are not a blessing for him, such as the pain resulting from sin, like cutting one’s own hand or tattooing one’s skin, for he suffers from it while being disobedient in it, and the pain of the disbelievers in the Fire—that is also a blessing, but for others among the servants, not for them, because the misfortunes of some people are benefits for others. Were it not that God Almighty created punishment and punished a group with it, those enjoying comfort would not recognize the value of His blessings, even if their joy in them increased. Thus, the joy of the people of Paradise multiplies when they reflect upon the pains of the people of Hell. Do you not see that the people of this world do not greatly rejoice in the light of the sun, despite their intense need for it, because it is universal and freely given? Nor do they greatly rejoice in gazing at the adornment of the heavens, though it is more beautiful than any garden they strive to cultivate on earth. But because the adornment of the heavens is universal, they do not perceive it and do not rejoice because of it. Therefore, what we have mentioned is confirmed: that God Almighty did not create anything except that there is wisdom in it, and He did not create anything except that there is a blessing in it—either for all His servants or for some of them. Hence, in God Almighty’s creation of affliction there is also a blessing, either for the afflicted one or for others. Therefore, every state cannot be described as an absolute affliction nor an absolute blessing, so upon the servant in it converge two duties: patience and gratitude together.

If you say: “But they are opposites; how can they converge, for there is no patience except upon grief, and no gratitude except upon joy?” Know that a single thing may cause grief from one aspect and joy from another, so patience is from the aspect of grief and gratitude from the aspect of joy. And in every poverty, illness, fear, and affliction in this world, there are five matters about which the heedless ought to rejoice and give thanks. First: every calamity and illness—it can be imagined to be greater than it is, for the decreed things of God Almighty are limitless. Had God Almighty weakened it and increased it, what could repel or prevent it? So let him give thanks that it was not greater in this world. Second: it could have been that his calamity was in his religion. A man said to Sahl—may God be pleased with him—

He, exalted be He, said: A thief entered my house and took my belongings, so I said: Give thanks to God, exalted be He, for if Satan had entered your heart and corrupted your monotheism, what would you have done? For this reason, Jesus, peace be upon him, sought refuge in his supplication when he said: O God, do not make my affliction in my religion. And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said: I have never been afflicted with a trial except that God, exalted be He, had four blessings upon me therein: that it was not in my religion, that it was not greater than it was, that I was not deprived of contentment with it, and that I hope for reward for it. One of the possessors of hearts had a friend whom the ruler imprisoned. He sent to him informing him and complaining to him, so he said to him: Give thanks to God. He struck him, so he sent to him informing him and complaining to him, so he said: Give thanks to God. Then a Magian was brought and imprisoned with him, and he had a stomach ailment. He was shackled, and a ring from his shackle was placed on his leg and a ring on the leg of the Magian. He sent to him, so he said: Give thanks to God. The Magian needed to get up many times, and he needed to get up with him and stand by his head until he relieved himself. He wrote to him about that, so he said: Give thanks to God. He said: Until when is this, and what trial is greater than this? He said: If the girdle that is around his waist were placed around your waist, what would you have done? Therefore, there is no person afflicted with a trial except that if he were to contemplate sincerely the deficiency of his conduct, outwardly and inwardly, toward his Master, he would see that he deserves more than what he has been afflicted with, in this world and the next. And he who deserves that you be struck one hundred lashes, but he limits it to ten, is deserving of thanks. And he who deserves that your hands be cut off, but he leaves one of them, is deserving of thanks. For this reason, a certain shaykh was passing in a street when a basin of ashes was poured on his head, so he prostrated to God, exalted be He, a prostration of thanks. He was asked: What is this prostration? He said: I was expecting that fire would be poured on me, so the limitation to ashes is a blessing. And it was said to one of them: Do not go out to pray for rain, for the rains have been withheld. He said: You consider the rain delayed, and I consider the stones delayed.

If you say: How can I rejoice when I see a group of people whose disobedience is greater than mine, yet they are not afflicted with what I have been afflicted with, even the disbelievers? Then know that the disbeliever has stored up for him what is greater, and he is only given respite so that he may increase in sin and his punishment be prolonged, as God, exalted be He, said: "We only give them respite that they may increase in sin." As for acts of disobedience, how do you know that in the world there is one who is more disobedient than him? Perhaps a thought of improper conduct toward God, exalted be He, and His attributes is greater and more grievous than drinking wine, fornication, and all other sins of the limbs. For this reason, God, exalted be He, said concerning its like: "And you consider it trivial, while with God it is grave." So how do you know that another is more disobedient than you? Then perhaps his punishment has been delayed to the Hereafter and your punishment hastened in this world, so why do you not thank God, exalted be He, for that? This is the third aspect of thankfulness, which is that there is no punishment except that it is conceivable for it to be delayed to the Hereafter. The afflictions of this world are consoled by other means that lessen the affliction, so its impact is lightened. But the affliction of the Hereafter is everlasting, and if it were not everlasting, there is no way to lighten it by consolation, for the means of consolation are completely cut off in the Hereafter for the tormented. And he whose punishment is hastened in this world is not punished a second time, for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When a servant commits a sin and is afflicted with hardship or a trial in this world, God is more generous than to punish him a second time." The fourth is that this affliction and trial were written for him in the Mother of the Book, and it was inevitable that it would reach him. It has reached him, the matter is concluded, and he is relieved of some of it or all of it, so this is a blessing. The fifth is that its reward is greater than it is, for the afflictions of this world are pathways to the Hereafter from two aspects: One is the aspect by which the bitter medicine is a blessing for the sick, and the prevention from means of play is a blessing for the child. For if he were left with play, it would prevent him from knowledge and proper conduct, so he would lose his entire life. Likewise, wealth, family, relatives, and limbs—even the eye, which is the most precious of things—can sometimes be a cause of a person's destruction. Indeed, the intellect, which is the most precious of matters, can be a cause of his destruction. Tomorrow, the atheists will wish they were insane or children and had not used their intellects concerning the religion of God, exalted be He. There is nothing from these means that exists for the servant except that it is conceivable for there to be in it a religious good for him. So he must think well of God, exalted be He, and deem it to contain good and thank Him for it, for the wisdom of God is vast, and He is more knowledgeable of the welfare of His servants than the servants are. Tomorrow, the servants will thank Him for the trials when they see God's reward for the trials, just as the child, after attaining intellect and maturity, thanks his teacher and his father for striking and disciplining him when he perceives the fruit of what he gained from the discipline. And the trial from God, exalted be He, is a discipline.

His care for His servants is more perfect and abundant than the care of parents for their children. It has been narrated that a man said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "Advise me." He said, "Do not suspect God regarding anything He has decreed for you." And he, peace be upon him, looked towards the sky and laughed. When asked, he said, "I marvel at God the Exalted's decree for the believer. If He decrees ease for him, he is content and it is good for him. And if He decrees hardship for him, he is content and it is good for him."

The second aspect is that the chief of destructive sins is love of this world, and the chief cause of salvation is the heart's detachment from the abode of delusion. When blessings come in accordance with one's desire, unmixed with trial and affliction, it causes the heart to become tranquil with this world and its means, and to find comfort in it, until it becomes like Paradise in his sight. Thus, his tribulation at death becomes immense due to his separation from it. When afflictions befall him frequently, his heart is agitated away from the world, finds no rest in it, and takes no comfort in it. It becomes a prison for him, and his salvation from it is the utmost delight, like deliverance from prison. For this reason, he, peace be upon him, said, "The world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the disbeliever." The disbeliever is everyone who turns away from God the Exalted, desires nothing but the worldly life, is content with it, and finds tranquility in it. The believer is everyone whose heart is severed from the world, intensely yearning to depart from it. Disbelief is partly manifest and partly hidden. According to the measure of love for the world in the heart, hidden polytheism flows within it. Indeed, the absolute monotheist is he who loves nothing but the One True God. Therefore, in affliction there are blessings from this perspective, so one must rejoice in it. As for the feeling of pain, it is inevitable. This is akin to your joy when in need of cupping, at someone who performs your cupping for free, or gives you a beneficial but bitter medicine for free. You feel pain and you rejoice, so you endure the pain and thank him for the cause of joy. Every worldly tribulation is analogous to medicine that pains in the present but benefits in the end. Rather, whoever enters the abode of a king for enjoyment and knows he must inevitably leave it, then sees a beautiful face that will not depart with him from the abode, that is a calamity and tribulation upon him, for it causes him to feel at home in a dwelling where he cannot remain. If, while residing there, there was a danger that the king might discover him and punish him, and then something he disliked befell him that repelled him from staying, that would be a blessing for him. The world is an abode. People entered it through the door of the womb and they will leave it through the door of the grave. Everything that confirms their comfort in the abode is a tribulation, and everything that agitates their hearts away from it and severs their comfort with it is a blessing. Whoever knows this, it is conceivable that he gives thanks for afflictions. Whoever does not recognize these blessings in tribulation, it is inconceivable that he gives thanks, for thanks necessarily follows recognition of the blessing. Whoever does not believe that the reward of the calamity is greater than the calamity itself, it is inconceivable that he gives thanks for the calamity.

It is related that a Bedouin condoled Ibn Abbas for his father, saying:
    Be patient, and we will be patient with you, for indeed
    The patience of the subjects follows the patience of the leader.
    The reward you have after al-Abbas is better than al-Abbas,
    And God is better for al-Abbas than you.
Ibn Abbas said, "No one has condoled me better than his condolence."

The reports concerning patience over calamities are numerous. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Whomever God desires good for, He afflicts him." And he, peace be upon him, said, "God the Exalted said: 'When I direct a calamity to a servant of Mine concerning his body, his wealth, or his child, and then he meets it with beautiful patience, I would be ashamed on the Day of Resurrection to set up a scale for him or to spread out a record for him.'" And upon him be peace said, "There is no servant afflicted by a calamity who says as God the Exalted has commanded him, 'Indeed we belong to God, and indeed to Him we return. O God, reward me in my calamity and give me better than it,' except that God will do that for him." And he, peace be upon him, said, "God the Exalted said: 'Whoever I deprive of his two precious ones, his reward is eternity in My abode and gazing upon My Countenance.'" And it is narrated that a man said, "O Messenger of God, my wealth is gone and my body is ill." He, peace be upon him, said, "There is no good in a servant whose wealth does not depart and whose body does not become ill. Verily, when God loves a servant, He tests him; and when He tests him, He grants him patience." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, a man may have a degree with God the Exalted which he cannot attain by his deeds, until he is tested with a tribulation in his body, and thus attains it by that." And from Khabbab ibn al-Aratt, who said: "We came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, while he was reclining on his cloak in the shade of the Kaaba. We complained to him, saying, 'O Messenger of God, will you not call upon God to grant us victory?' He sat up, his face reddened, and then said, 'Those before you would have a man brought, a pit dug for him in the ground, a saw brought and placed on his head, splitting him into two halves, yet that would not turn him away from his religion.'" And from Ali, may God honor his countenance, who said: "Any man imprisoned unjustly by a ruler who then dies is a martyr, and if he is beaten and dies, he is a martyr." And upon him be peace said, "Part of venerating God and knowing His right is that you do not complain of your pain, nor mention..."

Your calamity). Abu al-Dardā’ (may God be pleased with him) said: You are born for death, you build for ruin, you strive for what perishes, and you neglect what endures. How excellent are the three disliked things: poverty, sickness, and death. From Anas, who said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "When God the Exalted intends good for a servant and wishes to purify him, He pours tribulation upon him in torrents. When he calls upon Him, the angels say: 'A familiar voice.' And if he calls a second time, saying: 'O Lord,' God the Exalted says: 'Here I am, My servant, and at your service. Ask Me for anything and I will grant it, or I will avert from you what is better, and I have stored for you with Me what is superior to it.' On the Day of Resurrection, the people of deeds will be brought and their deeds weighed in the balance—the people of prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. Then the people of tribulation will be brought, and no balance will be set up for them, nor any record spread open. Reward will be poured upon them in torrents, just as tribulation was poured upon them in torrents. The people of ease in the world will wish that their bodies had been cut with scissors, when they see what the people of tribulation attain of reward." That is the meaning of His saying, the Exalted: "Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account." From Ibn ‘Abbās (may God be pleased with them both), who said: A prophet from among the prophets (peace be upon them) complained to his Lord, saying: "O Lord, the believing servant obeys You and avoids Your disobedience, yet the world is withheld from him and tribulation is presented to him. The disbeliever does not obey You and dares to disobey You, yet tribulation is withheld from him and the world is spread out for him." So God the Exalted revealed to him: "The servants and tribulation are Mine. Each glorifies Me with praise. The believer has sins, so I withhold the world from him and present him with tribulation, which becomes an expiation for his sins until he meets Me, and I reward him with his good deeds. The disbeliever has good deeds, so I expand his provision and withhold tribulation from him, and I reward him with his good deeds in the world until he meets Me, and I reward him with his evil deeds." It is related that when the verse was revealed: "Whoever does an evil deed will be recompensed for it," Abu Bakr al-Siddīq (may God be pleased with him) said: "How can one rejoice after this verse?" The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "May God forgive you, O Abu Bakr. Do you not fall ill? Are you not afflicted with harm? Do you not grieve? This is among that for which you are recompensed," meaning that all that befalls you is an expiation for your sins. From ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Āmir, from the Prophet (peace be upon him), who said: "When you see a man to whom God gives what he loves while he persists in disobedience, know that this is a gradual enticement." Then he recited the saying of the Exalted: "So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We opened to them the doors of every thing." Meaning, when they abandoned what they were commanded, We opened to them the doors of good until, when they rejoiced in what they were given—that is, the good they were granted—We seized them suddenly. From al-Hasan al-Basrī (may God have mercy on him): A man from the Companions (may God be pleased with them) saw a woman he knew from the pre-Islamic period and spoke to her, then left her. The man kept glancing back at her as he walked, and he struck a wall, which left a mark on his face. He came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and informed him, and he (peace be upon him) said: "When God intends good for a servant, He hastens the punishment for his sin in this world." And ‘Alī (may God honor his face) said: "Shall I not inform you of the most hopeful verse in the Qur’an?" They said: "Yes." So he recited to them: "And whatever strikes you of disaster—it is for what your hands have earned; and He pardons much." Thus, calamities in the world are due to earning sins. If God punishes him in the world, God is more generous than to punish him a second time. And if He pardons him in the world, God is more generous than to punish him on the Day of Resurrection. From Anas (may God be pleased with him), from the Prophet (peace be upon him), who said: "No servant has ever swallowed two draughts more beloved to God than a draught of anger he restrains with forbearance, and a draught of calamity for which a man is patient. And no drop has ever fallen more beloved to God than a drop of blood shed in the path of God, or a drop of tear in the darkness of the night while he is prostrating and none sees him but God. And no servant has taken two steps more beloved to God the Exalted than a step toward an obligatory prayer and a step toward maintaining family ties." From Abu al-Dardā’, who said: A son of Solomon, son of David (peace be upon them both), died, and he grieved intensely. Two angels came to him, kneeling before him in the guise of disputants. One said: "I sowed seed, and when it ripened, this one passed by and ruined it." He said to the other: "What do you say?" He replied: "I took the path and came upon a crop, looking right and left, and the path was upon it." Solomon (peace be upon him) said: "Why did you sow on the path? Did you not know that people must have a path?" He said: "Then why do you grieve for your son? Did you not know that death is the path to the Hereafter?" So Solomon repented to his Lord and did not grieve for a child after that. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz entered upon a sick son of his and said: "My son, for you to be in my scale is more beloved to me than for me to be in your scale." He said: "O my father, for what you love to be is more beloved to me than..."

that it be what he loves. And from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, that the death of his son was announced to him, so he said, "God is the greatest, to God we belong and to Him we return," and said, "A private matter God the Exalted has covered, a burden God has sufficed, and a reward God the Exalted has sent forth." Then he descended and prayed two units of prayer, then said, "We have done what God the Exalted commanded." God the Exalted said: "And seek help through patience and prayer." And from Ibn al-Mubarak, that a son of his died, and a Magian who knew him came to offer condolences, and said to him, "It behooves the intelligent person to do today what the ignorant person does after five days." Ibn al-Mubarak said, "Write this down from him." And some of the scholars said, "Indeed, God tests the servant with trial after trial until he walks upon the earth having no sin." And al-Fudayl said, "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, attends to His believing servant with trials just as a man attends to his family with good." And Hatim al-Asamm said, "Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, will argue on the Day of Resurrection against creation with four individuals for four categories: against the rich with Solomon, against the poor with the Messiah, against the slaves with Joseph, and against the sick with Job, the prayers of God be upon them." And it is narrated that Zechariah, peace be upon him, when he fled from the disbelievers from the Children of Israel and hid in a tree, and they became aware of that, so a saw was brought and the tree was sawn until the saw reached Zechariah's head, and he let out a groan. So God the Exalted revealed to him, "O Zechariah, if a second groan ascends from you, I will erase you from the register of prophethood." So Zechariah, peace be upon him, bit his finger until he severed two parts of it. And Abu Mas'ud al-Balkhi said, "Whoever is struck by a calamity and tears his garment or strikes his chest, it is as if he has taken a spear intending to fight his Lord, Mighty and Majestic, with it." And Luqman, may God have mercy on him, said to his son, "O my son, gold is tested by fire, and the righteous servant is tested by trial. So when God loves a people, He tests them. Thus, whoever is content, for him is contentment, and whoever is displeased, for him is displeasure." And al-Ahnaf ibn Qays said, "One day I awoke complaining of a toothache, and I said to my uncle, 'I did not sleep last night from the pain of the tooth until I pulled it out three times.' He said, 'You have made much of your tooth in one night, while this eye of mine has been gone for thirty years, and no one knew of it.'" And God the Exalted revealed to 'Aziz, peace be upon him, "If a trial befalls you, do not complain to My creation, but complain to Me, just as I do not complain of you to My angels when your faults and disgrace ascend. We ask God, from His immense gentleness and generosity, for His beautiful covering in this world and the next."

(Clarifying the Virtue of Blessing over Trial)

Perhaps you say, "These reports indicate that trial is better in this world than blessings, so should we ask God for trial?" I say, there is no basis for that, due to what is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he used to seek refuge in his supplication from the trial of this world and the trial of the Hereafter, and he used to say, he and the prophets, peace be upon them, "Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter," and they used to seek refuge from the gloating of enemies and other things. And 'Ali, may God honor his countenance, said, "O God, I ask You for patience." So he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "You have asked for trial, so ask Him for well-being." And al-Siddiq, may God the Exalted be pleased with him, narrated from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said, "Ask God for well-being, for no one has been given anything better than well-being except certainty." And he indicated by certainty the well-being of the heart from the sickness of ignorance and doubt, for the well-being of the heart is higher than the well-being of the body. And al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, said, "The good in which there is no evil is well-being with gratitude, for how many are those upon whom blessings are bestowed who are not grateful." And Mutarrif ibn 'Abdullah said, "That I be granted well-being and be grateful is more beloved to me than that I be tested and be patient." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said in his supplication, "And Your well-being is more beloved to me." This is clearer than to need evidence and citation for it. This is because trial becomes a blessing by two considerations: one, in relation to what is more than it, whether in this world or in religion; and the other, in relation to what is hoped for of reward. Therefore, we should ask God for the completion of blessing in this world and the removal of what is beyond it of trial, and we should ask Him for reward in the Hereafter for gratitude for His blessing, for He is capable of giving for gratitude what He does not give for patience.

If you say, "Indeed, some of them have said, 'I wish I were a bridge over the Fire, so all of creation could cross over it and be saved, and I would be in the Fire.'" And Sumnun, may God the Exalted have mercy on him, said:
            And I have no portion in other than You,
            So however You wish, test me.
So this from these individuals is a request for trial. Know that it is related from Sumnun the Lover, may God have mercy on him, that he was tested after this verse with the ailment of retention, and after that he would go around to the doors of the schools and say to the children, "Pray for your lying uncle." As for a person's love to be himself in the Fire to the exclusion of the rest of creation, it is not possible, but love can overcome the heart until the lover imagines of himself a love for such a thing. So from...

Drinking the cup of love brings intoxication, and the intoxicated speaks expansively. Were his intoxication to leave him, he would know that what overcame him was a state without true substance. Thus, what you hear from this genre is from the speech of lovers whose love has become excessive. The speech of lovers is delightful to hear, but one cannot rely upon it. As it is related that Fākhitah was being entreated by her husband, and she refused him. He said, "What prevents you from me? If I wished to turn the two worlds, along with the dominion of Solomon, upside down for your sake, I would do it." Solomon, peace be upon him, heard this and summoned him, reproaching him. He said, "O Prophet of God, the speech of lovers is not to be recounted." And it is as he said. The poet said:
            I desire union, and he desires abandonment,
            So I leave what I desire for what he desires.
This is also impossible. Its meaning is that I desire what he does not desire, for whoever desires union does not desire abandonment. So how could he desire abandonment, which he did not desire? Indeed, this speech cannot be deemed truthful except through two interpretations. The first is that this occurs in certain states, so that through it he may gain his beloved's pleasure, by which he attains union in the future. Thus, abandonment becomes a means to pleasure, and pleasure a means to the union of the beloved. The means to the beloved is beloved. Its example is like the lover of wealth who invests one dirham to gain two; for the love of the two dirhams, he forsakes the one dirham in the present. The second is that his beloved's pleasure becomes sought by him solely because it is his beloved's pleasure. He finds a delight in sensing his beloved's pleasure with him that surpasses his delight in seeing him, despite his aversion. At that point, it is conceivable that he would desire what contains that pleasure. Therefore, the state of some lovers has reached the point where their delight in tribulation, while sensing God's pleasure with them, is greater than their delight in well-being without sensing that pleasure. Thus, if they perceive His pleasure in tribulation, tribulation becomes more beloved to them than well-being. This is a state whose occurrence in the overpowering surges of love is not far-fetched, but it is not stable. Even if it were established as an example, is it a sound state, or a state necessitated by another state that came upon the heart, inclining it away from equilibrium? This requires examination, and detailing its verification is not suited to our present discussion. What has preceded makes clear that well-being is better than tribulation. So we ask God Almighty—who with His grace restrains from all His creation—for pardon and well-being in religion, this world, and the Hereafter, for us and for all Muslims.

(Clarification of Which is Superior: Patience or Gratitude)
Know that people have differed regarding this. Some have said patience is superior to gratitude; others said gratitude is superior; others said they are equal; and others said it differs according to circumstances. Each faction argued with discourse marked by severe confusion, far from sound acquisition. Thus, there is no point in prolonging by transmission; rather, hastening to manifest the truth is preferable. We say in clarifying this there are two stations. The first station is clarification in a lenient manner, which is to look at the apparent matter and not seek to investigate its reality. It is the clarification with which the common folk should be addressed, due to the deficiency of their understandings in grasping obscure realities. This genre of discourse is what preachers should rely upon, for the aim of their speech in addressing the common folk is their reform. The compassionate wet-nurse should not nourish the infant child with fattened birds and kinds of sweets, but with gentle milk. She must postpone fine foods for him until he becomes capable of bearing them through his strength and leaves behind the weakness inherent in his constitution. We say: This station in clarification forbids investigation and detailed analysis. Its requirement is to look at the apparent, understood from the sources of the Sacred Law. That necessitates favoring patience. For although many reports have come regarding the virtue of gratitude, when what has come regarding the virtue of patience is added to it, the virtues of patience become more numerous. Indeed, there are explicit texts regarding superiority, such as His saying, peace be upon him: "Among the best things you have been given are certainty and the resolve of patience." And in the report: "The most grateful person on earth will be brought, and God will reward him the reward of the grateful. Then the most patient person on earth will be brought and it will be said to him: 'Are you not content that We reward you as We rewarded this grateful one?' He will say, 'Yes, O Lord.' God Almighty will say, 'No. I bestowed favor upon him and he was grateful, and I tested you and you were patient. I shall multiply your reward for it.' So he is given multiples of the reward of the grateful one." And God Almighty has said: "Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account." As for his saying, peace be upon him: "The grateful one who eats is in the rank of the patient one who fasts," this is evidence for the superiority in patience, for he mentioned that in a context of hyperbole to raise the rank of gratitude, thus equating it with patience. So this became the ultimate degree for it. Were it not understood from the Sacred Law that the rank of patience is elevated, equating gratitude with it would not be hyperbole for gratitude. It is like his saying, peace be upon him: "Friday is the Hajj of the poor, and the woman's striving is good conduct toward her husband," and like his saying, peace be upon him: "The drinker of wine is like an idolater..."

The idol[117]—and indeed, the thing being compared should always be of a higher rank. Likewise, his saying, peace be upon him: "Patience is half of faith" does not indicate that gratitude is its equal, just as his saying, peace be upon him: "Fasting is half of patience." For anything divisible into two parts, one is called a "half" even if there is disparity between them, just as it is said faith is knowledge and action, so action is half of faith. This does not indicate that action equals knowledge. In a report from the Prophet, peace be upon him: "The last of the prophets to enter Paradise is Solomon, son of David, peace be upon them, due to his kingdom; and the last of my companions to enter Paradise is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, due to his wealth."[118] In another report: "Solomon will enter after the prophets by forty autumns."[119] And in the report: "All the gates of Paradise have two leaves except the gate of patience, for it has a single leaf, and the first to enter it are the people of affliction, with Job, peace be upon him, at their forefront."[120] All that has been narrated concerning the virtues of poverty indicates the virtue of patience, for patience is the state of the poor and gratitude the state of the wealthy. This is the station that satisfies and suffices the common people in appropriate admonition and instruction for the rectification of their religion.

The second station is the exposition we intend to elucidate for the people of knowledge and insight into the realities of matters through the path of unveiling and clarification. We say therein: Any two ambiguous matters cannot be balanced while ambiguous unless the reality of each is unveiled. Every unveiled matter comprises divisions; balancing the whole with the whole is not possible, rather the individual parts must be singled out for comparison until preponderance becomes clear. Patience and gratitude have many divisions and branches, so their ruling regarding preponderance and deficiency cannot be clarified in a general manner. We say: We have mentioned that these stations are composed of three matters: knowledge, states, and works. Gratitude, patience, and all other stations are likewise. When some of these three are weighed against others, it appears to observers of outward appearances that knowledge is sought for the sake of states, states are sought for the sake of works, and works are superior. As for the possessors of insight, the matter is the opposite for them: works are sought for the sake of states, states are sought for the sake of knowledge, so knowledge is superior, then states, then works. For whatever is sought for the sake of another, that other is inevitably superior to it. As for the individual parts of these three: works may be equal or may differ when compared to one another; likewise the individual states when compared; likewise the individual cognitions. The best cognitions are the sciences of unveiling, which are loftier than the sciences of transaction. Indeed, the sciences of transaction are inferior to transaction itself, for they are sought for the sake of transaction; their benefit is the rectification of work. The scholar of transaction is superior to the worshiper only if his knowledge is of general benefit, thus being superior relative to a specific action; otherwise, knowledge limited to action is not superior to action that is limited. We say: The benefit of rectifying action is the rectification of the heart's state. The benefit of rectifying the heart's state is that the majesty of God, Most High, in His Essence, Attributes, and Acts is unveiled to it. Thus, the loftiest of the sciences of unveiling is the knowledge of God, Glorified is He, which is the ultimate goal sought for its own sake, for through it happiness is attained—indeed, it is happiness itself. However, the heart may not perceive in this world that it is happiness itself; it only perceives that in the Hereafter. It is the free knowledge upon which there is no constraint, not bound by anything else. All other cognitions are, in relation to it, slaves and servants, for they are only sought for its sake. Since they are sought for its sake, their ranking is according to their usefulness in leading to the knowledge of God, Most High. For some cognitions lead to others, either directly or through many intermediaries. Thus, the fewer the intermediaries between it and the knowledge of God, Most High, the better it is. As for states, we mean by them the states of the heart in its purification and cleansing from the impurities of the world and the distractions of creation, so that when it is purified and clarified, the reality of the Truth becomes clear to it. Therefore, the virtues of states are according to their effect in rectifying, purifying, and preparing the heart to attain the sciences of unveiling. Just as polishing a mirror requires preceding states for the mirror, some closer to polish than others, so too are the states of the heart. The state closer or most conducive to the clarity of the heart is inevitably better than what is below it due to proximity to the objective. Similarly is the ranking of works, for their effect is in affirming the clarity of the heart and attracting states to it. Every work either attracts to it a state that prevents unveiling, causes darkness of the heart, and draws towards worldly adornments, or attracts to it a state that prepares for unveiling, causes clarity of the heart, and severs its attachments to the world. The name of the first is disobedience.

The second category is obedience and sins, which vary in their effect on the darkness and hardness of the heart. Likewise, acts of obedience vary in illuminating and purifying the heart, their degrees being according to the degrees of their effect. This differs according to differing circumstances. For we might say in absolute terms that supererogatory prayer is better than every other supererogatory act of worship, that Hajj is better than charity, and that standing in prayer at night is better than other acts. However, the truth of the matter is that for a rich man who possesses wealth but is overcome by miserliness and love of money to the point of withholding it, spending dirhams is better for him than standing in prayer for nights and fasting for days. For fasting suits one whose appetite has overcome him and he wishes to break it, or one whose satiety prevents the clarity of thought needed for the sciences of spiritual unveiling, so he wishes to purify his heart through hunger. As for this heedless one, if his state is not this state, he is not harmed by his appetite, nor is he occupied with a type of thought from which satiety prevents him. His occupation with fasting is a departure from his own state to the state of another. He is like a sick man complaining of a stomach ache; if he uses a headache remedy, he will not benefit from it. Rather, his duty is to look to the destructive trait that has mastered him. Miserliness, when obeyed, is among the destructive traits. Fasting for a hundred years and standing in prayer for a thousand nights will not remove from it an atom's weight. Rather, nothing removes it except spending wealth. So he must give in charity what he has. The details of this are from what we mentioned in the "Quarter of the Destructive Traits," so let him refer to it. Therefore, considering these circumstances, it differs. At that point, the insightful one knows that an absolute answer therein is erroneous. For if someone asked us, "Is bread better or water?" there would be no true answer except that bread is better for the hungry and water is better for the thirsty. If both are present, then look to the predominant need. If thirst is predominant, then water is better. If hunger is predominant, then bread is better. If they are equal, then they are equal. Likewise, if it is said, "Is oxymel better or lotus-flower drink?" it is not correct to answer it absolutely at all. Yes, if we were asked, "Is oxymel better or the absence of yellow bile?" we would say: the absence of yellow bile, for oxymel is intended for it, and what is intended for something else is inevitably better than it. Therefore, in spending wealth there is an action, which is expenditure, and a state is attained by it, which is the removal of miserliness and the expulsion of love of this world from the heart. The heart becomes prepared, due to the expulsion of love of this world from it, for the knowledge of God, the Exalted, and love of Him. So the best is knowledge, below it is the state, and below that is the action.

If you say: "The Sacred Law has urged actions and emphasized mentioning their merit, even seeking charities with His saying, 'Who is it that will lend Allah a goodly loan?' and He, the Exalted, said, 'And He accepts charities.' So how can the action and expenditure not be the best?" Know that when a physician praises a medicine, it does not indicate that the medicine is desired for its own sake or that it is better than the health and cure attained by it. Rather, actions are a treatment for the sicknesses of hearts. The sicknesses of hearts are something one is mostly unaware of. It is like leprosy on the face of one who has no mirror; he is not aware of it, and if it were mentioned to him, he would not believe it. The way with him is to exaggerate in praising washing the face with rosewater, for example, if rosewater removes the leprosy, so that he is urged by the excessive praise to persist in it, and thus his sickness is removed. For if it were mentioned to him that the objective is the removal of leprosy from your face, he might abandon the treatment and claim his face has no blemish. Let us give an example closer than this: We say: A man has a son whom he taught knowledge and the Quran, and he wanted to fix that in his memory so it would not leave him. He knew that if he ordered him to repeat and study so it would remain memorized for him, the son would say, "It is memorized, and I have no need for repetition and study," because he thinks what he memorizes now remains so forever. The man had slaves, so he ordered the son to teach the slaves and promised him something good for that, so that his motive would be abundant repetition through teaching. Perhaps the poor boy thinks the objective is teaching the slaves the Quran and that he has been employed to teach them. The matter becomes confusing for him, so he says, "Why have I been employed for the sake of the slaves? I am nobler than them and dearer to my father. I know that if my father wanted to teach the slaves, he could do so without imposing it on me. I know my father suffers no loss by the loss of these slaves, let alone their lack of knowledge of the Quran." So perhaps this poor one becomes lazy and abandons teaching them, relying on his father's self-sufficiency and his generosity in pardoning him. Thus he forgets the knowledge and the Quran and remains heedless, deprived without knowing it. A group has been deceived by such an illusion and taken the path of permissiveness, saying, "God, the Exalted, is independent of our worship and of borrowing from us. So what is the meaning of His saying, 'Who is it that will lend Allah a goodly loan?' If God willed to feed the poor..."

We would feed them, so we have no need to spend our wealth on them, as God Almighty said, narrating from the disbelievers: "And when it is said to them, 'Spend from what God has provided you,' the disbelievers say to the believers, 'Should we feed one whom, if God had willed, He would have fed?'" And they also said, "Had God willed, we would not have associated partners with Him, nor would our fathers." So observe how they were truthful in their speech and how they were destroyed by their truthfulness. Glory be to Him who, when He wills, destroys with truth, and when He wills, grants felicity through ignorance; He leads many astray by it and guides many by it. These people, when they assumed they were employed for the sake of the poor and needy—far exalted is God—and then said, "We have no share in the poor, and God has no share in us or our wealth, whether we spend or withhold," they were destroyed, just as the child was destroyed when he thought the parent's aim in employing him was for the sake of the slaves, unaware that the intended purpose was to establish the attribute of knowledge within his soul and affirm it in his heart, so that it would become the cause of his happiness in this world. This was merely the parent's gentleness in drawing him toward what contained his felicity. This example clarifies for you the misguidance of those who strayed from this path. Therefore, this poor person who takes your wealth extracts, through the medium of the wealth, the impurity of miserliness and love of this world from your inner self, for it is destructive to you. He is like a cupper who draws blood from you so that, with the blood's exit, the destructive ailment is removed from your inner self. Thus, the cupper serves you; you do not serve the cupper. Nor does the cupper cease being a servant by having an interest in doing something with the blood. And since charities are purifiers of the inner selves and cleanse them from the impurities of traits, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, refrained from taking them and abstained from them, just as he forbade the cupper's earnings and called them the filth of people's wealth, and honored the people of his household by preserving them from it. The intended meaning is that actions have effects upon the heart, as previously mentioned in the Quarter of Destructive Traits, and the heart, according to the influence of these actions, becomes prepared to accept guidance and the light of knowledge. This is the universal statement and the fundamental principle to which one should return in knowing the virtues of actions, states, and knowledges. Let us now return to the specific matter we are in concerning patience and gratitude. We say regarding each of them: knowledge, state, and action. It is not permissible to contrast the knowledge of one with the state or action of the other; rather, each should be contrasted with its counterpart so that the correspondence becomes apparent, and after the correspondence, the superiority appears. Whenever the knowledge of the grateful is contrasted with the knowledge of the patient, they may revert to a single knowledge, for the knowledge of the grateful is to see, for example, the blessing of the eyes as from God Almighty, and the knowledge of the patient is to see blindness as from God. These are two concomitant, equal knowledges—if we consider affliction and calamities. We have already clarified that patience may be in obedience and against sin, and in these two, patience and gratitude unite, because patience in obedience is precisely gratitude for obedience, for gratitude reverts to directing God's blessing to what is intended by it through wisdom, and patience reverts to the steadfastness of the motive of religion in opposition to the motive of desire. Thus, patience and gratitude are two names for a single reality from two different perspectives. The steadfastness of the motive of religion in resisting the motive of desire is called patience in relation to the motive of desire, and called gratitude in relation to the motive of religion, for the motive of religion was created for this wisdom: to overthrow the motive of passion, and one has directed it to the intended purpose of wisdom. They are two expressions for a single meaning, so how can a thing be superior to itself? Therefore, the domains of patience are three: obedience, sin, and affliction. Their ruling in obedience and sin has become clear. As for affliction, it is an expression for the loss of a blessing. The blessing is either essential, like the eyes for example, or occurs in a place of need, like wealth exceeding sufficiency. Regarding the eyes, the patience of the blind person concerning them is by not showing complaint and showing contentment with God's decree, and not using blindness as a license for some sins. The gratitude of the sighted person for them, in terms of action, is through two matters: first, not using them to aid in sin; second, using them in obedience. Each of these two matters is not devoid of patience, for the blind person is spared patience regarding beautiful images because he does not see them, while the sighted person, if his sight falls upon beauty and he exercises patience, is grateful for the blessing of the eyes. But if he follows his gaze, he is ungrateful for the blessing of the eyes. Thus, patience has entered into his gratitude. Likewise, if he uses his eyes to aid in obedience, he also necessarily exercises patience in obedience. Then one may give thanks by contemplating the wonders of God's creation to attain thereby knowledge of God, Glorified and Exalted, and this gratitude becomes superior to patience. Were it not for this, the rank of Shu'ayb, peace be upon him—who was blind among the prophets—would be above the rank of Moses, peace be upon him.

Peace be upon him and the other prophets, for he endured the loss of sight, whereas Moses, peace be upon him, did not show such endurance, for example. Perfection would lie in a person being deprived of all limbs, leaving him like meat on a chopping block, but that is utterly impossible, for each of these organs is an instrument in religion; with its loss, that pillar of religion is lost, and gratitude for them lies in using them. They are instruments in religion, and that can only be through patience. As for what occurs in the realm of need, such as wealth beyond sufficiency, if one is given only what is necessary and is in need of what lies beyond it, then patience regarding it is a struggle—the struggle of poverty. The presence of excess is a blessing, and gratitude for it is to direct it to good deeds or to refrain from using it in disobedience. If patience is coupled with gratitude, which is directing it to obedience, then gratitude is superior because it encompasses patience as well, and it includes joy in the blessing of God Almighty, along with enduring the pain of directing it to the poor and refraining from using it for permissible indulgence. The outcome reverts to the principle that two things are better than one, and the whole is of a higher rank than a part. Yet there is a flaw here, for a comparison between the whole and its parts is not valid. However, if gratitude means not using it to aid in disobedience but rather directing it to permissible enjoyment, then patience here is superior to gratitude, and the patient poor person is better than the rich person who withholds his wealth, spending it on permissible things—not better than the rich person who directs his wealth to good deeds—because the poor person has struggled against his soul, broken its greed, and excelled in contentment with the decree of God Almighty. This state inevitably requires strength, whereas the rich person has followed his greed and obeyed his desires, though he limited himself to the permissible. The permissible provides leeway away from the forbidden, but strength is also necessary to abstain from the forbidden. However, the strength from which the patience of the poor arises is higher and more complete than the strength from which limiting indulgence to the permissible arises. The nobility lies in that strength which the action indicates, for actions are sought only for the states of the hearts, and that strength is a state of the heart that varies according to the strength of certainty and faith. Thus, whatever indicates increased strength in faith is undoubtedly superior. All that has been conveyed regarding the superiority of the reward of patience over the reward of gratitude in verses and traditions refers specifically to this rank, because what commonly comes to people’s minds regarding blessings and wealth is being enriched by them, and what commonly comes to minds regarding gratitude is for a person to say “Praise be to God” and not use the blessing to aid in disobedience—not to direct it to obedience. Therefore, patience is better than gratitude—meaning the patience understood by the common people is better than the gratitude understood by the common people. It is to this meaning specifically that Junayd, may God have mercy on him, alluded when he was asked about patience and gratitude, which is superior. He said: “Praise is not for the rich due to possession, nor for the poor due to lack. Rather, praise for both lies in their fulfillment of the conditions incumbent upon them. The condition for the rich accompanies him in what is upon him—things that suit his nature, give him enjoyment and pleasure. The poor person accompanies him in what is upon him—things that suit his nature, cause him restraint and distress. If both are fulfilling for God Almighty the condition incumbent upon them, then the one whose nature is afflicted and distressed is in a more complete state than the one whose nature is indulged and gratified.” The matter is as he said, and it is correct within the categories of patience and gratitude in the last category we mentioned, and he intended nothing else. It is said that Abu al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Ata’ disagreed with him on this, saying the grateful rich person is better than the patient poor person. Junayd prayed against him, and he was afflicted with what befell him of trials—the killing of his children, loss of his wealth, and loss of his mind for fourteen years. He would say, “Junayd’s prayer struck me,” and he reverted to preferring the patient poor person over the grateful rich person. Whenever you consider the meanings we have mentioned, you will know that each of the two views has a valid aspect in some circumstances. Sometimes a patient poor person is better than a grateful rich person, as previously stated, and sometimes a grateful rich person is better than a patient poor person. That is the rich person who sees himself as like the poor, for he does not retain for himself from wealth except what is necessary, and the remainder he directs to good deeds or holds onto with the belief that he is a custodian for the needy and the poor, merely waiting for a need to arise so he may direct it thereto. Then, when he spends, he does not do so seeking status or reputation, nor out of mere habit, but rather as fulfilling the duty to God Almighty in caring for His servants. This is better than the patient poor person.

If you say: “This does not weigh heavily on the soul, whereas poverty weighs heavily on the poor person, because this one feels the pleasure of ability, and that one feels the pain of patience. If he is pained by parting with wealth, that is compensated by the pleasure in the ability to spend.” Know that what you see is that whoever spends his wealth willingly and with a content heart...

A more complete state is that of one who spends while being miserly with it, for he wrests it from himself by force. We have detailed this previously in the Book of Repentance. Thus, causing the self pain is not sought for its own sake, but to discipline it. This is akin to striking a hunting dog. The disciplined dog is more complete than the dog needing to be struck, even if it is patient under the strike. Therefore, one needs pain and struggle at the beginning and does not need them at the end. Rather, the end is that what was painful to him becomes delightful to him, just as learning becomes delightful to the intelligent boy after having been painful to him at first. Since all people, save the very few, are at the beginning—indeed, far before the beginning—like children, Junayd made the general statement that the one whose attribute is painful is superior. This is correct, as he intended, regarding the generality of creation. Therefore, if you do not specify the answer and make it general, intending the majority, then state generally that patience is superior to gratitude, for it is correct according to the meaning previously conveyed to understandings. If you seek precision, then specify, for patience has degrees. The lowest of them is abandoning complaint while disliking [the affliction]. Beyond it is contentment, which is a station beyond patience. Beyond it is gratitude for the affliction, which is beyond contentment, for patience is with pain, and contentment is possible with that which contains no pain and no joy, while gratitude is only possible for something beloved that brings joy. Likewise, gratitude has many degrees; we have mentioned the utmost of them. Included in its totality are matters lesser than it: the servant's shame at the succession of God's blessings upon him is gratitude; his recognition of his shortcoming in gratitude is gratitude; excusing himself for the lack of gratitude is gratitude; knowledge of God's immense forbearance and the shelter of His covering is gratitude; acknowledgment that blessings originate from God, the Exalted, without any deserving is gratitude; knowing that gratitude itself is also a blessing from God's blessings and a bestowal from Him is gratitude; good humility toward blessings and lowliness within them is gratitude; and gratitude to the intermediaries is gratitude, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever does not thank people has not thanked God." We have explained the reality of this in the Book of the Secrets of Zakat. Lack of objection and good manners before the Benefactor is gratitude; receiving blessings with good acceptance and magnifying what is small among them is gratitude. The individual instances of works and states subsumed under the name of gratitude and patience are innumerable, and they are different degrees. So how can a general statement preferring one over the other be possible, except by way of intending a specific meaning with a general expression, as has come in the reports and traditions? It has been narrated from one of them that he said: I saw in some travels a very old man, advanced in years. I asked him about his state, and he said: At the beginning of my life, I loved my cousin, and she likewise loved me. It happened that she was married to me. On the night of her bridal procession, I said, 'Let us rise to spend this night in gratitude to God, the Exalted, for uniting us.' So we prayed that night, and neither of us turned to the other. When the second night came, we said the same, and we prayed the entire night. For seventy or eighty years now, we have been in that state every night. Is that not so, O so-and-so? The old woman said: It is as the Shaykh says. Consider these two: if they had been patient under the affliction of separation, or if God had not brought them together, and then compare the patience of separation to the gratitude of union in this manner, it will not be hidden from you that this gratitude is superior. Therefore, there is no stopping at the realities of what is superior except by specification, as preceded. And God knows best.

[40] The Hadith of 'Ata': "I entered upon 'A'ishah and said to her: 'Inform us of the most amazing thing you saw from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him.' She said: 'All of his matters were amazing...'" The Hadith is about his weeping in the night prayer. Abu al-Shaykh and Ibn Hibban reported it in "The Character of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him," and from his route Ibn al-Jawzi in "Al-Wafa'." In it is Abu Janab, whose name is Yahya bin Abi Habbah; the majority weakened him. Ibn Hibban reported it in his Sahih from the narration of 'Abd al-Malik bin Abi Sulayman from 'Ata' without her saying: "All of his matters were amazing." And it is in Muslim from the narration of 'Urwah from 'A'ishah, limited to the end of the Hadith.

[41] The Hadith: "A call will be made on the Day of Resurrection: 'Let those who praise much rise.'" Al-Tabarani, Abu Nu'aym in "Al-Hilyah," and al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" reported it from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas with the wording: "The first to be called to Paradise are those who praise much." In it is Qays bin al-Rabi'; the majority weakened him.

[42] The Hadith: "Praise is the cloak of the Most Merciful." I did not find a basis for it. In the Sahih from the narration of Abu Hurayrah is: "Grandeur is His cloak." It has preceded in the chapter on Knowledge.

[43] The Hadith of 'Umar: "Let one of you adopt a tongue that remembers and a heart that is grateful." The Hadith has preceded in the chapter on Marriage.

[44] The Hadith: "Whoever says 'Subhan Allah' (Glory be to Allah), for him are ten good deeds." It has preceded in the chapter on Supplications.

[45] The Hadith: "The best remembrance is 'La ilaha illa Allah' (There is no god but Allah), and the best container is 'Alhamdulillah' (Praise be to Allah)." Al-Tirmidhi reported it and graded it Hasan, as did al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah," Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban from the narration of Jabir.

[46] The Hadith: "There is nothing among the remembrances that is multiplied like 'Alhamdulillah' (Praise be to Allah) is multiplied." I did not find it Marfu'. Rather, Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in the book "Al-Shukr" from Ibrahim al-Nakha'i: "It is said that praise is the speech most multiplied."

[47] The Hadith: "He, peace be upon him, said to a man: 'How have you become in the morning?' He said: 'In good condition.' He repeated the question until on the third time he said: 'In good condition, I praise Allah and thank Him.' He said: 'This is what I wanted from you.'" Al-Tabarani reported it in "Al-Du'a'" from the narration of al-Fudayl bin 'Amr, Marfu', similar to it. He said on the third: "I praise Allah." And this is Mu'dal (with a broken chain). He reported it in "Al-Mu'jam al-Kabir" from the narration of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr; it does not contain the repetition of the question, and he said: "I praise Allah to you." In it is Rashid bin Sa'd; the majority weakened him due to his poor memory. Malik reported it in the Muwatta'.

[48] A hadith reported by Muslim from the narration of ‘Ā’ishah: “I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your pardon from Your punishment.”

[49] The hadith, “Indeed, a cloudiness comes over my heart…” has preceded in the Book of Repentance and before it in the Book of Supplications.

[50] The hadith of ‘Ā’ishah when she said to him, “May Allah forgive you your past and future sins,” so why this weeping? It is narrated by Abū al-Shaykh, and it is the remainder of the hadith of ‘Atā’ from her, which preceded this by nine hadiths. It is in Muslim from the narration of ‘Urwah from her in a concise form, and likewise it is in the two Ṣaḥīḥ collections concisely from the hadith of al-Mughīrah ibn Shu‘bah.

[51] The hadith, “Act, for everyone is facilitated for what he was created for,” from the narration of ‘Alī and ‘Imrān ibn Ḥuṣayn.

[52] The hadith, “Whoever drinks from a vessel of gold or silver, it is as if he is swallowing the fire of Hell into his belly,” is agreed upon from the narration of Umm Salamah, though the author did not explicitly state it is a hadith.

[53] The hadith, “Were it not that the devils hover around the children of Adam, they would behold the kingdom of the heavens,” has preceded in the Book of Fasting.

[54] The hadith, “When predestination is mentioned, withhold,” is narrated by al-Ṭabarānī from the narration of Ibn Mas‘ūd and has preceded in the Book of Knowledge, though the author did not explicitly state it is a hadith.

[55] The hadith: It was said to him, “It is said that Jesus walked upon water.” He said, “Had his certainty increased, he would have walked upon air.” This is a rejected (munkar) hadith not known as such. The known version is narrated by Ibn Abī al-Dunyā in the Book of Certainty from the saying of Bakr ibn ‘Abd Allāh al-Muzanī: The disciples lost their prophet, so it was said to them, “Head towards the sea.” They went seeking him, and when they reached the sea, behold, he was approaching, walking upon the water. Then he mentioned a hadith in which Jesus said, “If the son of Adam had a mustard seed’s worth of certainty, he would walk upon the water.” And Abū Manṣūr al-Daylamī narrated in *Musnad al-Firdaws* with a weak chain from the hadith of Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal: “If you knew Allah as He truly should be known, you would walk upon the seas, and the mountains would be removed by your supplication.”

[56] The hadith, “There will be rulers over you who will cause corruption, yet through them Allah will bring about more good…” Muslim narrated it from the narration of Umm Salamah: “Rulers will be appointed over you; you will recognize some of their actions and reject others.” Al-Tirmidhī narrated it with the wording, “There will be leaders over you,” and said it is ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ. Al-Bazzār narrated it with a weak chain from the narration of Ibn ‘Umar: “The ruler is the shadow of Allah on earth; every oppressed one among His servants takes refuge in him. If he is just, he has the reward and the subjects owe gratitude. If he is oppressive, unjust, or tyrannical, the sin is upon him and the subjects must be patient.” As for his statement, “and through them Allah will bring about more good,” I have not found it with this wording except that it is understood from the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ūd when people rushed to him, objecting to the conduct of al-Walīd ibn ‘Uqbah. ‘Abd Allāh said, “Be patient, for the injustice of your ruler for fifty years is better than civil strife for a month. For I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say…” and he mentioned a hadith containing, “and a wicked rule is better than civil strife.” Al-Ṭabarānī narrated it in *al-Kabīr* with an acceptable chain.

[57] The hadith of his saying during the digging of the Trench, “There is no life except the life of the Hereafter,” is agreed upon from the narration of Anas.

[58] The hadith of his saying during the Farewell Pilgrimage, “There is no life except the life of the Hereafter,” is narrated by al-Shāfi‘ī as *mursal* and by al-Ḥākim as *muttasil*, who authenticated it. It has preceded in the Book of Pilgrimage.

[59] The hadith: A man said, “O Allah, I ask You for the perfection of blessing…” Al-Tirmidhī narrated it from the narration of Mu‘ādh with a ḥasan chain.

[60] The hadith, “An excellent possession for a righteous man is righteous wealth,” is narrated by Aḥmad, Abū Ya‘lā, and al-Ṭabarānī from the narration of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ with a good chain.

[61] The hadith, “An excellent aid for God-consciousness is wealth,” is narrated by Abū Manṣūr al-Daylamī in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the narration of Muḥammad ibn al-Munkadir from Jābir. Abū al-Qāsim al-Baghawī narrated it from the narration of Ibn al-Munkadir as *mursal*, and from his path al-Quḍā‘ī narrated it in *Musnad al-Shihāb* as *mursal*.

[62] The hadith, “Whoever wakes up healthy in his body, secure in his dwelling…” is narrated by al-Tirmidhī, who graded it ḥasan, and by Ibn Mājah from the narration of ‘Ubayd Allāh ibn Miḥṣan al-Anṣārī, and it has preceded.

[63] The hadith, "An excellent aid to religion is a righteous woman," I have not found a chain of transmission for it. Muslim has from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "The world is enjoyment, and the best enjoyment of the world is a righteous woman."

[64] The hadith, "When a servant dies, his deeds cease except for three..." Muslim transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and it was mentioned previously in the Book of Marriage.

[65] The hadith concerning what befell him (peace be upon him) of harm and the like, to the point of being reduced to fleeing and emigration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim transmitted it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, who said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "Has there come upon you a day more severe than the day of Uhud?" He said, "I have certainly met from your people... and the most severe I met was the day of 'Aqabah, when I presented myself to Ibn 'Abd Yalil..." At-Tirmidhi, who graded it sound, and Ibn Majah transmitted from the hadith of Anas: "I have been made to fear for the sake of Allah, and no one fears as I have feared. I have been harmed for the sake of Allah, and no one is harmed as I have been harmed. Thirty days and nights passed upon me and Bilal without us having any food that a living creature could eat, except what Bilal could conceal under his arm." At-Tirmidhi said the meaning of this is when the Prophet (peace be upon him) went out fleeing from Makkah with Bilal. Al-Bukhari has from 'Urwah who said: I asked 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr about the most severe thing the polytheists did to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He said, "I saw 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt come to the Prophet (peace be upon him) while he was praying and place his garment on his neck, strangling him severely. Then Abu Bakr came and pushed him away..." Al-Bazzar and Abu Ya'la transmitted from the hadith of Anas who said, "They struck the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) until he fell unconscious. Abu Bakr stood up and began calling out, 'Woe to you! Would you kill a man for saying, "My Lord is Allah"?' Its chain is sound according to the conditions of Muslim."

[66] The hadith, "The leaders are from Quraysh," An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim transmitted it from the hadith of Anas with a sound chain.

[67] The hadith, "He (peace be upon him) was from the noblest of people in lineage from Adam." *Al-Urumah* means origin; this is known. Muslim transmitted from the hadith of Wathilah ibn Al-Asqa', marfu': "Allah chose Kinanah from the children of Isma'il, and chose Quraysh from Kinanah, and chose from Quraysh Banu Hashim, and chose me from Banu Hashim." In a narration of At-Tirmidhi: "Allah chose from the children of Ibrahim, Isma'il..." and he has from the hadith of Al-'Abbas, and he graded it good, and Ibn 'Abbas and Al-Muttalib ibn Rabi'ah, and he authenticated it, and Al-Muttalib ibn Abi Wada'ah, and he graded it good: "Allah created creation and made me from the best..." In a hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "What is the matter with people who belittle lineage? By Allah, I am the best of them in lineage and the best of them in status."

[68] The hadith, "Choose for your offspring," Ibn Majah transmitted it from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and it was mentioned previously in the Book of Marriage.

[69] The hadith, "Beware of the lush dung heap," it was also mentioned previously therein.

[70] The hadith, "The best happiness is a long life spent in worship of Allah," is singular with this wording. At-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of Abu Bakrah that a man said, "O Messenger of Allah, which people are best?" He said, "He whose life is long and his deeds are good," and he said it is *hasan sahih*.

[71] The hadith, "Seek good from those with handsome faces," Abu Ya'la transmitted it from the narration of Isma'il ibn 'Ayyash from Khayrah bint Muhammad ibn Thabit ibn Saba' from her mother 'A'ishah. I do not know the condition of Khayrah and her mother. Ibn Hibban transmitted it from another route in *Ad-Du'afa'*, and Al-Bayhaqi in *Ash-Shu'ab* from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar. It has routes, all of which are weak.

[72] The hadith censuring wealth and status. At-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik: "Two hungry wolves sent among sheep do not cause more corruption to them than a man's love of wealth and status does to his religion." It was mentioned previously in the censure of wealth and stinginess.

[73] The hadith, "I am to you only like a father to his child," Muslim transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "to his child," and it was mentioned previously.

[74] The hadith, "You are plunging into the Fire like moths, and I am seizing you by your waistbands," agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording, "My parable and the parable of the people..." And Muslim said, "The parable of my community is like a man who lit a fire, and insects and moths began falling into it. I am seizing you by your waistbands, and you are plunging into it." And Muslim has from the hadith of Jabir, "And I am seizing you by your waistbands from the Fire, and you are slipping from my hand."

[75] The hadith, "Let the provision of any one of you from this world be like the provisions of a rider." Ibn Majah and Al-Hakim transmitted it from the hadith of Salman. The wording of Al-Hakim is, "And he said, 'Like the provisions of a rider,' and he said its chain is sound." I say: It is from the narration of Abu Sufyan from his unnamed shaykhs. And Ibn Majah has, "He enjoined upon me that it suffices for any one of you..."

[76] The hadith regarding ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf seeking permission to give away all that he possessed when he was told that the wealthy would enter Paradise with difficulty. Permission was granted to him, whereupon Gabriel descended and said, "Command him to feed the poor." This hadith is reported by al-Hakim from the narration of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, who said its chain is sound. I [al-Ghazali] say: No, for within it is Khalid ibn Abi Malik, who is very weak.

[77] The hadith: "No one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allah," agreed upon as sound from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "None of you will enter Paradise by his deeds." They said, "Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Not even I, unless Allah envelops me with His bounty and mercy." In a narration of Muslim: "No one will be admitted to Paradise by his deeds..." The hadith. Both [al-Bukhari and Muslim] agreed upon it from the narration of ‘A’ishah, and Muslim alone reported it from the narration of Jabir, as previously mentioned.

[78] The hadith that he was asked about the spirit, and he did not add except to say, "The spirit is of the command of my Lord," agreed upon as sound from the narration of Ibn Mas‘ud, as previously mentioned in the explanation of the wonders of the heart.

[79] The hadith prohibiting belief in astrologers and the study of stars, reported by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah with a sound chain from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas: "Whoever acquires a branch of the knowledge of stars has acquired a branch of sorcery; the more he adds, the more he adds." And by al-Tabarani from the narration of Ibn Mas‘ud and Thawban: "When the stars are mentioned, refrain." Their chains are weak, as previously mentioned in the chapter on knowledge. And in Muslim from the narration of Mu‘awiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Sulami, who said: I said, "O Messenger of Allah, there were matters we used to do in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance; we used to visit soothsayers." He said, "Do not visit soothsayers..." The hadith.

[80] The hadith: He recited the saying of the Almighty: "Our Lord, You have not created this in vain. Glory be to You! So protect us from the punishment of the Fire." Then he said, "Woe to him who recites this verse and then wipes his forehead with it," meaning he neglected to contemplate it. Reported by al-Tha‘labi from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas with the wording: "and did not reflect upon it." Within it is Abu Janab Yahya ibn Abi Hibah, who is weak.

[81] The reports concerning the angels entrusted with the heavens and the earths, and the parts of plants and animals, even every drop of rain and every cloud driven from one side to another. In the two Sahih collections from the narration of Abu Dharr in the story of the Night Journey: Gabriel said to the keeper of the lowest heaven, "Open." And in it: He came to the second heaven and said to its keeper, "Open..." The hadith. And in both from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Indeed, Allah has angels who travel about conveying to me the greetings from my nation." And in the two Sahih collections from the narration of ‘A’ishah in the story of him offering himself to ‘Abd Yalayl, the angel of the mountains called to me: "If you wish, I will cause the two mountains to close upon them..." The hadith. And in both from the narration of Anas: "Indeed, Allah has entrusted an angel with the womb..." The hadith. And Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported in *Musnad al-Firdaws* from the narration of Buraydah al-Aslami: "There is no plant that grows except that there is an angel entrusted beneath it until it is harvested..." The hadith. Within it are Muhammad ibn Salih al-Tabari and Abu Bahr al-Bakrawi, whose name is ‘Uthman ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman, and both are weak. And by al-Tabarani from the narration of Abu al-Darda’ with a weak chain: "Indeed, Allah has angels who descend every night, removing fatigue from the mounts of the warriors, except for a mount with a bell on its neck." And by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it good, from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas: The Jews said, "O Abu al-Qasim, inform us about thunder." He said, "It is an angel entrusted with the clouds." And in Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "While a man was in a desert, he heard a voice from a cloud: 'Water the garden of so-and-so.' That cloud then moved aside and poured its water into a rocky tract..." The hadith.

[82] The hadith: "Indeed, the spot where people gather curses them or seeks forgiveness for them"—I have not found any basis for it.

[83] The hadith: "Indeed, everything seeks forgiveness for the scholar, even the fish in the sea," previously mentioned in the chapter on knowledge.

[84] The hadith: "Indeed, the angels curse the disobedient," reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "The angels curse one of you if he points at his brother with an iron weapon, even if he is his brother from his father and mother."

[85] The hadith: "Whoever looks in worldly matters to those below him and in religious matters to those above him, Allah will record him as patient and grateful." The hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr, and he said it is rare. Within it is al-Muthanna ibn al-Sabbah, who is weak.

[86] The hadith: "Whoever is not enriched by the signs of Allah, Allah will not enrich him"—I have not found it with this wording.

[87] The hadith: "Indeed, the Qur'an is the enrichment; there is no enrichment after it, nor poverty with it," reported by Abu Ya‘la.

Al-Tabarani narrates from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain, wording: "The Qur'an is richness; there is no poverty after it, nor richness beyond it." Al-Daraqutni said: "Abu Mu'awiyah narrated it from al-A'mash from Yazid al-Raqashi from al-Hasan as mursal, and that is more likely correct."

[88] Hadith: "Whoever Allah grants the Qur'an, and he thinks that anyone is richer than him, has mocked the verses of Allah." Al-Bukhari recorded it in al-Tarikh from the hadith of Raja' al-Fanawi, wording: "Whoever Allah grants the memorization of His Book, and he thinks that anyone has been given better than what he has been given, has belittled the greatest blessings." It has preceded in the merits of the Qur'an. Raja' is disputed regarding his companionship. It is reported from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, Jabir, and al-Bara' similarly, and all are weak.

[89] Hadith: "He is not from us who does not chant the Qur'an." It has preceded in the etiquettes of recitation.

[90] Hadith: "Certainty suffices as richness." Al-Tabarani narrates it from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, and Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrates it in al-Qana'ah as mawquf upon him. It has preceded.

[91] Hadith: "Whoever wakes up secure in his home..." The hadith has preceded multiple times.

[92] Hadith: "Whenever Allah's favor upon a servant increases, the needs of people toward him increase." Ibn 'Adi and Ibn Hibban in al-Du'afa' narrate it from the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal, wording: "Except that the burdens of people upon him increase. So whoever does not bear those burdens..." Ibn Hibban in al-Du'afa' narrates it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas and said it is fabricated upon Hajjaj al-A'war.

[93] Hadith: "Indeed Allah protects His servant from the world..." Al-Tirmidhi narrates it and graded it hasan, and al-Hakim graded it sahih. It has preceded.

[94] Hadith: "When a servant commits a sin and is afflicted with hardship and trial in the world, Allah is more generous than to punish him a second time." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrate it from the hadith of 'Ali: "Whoever commits a sin in the world and is punished for it, Allah is more just than to impose His punishment upon His servant." This is the wording of Ibn Majah. Al-Tirmidhi said: "Whoever commits a crime and his punishment is hastened in the world," and he said it is hasan. Al-Bukhari and Muslim have from the hadith of 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit: "Whoever commits any of that and is punished for it, it is an expiation for him."

[95] Hadith: "A man said to him: 'Advise me.' He said: 'Do not accuse Allah regarding anything He has decreed for you.'" Ahmad and al-Tabarani narrate it from the hadith of 'Ubadah with an addition at the beginning, and in its chain is Ibn Lahi'ah.

[96] Hadith: "He looked at the sky and laughed, and was asked. He said: 'I marvel at Allah's decree for the believer...'" Muslim narrates it from the hadith of Suhayb without mentioning his looking at the sky and laughing: "I marvel at the affair of the believer. Indeed, all his affair is good, and that is for no one except the believer. If good befalls him, he is grateful, and that is good for him. If harm befalls him, he is patient, and that is good for him." Al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah narrates from the hadith of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: "I marvel at Allah's pleasure for the believer. If good befalls him, he praises his Lord and is grateful..."

[97] Hadith: "The world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the disbeliever." Muslim narrates it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. It has preceded.

[98] Hadith: "Whomever Allah intends good for, He afflicts him." Al-Bukhari narrates it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[99] Hadith: "A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah, my wealth is gone and my body is sick.' He said: 'There is no good in a servant whose wealth does not depart and whose body does not become sick. Indeed, when Allah loves a servant, He tests him, and when He tests him, He grants him patience.'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrates it in Kitab al-Marad wa al-Kaffarat from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with a chain containing leniency.

[100] Hadith: "Indeed, a man may have a rank with Allah that he cannot attain by his deeds, until he is tested with an affliction in his body, and thus attains it." Abu Dawud narrates it in the narration of Ibn Dasah and Ibn al-'Abd from the hadith of Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Sulami from his father from his grandfather. It is not in the narration of al-Lu'lu'i. Ahmad, Abu Ya'la, and al-Tabarani narrate it from this avenue. Muhammad ibn Khalid was only narrated from by Abu al-Malih al-Hasan ibn 'Umar al-Raqqi. Likewise, only his son Muhammad narrated from Khalid. Abu Nu'aym mentioned that Ibn Mandah named his grandfather al-Lajlaj ibn Sulaym, but Allah knows best. On this basis, his son is Khalid ibn al-Lajlaj al-'Amiri, that one is well-known; a group narrated from him. Ibn Mandah, Abu Nu'aym, and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr narrate it in al-Sahabah from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Abi Iyas ibn Abi Fatimah from his father from his grandfather.

Al-Bayhaqi narrates from the chain of Ibrahim al-Sulami from his father from his grandfather, but God knows best.

[101] The hadith of Khabbab ibn al-Arat: We came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, while he was reclining on his cloak in the shade of the Kaaba, and we complained to him of the persecution we faced.

[102] The hadith of Anas: When God intends good for a servant and wishes to purify him, He pours tribulation upon him profusely. Ibn Abi al-Dunya recorded it in the Book of Sickness from the narration of Bakr ibn Khunays from Yazid al-Raqashi from Anas, in a shorter version without the words, "Then on the Day of Resurrection..." to the end. Both Bakr ibn Khunays and al-Raqashi are weak narrators. Al-Isfahani recorded it in full in "Al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib," inserting between Bakr and al-Raqashi the name of Darar ibn 'Amr, who is also weak.

[103] The hadith: When the verse was revealed, "Whoever does an evil deed will be recompensed for it," Abu Bakr al-Siddiq said, "How can one rejoice after this verse?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, replied, "May God forgive you, O Abu Bakr. Do you not fall ill...?" This is narrated by an unnamed narrator from Abu Bakr. Al-Tirmidhi recorded it through another chain with different wording and deemed it weak, saying it has no sound chain. Al-Daraqutni said it was also narrated from the hadith of 'Umar and from the hadith of al-Zubayr, but none of them are established.

[104] The hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir: If you see a person to whom God gives what he loves while he persists in disobedience, know that this is a gradual enticement. Narrated by Ahmad, al-Tabarani, and al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" with a good chain.

[105] The hadith of al-Hasan al-Basri concerning a man who saw a woman and kept turning to look at her as he walked, then he struck a wall. In it is: When God intends good for a servant, He hastens the punishment for his sin in this world. Ahmad and al-Tabarani recorded it with a sound chain from the narration of al-Hasan from 'Abdullah ibn Ma'qil, raised to the Prophet and connected. Al-Tabarani also connected it through the narration of al-Hasan from 'Ammar ibn Yasir and from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded the raised portion from the hadith of Anas, and al-Tirmidhi graded it as good.

[106] The hadith of Anas: No servant ever swallows two draughts more beloved to God than a draught of anger he restrains with forbearance, and a draught of affliction for which he exercises patience. Abu Bakr ibn Lal recorded it in "Makārim al-Akhlaq" from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib without mentioning the two draughts, and in its chain is Muhammad ibn Sadaqah, who is al-Farisi, a narrator of rejected hadith. Ibn Majah recorded from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain: No draught is greater with God than a draught of anger which a servant suppresses seeking the Face of God. Abu Mansur al-Daylami recorded in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the hadith of Abu Umamah: No drop has ever fallen upon the earth more beloved to God Almighty than the blood of a Muslim spilled in the path of God or a tear shed in the darkness of night. In its chain is Muhammad ibn Sadaqah, who is al-Farisi, a narrator of rejected hadith.

[107] The hadith that he, peace be upon him, used to seek refuge in his supplication from the tribulations of this world and the tribulations of the Hereafter. Ahmad narrated it from the hadith of Bishr ibn Abi Artah with the wording, "Protect us from the disgrace of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter," and its chain is sound. Abu Dawud has it from the hadith of 'A'ishah: O God, I seek refuge in You from the distress of this world and the distress of the Day of Resurrection. In its chain is Baqiyyah, who is a mudallis, and he narrated it with 'an'anah.

[108] The hadith: He and the prophets, peace be upon them, used to say, "Our Lord, grant us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire." Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded it from the hadith of Anas: The supplication the Prophet, peace be upon him, most frequently made was: O God, grant us in this world... Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i have it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn al-Sa'ib who said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say between the two corners (of the Kaaba): Our Lord, grant us...

[109] The hadith: He used to seek refuge from the gloating of enemies. Previously mentioned in the chapter on supplications.

[110] The hadith: 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "O God, I ask You for patience." He, peace be upon him, said, "You have asked God for tribulation; rather, ask Him for well-being." Al-Tirmidhi recorded it from the hadith of Mu'adh within a longer hadith and graded it as good, but he did not name 'Ali; he only said, "He heard a man..." Al-Nasa'i has it in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from the hadith of 'Ali: I was sitting when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed by me while I was saying... In it is: "If it is tribulation, then grant me patience." He struck me with his foot and said, "O God, grant him well-being and healing," and said it is good and sound.

[111] The hadith of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, "Ask Allah for well-being," was reported by Ibn Majah and al-Nasa'i in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" with a good chain, and it has preceded.
[112] The hadith, "And Your well-being is more beloved to me," was mentioned by Ibn Ishaq in "Al-Sirah" in his supplication on the day he set out for Ta'if with the wording, "And Your well-being is more expansive for me." Similarly, Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in "Al-Du'a'" from the narration of Hassan ibn 'Atiyyah as a *mursal* report. Abu 'Abdullah ibn Mandah reported it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far as a *musnad* report, and it contains someone unknown.
[113] The hadith, "The best of what you have been given is certainty and the resolve of patience," has preceded.
[114] The hadith, "The most grateful person on earth will be brought forth, and Allah will reward him with the reward of the grateful, and the most patient person on earth will be brought forth..." I did not find an origin for it.
[115] The hadith, "The grateful eater is in the station of the fasting, patient person," was reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it *hasan*, and by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and it has preceded.
[116] The hadith, "Friday is the Hajj of the poor, and the jihad of a woman is good conduct towards her husband," was reported by al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his *Musnad* with the first part from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a weak chain, or by al-Tabarani with the second part from his hadith also with a weak chain: A woman said, "Allah has prescribed jihad for men, so what is the equivalent of that from their acts of obedience?" He said, "Obedience to their husbands." In another narration: "What is the reward for a woman's military expedition?" He said, "Obedience to the husband." The hadith contains al-Qasim ibn Fayyad; Abu Dawud declared him trustworthy, while Ibn Ma'in weakened him, and the rest of its narrators are reliable.
[117] The hadith, "The drinker of wine is like a worshipper of idols," was reported by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with the wording "the addict of wine," and al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah reported it with the wording "the drinker" from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar. Both are weak. Ibn 'Adi said regarding the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Isbahani erred in it.
[118] The hadith, "The last of the prophets to enter Paradise is Sulayman ibn Dawud because of his kingdom, and the last of my companions to enter Paradise is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf because of his wealth," was reported by al-Tabarani in "Al-Awsat" from the hadith of Mu'adh ibn Jabal: "All the prophets will enter Paradise forty years before Dawud and Sulayman." He said, "Only Shu'ayb ibn Khalid reported it, and he is a reliable Kufan." Al-Bazzar reported from the hadith of Anas: "The first of the wealthy of my nation to enter Paradise is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf." It contains Aghlab ibn Tamim, who is weak.
[119] The hadith, "Sulayman, the servant of the prophets, will enter after forty autumns," has preceded in the hadith of Mu'adh before it. Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the narration of Dinar from Anas ibn Malik. Dinar al-Habashi is one of the liars upon Anas, and the hadith is rejected.
[120] The hadith, "All the gates of Paradise have two leaves except the gate of patience, for it is a single gate," I did not find an origin for it, nor in the hadiths concerning the leaves of the gates of Paradise is there a distinction. Muslim reported from the hadith of Anas concerning intercession, "By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, the distance between the two leaves of the gates of Paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Busra." In the two *Sahih* collections, in the sermon of 'Utbah ibn Ghazwan, "We have been informed that the distance between the two leaves of the gates of Paradise is a journey of forty years, and a day will come upon it when it is crowded with throngs."
[121] The hadith prohibiting the earnings of a cupper has preceded.
[122] The hadith concerning his abstention from charity, calling it the filth of people, and honoring the people of his household by preserving them from it, was reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'Abd al-Muttalib ibn Rabi'ah: "This charity is not lawful for us; it is but the filth of the people, and it is not lawful for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad." In another narration of his: "the filth of people."
[123] The hadith, "Whoever is not grateful to people is not grateful to Allah," has preceded in the chapter on Zakat.
