The Book Condemning Anger, Malice, and Envy

This is the fifth book of the quarter on the soul's destroyers from the book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, upon whose pardon and mercy none rely except the hopeful, and whose severe wrath and overpowering might none fear except the fearful; who leads His servants step by step from where they know not, subjects them to their passions yet commands them to abandon what they desire, tests them with anger and obliges them to swallow their rage in matters that provoke them; then surrounds them with hardships and pleasures and grants them respite to observe how they act, and tries them through their own love to ascertain the truth of what they profess; who makes known to them that nothing is hidden from Him of what they conceal or reveal, and warns them that He may seize them suddenly while they are unaware, saying: “They await but a single blast that will seize them while they are disputing. Then they will not be able to make a bequest, nor will they return to their families.” And blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, His messenger, beneath whose banner the prophets march, and upon his family and his companions, the rightly guided leaders and the pleasing masters—a blessing equal in number to all that God has created and will ever create, and through whose blessing the first and the last are graced—and abundant peace.

Now then, anger is a flame of fire kindled from the fire of God, the kindled fire that rises over the hearts, and indeed it lies hidden within the folds of the heart, like an ember hidden beneath ashes. It is drawn out by the pride concealed in the heart of every obstinate tyrant, just as fire is drawn from iron by a stone. It has been revealed to those who see by the light of certainty that a vein in man extends to the accursed Satan. Thus, whoever is provoked by the fire of anger has strengthened within him the kinship of Satan, as he said, "You created me from fire and created him from clay." For the nature of clay is stillness and dignity, while the nature of fire is blazing and flaming, movement and agitation. Among the consequences of anger are malice and envy, and through these two, those who are ruined are ruined and those who are corrupted are corrupted. Their source is a morsel [the heart]; if it is sound, the entire body becomes sound with it. If malice, envy, and anger are among what drive a servant to places of ruin, how greatly he needs to know their harms and evils, so that he may beware of them and guard against them, and remove them from the heart if present and expel them, and treat them if they have taken root in his heart and cure them. For he who does not know evil falls into it, and he who knows it, knowledge alone does not suffice him unless he knows the way by which to repel evil and drive it away.

We shall mention the condemnation of anger and the harms of malice and envy in this book, gathering them together by explaining the condemnation of anger, then explaining the reality of anger, then explaining whether the root of anger can be removed through spiritual discipline or not, then explaining the causes that provoke anger, then explaining the treatment of anger after it is provoked, then explaining the virtue of suppressing rage, then explaining the virtue of forbearance, then explaining the extent to which retaliation and seeking redress through speech is permissible, then discussing the meaning of malice and its consequences and the virtue of pardon and gentleness, then discussing the condemnation of envy and its reality, causes, treatment, and the utmost obligation in removing it, then explaining the reason for the prevalence of envy among peers, equals, brothers, cousins, and relatives, and its intensity and rarity among others and its weakness, then explaining the remedy by which the disease of envy is expelled from the heart, then explaining the extent obligatory in expelling envy from the heart. And with God is success.

Exposition on the Censure of Anger

God Almighty said: "When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts zealotry—the zealotry of ignorance—then God sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers" (Qur'an 48:26). This verse censures the disbelievers for the zealotry they displayed, which stemmed from anger over falsehood, and praises the believers for the tranquility God bestowed upon them.

Abu Hurairah reported that a man said, "O Messenger of God, instruct me in a deed and make it concise." He said, "Do not become angry." The man repeated his request, and he again said, "Do not become angry."

Ibn 'Umar said: I said to the Messenger of God, "Tell me a concise statement that I may comprehend." He said, "Do not become angry." I repeated my request to him twice, and each time he returned to saying, "Do not become angry."

From 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: He asked the Messenger of God, "What will save me from the wrath of God?" He said, "Do not become angry."

Ibn Mas'ud said: The Prophet said, "Whom do you consider the strong one among you?" We said, "The one whom men cannot overpower." He said, "That is not so. Rather, the strong one is he who controls himself when angry."

Abu Hurairah said: The Prophet said, "The strong one is not the one who overpowers people. Indeed, the strong one is he who controls himself when angry."

Ibn 'Umar said: The Prophet said, "Whoever restrains his anger, God will conceal his faults."

Sulayman ibn Dawud said: O my son, beware of frequent anger, for frequent anger makes light the heart of a forbearing man.

From 'Ikrimah regarding God's saying, "…and a chief, and chaste…" (Qur'an 3:39), he said: "The chief is one whom anger does not overpower."

Abu al-Darda' said: I said, "O Messenger of God, guide me to a deed that will admit me to Paradise." He said, "Do not become angry."

Yahya said to 'Isa, "Do not become angry." He replied, "I cannot avoid anger, for I am only human." Yahya said, "Then do not acquire wealth." He said, "This, perhaps, I can manage."

The Prophet said, "Anger corrupts faith just as vinegar corrupts honey."

The Prophet said, "No one becomes angry except that he draws near to Hellfire."

A man said to him, "What is the most severe thing for me?" He said, "The wrath of God." The man asked, "What will distance me from the wrath of God?" He said, "Do not become angry."

The Traditions: Al-Hasan said: O son of Adam, whenever you become angry, you leap, and you are on the verge of leaping a leap that will cast you into the Fire. It is related from Dhul-Qarnayn that he met a king from among the angels and said: "Teach me knowledge by which I may increase in faith and certainty." He said: "Do not become angry, for Satan is most powerful over the son of Adam when he is angry." Repel anger by restraint and calm it with deliberateness. Beware of haste, for if you hasten you will miss your portion. Be gentle and soft with the near and the far, and do not be an oppressive tyrant. From Wahb ibn Munabbih: A monk was in his hermitage, and Satan wished to misguide him but could not. He came to him and called out, saying to him: "Open!" He did not answer him. He said: "Open, for if I leave you will regret it." He paid him no heed. He said: "I am the Messiah." The monk said: "Even if you are the Messiah, what should I do with you? Have you not commanded us to worship and strive, and promised us the Resurrection? If you came to us today with other than that, we would not accept it from you." He said: "I am Satan. I wished to misguide you but could not, so I came to you so you could ask me whatever you wish and I would inform you." He said: "I do not wish to ask you about anything." He turned away departing. The monk said: "Will you not listen?" He said: "Yes, inform me: which of the character traits of the children of Adam is most helpful to you against them?" He said: "Sharp temper. If a man is sharp-tempered, we turn him over as children turn over a ball." Khaythama said: Satan says: "How can the son of Adam overcome me? When he is pleased, I come until I am in his heart. And when he is angry, I fly until I am in his head." Ja'far ibn Muhammad said: "Anger is the key to every evil." One of the Helpers said: "The head of foolishness is sharp temper, and its commander is anger. Whoever is content with ignorance dispenses with forbearance. Forbearance is an adornment and beneficial, while ignorance is disgraceful and harmful. Silence in response to the fool is his answer." Mujahid said: Iblis said: "What makes the children of Adam too difficult for me? They will not be too difficult for me in three states: When one of them is intoxicated, we take him by the nose-ring and lead him wherever we wish, and he works for us as we love. When he is angry, he says what he does not know and does what he will regret. We make him miserly with what is in his hands and give him false hopes for what he cannot attain." It was said to a wise man: "What does so-and-so possess for himself?" He said: "Then let not desire humiliate him, nor caprice throw him down, nor anger overcome him." Some said: "Beware of anger, for it brings you to the humiliation of apology." It was said: "Guard against anger, for it corrupts faith as vinegar corrupts honey." Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said: "Look at a man's forbearance when he is angry, and his trustworthiness when he is covetous. What do you know of his forbearance if he does not become angry, and what do you know of his trustworthiness if he does not covet?" Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz wrote to his governor: "Do not punish while you are angry. If you become angry with a man, imprison him. If your anger subsides, then bring him out and punish him according to his sin, and do not exceed fifteen lashes." Ali ibn Yazid said: "A man from Quraysh spoke harshly to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. Umar remained silent for a long time, then said: 'Did you want Satan to provoke me through the might of authority, so that I would inflict upon you today what you would inflict upon me tomorrow?'" Someone said to his son: "O my son, intellect does not remain firm during anger, just as the spirit of a living being does not remain firm in blazing furnaces. Therefore, the least angry of people are the most intelligent. If it is for worldly matters, it is supplication and plotting; if it is for the Hereafter, it is forbearance and knowledge. It has been said: Anger is the enemy of intellect, and anger is the ghoul of intellect." Umar, may God be pleased with him, when he gave a sermon, would say in his sermon: "Successful among you is he who guards against covetousness, caprice, and anger." Some said: "Whoever obeys his desire and his anger, they lead him to the Fire." Al-Hasan said: "Among the signs of a Muslim are strength in religion, resolve in gentleness, faith in certainty, knowledge in forbearance, intelligence in kindness, giving in truth, moderation in wealth, adornment in poverty, beneficence in capability, endurance in hardship, and patience in adversity. Anger does not overcome him, zeal does not carry him away, desire does not overpower him, his stomach does not disgrace him, his greed does not make him frivolous, and his intention does not fall short. Thus, he supports the oppressed, shows mercy to the weak, is neither miserly nor wasteful, neither extravagant nor stingy. He forgives when wronged and pardons the ignorant. His own self is in hardship while people are at ease from him." It was said to Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak: "Describe good character to us in one word." He said: "Abandon anger." A prophet from among the prophets said to his followers: "Who will guarantee for me that he will not become angry, so that he will be with me in my rank and be my successor after me?" A youth from the people said: "I will." Then he repeated it to them, and the youth said: "I will fulfill it." When he died, he was in his station after him, and he is Dhu al-Kifl. He was named by it because he guaranteed concerning anger and fulfilled it. Wahb ibn Munabbih said: "Disbelief has four pillars: anger, desire, rashness, and covetousness."

Explanation of the True Nature of Anger

Know that when God, exalted is He, created living beings, exposing them to decay and mortality through causes within their bodies and causes external to them, He bestowed upon them that which protects them from decay and wards off destruction from them until a predetermined term, which He named in His Book.

As for the internal cause: it is that He constructed it from heat and moisture, and placed between the heat and moisture enmity and opposition. Thus, the heat continually dissolves the moisture, dries it, and vaporizes it until its parts become a vapor that ascends from it. Were a supply from nourishment not to reach the moisture, restoring what has been dissolved and vaporized of its parts, the animal would perish. Therefore, God created nourishment suitable for the animal's body and created within the animal an appetite that spurs it to consume nourishment—like one appointed to restore what is broken and mend what is breached—so that this may be a preserver for it from destruction by this cause.

As for the external causes that befall a person, such as the sword, the spear, and all other destructive means that are aimed at him, he needed a force and a protective zeal that would surge from within him to repel these destructive forces. Therefore, Allah created the nature of anger from fire and implanted it within man, kneading it into his very substance. Whenever he is prevented from attaining a desire or an objective, the fire of anger ignites and surges forth, causing the blood of the heart to boil and spread through the veins, rising to the upper parts of the body, just as fire rises and as boiling water rises in a pot. For this reason, it rushes to the face, reddening the face and the eyes, for the skin, due to its clarity, reflects the color of what lies behind it—the redness of the blood—just as a glass vessel reflects the color of what is within it. The blood expands when one is angry at someone beneath him and feels capable against him. If the anger originates towards someone above him, accompanied by despair of retaliation, it results in the blood contracting from the surface of the skin to the cavity of the heart, becoming grief, which is why the complexion turns yellow. If the anger is towards an equal about whom there is doubt, the blood fluctuates between contraction and expansion, causing it to redden and yellow and become unsettled.

In summary, the faculty of anger resides in the heart, and its essence is the boiling of the heart's blood in pursuit of vengeance. This faculty, when aroused, directs itself toward repelling harmful things before they occur and toward seeking redress and revenge after they have occurred. Revenge is the sustenance and desire of this faculty, wherein lies its pleasure, and it does not subside except through it. Furthermore, people in regard to this faculty are at three levels in the original disposition: deficiency, excess, and moderation.

As for negligence: it is the absence of this power or its weakness, and that is blameworthy. It is said of such a person that he has no protective zeal. For this reason, Imam al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, said: "He who is provoked and does not become angry is a donkey." Thus, he who lacks the power of anger and protective zeal entirely is profoundly deficient. God the Exalted has described the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, with sternness and protective zeal, saying: "Severe against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves." And He said to His Prophet, peace be upon him: "Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them." Indeed, harshness and severity are among the effects of the strength of protective zeal, which is anger.

As for excess: it is when this trait dominates to the point of exceeding the governance of intellect and religion and obedience to it, leaving the individual with no insight, reflection, or choice—becoming instead like one compelled. The cause of its dominance lies in innate factors and habitual ones: some are by nature predisposed to quick anger, as if their innate form were that of an angry person, aided by a heated temperament of the heart, for anger is from fire, as He said. Indeed, a cool temperament extinguishes it and breaks its intensity. As for habitual causes: it is mixing with people who boast of venting rage and obeying anger, calling it courage and manliness, so one of them says: "I am one who does not endure deceit and falsehood, nor bear bitterness from anyone!"—meaning there is no intellect nor forbearance in me. Then he mentions it in a context of pride in his ignorance. Whoever hears this, the goodness of anger and the desire to emulate such people becomes fixed in his soul, thereby strengthening anger. Whenever the fire of anger intensifies and its flames grow strong, it blinds and deafens its possessor to every admonition; if admonished, he does not hear but rather it increases his anger, and if he seeks illumination by the light of his intellect and reflects upon himself, he cannot, for the light of intellect is extinguished and immediately obscured by the smoke of anger. Indeed, the seat of thought is the brain, and during intense anger, dark smoke ascends from the boiling blood of the heart to the brain, overwhelming the seats of thought, sometimes extending to the seats of sensation so his vision darkens until he cannot see with his eyes, and the entire world grows dark upon him, his brain becoming like a cave in which a fire rages. Its atmosphere blackens, its abode heats, its corners fill with smoke, and within it was a weak lamp whose light is obliterated or extinguished—so no foot stands firm within it, no speech is heard, no form is seen, and he cannot extinguish it from inside or out; rather, one must wait until all that is combustible burns away. Thus does anger act upon the heart and brain. Sometimes the fire of anger grows so strong it consumes the moisture that sustains the heart’s life, and its owner dies of rage, just as a fire in a cave intensifies until it cracks and its upper parts collapse upon its lower—this because the fire nullifies the cohesive force holding its parts together. Such is the state of the heart in anger. In truth, a ship amid tumultuous waves, with winds raging in the sea’s depths, is in a better state and more hopeful of safety than a soul disturbed by rage; for on the ship there is one who contrives to calm it, manage it, watch over it, and steer it, whereas the heart is the ship’s master whose stratagem has failed when anger blinds and deafens him. Among the outward effects of this anger are: change of complexion, severe trembling in the limbs, actions losing order and arrangement, disturbance in movement and speech, until foam appears on the lips, the eyes redden, the nostrils invert, and the form is transformed. If the angry person saw his image in the state of anger, his anger would subside out of shame at its ugliness and the alteration of his form—and the ugliness of his inner state is greater than that of his outer, for the outer is an indication of the inner. Indeed, the inner form first becomes ugly, then its ugliness spreads to the outer; thus the change of the outer is the fruit of the inner change—judge the fruit by the tree. This is its effect upon the body.

As for its effect on the tongue, it is the utterance of insults and obscenities—speech that a person of intellect would be ashamed of, and that the speaker himself would be ashamed of once the heat of anger subsides—all while the coherence of thought is disrupted and the flow of words becomes disordered.

As for its effect on the limbs, it is striking, assaulting, tearing, killing, and wounding when possible, without care. If the object of wrath flees from him or escapes due to some cause, and he is unable to exact vengeance, the anger returns upon its possessor, so he tears his own garment and strikes himself. He may strike the ground with his hand and run like the running of the bewildered, intoxicated, and stunned, confused one. Sometimes he falls swiftly, unable to run or rise due to the intensity of the anger, and he is overcome by something like a swoon. Sometimes he strikes inanimate objects and animals; for example, he strikes a bowl upon the ground and may break a table if he is angry at it. He engages in the actions of the insane: he reviles beasts and inanimate objects, addresses them, and says, "How long will this be from you, O such-and-such?" as if addressing a rational being, until perhaps he kicks it, so he kicks the beast and confronts it with that.

As for the effects in the heart toward the one who is the object of anger, they are rancor, envy, harboring ill intent, rejoicing in another’s misfortunes, feeling sorrow at another’s joys, resolving to divulge secrets and violate privacy, mockery, and other such vile traits. These are the fruit of excessive anger.

As for the fruit of weak zeal, it is the lack of indignation at what should provoke indignation—such as encroaching upon what is sacred, one’s wife, or female servant—and the endurance of humiliation from the lowly, along with pettiness of soul and cowardice, which is also blameworthy. For among its consequences is the absence of jealousy over what is forbidden, and that is effeminacy. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Indeed, Sa‘d is jealous, and I am more jealous than Sa‘d, and Allah is more jealous than I.” Jealousy was created solely to preserve lineages. If people were to be lax in this matter, lineages would become mixed. Thus it is said: Every community that places jealousy in its men places chastity in its women.

Among the defects of weak anger is timidity and silence in the face of witnessing wrongs. The Prophet ﷺ said, “The best of my community are those who are passionate,” meaning in religion. And Allah the Exalted said, “And let not pity for them seize you in the religion of Allah.” Indeed, one who lacks anger is incapable of disciplining his soul, for discipline is not accomplished except by unleashing anger upon desire, so that he becomes angry with himself when inclining toward base appetites. Thus the absence of anger is blameworthy. What is praiseworthy is anger that awaits the signal of intellect and religion, flaring up where zeal is required and subsiding where forbearance is fitting. Maintaining it within the bounds of moderation is the uprightness that Allah has charged His servants with—it is the middle course that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ described when he said, “The best of matters are their middle ones.”

Whoever’s anger inclines toward feebleness, to the point that he feels in himself weak jealousy and baseness of soul in enduring humiliation and oppression where it is not warranted, should treat his soul until his anger strengthens. And whoever’s anger inclines toward excess, to the point that it leads him to recklessness and plunging into abominations, should treat his soul to reduce the intensity of his anger and stand upon the true middle between the two extremes. That is the straight path, finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. If one is incapable of it, let him seek closeness to it. Allah the Exalted said, “You will never be able to be perfectly just between wives, even if you strive. So do not incline completely [to one] and leave another hanging.” Not everyone who is incapable of achieving all good should therefore commit all evil; rather, some evil is lighter than other evil, and some good is loftier than other good. This is the reality of anger and its degrees. We ask Allah for good success in what pleases Him; indeed, He has power over all He wills.

Explanation of Whether Anger's Root Can Be Removed Through Spiritual Discipline or Not

Know that some have imagined it possible to erase anger entirely, claiming that spiritual discipline is directed toward this end and aims at it. Others have supposed it to be a root trait that admits no remedy. This is the view of those who think that character is like innate creation, and that neither can be changed—both opinions are weak. Rather, the truth in this matter is what we shall mention: as long as a person loves one thing and hates another, he cannot be free from vexation and anger. And as long as something agrees with him and another opposes him, he must inevitably love what agrees and hate what opposes; anger follows from this. For whenever what he loves is taken from him, he will inevitably become angry, and whenever harm is intended against him, he will inevitably become angry.

Except that what a person loves is divided into three categories. The first is what is a necessity for all people, such as sustenance, shelter, clothing, and bodily health. Thus, if someone intends to strike or wound his body, he will inevitably become angry. Likewise, if his garment that covers his nakedness is taken from him, or if he is expelled from his house which is his dwelling, or if his water for quenching his thirst is spilled—these are necessities, and a person cannot but dislike their removal and feel wrath toward whoever encroaches upon them.

The second category: that which is not essential for any of creation, such as status, abundant wealth, servants, and beasts of burden. For these matters have become beloved through habit and ignorance of the true purposes of things, to the point that gold and silver become loved for their own sake, so they are hoarded, and one becomes angry with whoever steals them—even if one has no need of them for sustenance. This type is such that one can conceive of a person being free from the root of resentment concerning it. For if he possesses a house beyond his dwelling need and it is unjustly demolished, it is possible he would not be angry, since it is possible he is insightful regarding worldly matters and thus renounces what exceeds necessity, so he does not become angry at its taking. For he does not love its existence; and if he did love its existence, he would necessarily become angry at its taking. Most people's anger is over what is non-essential, such as status, reputation, precedence in gatherings, and boasting in knowledge. Whoever is overcome by this love will inevitably become angry if a rival contends with him for precedence in assemblies; but whoever does not love that will not care even if he sits in the row of shoes, and will not become angry if another sits above him. These corrupt habits are what multiply a person's likes and dislikes, thereby multiplying his anger. The more desires and appetites increase, the lower and more deficient their possessor becomes, because need is an attribute of deficiency; whenever needs multiply, deficiency multiplies. The ignorant one constantly strives to increase his needs and his appetites, not knowing that he is amassing causes of grief and sorrow—to the extent that some fools, due to corrupt habits and keeping bad company, reach the point of anger if told, "You are not skilled at playing with birds or at chess, nor are you capable of drinking much wine or consuming much food," and similar vices. Anger over this category is not necessary, because love for it is not necessary.

The third category: that which is essential for some people but not for others, such as a book for the scholar, because he is compelled to rely on it, so he loves it and becomes angry with whoever burns or drowns it. Likewise, the tools of trades for the laborer who cannot attain his sustenance except through them, for they are merely a means to the essential. The beloved thus becomes essential and beloved, and this varies among individuals. The essential love is that to which the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, alluded in his saying: "Whoever wakes up secure in his home, healthy in his body, and possessing his daily sustenance, it is as if the entire world has been gathered for him." And whoever is insightful into the realities of matters and is granted these three, it is conceivable that he would not become angry over anything else. These are the three categories; let us now mention the ultimate discipline for each of them.

As for the first category: the spiritual discipline therein is not so that the heart's indignation ceases to exist, but so that one gains the ability to not obey anger nor employ it against a wrongdoer except within a limit that the Sacred Law approves and reason deems good. This is attainable through striving, and by forcing oneself to exercise forbearance and endurance for a period, until forbearance and endurance become a firmly established character trait. As for suppressing the very root of indignation from the heart, that is not in accordance with innate human nature and is not possible. Indeed, it is possible to break its intensity and weaken it, so that the agitation of indignation does not become severe inwardly, and its weakness reaches the point that its effect does not appear on the face. Yet this is extremely difficult. And this is also the ruling for the third category, because what has become necessary for a particular person, another's lack of need for it does not prevent him from feeling indignation. Therefore, the spiritual discipline in this case prevents acting upon it and weakens its agitation inwardly, so that the pain of enduring it does not become severe.

As for the second category: it is possible, through spiritual discipline, to achieve freedom from anger toward it, for it is possible to remove love for it from the heart. This is by a person knowing that his true abode is the grave and his final destination is the Hereafter, and that this world is merely a crossing he traverses, from which he takes provision only to the extent of necessity. Anything beyond that is a burden and a harm to his abode and destination. Thus, he renounces the world and erases love for it from his heart. If a person had a dog he did not love, he would not become angry if someone else struck it; anger follows love. Therefore, discipline in this matter culminates in suppressing the very root of anger, which is exceedingly rare, or it may culminate merely in restraining the use of anger and acting upon its impulse, which is easier.

If you say: The necessary aspect of the first category is the pain felt at the loss of what one needs, not anger. For example, if a man has a sheep which is his sustenance and it dies, he does not become angry with anyone, even though he may feel dislike. Not every dislike necessitates anger. A person feels pain from bloodletting and cupping, yet he does not become angry with the bloodletter or cupper. So, one who is so dominated by the realization of Divine Oneness that he sees all things as being in God's hand and from Him, does not become angry with any of His creation; for he sees them as subjugated within the grasp of His power, like a pen in the hand of a writer. One whose kingdom falls by the stroke of a pen does not become angry with the pen. Thus, he does not become angry with the one who slaughters his sheep, which is his sustenance, just as he is not angry at its death, since he sees both the slaughter and death as from God, Glorified and Exalted, and that nothing befalls him except what contains the better choice. Perhaps the better choice lies in his illness, hunger, wounding, or killing. So he does not become angry, just as he is not angry with the bloodletter and cupper because he sees the better choice in it. One might say this is not impossible from this perspective. However, such dominance of the realization of Oneness to this degree is like a fleeting flash of lightning; it prevails in various states but does not endure. The heart naturally returns to focusing on the intermediaries, a return from which it cannot be repelled. If one were to imagine this state as permanent, it would be a glad tiding, but it was not imagined for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, for he would become angry until his cheeks reddened, to the point that he said, "O God, I am but a human. I become angry as humans become angry. So, any Muslim whom I have insulted, cursed, or struck, make that from me a prayer for him, a purification, and a means of nearness by which You bring him closer to You on the Day of Resurrection." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "O Messenger of God, shall I write down everything you say in anger and contentment?" He replied, "Write, for by the One who sent me with the truth as a prophet, nothing issues from it except truth," and he pointed to his tongue. He did not say, "I do not become angry," but said that anger does not cause him to depart from the truth, meaning he does not act according to the dictates of anger. Once, 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, became angry, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to her, "What is with you? Has your devil come to you?" She said, "And do you have a devil?" He said, "Yes, but I called upon God and He helped me against him, so he submitted and does not command me except with good." He did not say, "I have no devil," meaning the devil of anger, but said that he does not compel him to evil. And 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would not become angry for worldly matters. But when he was angered for the sake of truth, no one could recognize him, and nothing could withstand his anger until he secured victory for it." Thus, he would become angry for the sake of truth. And if his anger was for God, it is, in summary, an attention to the intermediaries. Indeed, anyone who becomes angry with someone who takes away the necessity of his sustenance and his need, which is indispensable for his religion, is only angry for God's sake. Therefore, it is not possible to be free from it. Yes, the root of anger may be absent regarding what is necessary if the heart is preoccupied with a more important necessity, leaving no room in the heart for anger due to its engagement with other matters, for the heart's complete absorption in some important concerns prevents the perception of anything else.

This is akin to when Salman was insulted and said: "If you fear my scales [of deeds], then I am worse than what you say; but if my scales are heavy, what you say will not harm me." His concern was wholly directed toward the Hereafter, so his heart remained unaffected by the insult. Similarly, when Rabi‘ ibn Khuthaym was insulted, he said: "O you, God has heard your words. Beyond lies a barrier to Paradise; if I cross it, what you say will not harm me, but if I do not cross it, then I am worse than what you say." A man reviled Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, and he replied: "What God has concealed from you is far greater." It was as though he was preoccupied with contemplating his own shortcomings in fearing God as He truly ought to be feared and knowing Him as He truly ought to be known, so he was not angered by another attributing deficiency to him, for he viewed himself through the lens of deficiency—such was the loftiness of his station. A woman said to Malik ibn Dinar: "O hypocrite!" He replied: "No one else has recognized me!" It was as though he was occupied with purging himself from the affliction of hypocrisy and reproaching himself for what Satan casts into him, so he was not angered by what was attributed to him. A man reviled al-Sha‘bi, and he said: "If you are truthful, may God forgive me; and if you are lying, may God forgive you."

These statements outwardly indicate that they did not become angry because their hearts were preoccupied with the weighty matters of their religion. It is also plausible that anger did stir within their hearts, yet they did not engage with it, but rather engaged with what held greater sway over their hearts. Thus, the heart's preoccupation with certain important matters can indeed prevent the agitation of anger when some desires are thwarted. Consequently, the absence of rage can be conceived either due to the heart's engagement with a significant concern, or due to the predominance of the perspective of Divine Oneness (tawhid), or due to a third reason: which is to know that God loves for one not to be overcome by rage, so the intensity of one's love for God extinguishes his rage. This is not impossible in rare states.

From this, it is understood that the path to salvation from the fire of anger is to erase the love of the world from the heart, and that is through knowledge of the world's harms and its perils—as will come in the Book of the Condemnation of the World. And whoever expels the love of distinctions from the heart is freed from most causes of anger. As for what cannot be entirely erased, it is possible to break and weaken it, so anger is weakened because of it and repelling it becomes easy. We ask God for the beauty of success through His gentleness and generosity; indeed, He has power over all things. And all praise is to God alone.

Explanation of the Inciting Causes of Anger

You have come to know that the remedy for every ailment is to cut off its substance and remove its causes. Therefore, it is necessary to know the causes of anger. Yahya (John the Baptist) once said to 'Isa (Jesus), peace be upon them both: "What is the most severe thing?" He replied: "The wrath of God." He asked: "What brings one near to the wrath of God?" He said: "That you become angry." He asked: "What reveals anger and makes it grow?" 'Isa said: "Pride, boastfulness, arrogance, and zealotry."

The inciting causes of anger are: arrogance, pride, jesting, frivolity, mockery, reproach, contentious argumentation, opposition, treachery, and intense craving for superfluous wealth and status. All of these are base and blameworthy traits according to the Sacred Law, and there is no deliverance from anger while these causes remain. Therefore, it is imperative to remove these causes by adopting their opposites.

It is incumbent upon you to extinguish arrogance through humility. And extinguish self-admiration through knowledge of your own soul—as will be elucidated in the Book of Pride and Self-Admiration—and remove vainglory by recognizing that you are of the same kind as your servant, for mankind are united in lineage by a single father; they differ only in merit, scattered as they are. The children of Adam are one kind, and pride is only taken in virtues. Yet vainglory, self-admiration, and pride are the greatest of vices, their very root and head. If you are not free from them, you have no merit over another. Why then would you boast when you are of the same kind as your servant in terms of physical constitution, lineage, and outward and inward limbs? As for jesting, remove it by occupying yourself with important religious duties that consume one's lifetime and exceed it, if you understand this. As for mockery, remove it by being too noble to harm people and by guarding yourself from being mocked. As for reproach, be wary of ugly speech and guard yourself from bitter retorts. As for intense craving for life's luxuries, remove it by being content with what is necessary, seeking the honor of self-sufficiency and rising above the humiliation of need.

Every trait among these moral qualities and every characteristic among these attributes requires, for its rectification, discipline and endurance of hardship. The essence of their discipline returns to recognizing their pernicious consequences, so that the soul may be repelled from them and recoil at their ugliness, then to persisting in practicing their opposites over a prolonged period until they become, through habit, familiar and easy for the soul. When they are erased from the soul, it has been purified and cleansed of these vices and is also freed from the anger that arises from them. Among the strongest incentives to anger for most ignorant people is their labeling of anger as courage, manliness, self-respect, and high ambition, and their giving it praiseworthy titles out of stupidity and ignorance, so that the soul inclines toward it and approves of it. This may be reinforced by recounting the intensity of anger among great figures in the context of praising courage, and since souls are inclined to emulate great ones, anger is stirred in the heart because of it. To call this self-respect and courage is ignorance; rather, it is a sickness of the heart and a deficiency of intellect, arising from the weakness and deficiency of the soul. A sign that it stems from the soul's weakness is that the sick person is quicker to anger than the healthy one, the woman quicker than the man, the child quicker than the grown man, the feeble elder quicker than the middle-aged, and the one of bad character and vile vices quicker to anger than the possessor of virtues. The base person becomes angry over his appetite if a morsel escapes him, and over his stinginess if a grain is lost, to the point that he becomes angry with his family, children, and companions. Rather, the strong one is he who controls himself in anger, as the Messenger of God ﷺ said: "The strong is not the one who overcomes people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger." Indeed, this ignorant one should be treated by recounting to him the stories of the forbearing and forgiving, and what is praised among them of restraining rage, for that is transmitted from the prophets, the saints, the wise, the scholars, and the great and virtuous kings, while the opposite is transmitted from the Kurds, the Turks, and the ignorant and foolish who have no intellect and no virtue in them.

Explanation of Treating Anger After Its Arousal

What we have mentioned is the severing of the sources of anger and the cutting off of its causes, so that it does not flare up. If a cause arises that stirs it, then at that point one must exercise restraint, so that its possessor is not compelled to act upon it in a blameworthy manner. Indeed, anger is treated at the moment of its flaring up with the remedy of knowledge and action.

Knowledge consists of six matters. The first is to reflect upon the reports we shall present concerning the merit of restraining anger, pardoning, forbearance, and endurance, so that one becomes desirous of its reward. Then the intensity of his craving for the reward of restraint prevents him from seeking vindication and retaliation, and his rage is extinguished. Malik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadathan said: Umar became angry with a man and ordered him to be struck. I said, "O Commander of the Faithful, 'Take to forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant.'" Umar then kept repeating, "Take to forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant." He pondered the verse, for he was one who halted at the Book of God, deeply contemplative whenever it was recited to him. So he reflected upon it and released the man. And Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz ordered a man to be struck, then he recited the words of the Almighty, "and those who restrain anger," and said to his servant, "Let him go."

The second is to instill fear in oneself of God's punishment, by saying: God's power over me is greater than my power over this person. Were I to unleash my anger upon him, I could not be secure from God unleashing His anger upon me on the Day of Resurrection, when I will be in utmost need of pardon. Indeed, God Almighty said in some of the ancient scriptures: "O son of Adam, remember Me when you are angry, that I may remember you when I am angry, and thus not annihilate you among those I annihilate." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, once sent a servant on an errand, and he was delayed. When he came, the Prophet said, "Were it not for the retribution [in the Hereafter], I would have struck you," meaning the retribution on the Day of Resurrection. It is also said that there was no king among the Children of Israel except that he had a wise man with him who, when the king became angry, would hand him a scroll inscribed with: "Show mercy to the poor, fear death, and remember the Hereafter." He would read it until his anger subsided.

The third is to caution oneself against the consequences of enmity and retaliation, and to see the enemy girding himself to confront him, striving to demolish his aims and gloating over his calamities—while he himself is not free from calamities—thus frightening himself with the worldly outcomes of anger if he does not fear the Hereafter. This reverts to allowing a desire to dominate anger, and this is not among the works of the Hereafter, nor is there reward for it, because it fluctuates between his immediate interests, preferring some over others, unless his caution is that his worldly affairs become disordered, thereby disturbing his leisure for knowledge and action and what aids him in the Hereafter; then he would be rewarded for it.

The fourth is to reflect on the ugliness of one's own appearance when angry, by recalling the image of others in a state of anger, and to contemplate the inherent foulness of anger itself, and how the angry person resembles a rabid dog or a predatory beast, while the forbearing, calm person who abandons anger resembles the prophets, the saints, the scholars, and the wise. He should then present his soul with the choice: whether to imitate dogs, beasts, and the vilest of people, or to imitate the scholars and prophets in their customary conduct, so that his soul may incline toward loving to emulate these latter, if there yet remains within him a shred of sound intellect.

The Fifth: That he reflects upon the motive which incites him to retaliation and prevents him from swallowing anger, and there must inevitably be a motive for it, such as Satan whispering to him: "Verily, this will lead you to incapacity, pettiness of soul, abasement, and degradation, and you will become contemptible in the eyes of people!" So he should say to his soul: "How strange you are! You disdain forbearance now, yet you do not disdain the disgrace of the Day of Resurrection and the exposure when this one takes you by the hand and takes vengeance upon you? And you fear becoming small in the eyes of people, yet you do not fear becoming small before God, the angels, and the prophets?" Therefore, whenever he swallows anger, he should swallow it for God's sake, and that will magnify him in God's sight. So what concern has he with people? And the humiliation of the one who wronged him on the Day of Resurrection is more severe than his humiliation of him if he takes vengeance now. Does he not wish to be among those who stand when the call is made on the Day of Resurrection: "Let him stand whose reward is upon God," and none shall stand save those who have pardoned? This and its like from the knowledges of faith should be repeated upon his heart.

The Sixth: That he knows his anger stems from his astonishment that a matter proceeds according to God's will, not according to his own will. So how can he say, "My will takes precedence over God's will?" And it is near that God's anger upon him becomes greater than his own anger.

As for the action, it is to say with your tongue: "I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan." This is how the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) commanded it to be said at the time of anger. When 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) would become angry, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would take her by the nose and say: "O 'Uwaysh, say: 'O Allah, Lord of the Prophet Muhammad, forgive me my sin, remove the anger from my heart, and save me from the misleading trials.'" It is recommended to say that. If it does not subdue with that, then sit if you are standing, and lie down if you are sitting, and draw near to the earth from which you were created, so that you may thereby recognize the lowliness of your soul. Seek stillness through sitting and lying down, for the cause of anger is heat, and the cause of heat is movement. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Verily, anger is an ember kindled in the heart." Do you not see the swelling of his veins and the redness of his eyes? So if any of you feels something of that, if he is standing, let him sit; and if he is sitting, let him lie down. If it still does not subside, then let him perform ablution with cold water or bathe, for fire is not extinguished except by water. He (peace be upon him) said: "When one of you becomes angry, let him perform ablution with water, for indeed anger is from fire." In another narration: "Verily, anger is from Satan, and Satan was created from fire, and fire is only extinguished by water. So when one of you becomes angry, let him perform ablution." Ibn 'Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "When you become angry, be silent." Abu Hurayrah said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) became angry while standing, he would sit; and when he became angry while sitting, he would lie down, and his anger would depart. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Verily, anger is an ember in the heart of the son of Adam. Do you not see the redness of his eyes and the swelling of his veins? So whoever feels something of that, let him press his cheek to the ground." This is an allusion to prostration, and placing the most noble of limbs upon the most lowly of places, which is the dust, so that the soul may thereby feel humility and be separated from the pride and arrogance that is the cause of anger.

It is reported that Umar once became angry, so he called for water, performed ablution, and said, "Anger is from Satan, and this removes anger." Urwah ibn Muhammad said: When I was appointed over Yemen, my father said to me, "Have you been given authority?" I said, "Yes." He said, "If you become angry, then look at the sky above you and the earth beneath you, and then magnify their Creator."

It is reported that Abu Dharr said to a man during a dispute between them, "O son of a red woman!" When this reached the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, he said, "O Abu Dharr, I have been informed that today you insulted your brother by his mother." He said, "Yes." Abu Dharr then went to appease his companion, but the man preceded him, greeted him, and mentioned this to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He said, "O Abu Dharr, raise your head and look, then know that you are not better than any red or black person except by surpassing him in good deeds." Then he said, "If you become angry while standing, sit down; if you are sitting, recline; and if you are reclining, lie down."

Al-Mu'tamir ibn Sulayman said: There was a man among those before you who would become intensely angry. He wrote scrolls and gave each scroll to a man. To the first he said, "When I become angry, give me this." To the second he said, "When my anger subsides somewhat, give me this." To the third he said, "When my anger departs, give me this." One day his anger intensified, so he was given the first scroll. On it was written: "What are you and this anger? You are not a god; you are merely a human, and it is likely that you will consume one another." So his anger subsided somewhat, and he was given the second scroll. On it was written: "Show mercy to those on earth, and He who is in heaven will show mercy to you." Then he was given the third scroll. On it was written: "Deal with people according to God's right, for nothing else will set them right"—meaning, do not suspend the prescribed punishments.

Al-Mahdi became angry with a man, so Shabib said, "Do not be more severe in anger for God than He is for Himself." He said, "Let him go."

The Virtue of Restraining Anger

God Almighty said, "And those who suppress their wrath," mentioning this in the context of praise. And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever restrains his anger, God will shield him from His punishment; and whoever seeks excuse from his Lord, God will accept his excuse; and whoever guards his tongue, God will conceal his faults." And he said, peace be upon him, "The strongest among you is he who overcomes himself in anger, and the most forbearing is he who pardons when he has the power." And he said, peace be upon him, "Whoever suppresses a surge of anger, even though he could have acted upon it, God will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection." In another narration, "God will fill his heart with security and faith." And Ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "No servant swallows a draught more greatly rewarded than a draught of anger swallowed seeking the countenance of God Almighty." And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: He, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, Hell has a gate through which none shall enter except he who quenches his anger by disobeying God Almighty." And he said, peace be upon him, "No draught is more beloved to God Almighty than a draught of anger swallowed by a servant, and no servant swallows it except that God fills his heart with faith." And he said, peace be upon him, "Whoever suppresses anger while capable of enacting it, God will call him before all creation and let him choose from among the houris as he wishes."

Narrations: Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever is God-fearing, his anger does not find relief; and whoever fears God does not do as he pleases. Were it not for the Day of Resurrection, matters would be other than what you see." Luqman said to his son: "O my son, do not let your dignity be lost through begging, nor relieve your anger by exposing others. Know your worth, and your livelihood will benefit you." Ayyub said: "An hour of forbearance wards off much evil." Sufyan al-Thawri, Abu Khuzaymah al-Yarbu'i, and al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad gathered and discussed asceticism. They unanimously agreed that the best of deeds are forbearance in anger and patience in distress." A man said to Umar, may God be pleased with him: "By God, you neither judge with justice nor give generously." Umar became angry until it showed on his face. A man said to him: "O Commander of the Faithful, do you not hear God the Exalted saying: 'Hold to forgiveness; enjoin what is right; and turn away from the ignorant'? This man is among the ignorant." Umar said: "You have spoken the truth," and it was as if a fire had been extinguished. Muhammad ibn Ka'b said: "Three traits, whoever possesses them has perfected faith in God: when pleased, his pleasure does not lead him into falsehood; when angry, his anger does not drive him from the truth; and when in power, he does not take what is not his." A man came to Salman and said: "O servant of God, counsel me." He said: "Do not become angry." The man said: "I cannot." He said: "If you become angry, then restrain your tongue and your hand."

An Exposition on the Virtue of Forbearance

Know that forbearance is superior to suppressing anger, for suppressing anger is an expression of assuming forbearance—that is, forcing oneself to be forbearing. One only needs to suppress anger when one’s anger has been stirred, and doing so requires intense struggle. However, if one practices this for a time, it becomes habitual, and anger no longer flares up; or if it does flare, suppressing it is no longer laborious. This is natural forbearance, which indicates the perfection of the intellect, its dominance, and the breaking of anger’s power, subjugating it to the intellect. Yet its beginning is assuming forbearance and forcing oneself to suppress anger. He (peace be upon him) said, “Knowledge is only acquired through learning, and forbearance through assuming forbearance. Whoever chooses good is granted it, and whoever guards against evil is protected from it.” This points to the fact that acquiring forbearance follows the path of first assuming it and forcing it, just as acquiring knowledge follows the path of learning. Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, “Seek knowledge, and along with knowledge seek tranquility and forbearance. Be gentle with those you teach and with those from whom you learn, and do not be among the tyrants among scholars, lest your ignorance overcome your forbearance.” This indicates that arrogance and tyranny are what stir anger and prevent forbearance and gentleness. Among his supplications (peace be upon him) was: “O God, enrich me with knowledge, adorn me with forbearance, honor me with piety, and beautify me with well-being.” Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Seek elevation with God.” They asked, “What is it, O Messenger of God?” He said, “Maintain ties with those who cut you off, give to those who deprive you, and be forbearing toward those who are ignorant toward you.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Five are from the practices of the messengers: modesty, forbearance, cupping, using the tooth-stick, and applying perfume.” Ali (may God honor his face) reported: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Indeed, a Muslim man may attain through forbearance the rank of one who fasts and prays at night, and he is recorded as mighty and obstinate, having power only over his own household.” Abu Huraira reported: A man said, “O Messenger of God, I have relatives with whom I maintain ties while they sever them, I treat them well while they treat me poorly, and they are ignorant toward me while I am forbearing toward them.” He said, “If it is as you say, it is as if you are feeding them hot ashes, and as long as you remain in that state, you will have a supporter from God.” By “hot ashes” he meant sand. A Muslim man said, “O God, I have no charity to give in charity, so whoever takes anything from my honor, it is charity on his part.” Then God Almighty revealed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), “I have forgiven him.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Is any one of you incapable of being like Abu Damdam?” They asked, “Who is Abu Damdam?” He said, “A man from those before you who would say upon waking: O God, I have given my honor in charity today to whoever wrongs me.”

It is said regarding God's statement "Rabbaniyyun" that it means forbearing scholars. Al-Hasan commented on God's words "And when the ignorant address them, they say, 'Peace'" saying they are forbearing; if ignorance is shown to them, they do not respond with ignorance. 'Ata ibn Abi Rabah said concerning "They walk upon the earth in humility" that it means they are forbearing. Ibn Abi Habib said regarding the Almighty's words "and middle-aged" that he stated: Middle age is the pinnacle of forbearance. Mujahid said concerning "And when they pass by ill speech, they pass by with dignity" meaning when they are wronged, they overlook it.

It is reported that Ibn Mas'ud passed by idle talk while turning away, and the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Ibn Mas'ud has become noble in the morning and the evening." Then Ibrahim ibn Maysarah, the narrator, recited the words of the Almighty, "And when they pass by idle talk, they pass by with dignity." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "O God, do not let me reach, nor let it reach me, a time in which they do not follow the All-Knowing, nor feel shame before the Forbearing, their hearts being the hearts of foreigners and their tongues the tongues of Arabs." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Let those among you who possess wisdom and understanding be near me, then those next to them, then those next to them. And do not differ, lest your hearts become discordant, and beware of the clamor of the markets." It is reported that al-Ashaj came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, as a delegate. He made his mount kneel, then tethered it, removed two garments he was wearing, and took out two fine garments from his saddlebag and put them on. This was within the sight of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, who saw what he was doing. Then he approached walking toward the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, who said to him, "O Ashaj, indeed in you are two traits that God and His Messenger love." He said, "What are they, may my father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Forbearance and deliberateness." He said, "Are they two traits I have acquired, or two I was created with?" He said, "Rather, two traits God created you with." He said, "Praise be to God who created me with two traits that God and His Messenger love." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, God loves the forbearing, modest, self-sufficient, chaste provider for his family, the pious, and He detests the obscene, vulgar, importunate beggar, the foolish." And Ibn 'Abbas said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Three things: whoever does not have one of them, do not regard any of his deeds as significant: God-consciousness that restrains him from the disobedience of God, Mighty and Majestic; forbearance by which he restrains the foolish; and good character by which he lives among people." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "When God gathers the creatures on the Day of Resurrection, a caller will call out, 'Where are the people of excellence?' A few people will stand and proceed swiftly to Paradise. The angels will meet them and say, 'We see you hastening to Paradise.' They will say, 'We are the people of excellence.' They will say to them, 'What was your excellence?' They will say, 'When we were wronged, we were patient; when we were mistreated, we forgave; and when ignorance was directed at us, we were forbearing.' It will be said to them, 'Enter Paradise; how excellent is the reward of the workers.'"

The Narrations: Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: Learn knowledge, and learn for knowledge serenity and forbearance.
And Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: Goodness is not that your wealth and children are many, but goodness is that your knowledge increases and your forbearance becomes great, and that you do not boast to people of your worship of God; and when you do good, you praise God the Exalted, and when you err, you seek forgiveness from God the Exalted.

And Anas ibn Malik said concerning the saying of God the Exalted, "Then he who was your enemy becomes as if he were a close friend" up to His saying, "Great": It is the man whose brother insults him, so he says: If you are lying, may God forgive you, and if you are truthful, may God forgive me.
And one of them said: I insulted so-and-so from the people of Basra, and he showed forbearance toward me, and he enslaved me by it for a time.
And Mu'awiyah said to 'Urabah ibn Aws: By what did you become the chief of your people, O 'Urabah? He said: O Commander of the Faithful, I would forbear from their ignorant ones, give to their asker, and strive for their needs. So whoever does what I did, then he is like me, and whoever surpasses me, then he is better than me, and whoever falls short of me, then I am better than him.
And a man reviled Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, and when he finished, he said: O 'Ikrimah, does the man have a need that we may fulfill it? So the man lowered his head and was ashamed.
And a man said to 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz: I bear witness that you are among the corrupt. He said: Your testimony is not accepted.
And it is related from 'Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn 'Ali, may God be pleased with them, that a man reviled him, so he threw to him a cloak that was upon him and ordered for him a thousand dirhams. So one of them said: He combined for him five praiseworthy traits: forbearance, removing harm, freeing the man from what distances him from God the Mighty and Majestic, causing him to regret and repent, and his return to praise after blame. He bought all of that with something of the world that is little.

And some of the scholars said: Forbearance is loftier than intellect because God the Exalted has named Himself by it.
And a man said to one of the wise men: By God, I will revile you with a revilement that will enter the grave with you. He said: It will enter with you, not with me.

So the friend went out angry, and the wise man followed him and said to him: Do you remember the day we were in your house eating, and a chicken fell on the table and spoiled what was on it, and none of us became angry? He said: Yes. He said: Then consider that this one is like that chicken. So the man's anger subsided, and he departed saying: The wise man spoke truth. Forbearance is a cure for every pain.

Even if his crimes against me multiply.

A superior, an inferior, and one like me in station.
As for the one above, I know his rank
And follow therein the truth, for truth is binding.
As for the one below me, if he speaks, I guard my honor,
And if a blamer blames, I turn away.
As for my equal, if he slips or errs,
I show favor, for favor, with forbearance, is the judge.

Explanation of the permissible measure of retaliation and satisfaction in speech

Know that every injustice that emanates from a person may not be countered with its like. Thus, it is not permissible to counter backbiting with backbiting, nor spying with spying, nor insult with insult. The same applies to all other sins. Indeed, retribution and compensation are only according to what the Sacred Law has prescribed, and we have detailed this in the jurisprudence.

As for retaliation, it is not permissible to respond in kind, for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "If a person reproaches you for what is in you, do not reproach him for what is in him." And he said, "The two who revile each other—what they say is upon the initiator, so long as the wronged one does not transgress." And he said, "The two who revile each other are two devils contending." A man insulted Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may God be pleased with him) while he remained silent. When Abu Bakr began to defend himself, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) stood up. Abu Bakr said, "You were silent when he insulted me, but when I spoke, you stood." He replied, "Because an angel was answering on your behalf. When you spoke, the angel departed and Satan came, and I would not sit in a gathering where Satan is present." Some have said: Retaliation is permissible with that which contains no falsehood, for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) only prohibited responding to reproach in kind as a prohibition of refinement, and it is superior to abstain, but it is not an act of disobedience. That which is permitted is to say: "Who are you? Are you not but from the tribe of so-and-so?" as Sa'd said to Ibn Mas'ud: "Are you not but from the tribe of Hudhayl?" and Ibn Mas'ud replied: "Are you not but from the tribe of Umayyah?" And like saying: "O fool!" Mutarrif said: "All people are foolish in what is between them and their Lord, except that some are less foolish than others." And Ibn Umar said in a lengthy tradition: "...until you see all people as foolish in the matter of God Almighty." Likewise, saying "O ignorant one!" for there is no one except that ignorance is in him; thus he has harmed him with what is not a lie. Likewise, saying "O one of bad character! O brazen-faced one! O one worthy of being turned away from!" if that is in him. Likewise, saying: "If you had any modesty, you would not have spoken," and "How low you are in my sight for what you have done," and "May God disgrace you and take vengeance upon you."

As for talebearing, backbiting, lying, and reviling one’s parents, these are unanimously forbidden. It is related that a dispute arose between Khalid ibn al-Walid and Sa‘d, and a man mentioned Khalid in Sa‘d’s presence. Sa‘d said, “Enough! What is between us has not reached the point of violating our religion”—meaning that neither of us would sin against the other—so he did not listen to evil; how then could it be permissible for him to speak it? The proof for the permissibility of what is neither false nor forbidden—such as attributing adultery, obscenity, or insult—is what ‘A’ishah (may God be pleased with her) reported: The wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Fatimah to him. She came and said, “O Messenger of God, your wives have sent me to ask you to be just concerning the daughter of Abu Quhafah,” while the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sleeping. He said, “O my daughter, do you love what I love?” She said, “Yes.” He said, “Then love this one.” She returned to them and informed them of that, and they said, “You have not helped us at all.” So they sent Zaynab bint Jahsh—she who used to rival me in love—and she came and said, “Daughter of Abu Bakr and daughter of Abu Bakr,” and she kept mentioning me while I remained silent, waiting for the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) to permit me to reply. He gave me permission, and I reviled her until my tongue grew dry. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “No indeed, she is the daughter of Abu Bakr”—meaning that you cannot match her in speech. Her statement, “I reviled her,” does not mean obscenity; rather, it is replying to her speech with truth and confronting her with sincerity. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “When two people revile each other, what they say is upon the one who began, until the wronged party transgresses.” Thus he affirmed the wronged person’s right to retaliate until he transgresses. This extent is what these scholars permitted, and it is a concession for harm as recompense for prior harm. The concession in this measure is not far-fetched, but it is better to abandon it, for it may lead beyond it, and one cannot confine oneself to the proper limit in it. Remaining silent from answering altogether is perhaps easier than embarking on a reply and adhering to the legal limit therein. Yet among people are those who cannot restrain themselves in the heat of anger but quickly return to calm, and among them are those who restrain themselves at the outset but harbor lasting resentment. People regarding anger are of four kinds: some are like kindling, quick to ignite and quick to die down; some are like the *ghada* tree, slow to ignite and slow to die down; some are slow to ignite and quick to die down—this is the most praiseworthy, provided it does not lead to weakening zeal and protective jealousy; and some are quick to ignite and slow to die down—this is the worst of them. In the report: “The believer is quick to anger and quick to be pleased, and this balances that.” Al-Shafi‘i (may God have mercy on him) said, “Whoever is provoked and does not become angry is a donkey, and whoever is appeased and is not pleased is a devil.” Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, “Verily, the children of Adam are created in various dispositions: among them are those slow to anger and quick to return, and those quick to anger and quick to return—that balances this; and among them are those quick to anger and slow to return. Verily, the best of them are the slow to anger and quick to return, and the worst of them are the quick to anger and slow to return.” Since anger flares and affects every person, it is incumbent upon the ruler not to punish anyone while angry, because he may exceed what is obligatory, and because he may be enraged at him and thus seek to vent his rage and relieve himself from the pain of fury, thereby serving his own interest. Therefore, his retaliation and vindication should be for God Almighty, not for himself. ‘Umar (may God be pleased with him) saw a drunkard and intended to seize and punish him, but the drunkard insulted him, so ‘Umar turned away. He was asked, “O Commander of the Faithful, did you leave him because he insulted you?” He said, “Because he angered me, and had I punished him, it would have been for my own anger. I did not wish to strike a Muslim out of zeal for myself.” ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may God have mercy on him) said to a man who angered him, “Were it not that you angered me, I would have punished you.”

The Discourse on the Meaning of Grudges, Their Consequences, and the Virtue of Forgiveness and Gentleness

Know that when anger is suppressed due to an inability to seek immediate redress, it retreats inward and festers, becoming rancor. Rancor means that the heart persistently harbors resentment, hatred, and aversion toward another, and that this endures and remains. It has been said, "The believer is not rancorous" [62]. Thus, rancor is the fruit of anger.

Malice yields eight consequences. First, envy: when malice compels you to wish for the removal of blessings from another, so that you grieve at any favor he receives and rejoice at any calamity that befalls him. This is the conduct of hypocrites, and its condemnation will follow, God Almighty willing. Second, that you go beyond harboring envy inwardly and instead gloat over the affliction that strikes him. Third, that you shun him, sever ties, and cut off relations, even if he seeks you out and turns to you. Fourth, which is lesser than that, is to turn away from him in disdain. Fifth, to speak of him unlawfully through falsehood, backbiting, disclosing secrets, exposing faults, and the like. Sixth, to mimic him in mockery and ridicule. Seventh, to harm him by striking or causing pain to his body. Eighth, to withhold his due rights, whether in settling a debt, maintaining kinship ties, or redressing an injustice. All of this is forbidden.

The lowest degree of rancor is that you guard against the eight mentioned afflictions and do not, due to rancor, proceed to that by which you disobey God. However, you bear it heavily within, and you do not restrain your heart from hating him, to the point that you abstain from what you used to voluntarily offer of cheerfulness, gentleness, care, attending to his needs, sitting with him in remembrance of God the Exalted, and assisting in what benefits him. Or you abstain by abandoning supplication for him and praise of him, or by refraining from urging his good treatment and offering him solace. All of this diminishes your rank in religion and stands between you and immense virtue and abundant reward, even if it does not expose you to God's punishment.

When Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, swore that he would no longer provide for Mistah—who was his relative—because he had spoken regarding the incident of the slander, the words of the Almighty were revealed: "And let not those of virtue among you swear..." up to "...Do you not love that God should forgive you?" Abu Bakr said, "Yes, we love that," and he resumed providing for him.

The preferable course is to remain upon what one was upon. However, if one is able to increase in beneficence, striving against the self and thwarting Satan, then that is the station of the truthful ones and is among the virtuous deeds of those brought near. For the one against whom rancor is held, there are three states when one has the capability: The first is to exact one's rightful due without increase or decrease, and that is justice. The second is to show kindness to him through pardon and maintaining ties, and that is excellence. The third is to wrong him with what he does not deserve, and that is injustice, which is the choice of the vile. The second is the choice of the truthful ones, and the first is the ultimate degree of the righteous. Let us now mention the virtue of pardon and beneficence.

The Virtue of Forgiveness and Benevolence

Know that the meaning of forgiveness is when one is entitled to a right but relinquishes it and absolves the other from retaliation or penalty. This is distinct from forbearance and restraining anger; hence we have treated it separately. God Almighty says: "Hold to forgiveness, enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant." And God Almighty says: "And to forgive is nearer to piety." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Three things—by Him in whose hand is my soul, were I to swear an oath I would swear upon them: wealth is not diminished by charity, so give charity; no man forgives an injustice seeking thereby the face of God but that God increases him in honor on the Day of Resurrection; and no man opens for himself the door of begging but that God opens for him the door of poverty." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Humility does not increase a servant except in rank, so be humble that God may elevate you. Forgiveness does not increase a servant except in honor, so forgive that God may honor you. Charity does not increase wealth except in abundance, so give charity that God may have mercy on you."

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "I never saw the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, seek retribution for an injustice done to him, so long as it did not violate the sanctities of God. But if any of God's sanctities were violated, he was the most angered among them. And he was never given a choice between two matters except that he chose the easier of them, provided it was not sinful." Uqbah said: "I met the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, one day and I hastened to him and took his hand, or he hastened to me and took my hand, and he said: 'O Uqbah, shall I inform you of the best character traits of the people of this world and the Hereafter? Maintain ties with him who cuts you off, give to him who deprives you, and forgive him who wrongs you.'" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Moses, peace be upon him, said: 'O Lord, which of Your servants is most dear to You?' He said: 'The one who, when he has power, forgives.'" Likewise, Abu al-Darda was asked about the most honorable of people, and he said: "He who forgives when he has power." So forgive, that God may honor you.

A man came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, complaining of an injustice, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, instructed him to sit and intended to secure his right for him. Then he, peace be upon him, said to him: "Indeed, the wronged are the successful on the Day of Resurrection." So the man refused to pursue it when he heard the hadith. And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever invokes a curse upon one who wronged him has taken revenge." And from Anas, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When God raises the creatures on the Day of Resurrection, a caller from beneath the Throne will call out three times: 'O assembly of monotheists, God has forgiven you, so forgive one another.'"

From Abu Hurairah: When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, conquered Mecca, he circumambulated the House and prayed two rak'ahs, then came to the Kaaba and took hold of the doorposts and said: "What do you say, and what do you suppose?" They said: "We say: a brother and a cousin, forbearing and merciful"—they said it three times—and he, peace be upon him, said: "I say as my brother Joseph said: 'No blame upon you today; may God forgive you, for He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.'" So they departed as if they had been raised from the graves and entered into Islam. From Suhayl ibn Amr: When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, entered Mecca, he placed his hands upon the door of the Kaaba with the people around him and said: "There is no god but God alone, with no partner. He fulfilled His promise, supported His servant, and defeated the confederates alone." Then he said: "O assembly of Quraysh, what do you say and what do you suppose?" I said: "O Messenger of God, we say good and suppose good: a noble brother and a merciful cousin, and you have prevailed." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "I say as my brother Joseph said: 'No blame upon you today; may God forgive you.'"

From Anas, who said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When the servants stand [for judgment], a caller will call: 'Let him whose reward is upon God rise and enter Paradise.' It was said: 'And who is he whose reward is upon God?' He said: 'Those who forgive people.' Then a great multitude, thousands upon thousands, will rise and enter it without account." Ibn Mas'ud said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "It is not fitting for a ruler, when a prescribed punishment is brought before him, except that he carry it out; yet God is forgiving and loves forgiveness." Then he recited the verse: "And let them pardon and overlook." Jabir said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Three things: whoever comes with them along with faith will enter from whichever gates of Paradise he wishes and will be wed to the wide-eyed maidens wherever he wishes: he who repays a debt secretly, recites 'Say: He is God, the One' ten times after every prayer, and forgives his killer." Abu Bakr said: "Or one of them, O Messenger of God?" He said: "Or one of them."

Narrations: Ibrahim al-Taymi said: "A man may wrong me, yet I feel compassion for him." This is a kindness beyond mere pardon, for one's heart becomes occupied with concern that the wrongdoer has exposed himself to disobedience to God Almighty through his injustice and that he will be called to account on the Day of Resurrection without a ready answer. Some have said: "When God wills to bestow a gift upon a servant, He appoints for him one who will wrong him." A man entered upon 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy on him, and began to complain to him about a man who had wronged him, speaking ill of him. 'Umar said to him: "If you meet God with your grievance as it is, that is better for you than meeting Him after having exacted retaliation." Yazid ibn Maysarah said: "If you persist in praying against one who has wronged you, then God Almighty says: 'The last to pray against you is the one you wronged. If you wish, We answer you and answer against you; and if you wish, We defer you both until the Day of Resurrection, where My forgiveness will encompass you both.'" Muslim ibn Yasar said to a man who was praying against his wrongdoer: "Leave the wrongdoer to his wrongdoing, for it will reach him faster than your prayer against him, unless he is redeemed by righteous deeds—though it is likely he will not do so." It is reported from Ibn 'Umar, from Abu Bakr, that he said: "It has reached us that on the Day of Resurrection, God Almighty will command a caller to proclaim: 'Let whoever has a claim with God stand up.' Then those who pardoned others will stand, and God will reward them for their having pardoned people." It is reported from Hisham ibn Muhammad that al-Nu'man ibn al-Mundhir was brought two men: one had committed a grave sin, and he pardoned him; the other had committed a minor sin, and he punished him. He said:

"Kings pardon grave sins by their grace,
Yet punish for the slight—not out of ignorance,
But to make known their forbearance and to instill fear
Of the severity of their wrath."

From Mubarak ibn Fadala, who said: Sawwar ibn Abdullah was part of a delegation from the people of Basra to Abu Ja'far. He said: I was with him when a man was brought and he ordered him to be killed. I said, "A man from the Muslims is to be killed while I am present?" So I said, "O Commander of the Faithful, shall I not relate to you a narration I heard from Al-Hasan?" He said, "What is it?" I said, "I heard him say: 'On the Day of Resurrection, God Almighty will gather the people on a single plain where the caller will make them hear and sight will penetrate. Then a caller will stand and proclaim, "Let him who has a favor with God stand." None will stand except one who pardoned (others).'" He said, "By God, did you truly hear this from Al-Hasan?" I said, "By God, I heard it from him." He said, "Release him."

And Mu'awiyah said: Adhere to forbearance and endurance until the opportunity is yours, and when it is yours, then upon you is pardon and bestowing favor.

It was narrated that a monk entered upon Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, who said to the monk, "What is your view of Dhu al-Qarnayn? Was he a prophet?" He said, "No, but he was granted what he was granted due to four traits he possessed: When he had power, he pardoned; when he promised, he fulfilled; when he spoke, he was truthful; and he did not accumulate today's work for tomorrow."

Some of them said: The forbearing one is not he who is wronged and shows forbearance until, when he gains power, he takes revenge. Rather, the forbearing one is he who is wronged and shows forbearance until, when he gains power, he pardons.

And Ziyad said: Power removes rancor—meaning grudge and anger.

A man was brought to Hisham about whom something had reached him. When he was placed before him, he began to speak his defense. Hisham said to him, "And you still speak?" The man said, "O Commander of the Faithful, God Almighty said, 'The Day when every soul will come disputing for itself' (Quran 16:111). Shall we dispute with God Almighty and not speak a word before you?" Hisham said, "Yes, woe to you, speak."

It was narrated that a thief entered the tent of Ammar ibn Yasir at Siffin. It was said to him, "Cut off his hand, for he is from our enemies." He said, "Rather, I will cover for him, perhaps God will cover for me on the Day of Resurrection."

Ibn Mas'ud sat in the market to buy food. He bought, then sought the dirhams, which were in his turban, and found it had been untied. He said, "I sat down while they were with me." They began to invoke against the one who took them, saying, "O God, cut off the hand of the thief who took them! O God, do such and such to him!" Abdullah said, "O God, if need compelled him to take them, then bless him in them; and if boldness in sin compelled him, then make it the last of his sins."

Al-Fudayl said: I have not seen anyone more ascetic than a man from the people of Khorasan who sat with me in the Sacred Mosque, then stood to perform tawaf, and dinars he had with him were stolen. He began to weep. I said, "Do you weep over the dinars?" He said, "No. But I imagined him and me before God Almighty, and my intellect perceived the nullification of his argument, so my weeping is mercy for him."

Malik ibn Dinar said: We came to the residence of Al-Hakam ibn Ayyub at night—he was the governor of Al-Basrah—and Al-Hasan came, fearful. We entered with him to see him. We were with Al-Hasan only in the place of the chicks. Al-Hasan mentioned the story of Joseph, peace be upon him, and what his brothers did to him by selling him and throwing him into the well. He said, "They sold their brother and grieved their father," and he mentioned what he faced from the plotting of the women and from imprisonment. Then he said, "O Governor, what did God do for him? He gave him mastery over them, raised his mention, exalted his word, and made him over the storehouses of the earth. So what did he do when his affair was perfected for him and his family was gathered? He said, 'There is no blame upon you today. May God forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful' (Quran 12:92)"—hinting to Al-Hakam about pardoning his companions. Al-Hakam said, "Then I say: There is no blame upon you today, and if I had only this garment of mine, I would cover you beneath it."

Ibn al-Muqaffa wrote to a friend of his, asking him to pardon one of his brothers: "So-and-so flees from his slip to your pardon, seeking refuge with you. And know that the sin will not increase in greatness except that pardon increases in virtue."

Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was brought captives from Ibn al-Ash'ath. He said to Raja ibn Haywah, "What do you see?" He said, "God Almighty has given you what you love of victory, so give God what He loves of pardon." So he pardoned them.

It was narrated that Ziyad seized a man from the Khawarij, but he escaped from him, so he seized his brother. He said to him, "If you bring me your brother, otherwise I will strike your neck." He said, "What is your view if I bring you a letter from the Commander of the Faithful to release me?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Then I bring you a letter from the Almighty, the Wise, and I establish upon it two witnesses: Abraham and Moses." Then he recited, "Or has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Moses and Abraham who fulfilled [his obligations]? That no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another" (Quran 53:36-38). So Ziyad said, "Release him. This man has been taught his argument."

And it is said, written in the Gospel: He who seeks forgiveness for the one who wronged him has defeated Satan.

The Virtue of Gentleness

Know that gentleness is praiseworthy, and its opposite is harshness and severity. Harshness results from anger and coarseness, while gentleness and softness stem from good character and soundness. The cause of severity may be anger, or it may be intense greed and its domination, such that it bewilders one from reflection and prevents careful consideration. Thus, gentleness in affairs is a fruit yielded only by good character, and good character is achieved only by controlling the forces of anger and desire, keeping them within the bounds of moderation. For this reason, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, praised gentleness and emphasized it, saying, "O 'A'ishah, whoever is given his share of gentleness has been given his share of the good of this world and the Hereafter, and whoever is deprived of his share of gentleness has been deprived of his share of this world and the Hereafter." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "When God loves a household, He causes gentleness to enter upon them." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, God grants for gentleness what He does not grant for harshness, and when God loves a servant, He grants him gentleness. No household is deprived of gentleness except that they are deprived of the love of God, the Exalted." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, God is Gentle and loves gentleness, and He grants for it what He does not grant for harshness." And he, peace be upon him, said, "O 'A'ishah, be gentle, for when God wills goodness for a household, He guides them to the door of gentleness." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever is deprived of gentleness is deprived of all good." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Any ruler who governs with gentleness and softness, God, the Exalted, will be gentle with him on the Day of Resurrection." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Do you know who is forbidden from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection? Every gentle, easy, approachable person." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Gentleness is a blessing, and harshness is an ill omen." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Deliberation is from God, and haste is from Satan." It is narrated that a man came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, God has blessed all the Muslims through you, so favor me with some good from you." He said, "Praise be to God," two or three times, then turned to him and said, "Will you take counsel?" two or three times. The man said, "Yes." He said, "If you intend a matter, consider its consequence; if it is sound, proceed, and if it is otherwise, desist." And from 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she was with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, on a journey on a stubborn camel, and she kept turning it right and left. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "O 'A'ishah, be gentle, for gentleness does not enter anything except that it adorns it, and is not removed from anything except that it disgraces it."

Narrations: It reached 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, that a group of his subjects complained about his governors, so he ordered them to come to him. When they came, he stood, praised God, and extolled Him, then said, "O people, O subjects, you have a duty to us: sincere advice in absence and cooperation in good. O rulers, the subjects have a right over you. Know that nothing is more beloved to God nor more honored than the forbearance and gentleness of a leader. No ignorance is more detestable to God nor more grievous than the ignorance and harshness of a leader. And know that whoever deals with gentleness among those around him will be granted gentleness from those above him."

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: Gentleness is the twin of forbearance.

In a report, both attributed and traced to the Prophet: "Knowledge is the intimate friend of the believer, forbearance is his minister, intellect his guide, action his treasurer, gentleness his father, softness his brother, and patience the commander of his troops." Some said: How excellent is faith adorned by knowledge, how excellent is knowledge adorned by action, how excellent is action adorned by gentleness, and nothing is added to something like forbearance is added to action. 'Amr ibn al-'As said to his son 'Abdullah: "What is gentleness?" He said, "To be deliberate and to soften toward rulers." He said, "And what is harshness?" He said, "Opposing your leader and antagonizing one who can harm you." Sufyan said to his companions: "Do you know what gentleness is?" They said, "Tell us, O Abu Muhammad." He said, "To place matters in their proper places: severity where it belongs, softness where it belongs, the sword where it belongs, and the whip where it belongs." This indicates that it is necessary to mix sternness with softness and coarseness with gentleness, as it is said:

"Placing gentleness in the place of severity is harmful, like placing the sword in the place of gentleness."

The praiseworthy path is the middle ground between harshness and gentleness, as in all moral traits. However, since human dispositions lean more toward harshness and severity, the need to encourage them toward the side of gentleness is greater. This is why the Sacred Law frequently praises the aspect of gentleness over harshness, even though harshness in its proper place is good, just as gentleness in its proper place is good. When harshness is the obligatory course, it aligns truth with one's inclination, and that is sweeter than cream with honey, and so on.

‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, may God have mercy on him, said: It is reported that ‘Amr ibn al-‘As wrote to Mu‘awiyah reproaching him for his deliberateness. Mu‘awiyah wrote back to him: "Now then, understanding in matters of good is an increase in good. The rightly guided is he who is guided away from haste. The loser is he who fails in patience. The cautious one is correct, or nearly so. The hasty one is mistaken, or nearly so. He whom gentleness does not benefit, rashness will harm. He whom experiences do not benefit will not attain lofty stations."

And from Abu ‘Awn al-Ansari, who said: "People never utter a harsh word except that there is a gentler word beside it that could serve the same purpose."

And Abu Hamzah al-Kufi said: "Do not take on servants except out of absolute necessity, for with every person is a devil. And know that they will not give you anything through severity except that they would give you something better through gentleness."

And al-Hasan said: "The believer is deliberate and cautious; he is not like a night-time wood-gatherer."

This is the praise of the people of knowledge for gentleness, because it is praiseworthy and beneficial in most circumstances and the majority of affairs. The need for harshness may occur, but it is rare. Only the perfected one can distinguish the occasions for gentleness from the occasions for harshness and give each matter its due right. If one's insight is deficient or the ruling of a particular situation is unclear to him, then let his inclination be toward gentleness, for success lies with it in most cases.

Discourse on the Censure of Envy, Its True Nature, and Its Causes

and its remedy, and the utmost obligation in its removal

An Exposition on the Censure of Envy

Know that envy is also a consequence of rancor, and rancor is a consequence of anger; thus it is a branch of its branch, and anger is the root of its root. Then, envy has from blameworthy branches what can scarcely be enumerated. Numerous reports have come regarding the censure of envy in particular: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Envy consumes good deeds just as fire consumes firewood." And he, peace be upon him, said in prohibiting envy, its causes, and its fruits, "Do not envy one another, do not sever ties, do not harbor hatred, do not turn your backs on one another, and be brothers, servants of God." Anas said: We were sitting one day with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, when he said, "There will now appear to you from this mountain pass a man from the people of Paradise." Then a man from the Ansar appeared, shaking his beard from his ablution, having hung his sandals in his left hand, and he gave greetings. The next day, he, peace be upon him, said the same thing, and that man appeared. He said it on the third day, and that man appeared. When the Prophet, peace be upon him, departed, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As followed him and said to him, "I have quarreled with my father and sworn not to enter upon him for three days. If you see fit to host me with you until the three days pass, I would do so." He said, "Yes." So he stayed with him for three nights and did not see him perform any night prayer, except that when he turned on his bed he remembered God, the Exalted, and he did not rise for the dawn prayer. He said, "However, I did not hear him say anything but good." When the three days had passed and I was almost belittling his deeds, I said, "O Abdullah, there was no anger or estrangement between me and my father, but I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say such and such, and I wanted to know your deed, yet I did not see you perform much deed. So what is it that has brought you to that?" He said, "It is nothing but what you saw." When I turned to leave, he called me and said, "It is nothing but what you saw, except that I find in myself no deceit against any Muslim, nor envy for any good that God has bestowed upon him." Abdullah said, "I said to him, 'It is that which has brought you to it, and it is that which we cannot attain.'" And he, peace be upon him, said, "Three things from which no one is saved: suspicion, ill omens, and envy. And I will tell you the way out from them: if you suspect, do not confirm; if you see an ill omen, proceed; and if you envy, do not transgress." In another narration: "Three things from which no one is saved, and few are saved from them." This narration affirms the possibility of salvation. And he, peace be upon him, said, "The diseases of the nations before you have crept upon you: envy and hatred. Hatred is the shaver—I do not say it shaves hair, but it shaves religion. By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not inform you of what establishes that for you? Spread peace among yourselves." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Poverty almost becomes disbelief, and envy almost overcomes divine decree." And he, peace be upon him, said, "A disease of the nations will afflict my community." They said, "And what is the disease of the nations?" He said, "Extravagance, arrogance, rivalry in worldly increase, competition in the world, alienation, and mutual envy until there is oppression, then chaos." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Do not show glee at your brother's misfortune, lest God grant him recovery and afflict you." It is narrated that when Moses, peace be upon him, hastened to his Lord, the Exalted, he saw a man in the shadow of the Throne and admired his station, saying, "This one is indeed honored by his Lord." He asked his Lord, the Exalted, to inform him of his name, but He did not inform him and said, "I will tell you of his deed with three things: He did not envy people for what God had given them of His bounty, he did not disobey his parents, and he did not walk with slander." And Zechariah, peace be upon him, said: God, the Exalted, said, "The envier is an enemy to My favor, displeased with My decree, not content with the portion I have apportioned among My servants." And he, peace be upon him, said, "What I fear most for my community is that wealth becomes abundant among them, so they envy one another and kill one another." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Seek help in fulfilling needs through concealment, for everyone endowed with a favor is envied." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, the favors of God have enemies." It was said, "And who are they?" He said, "Those who envy people for what God has given them of His bounty." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Six will enter the Fire a year before the Reckoning." It was said, "O Messenger of God, who are they?" He said, "Rulers through injustice, Arabs through tribalism, village chiefs through arrogance, merchants through treachery, villagers through ignorance, and scholars through envy."

The Narrations: Some of the early pious predecessors said: The first sin was envy—the envy of Iblis towards Adam, peace be upon him, regarding his rank. He refused to prostrate to him, and this led him to envy and disobedience. It is related that ‘Awn ibn ‘Abd Allah entered upon al-Fadl ibn al-Muhallab, who was then the governor of Wasit, and said: "I wish to admonish you with something." He said: "What is it?" He replied: "Beware of pride, for it was the first sin by which God was disobeyed." Then he recited: "And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam,' and they prostrated, except for Iblis..." [Qur'an 2:34]. "And beware of greed, for it expelled Adam from Paradise. God Almighty had granted him a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth, from which he could eat except for one tree He forbade him. He ate from it, and God expelled him from it." Then he recited: "Descend from it..." [Qur'an 2:38] to the end of the verse. "And beware of envy, for it was only envy that caused the son of Adam to kill his brother." Then he recited: "And recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam in truth..." [Qur'an 5:27] the verses. "And when the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, are mentioned, hold back [from criticism]. When Divine Decree is mentioned, be silent. And when the stars are mentioned, be silent."

And Bakr ibn ‘Abd Allah said: A man used to frequent a certain king and would stand before him and say: "Be good to the one who does good by his goodness, for the wrongdoer will suffice you his wrongdoing." Another man envied him for that position and speech and slandered him to the king, saying: "This one who stands before you and says what he says claims that the king has bad breath." The king said to him: "How can that be verified to me?" He said: "Summon him to you, for when he draws near, he will place his hand over his nose so as not to smell the bad breath." The king said: "Leave until I consider it." He left the king's presence and invited the man to his house, feeding him food containing garlic. The man left him and stood before the king as was his custom and said: "Be good to the one who does good by his goodness, for the wrongdoer will suffice you his wrongdoing." The king said to him: "Draw near to me." He drew near and placed his hand over his mouth, fearing the king would smell the garlic from him. The king said to himself: "I see nothing but that he has spoken the truth." It is said the king would only write in his own hand for a reward or a gift. So he wrote for him a letter in his own hand to one of his agents: "When the bearer of my letter comes to you, slaughter him, skin him, stuff his skin with straw, and send it to me." He took the letter and left. The man who had slandered him met him and said: "What is this letter?" He said: "The king's handwriting for a gift for me." He said: "Give it to me!" He said: "It is yours." He took it and went with it to the agent. The agent said: "In your letter it says I am to slaughter you and skin you." He said: "The letter is not for me and not concerning me until you refer back to the king." He said: "There is no referring back the king's letter." So he slaughtered him, skinned him, stuffed his skin with straw, and sent it. Then the man returned to the king as was his custom and said his saying. The king was amazed and said: "What happened with the letter?" He said: "So-and-so met me and asked me for it, so I gave it to him." The king said to him: "He mentioned to me that you claim I have bad breath." He said: "I never said that." He said: "Then why did you place your hand over your mouth?" He said: "Because he fed me food containing garlic, and I disliked that you should smell it." He said: "You have spoken the truth. Return to your place, for the wrongdoer has indeed sufficed you his wrongdoing."

And Ibn Sirin, may God have mercy on him, said: "I have never envied anyone for anything of worldly matters, for if he is among the people of Paradise, how can I envy him for the world when it is but a pit compared to Paradise? And if he is among the people of the Fire, how can I envy him for worldly matters when he is bound for the Fire?"

And a man said to al-Hasan: "Does a believer feel envy?" He said: "Have you forgotten the sons of Jacob? Yes, but suppress it in your chest, for it will not harm you as long as you do not act upon it with hand or tongue."

And Abu al-Darda’ said: "No servant frequently remembers death except that his joy diminishes and his envy diminishes!"

And Mu‘awiyah said: "All people can be satisfied except the envier of blessings, for nothing satisfies him except their removal." And for that it is said:

Every enmity may be hoped to be extinguished, except the enmity of one who opposes you out of envy.

Some of the wise have said: Envy is a wound that does not heal, or consider what the envious one endures. A Bedouin said: I have never seen an oppressor more resembling the oppressed than the envier; he sees a blessing upon you as a calamity upon himself. Al-Hasan said: O son of Adam, why do you envy your brother? If what was given to him was due to his honor with God, why do you envy one whom God has honored? And if it was otherwise, why do you envy one whose destination is the Fire? Some have said: The envier gains from gatherings nothing but blame and humiliation, and from the angels nothing but curse and hatred, and from creation nothing but anguish and grief, and at the moment of death nothing but severity and terror, and at the Standing (on Judgment Day) nothing but disgrace and punishment.

Explanation of the Reality of Envy, Its Ruling, Its Types, and Its Degrees

Know that envy is only concerning a blessing. When God bestows a blessing upon your brother, you have two possible states regarding it: One is that you dislike that blessing and desire its removal—this state is called envy. Thus, envy is defined as disliking the blessing and desiring its removal from the one upon whom it is bestowed.

The second state is when you do not desire its removal, nor do you dislike its existence and continuance, but you yearn for the like of it for yourself. This is called "ghibṭah" (emulation), and it may be specifically termed "munāfasah" (rivalry).

And competition may be termed envy, and envy may be termed competition, with one expression being used in place of the other. There is no restriction in names once the meanings are understood, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Indeed, the believer feels emulation (ghibṭah), while the hypocrite feels envy (ḥasad)."

As for the first, it is forbidden in every circumstance, except when a wicked or disbelieving person attains a blessing and uses it to stir up strife, corrupt relationships, and harm the truth. Then your aversion to it and your desire for its removal do not harm you, for you do not desire its removal insofar as it is a blessing, but rather insofar as it is an instrument of corruption. Had you been secure from his corruption, his blessing would not grieve you. The transmitted reports we have cited indicate the prohibition of envy, and that this aversion is displeasure with God’s decree in preferring some of His servants over others—and there is no excuse or concession for that. What sin is greater than your aversion to the comfort of a Muslim without you suffering any harm from him? To this the Qur’an alludes in His saying, “If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if evil strikes you, they rejoice at it.” This rejoicing is gloating, and envy and gloating are intertwined. And the Exalted said, “Many of the People of the Book wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves.” So the Exalted informed that their love for the removal of the blessing of faith is envy. And the Almighty said, “They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would be equal.” And God the Exalted mentioned the envy of the brothers of Joseph, peace be upon him, and expressed what was in their hearts by His saying, “When they said, ‘Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a band. Indeed, our father is in clear error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to some land; your father’s attention will then be solely for you.’” So when they disliked their father’s love for him and were grieved by it, and desired its removal from him, they concealed him from him. And He said, “And they find in their breasts no need for what they have been given,” meaning their breasts are not constricted by it, nor are they grieved—thus He praised them for the absence of envy. And He said in the context of reproach, “Or do they envy people for what God has given them of His bounty?” And He said, “Mankind was one community,” up to His words, “except those to whom it was given after clear proofs had come to them, out of envy among themselves.” It is said in the interpretation: out of envy. And He said, “And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves.” For God sent down knowledge to unite them and bring them together in obedience to Him, and commanded them to unite through knowledge, but they envied and differed when each of them desired to be alone in leadership and acceptance of speech, so they refuted one another. Ibn Abbas said: The Jews, before the Prophet was sent, when they fought a people, would say, “We ask you by the Prophet you have promised to send and by the Book you will reveal, that you grant us victory.” And they would be granted victory. But when the Prophet came from the descendants of Ishmael, peace be upon him, they recognized him and disbelieved in him after recognizing him. So the Exalted said, “And they used to pray for victory over those who disbelieved, but when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it,” up to His words, “that they disbelieve in what God has revealed out of envy.” Safiyyah bint Huyayy said to the Prophet: My father and my uncle came from you one day, and my father said to my uncle, “What do you say about him?” He said, “I say he is the Prophet foretold by Moses.” He said, “What do you think?” He said, “I think to oppose him for the rest of my life.” This is the ruling of envy in its prohibition.

As for rivalry: it is not forbidden; rather, it is either obligatory, recommended, or permissible. The term envy is sometimes used in place of rivalry, and rivalry in place of envy. Qutham ibn al-‘Abbas said: When he and al-Fadl intended to go to the Prophet, peace be upon him, to ask him to appoint them over the collection of alms—they said to ‘Ali when he told them, “Do not go to him, for he will not appoint you to such a position”—they replied to him, “This from you is nothing but rivalry, and by God, he married you to his daughter, yet we did not begrudge you that.” That is, this from you is envy, and we did not envy you for his marrying you to Fatimah.

Competition in language is derived from "preciousness," and what indicates the permissibility of competition is the statement of the Almighty: "For that let the competitors compete" (Quran 83:26), and His saying: "Race toward forgiveness from your Lord" (Quran 57:21). Competition occurs when there is fear of missing out, akin to two servants racing to serve their master; each is anxious that his companion might precede him and attain a station with their master that he himself does not reach. How much more so when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, explicitly stated it, saying: "There is no envy except in two cases: a man whom God has given wealth and he spends it rightfully in truth, and a man whom God has given knowledge and he acts upon it and teaches it to the people." He then explained this in the hadith of Abu Kabshah al-Anmari, saying: "The likeness of this community is that of four men: a man whom God has given wealth and knowledge, so he acts upon his knowledge with his wealth; a man whom God has given knowledge but has not given wealth, and he says, 'O Lord, if I had wealth like so-and-so, I would act with it as he acts'—these two are equal in reward (and this from him is a love to have wealth like his so that he may do as he does, without desiring the removal of the blessing from him)—and a man whom God has given wealth but has not given knowledge, so he spends it in disobedience to God; and a man whom God has not given knowledge nor wealth, and he says, 'If I had wealth like so-and-so, I would spend it in the same way he spends it in disobedience'—these two are equal in sin." Thus, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, censured him from the aspect of his wishing for disobedience, not from the aspect of his love to have a blessing like his. Therefore, there is no blame on one who admires another for a blessing and desires the like for himself, as long as he does not wish for its removal from the other nor dislike its continuance for him. Indeed, if that blessing is a religious obligation such as faith, prayer, or zakah, then this competition is obligatory—meaning he loves to be like him, for if he does not love that, he is content with disobedience, and that is forbidden. If the blessing is among the virtues, such as spending wealth in noble deeds and charities, then competition in it is recommended. If it is a blessing enjoyed in a permissible manner, then competition in it is permissible. All of this returns to the intention of equaling him and catching up to him in the blessing, without any dislike of the blessing itself. Under this blessing lie two matters: one is the comfort of the one bestowed, and the other is the appearance of the deficiency of others and their falling short of it. He dislikes one of the two aspects—his own falling short—and loves to equal him.

There is no blame upon one who dislikes his own lagging behind and deficiency in permissible matters. Indeed, that diminishes from the virtues and contradicts asceticism, reliance, and contentment, and it veils one from the lofty spiritual stations, but it does not constitute disobedience. And herein lies a subtle, obscure point: that when one despairs of attaining a similar blessing, while disliking his own lagging and deficiency, he inevitably loves the removal of that deficiency. His deficiency is only removed either by attaining something similar or by the removal of the blessing from the one envied. If one of these two paths is blocked, the heart can scarcely be free from desiring the other path, until if the blessing is removed from the envied one, that is more healing for him than its continuance, for with its removal his own lagging ceases and the other's advancement is gone. The heart can scarcely be free from this. If it is such that were the matter left to him and returned to his choice, he would strive to remove the blessing from the other, then he is an envier with a blameworthy envy. But if piety restrains him from removing it, then he is forgiven for what he finds in his nature of pleasure at the removal of the blessing from the one he envies, however much his intellect and religion may dislike it from himself. Perhaps this is the meaning of his saying, peace be upon him, "Three things the believer is never free from: envy, suspicion, and ill omen." Then he said, and he has an escape from them: "If you envy, do not transgress," meaning if you find something in your heart, do not act upon it. It is remote that a person, desiring to catch up to his brother in a blessing but being unable, would then be free from an inclination toward the removal of the blessing; for he inevitably finds a preference for its removal over its continuance. This limit of rivalry contends with forbidden envy, so one must be cautious therein, for it is a place of danger. There is no person except that he sees above himself a group of his acquaintances and peers, and he loves equaling them. This almost drags one into prohibited envy if one is not strong in faith and firm in piety. Whenever his motivator is the fear of disparity and the appearance of his deficiency compared to others, it drags him to blameworthy envy and to the natural inclination toward the removal of the blessing from his brother, so that he may descend to his level since he could not ascend to his level by attaining the blessing. There is absolutely no concession for this; rather, it is forbidden, whether in religious or worldly objectives. However, one is forgiven for it as long as he does not act upon it, if God Almighty wills, and his dislike of it from himself is an expiation for him. This, then, is the reality of envy and its rulings.

As for its levels, they are four. The first is that one desires the removal of blessing from another, even if that blessing does not transfer to oneself. This is the utmost depravity. The second is that one desires the removal of the blessing from another due to one's own craving for that blessing, such as craving a fine house, a beautiful woman, an influential position, or an ample provision that another has attained, and one wishes it were for oneself. What is sought is that blessing itself, not merely its removal from the other; what is disliked is the loss of the blessing, not that another should enjoy it. The third is that one does not covet the very same thing for oneself but covets its like. If one is incapable of attaining its like, one then desires its removal so that the disparity between them may not be apparent. The fourth is that one desires for oneself the like of it, but if it is not attained, one does not desire its removal from the other.

This latter type is pardoned if it pertains to worldly matters, but recommended if it concerns religion.  
The third type contains both blameworthy and non-blameworthy aspects, while the second is lighter than the third, and the first is purely blameworthy.  
To label this rank as envy is permissible as an extended usage, yet it is blameworthy due to the Almighty’s saying: “Do not covet what God has favored some of you with over others.” Thus, wishing for the like of that is not blameworthy, but wishing for that very thing itself is blameworthy.

Explanation of the Causes of Envy and Rivalry

As for competition, its cause is love for that in which there is rivalry. If that is a religious matter, its cause is love for God Almighty and love for obedience to Him; if it is worldly, its cause is love for the permissible enjoyments of this world and indulgence in them. We are now examining blameworthy envy, and its avenues are exceedingly numerous, but its totality may be confined to seven doors: enmity, arrogance, astonishment, fear of losing beloved objectives, love of leadership, the wickedness and stinginess of the soul. For indeed, one begrudges a blessing upon another either because he is his enemy and thus does not wish good for him—this is not limited to equals, but even a base person envies a king, meaning he desires the removal of his blessing due to hatred for him because of some harm he inflicted upon him or upon someone he loves. Or it may be from the perspective that he knows the other will grow arrogant with the blessing over him, and he cannot bear his arrogance and boasting due to his own sense of honor—this is what is meant by self-respect. Or it may be in his nature to be arrogant over the envied one, and that is prevented from him due to the other's blessing—this is what is meant by arrogance. Or the blessing may be great and the position lofty, so he is astonished that one like him should attain such a blessing—this is what is meant by astonishment. Or he may fear the loss of his own objectives because of the other's blessing, in that he may use it to rival him in his aims. Or he may love leadership, which is built upon being distinguished by a blessing in which others do not share. Or it may not be due to any of these reasons, but rather due to the wickedness of the soul and its stinginess with good toward the servants of God Almighty. It is necessary to explain these causes.

The First Cause: Enmity and Hatred. This is the most severe cause of envy. For when a person is harmed by another due to some reason, or is opposed by them in some objective in any manner, his heart comes to hate them and is angered by them, and rancor becomes firmly rooted in his soul. Rancor demands retaliation and revenge. If the one who hates is incapable of taking revenge himself, he desires that time itself take revenge for him. He may even attribute this to the honor of his own soul before God, Exalted is He. Thus, whenever a calamity befalls his enemy, he rejoices at it, thinking it is a recompense from God for his hatred, and that it is because of him. And whenever a blessing befalls his enemy, it grieves him, for it contradicts his desire. It may even occur to him that he has no standing with God, since He did not take revenge on his behalf against the enemy who harmed him, but rather bestowed favor upon him. In sum, envy necessarily accompanies hatred and enmity and does not part from them. The utmost limit of piety is that one does not act unjustly and that one dislikes this [envy] within himself. As for hating a person and then being indifferent to his joy and his grief—this is not possible. This is among what God, Exalted is He, ascribed to the disbelievers, namely envy born of enmity, as God, Exalted is He, said: "And when they meet you, they say, 'We believe,' but when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage. Say, 'Die in your rage. Indeed, God is Knowing of that within the breasts. If good touches you, it distresses them...'" [Qur'an 3:119-120]. And similarly He said: "They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate in the cause of God. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper" [4:89], and "Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater" [3:118]. Envy arising from hatred may lead to contention and fighting, and to consuming one's entire life in removing blessings through schemes, slander, exposing faults, and the like.

The second cause is self-importance; it is that one finds it burdensome for another to be elevated above him. Thus, if some of his peers attain authority, knowledge, or wealth, he fears that they will become arrogant toward him, and he cannot endure their arrogance, nor does his soul permit him to bear their haughtiness and boasting over him. His aim is not to become arrogant himself, but rather to repel their pride, for he was content with their equality, for example, but is not content with their elevation above him.

The third cause: Pride; which is when one's nature inclines to look down upon another, belittle him, and treat him as a servant, expecting from him compliance and following in his own aims. So when that other attains a blessing, he fears he will not endure his pride and will rise above following him, or perhaps he aspires to be his equal or to rise above him, thus returning proud after having been the object of pride. From pride and haughtiness arose the envy of most disbelievers towards the Messenger of God ﷺ, when they said: How can an orphan boy advance over us, and how can we bow our heads? So they said, "If only this Qur'an had been sent down to a great man from the two towns," meaning it would not have been burdensome for us to humble ourselves before him and follow him if he were great. And God Almighty described the saying of Quraysh: "Are these the ones upon whom God has bestowed favor from among us?" as belittling them and feeling aversion towards them.

The fourth cause: Amazement, as God Almighty informed about past nations when they said, "You are but human beings like us," and "They said, 'Shall we believe for two human beings like ourselves?'" and "If you obey a human being like yourselves, then indeed you would be losers." So they were amazed that a human being like them should attain the rank of Messengership, revelation, and closeness to God Almighty, and thus they envied them, and wished for Prophethood to be removed from them, resentful that one like them in creation should be favored over them—not from an intent of pride, seeking leadership, advancement, enmity, or any other cause from among the various causes. And they said in amazement, "Has God sent a human being as a messenger?" and they said, "If only angels had been sent down to us." And God Almighty said, "Or do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you?" the verse.

The fifth cause: Fear of missing objectives, which pertains specifically to those competing for a single aim. For one may envy his companion in every blessing that aids him in exclusively attaining his goal. Of this kind is the envy between co-wives in competing for marital aims, and the envy among siblings in competing to attain status in the hearts of their parents, so as to thereby reach goals of honor and wealth. Likewise, the envy between two students of a single teacher in attaining rank in the teacher’s heart, and the envy among the companions and close associates of a king in attaining status in his heart, so as to thereby reach wealth and prestige. Similarly, the envy between preachers competing for the people of a single town if their aim is to gain wealth through acceptance among them, and the envy between scholars competing for a limited group of students, as each seeks status in their hearts so as to use them to achieve his own purposes.

The sixth cause: love of leadership and pursuit of status for oneself without aiming for a true purpose. This is like a man who desires to be without equal in a certain field, when the love of praise overcomes him and he is stirred by joy at being commended as the unique figure of the age and the unparalleled master of his craft, such that he has no peer. For if he were to hear of a peer in the farthest corner of the world, it would distress him, and he would wish for that person’s death or the removal of the blessing—be it courage, knowledge, worship, skill, beauty, wealth, or anything else—that allows him to share that rank. He rejoices because of his singularity, and the reason for this is neither enmity, nor a sense of honor, nor rivalry with the envied one, nor fear of losing some intended aim, but sheer leadership claimed through exclusivity. This goes beyond what is found among individual scholars who seek status and position in people’s hearts in order to attain objectives other than leadership. Indeed, the scholars of the Jews used to deny knowledge of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and not believe in him, fearing that their leadership and following would be nullified whenever their knowledge was abrogated.

The seventh cause: the baseness of the soul and its stinginess with good toward the servants of God Most High. For you will find one who is not occupied with seeking leadership, arrogance, or wealth, yet when the good condition of a servant among the servants of God Most High—in what God has bestowed upon him—is described in his presence, it weighs heavily upon him; and when the turmoil of people’s affairs, their decline, the loss of their aims, and the bitterness of their lives are described to him, he rejoices in it. Thus, he constantly loves decline for others and is stingy with God’s blessings upon His servants, as if they were taking it from his own dominion and treasury. It is said: the miser is one who is stingy with his own wealth, and the covetous is one who is stingy with the wealth of others. This one is stingy with the blessings of God Most High upon His servants, between whom and himself there is neither enmity nor any tie. This has no apparent cause except a baseness in the soul and a vileness in the innate disposition upon which his nature has been formed. Its treatment is severe, for envy that is established due to various causes has incidental reasons whose removal can be conceived, so one may hope to eliminate it. But this is a baseness in the innate disposition, not due to an incidental cause, so its removal becomes difficult, as its removal is ordinarily impossible. These are the causes of envy, and some of these causes, or most of them, or all of them, may gather in a single person, so envy becomes great in him thereby and gains a strength with which he cannot conceal it or maintain courtesy; rather, he breaches the veil of courtesy and hostility becomes apparent through open confrontation. Most instances of envy involve a combination of these causes, and rarely is a single cause isolated from them.

Explanation of the Reason for the Prevalence of Envy

Separation occurs among peers, companions, brothers, cousins, and relatives, and it is most severe and least frequent among them, while it is weaker in others.

Know that envy increases among people where the causes we have mentioned abound, and it strengthens among those in whom a combination of these causes gathers and reinforces one another. For a single individual may envy because he may refrain from accepting arrogance, or because he is arrogant, or because he is an enemy, or due to other such reasons. These causes multiply among communities bound by ties that bring them together in gatherings of conversation and draw them to common aims. When one of them opposes his companion in a particular aim, his nature recoils from him, he hates him, and resentment becomes fixed in his heart. Thereupon, he desires to belittle him, act arrogantly toward him, and retaliate against him for opposing his aim. He dislikes that the other attains the blessing that leads him to his aims, and a cluster of these causes accumulates. Indeed, there is no bond between two persons in two distant towns, so there is no envy between them; likewise in two different neighborhoods. However, if they become neighbors in a dwelling, market, school, or mosque, they converge upon objectives wherein their aims conflict. From this contradiction arises mutual aversion and hatred, and from it spring the remaining causes of envy. Therefore, you see the scholar envies the scholar, not the ascetic; the ascetic envies the ascetic, not the scholar; the merchant envies the merchant; indeed, the cobbler envies the cobbler but does not envy the cloth merchant except for a reason other than sharing the same trade. A man envies his brother and cousin more than strangers, and a woman envies her co-wife and her husband’s concubine more than her husband’s mother or daughter. For the aim of the cloth merchant is not the aim of the cobbler, so they do not compete over objectives, since the cloth merchant’s aim is wealth, which he only attains through many customers, and only another cloth merchant contends with him for that; the customer of the cloth merchant is not sought by the cobbler, but by the cloth merchant. Then, the competition of the neighboring cloth merchant is greater than that of one far away at the market’s edge, so inevitably his envy for the neighbor is greater. Similarly, the brave envies the brave, not the scholar, because his aim is to be remembered for bravery, become famous for it, and be distinguished by this trait, and the scholar does not compete with him over this aim. Likewise, the scholar envies the scholar, not the brave. Then, the envy of the preacher for the preacher is greater than his envy for the jurist or the physician, because the competition between them over a single aim is more specific. The root of these envies is enmity, and the root of enmity is competition between them over a single aim. A single aim does not bring together those who are distant, but rather those who are similar; therefore, envy increases between them. Indeed, one whose greed for status intensifies and who loves fame in all corners of the world for what he possesses envies everyone in the world, even if distant, who shares in the trait he boasts of. The origin of all this is love of the world, for it is the world that constricts the competitors: as for the Hereafter, there is no constriction therein. The example of the Hereafter is the blessing of knowledge; thus, whoever is devoted to knowing God Almighty, His attributes, His angels, His prophets, and the dominion of His heavens and earth does not envy others if they also know that, because knowledge does not constrict the knowers. Rather, a single known matter can be known by a thousand thousand knowers, and they rejoice in knowing it and delight in it. The delight of one is not diminished because of another; rather, through the multitude of knowers comes increased companionship and the fruit of benefiting and bestowing benefit. Therefore, there is no envy among the scholars of religion, because their aim is knowledge of God Almighty, which is a vast sea with no constriction, and their goal is nearness to God—and there is also no constriction in what is with God Almighty, for the greatest of bliss with God, glorified be He, is the delight of meeting Him, and therein is no hindrance or competition. Nor do some observers constrict others; rather, companionship increases with their multitude. However, if scholars seek wealth and status through knowledge, they envy one another, because wealth consists of tangible objects and bodies; when it falls into one hand, it is empty from another’s hand. The meaning of status is mastery over hearts: whenever a person’s heart is filled with reverence for one scholar, it turns away from revering another or inevitably diminishes in that, becoming a cause for envy. But if a heart is filled with joy in knowing God Almighty, that does not prevent another heart from being filled with it and rejoicing in that. The difference between knowledge and wealth is that wealth cannot reside in one hand without departing from another, while knowledge resides in the scholar’s heart and settles in another’s heart through teaching without departing from his heart. Wealth consists of bodies and tangible objects with a limit; if a person owned all the wealth on earth, no wealth would remain for another to possess. Knowledge has no limit and cannot be fully comprehended. Whoever accustoms himself to reflect on the majesty of God, His greatness, and the dominion of His earth and heavens finds that more delightful than every bliss, and he is not deprived of it nor competed with in it. Thus, there is no envy in his heart for any creature, because if another knew like his knowledge, it would not diminish his delight but rather increase it through companionship. Therefore, the delight of these people in continually contemplating the wonders of the dominion is greater than the delight of one who looks at the trees and gardens of Paradise with the outward eye. For the bliss of the knower and his Paradise is his knowledge, which is an attribute of his essence; he is secure from its disappearance and perpetually gathers its fruits. With his spirit and heart, he feeds on the fruit of his knowledge, a fruit that is neither cut off nor withheld; rather, its clusters are within reach. Even if the outward eye is closed, his spirit perpetually roams in a lofty garden and blooming meadows. If there is a multitude of knowers, they are not envious of one another; rather, they are as the Lord of the Worlds said of them: “And We shall remove whatever rancor is in their breasts; as brothers, facing one another upon couches.” This is their state while still in the world, so what is imagined of them when the veil is lifted, witnessing the Beloved in the end? Therefore, it is inconceivable that there be envy in Paradise or that the people of the world in Paradise envy one another, because in Paradise there is no distress or competition. It is attained only by knowledge of God Almighty, in which there is no competition in this world either. Thus, the people of Paradise are necessarily free from envy in both this world and the Hereafter. Rather, envy is among the attributes of those banished from the expanse of the Highest to the constriction of the lowest. For this reason, the accursed Satan was branded with it, and it is mentioned among his attributes that he envied Adam, peace be upon him, for the election he was specially given, and when he was commanded to prostrate, he grew arrogant, refused, rebelled, and disobeyed. So you have learned that envy exists only due to convergence upon an aim that is too narrow to fulfill all. Hence, you do not see people envying one another over looking at the adornment of the heavens, but they envy over seeing gardens that are a small part of the whole earth—and all the earth has no weight compared to the heavens. But the heavens, due to the vastness of their expanse, suffice for all eyes, so there is no competition or envy therein at all. Therefore, if you are insightful and compassionate toward yourself, seek a blessing without crowding and a delight without impurity. That is not found in this world except in knowledge of God, glorified and exalted, knowledge of His attributes, His actions, and the wonders of the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And that is not attained in the Hereafter except through this knowledge as well. If you do not yearn for knowledge of God Almighty and do not find its delight, and your opinion slackens concerning it and your desire weakens, then you are excused in that; for the impotent does not yearn for the pleasure of intercourse, and the child does not yearn for the pleasure of kingship. These are pleasures specific to men, not children or the effeminate. Likewise, the delight of knowledge is specific to men—“men whom neither trade nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God”—and none but them yearn for this delight, because yearning comes after tasting. Whoever has not tasted does not know; whoever does not know does not yearn; whoever does not yearn does not seek; whoever does not seek does not attain; and whoever does not attain remains with the deprived in the lowest of the low. “And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful, We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.”

Explanation of the Remedy that Removes the Disease of Envy from the Heart

Know that envy is among the grave diseases of the hearts, and the diseases of the hearts are not cured except by knowledge and action. The beneficial knowledge for the disease of envy is that you know with certainty that envy is harmful to you in this world and in religion, and that it causes no harm to the envied one in this world or in religion; rather, he benefits from it in both. Whenever you know this with insight and do not become an enemy to yourself and a friend to your enemy, you will inevitably part from envy. As for it being harmful to you in religion, it is because through envy you have shown displeasure with the decree of God Almighty, disliked His favor which He has apportioned among His servants, and His justice which He has established in His dominion by His hidden wisdom, so you have deemed it strange and repugnant. This is an offense against the essence of divine oneness and a mote in the eye of faith—and let that suffice as an offense against religion. Added to this is that you have deceived a man among the believers and abandoned sincere counsel for him, and you have departed from the allies of God and His prophets in their love for good for His servants, and you have joined Iblis and the disbelievers in their love for calamities to befall the believers and for blessings to be removed. These are foul traits in the heart that consume the good deeds of the heart as fire consumes firewood, and erase them as night erases day.

As for it being harmful to you in this worldly life, it is that you suffer pain through your envy in this world or are tormented by it. You remain in constant distress and sorrow since your enemies are never deprived by God Almighty of blessings He bestows upon them. Thus, you are continually tormented by every blessing you see them receive and pained by every affliction that turns away from them, leaving you sorrowful, deprived, with a divided heart and constricted chest. What has befallen you is what enemies desire for you and what you desire for your enemies. You wished misfortune upon your foe, and your own misfortune and grief are immediately delivered to you in full. Yet despite this, the blessing does not depart from the envied due to your envy. Even if you did not believe in resurrection and reckoning, the dictate of wisdom—if you are rational—would be to avoid envy because of the heart’s pain and distress it brings without any benefit. How much more so when you are aware of the severe punishment envy carries in the hereafter? How astonishing it is that a rational person would expose himself to the displeasure of God Almighty without gaining any benefit, but rather while bearing harm and enduring pain, thereby ruining his religion and his worldly life to no avail or profit?

As for there being no harm to the envied in his religion or worldly life, this is clear because the blessing does not depart from him due to your envy. Rather, whatever God Almighty has decreed of favor and blessing must inevitably last until an appointed term unknown except to God, glorified be He. There is no means to repel it; indeed, everything with Him is by measure, and for every term there is a decree. For this reason, a prophet among the prophets complained about a tyrannical woman who dominated the people, and God revealed to him: “Flee from before her until her days are concluded”—meaning, what We decreed in eternity cannot be altered, so be patient until the period ordained for the continuance of her dominance expires. Since blessing is not removed by envy, there is no harm upon the envied in this world, nor will there be sin upon him in the hereafter.

Perhaps you say, “If only the blessing would depart from the envied due to my envy.” This is the height of ignorance, for it is a calamity you first desire for yourself—since you too are not free from an enemy who envies you. If blessing were removed by envy, no blessing from God Almighty would remain upon you or upon any of creation, nor even the blessing of faith, because the disbelievers envy the believers for their faith. God Almighty says, “Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves.” What the envier desires does not come to pass. Indeed, he leads astray by his desire for misguidance for others; if he desires disbelief, he disbelieves. Thus, whoever wishes for blessing to be removed from the envied through envy is as if he desires that the blessing of faith be stripped away by the envy of disbelievers, and likewise all other blessings. And if you desire that blessings be removed from others through your envy but not removed from you through the envy of others, this is the peak of ignorance and foolishness, for every one of the foolish envious also desires to be uniquely granted this trait, and you have no greater right to it than anyone else. God Almighty’s blessing upon you in that blessing is not removed by envy is something for which you owe gratitude, yet in your ignorance you resent it.

As for the benefit that the envied person gains in religion and worldly life, it is evident. Regarding his benefit in religion: it is that he is wronged by you, especially when envy drives you to speech and action through backbiting, fault-finding, exposing his privacy, and mentioning his faults. These are gifts you present to him; meaning, by that you transfer your good deeds to him until you meet him on the Day of Resurrection bankrupt, deprived of bliss as you deprived him of bliss in this world. Thus, it is as if you desired the removal of blessing from him, yet it did not cease. Indeed, it was a blessing upon him that you were guided to good deeds and transferred them to him, so you added blessing upon blessing for him, and added misery upon misery for yourself.

As for its harm in this worldly life, it is that the primary aims of the envious are to cause distress, grief, and misery to their enemies, and to see them tormented and anguished. Yet there is no torment more severe than the pain of envy that you yourself endure. The utmost desire of your enemies is that they be in a state of blessing while you are in grief and regret on their account—and you have inflicted upon yourself what they desire. For this reason, your enemy does not wish for your death, but rather wishes that your life be prolonged, yet in the torment of envy, so that you may look upon the favor God has bestowed upon him and your heart be torn apart with envy. Thus it has been said:

Let not your enemies die until they witness in you  
That which grieves the heart—nay, let them live long.  
May you remain envied, for the one who is complete in virtue  
Is only he who is envied on account of a blessing.

Your enemy rejoices in your distress and your envy is greater to him than his own blessings. If he knew of your deliverance from the pain and torment of envy, that would be the greatest calamity and affliction in his sight. In the grief of envy you persistently cling to, you are nothing but what your enemy desires. When you reflect upon this, you realize that you are an enemy to your own soul and a friend to your enemy, for you undertake what harms you in this world and the next, while your enemy benefits from it in both realms. You become blameworthy before the Creator and creation, wretched in your present state and final end, while the blessings of the one you envy remain enduring and everlasting, whether you will it or not. Nor do you stop at merely fulfilling your enemy’s desire—you go so far as to bring the greatest joy to Iblis, who is the fiercest of your enemies. For when he sees you deprived of the blessings of knowledge, piety, status, and wealth that your enemy enjoys exclusively, he fears that you might love those blessings for your enemy and thus share in the reward due to that love. For whoever loves good for the Muslims becomes a partner in that good, and even if one cannot attain the rank of the great in this world, the reward of loving them is not lost as long as that love is sincere. Thus Iblis fears that you might love what God has bestowed upon His servant in terms of righteousness in religion and worldly affairs, and thereby attain the reward of that love. So he makes you resent it, so that you do not reach him through your love, just as you have not reached him through your deeds.

A Bedouin once said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), "O Messenger of God, what about a man who loves a people but has not yet joined them?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied, "A person is with those he loves." And a Bedouin stood up before the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) while he was delivering a sermon and said, "O Messenger of God, when is the Hour?" He responded, "What have you prepared for it?" The man said, "I have not prepared much in terms of prayer or fasting, except that I love God and His Messenger." He (peace be upon him) said, "You are with those you love." Anas said, "The Muslims never rejoiced after embracing Islam as they did that day," indicating that their greatest aspiration was the love of God and His Messenger. Anas said, "So we love the Messenger of God, Abu Bakr, and Umar, though we do not perform deeds like theirs, and we hope to be with them." And Abu Musa said, "I asked, 'O Messenger of God, what about a man who loves those who pray but does not pray himself, and loves those who fast but does not fast,' enumerating several things. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'He is with those he loves.'" And a man said to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, "It has been said: If you can be a scholar, then be one; if you cannot be a scholar, then be a student of knowledge; if you cannot be a student, then love them; and if you cannot do that, then do not hate them." He replied, "Glory be to God! Indeed, God has provided us with a way out."

Now observe how Satan envied you, causing you to forfeit the reward of love, and was not content with that until he made you detest your brother and led you into hatred until you sinned. And how could it be otherwise, when you might envy a man of knowledge, desiring that he err in the religion of God Almighty and that his error be exposed to disgrace him? You wish his tongue to be silenced so he cannot speak, or that he fall ill so he cannot teach or learn—what sin could be greater than this? Would that when you failed to match him and then grieved because of him, you had at least remained safe from sin and the punishment of the Hereafter. For it is related in the Hadith: "The people of Paradise are three: the doer of good, the one who loves him, and the one who restrains from harming him"—meaning one who refrains from injury, envy, hatred, and malice. See how Satan has distanced you from all three gateways, so that you are not among the people of any of them at all. Indeed, Satan’s envy has penetrated you, while your envy has not penetrated your enemy, but rather yourself. If your state were unveiled to you in wakefulness or sleep, you would see yourself, O envier, as one who shoots an arrow only to have it return to strike his own eye, missing its target but instead returning to his right eyeball and plucking it out. Then his anger increases, and he shoots again more fiercely than before, and it returns to his other eye, blinding him. His rage grows further, and he turns upon his own head, wounding it—while his enemy remains safe in every state, and the arrow returns to him again and again, with his enemies around him rejoicing and laughing at him. Such is the condition of the envier and the mockery of Satan at his expense. Nay, your state in envy is uglier than this, for the returning arrow only destroys the eyes, and even if they remained, they would inevitably be lost through death. But envy brings sin, and sin is not lost through death; indeed, it may lead to the wrath of God and to the Fire. For him, to lose an eye in this world is better than to keep an eye with which he enters the Fire, only for the blaze of Hell to pluck it out. Consider how God takes vengeance on the envier: when he wishes for the removal of a blessing from the envied, it is not removed from him, but instead it is removed from the envier—for safety from sin is a blessing, and safety from grief and sorrow is a blessing, both of which have been taken from him, confirming the truth of God’s word: "But the evil plot encompasses only its own perpetrators." And perhaps he is afflicted with the very thing he desired for his enemy. Rarely does a gloating one rejoice at another’s misfortune without being afflicted by the like, so much so that ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "I never wished anything for ‘Uthmān except that it befell me, to the point that if I had wished him killed, I would have been killed." This is the sin of envy itself—so what then of the consequences it drags along: discord, denial of truth, unleashing the tongue and hand in vile acts to seek revenge on enemies? It is the disease by which past nations perished.

These are the intellectual remedies; whenever a person reflects upon them with a clear mind and a present heart, the fire of envy is extinguished from his heart, and he knows that he is destroying himself, delighting his enemy, angering his Lord, and embittering his own life.

As for the beneficial action concerning it, it is to subdue envy. Thus, whatever envy demands in terms of speech or action, one should compel oneself to do its opposite. If envy drives him to disparage the one he envies, he should compel his tongue to praise him and commend him. If it drives him to be arrogant toward him, he should oblige himself to show humility to him and apologize to him. If it incites him to withhold favor from him, he should oblige himself to increase the favor toward him. Whenever he does this through conscious effort and the envied one becomes aware of it, his heart becomes pure and loves him. And whenever his love becomes apparent, the envier in turn loves him. From this arises mutual harmony, which severs the root cause of envy. For humility, praise, commendation, and showing joy at another's blessing attract the heart of the one upon whom the favor is bestowed, soften it, win it over, and lead him to reciprocate with kindness. Then that kindness returns to the first, so his heart becomes pure, and what he initially compelled himself to do becomes a second nature. Let not the words of Satan deter him from this, saying: "If you show humility and praise him, the enemy will attribute it to you as weakness, hypocrisy, or fear, and that it is humiliation and degradation." That is from the deception and schemes of Satan. Rather, courtesy—whether compelled or natural—breaks the intensity of hostility from both sides, diminishes its appeal, and accustoms the heart to affection and mutual love. Through this, hearts find rest from the pain of envy and the grief of mutual hatred.

These are the remedies for envy, and they are exceedingly beneficial, yet they are intensely bitter to the hearts. However, the benefit lies in the bitter medicine. Whoever cannot endure the bitterness of the remedy will not taste the sweetness of healing. The bitterness of this remedy—namely, humility toward enemies and drawing near to them through praise and commendation—is only made bearable by the strength of understanding the meanings we have mentioned, the strength of desire for the reward of contentment with the decree of God Almighty, and the love for what He loves. The soul's pride and its haughtiness, in that it considers anything in the world contrary to its desire to be ignorance, leads it to desire what cannot be. For there is no hope in attaining what it desires, and the loss of that desire is humiliation and baseness. There is no path to salvation from this humiliation except through one of two matters: either that what you desire comes to be, or that you desire what comes to be. The first is not within your power, and there is no room for striving or exertion in it. As for the second, there is room for exertion in it, and its attainment through spiritual discipline is possible. It is incumbent upon every rational person to attain it. This is the comprehensive remedy.

As for the detailed remedy: it is to pursue the causes of envy, such as arrogance and the like, self-importance, and intense craving for what is of no avail—the detailed treatment of these causes will follow in their proper places, God Almighty willing—for they are the sources of this ailment, and the ailment is not suppressed except by suppressing its source. If the source is not suppressed, what we have mentioned achieves only temporary calming and quenching, and it will return again and again, with great effort expended in calming it while its sources remain. For as long as one loves status, he will inevitably envy whoever monopolizes status and rank in people’s hearts above him, and this will unavoidably grieve him. At best, he can only lessen the grief within himself and not manifest it with his tongue or hand; but to be entirely free from it is impossible for him. And God grants success.

Explanation of the Obligatory Measure in Eradicating Envy from the Heart

Know that the one who causes harm is naturally detested, and if someone harms you, you generally cannot help but dislike them. Thus, when a blessing befalls them, you typically cannot avoid resenting it for them, to the point where the good fortune of your enemy and their misfortune become equal in your sight. Rather, you continually perceive a distinction in your soul between the two, and Satan persistently contends with you toward envy for them. However, if this feeling grows strong within you to the extent that it compels you to manifest envy through word or deed—such that it becomes apparent from your outward behavior through your voluntary actions—then you are an envious sinner due to your envy. Even if you completely restrain your outward self, yet in your heart you desire the removal of the blessing and feel no aversion to this state, you are also an envious sinner, for envy is an attribute of the heart, not of action. God Almighty says, "And they find in their breasts no need for what they have been given," and He, exalted is He, says, "They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would be alike," and He says, "If good befalls you, it distresses them." As for action, it is backbiting and falsehood—deeds arising from envy, but they are not envy itself; rather, the seat of envy is the heart, not the limbs. Indeed, this envy is not an injustice requiring seeking pardon from the one envied, but it is a sin between you and God Almighty. Seeking pardon is only obligatory for apparent causes affecting the limbs. However, if you restrain your outward self and simultaneously compel your heart to detest what naturally emanates from it—the desire for the removal of the blessing—so much so that you despise yourself for what is in your nature, then that aversion, arising from reason in opposition to the inclination of nature, constitutes fulfilling your duty. In most circumstances, you cannot choose more than this. As for changing one's nature so that the one who harms and the one who benefits become equal to you, and your joy or grief over what blessings or calamities befall them is the same—this is something nature does not comply with as long as one is attentive to worldly gains, unless one becomes utterly absorbed in God Almighty, like an intoxicated lover. Then his state may reach a point where his heart pays no heed to the detailed conditions of creation, but views all with a single eye—the eye of mercy—and sees all as God's servants and their actions as God's actions, considering them subjugated. If this occurs, it is like a fleeting flash of lightning that does not last; then the heart returns afterward to its nature, and the enemy—meaning Satan—returns to his contention, for he contends through whisperings. Whenever one confronts this with aversion and imposes this state upon his heart, he has fulfilled what is required of him. Some have held that one is not sinful if envy is not manifested through his limbs, based on what is reported from Al-Hasan: when asked about envy, he said, "It grieves you, but it does not harm you as long as you do not reveal it." It is also reported from him, both as his own saying and attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), that he said, "Three traits are not absent from a believer, but there is an exit for him." His exit from envy is not to act wrongfully. It is preferable to interpret this as we mentioned: that there be in him an aversion from the perspective of religion and reason in opposition to the natural love for the removal of the enemy's blessing, and that aversion prevents him from wrongdoing and harm. For all the narrations that have come condemning envy indicate outwardly that every envious person is sinful, yet envy is an expression of a heart attribute, not of actions. Thus, anyone who desires harm for a Muslim is envious. Therefore, whether one is sinful merely due to envy in the heart without action is a matter of scholarly interpretation. The more apparent view is what we have mentioned, based on the apparent meanings of the verses and narrations and on reason, for it is unlikely that a servant is excused for intending harm to a Muslim and harboring that in his heart without any aversion.

And you have come to know from this that regarding your enemies, you have three states. The first is that you naturally desire their harm, yet your intellect detests this inclination of your heart toward it, and you despise your own soul for it, wishing you had some means to remove that inclination from yourself. This is undoubtedly forgiven, for it falls no more within the realm of voluntary choice than it does.

The second type is to love that and show joy at his misfortune, whether by your tongue or your limbs. This is the forbidden envy, without doubt.

The third type lies between the two extremes: to envy in the heart without despising yourself for your envy, and without rebuking your heart for it, yet restraining your limbs from obeying the envy in its demands. This is a matter of scholarly disagreement. The apparent ruling is that it is not free from sin, to the degree of the strength or weakness of that love. And God knows best. All praise is to God, Lord of the worlds, and sufficient is God for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.



Exposition on the Censure of Anger

A man said, "O Messenger of God, command me with a deed and make it brief." He said, "Do not become angry." Then the man repeated his request, and he again said, "Do not become angry." (Narrated by al-Bukhari)

I said to the Messenger of God, "Tell me a word and make it brief." The hadith is similar; Abu Ya'la narrated it with a good chain.

A man asked the Messenger of God, "What will distance me from the wrath of God?" He said, "Do not become angry." (Narrated by al-Tabarani in *Makārim al-Akhlāq* and Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in *al-Tamhīd* with a good chain. It is also in Ahmad, and 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr was the questioner.)

The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whom do you consider the strong wrestler?" (Narrated by Muslim)

The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The strong one is not the wrestler..." (Agreed upon)

The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever restrains his anger, God will conceal his faults." (Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *Kitāb al-'Afw* and in *al-Samt*; it was previously mentioned in the section on the harms of the tongue.)

The hadith of Abu al-Darda': "Guide me to a deed that will admit me to Paradise." He said, "Do not become angry." (Narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya and al-Tabarani in *al-Kabīr* and *al-Awsat* with a good chain.)

The hadith: "Anger corrupts faith just as vinegar corrupts honey." (Narrated by al-Tabarani in *al-Kabīr* and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the narration of Bahz ibn Hakim from his father from his grandfather with a weak chain.)

The hadith: "No one becomes angry except that he draws near to Hellfire." (Narrated by al-Bazzar and Ibn 'Adi from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "For the Fire is a gate which none enters except one who satisfies his rage by disobeying God." Its chain is weak, and it was previously mentioned in the section on the harms of the tongue.)

A man said, "What is the most severe thing upon me?" He said, "The wrath of God." He said, "What will distance me from the wrath of God?" He said, "Do not become angry." (Narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with the latter part of it. Six hadiths have preceded it.)

(Explanation of the Reality of Anger)

The anger is a coal in the heart of the son of Adam. And in the narration of Abu Dawud from 'Atiyyah al-Sa'di: Verily, anger is from Satan, and Satan was created from fire.

[12] The hadith "Indeed, Sa'd is jealous" was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah, and it is agreed upon from the narration of Al-Mughirah in a similar manner, and it has been previously mentioned in the Book of Marriage.

[13] The hadith "The best of my nation are those with the most intense anger" was narrated by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat and Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of 'Ali with a weak chain, and he added: "Those who, when they become angry, return [to reason]."

[14] The hadith "The best of matters are the middlemost" was narrated by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab as a mursal narration, and it has been previously mentioned.
(Clarification on whether the root of anger can be removed through spiritual discipline or not)

[15] Hadith: Whoever wakes up secure in his home, healthy in his body, and possessing his sustenance for the day, it is as if the entire world with all its contents has been gathered for him. Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the narration of 'Ubayd Allah ibn Muhsin, without the phrase "with all its contents." Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan*.

[16] Hadith: He (peace be upon him) would become angry until his cheeks reddened. Reported by Muslim from the narration of Jabir: "When he delivered a sermon, his eyes would redden, his voice would rise, and his anger would intensify." And al-Hakim reported: "When the Hour was mentioned, his cheeks would redden and his anger would intensify." This has preceded in the chapter on the Character Traits of Prophethood.

[17] Hadith: O Allah, I am but a human; I become angry as humans become angry. Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, without the phrase "I become angry as humans become angry," and with "I lashed him" instead of "I struck him." In another narration: "O Allah, Muhammad is but a human; he becomes angry as humans become angry." Its origin is agreed upon and it has preceded. And Muslim reported from the narration of Anas: "I am but a human; I become pleased as humans become pleased, and I become angry as humans become angry." And Abu Ya'la reported from the narration of Abu Sa'id: "...or I struck him."

[18] Hadith: 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr said: "O Messenger of Allah, shall I write down everything you say, in anger and in contentment?" He said: "Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, nothing issues from this except truth," and he pointed to his tongue. Reported by Abu Dawud in a similar manner.

[19] Hadith: 'A'ishah became angry, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "What is the matter with you? Has your devil come to you?" Reported by Muslim from the narration of 'A'ishah.

[20] Hadith: 'Ali would not become angry for worldly matters. Reported by al-Tirmidhi in *al-Shama'il* and it has preceded.
(Explanation of the Inciting Causes of Anger)

The strong one is not he who overthrows others; rather, the strong one is he who controls himself when angered.  
(Explanation of treating anger after its arousal)

[22] Hadith: "Were it not for retaliation, I would have caused you pain." Reported by Abu Ya'la from the narration of Umm Salamah with a weak chain.

[23] Hadith: The command to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan at the time of anger is agreed upon (muttafaqun 'alayh). From the narration of Sulayman ibn Surad who said: I was sitting with the Prophet (peace be upon him) while two men were insulting each other, and one of them had his face reddened and his veins swollen... In it (the hadith): "If he had said, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan,' what he felt would have left him." So they said to him, "The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'Seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan.'"

[24] Hadith: "When 'A'ishah became angry, he (the Prophet) would take her by the nose and say, 'O 'Uwaysh, say: O Allah, Lord of Prophet Muhammad, forgive me my sin, remove the anger from my heart, and save me from the misguiding trials.'" Reported by Ibn al-Sunni in "Al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" from her narration, and it has preceded in the chapter of Remembrances and Supplications.

[25] Hadith: "Verily, anger is an ember kindled in the heart..." Reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Sa'id without the phrase "kindled in," and it has preceded. Al-Bayhaqi reported it with this wording in "Al-Shu'ab."

[26] Hadith: "When one of you becomes angry, let him perform ablution with cold water." Reported by Abu Dawud from the narration of 'Atiyyah al-Sa'di without the phrase "with cold water," and it is with the wording of the second narration mentioned by the author, and it has preceded.

[27] Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "When you become angry, be silent." Reported by Ahmad, Ibn Abi al-Dunya, al-Tabarani (and the wording is theirs), and al-Bayhaqi in "Shu'ab al-Iman." In its chain is Layth ibn Abi Sulaym.

[28] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When he (the Prophet) became angry while standing, he would sit down, and when he became angry while sitting, he would lie down, and his anger would depart." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya, and in its chain is an unnamed narrator. Ahmad reported it with a sound chain in the course of a hadith in which Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat, then he lay down. It was said to him, "Why did you sit then lie down?" He said, "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to us, 'When one of you becomes angry while standing, let him sit down. If his anger departs (well and good); otherwise, let him lie down.'"

Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "Al-'Afw wa Dham al-Ghadab" with a sound chain. And in the two Sahihs from his narration: "There was an exchange of words between me and a man from my brothers. His mother was a non-Arab, and I insulted him regarding his mother. So he complained about me to the Prophet (peace be upon him). He said, 'O Abu Dharr, you are a man in whom there is ignorance (jahiliyyah).'" Ahmad reported that he (peace be upon him) said to him, "Look, for you are not better than a red (person) nor a black (person) except by surpassing him in piety." And its narrators are trustworthy.

[32] The hadith: "The strongest among you is the one who masters himself when angry, and the most forbearing among you is the one who pardons when he has the power." Reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya from the narration of 'Ali via a weak chain, and by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab with the first part from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Ajlan as a mursal report with a sound chain. Also reported by al-Bazar and al-Tabarani in Makarim al-Akhlaq with the wording: "The strongest among you is the one who has the most control over himself when angry," and in its chain is 'Imran al-Qattan, who is disputed.

Ibn Abi al-Dunya also reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, in whose chain is an unnamed narrator.

[34] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "No man has swallowed a draught greater in reward than a draught of anger which he swallowed seeking the Face of God." Reported by Ibn Majah.

[45] The hadith: A man from among the Muslims said, "O Allah, I have no charity to give in charity. So, whatever man receives something from my honor, it is charity for him." This was reported by Abu Nu'aym in al-Sahabah and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of 'Abd al-Majid ibn Abi 'Abs ibn Jabr from his father from his grandfather with a lenient chain. Al-Bayhaqi added from 'Ulayyah ibn Zayd, and 'Ulayyah is the one who said that, as mentioned within the hadith. Ibn 'Abd al-Barr mentioned in al-Isti'ab that Ibn 'Uyaynah narrated it from 'Amr ibn Dinar from Abu Salih from Abu Hurayrah that a man from among the Muslims—and he did not name him—and said, "I think he was Abu Damdam." I say: He is not Abu Damdam; rather, he is 'Ulayyah ibn Zayd. And Abu Damdam did not have companionship (with the Prophet); rather, he is from an earlier time.

[50] The hadith: "O Ashajj, indeed in you are two characteristics that Allah loves: forbearance and deliberateness." This is agreed upon.

[52] The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "Three: Whoever does not have one of them in him, then do not consider any of his deeds." This was reported by Abu Nu'aym in the book al-Ijaz with a weak chain and by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Umm Salamah with a lenient chain, and it has preceded in the chapter on the etiquettes of companionship.

[53] The hadith: "When the creatures are gathered, a caller will call out, 'Where are the people of excellence?' Then a group of people will stand..." And in it: "When they acted ignorantly towards us, we forbore." This was reported by al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather.

[69] The hadith: "Indeed, the wronged ones are the successful on the Day of Resurrection." At its beginning is a story narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in the book *al-'Afw* from the narration of Abu Salih al-Hanafi, as a *mursal* report.

[70] The hadith of Anas: "When Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, resurrects the creation on the Day of Resurrection, a caller from beneath the Throne will call out three times: 'O assembly of monotheists! Allah has forgiven you, so forgive one another.'" Abu Sa'id Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Maqri narrated it in the book *al-Tabsirah wa al-Tadhkirah* with the wording: "A caller from the depths of the Throne will call out on the Day of Resurrection: 'O community of Muhammad! Allah the Exalted says: What was due to Me from you, I have granted to you. What remains are the claims against one another, so forgive them and enter Paradise by My mercy.'" Its chain is weak. Al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Awsat* with the wording: "A caller called out: 'O people of the gathering! Renounce the wrongs between you, and your reward is upon Me.'" And he has from the hadith of Umm Hani': "A caller will call out: 'O people of monotheism! Let some of you forgive others, and the reward is upon Me.'"

[71] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, conquered Makkah, he performed the circumambulation of the House, prayed two rak'ahs, then came to the Ka'bah and took hold of the two doorposts and said, 'What do you say...?'" Ibn al-Jawzi narrated it in *al-Wafa'* from the path of Ibn Abi al-Dunya, and there is weakness in it.

Al-Tabarani narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq*, and in it is al-Fadl ibn Yasar, and his hadith is not corroborated.

[74] The hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "It is not fitting for a person in authority to have a prescribed punishment brought before him except that he carries it out, and Allah is Forgiving, He loves forgiveness."

[82] Hadith: Any ruler who is appointed over people and is gentle, Allah will be gentle with him on the Day of Resurrection. Muslim narrated it from the narration of Aisha. And in a narration: Whoever is appointed over any affair of my community and is gentle with them, be gentle with him.
