The Book of Arranging Devotional Practices and Detailing the Revivification of the Night
           This is the Tenth Book [of the Quarter of Worship] from The Revivification of the Religious Sciences
                 And with it concludes the Quarter of Worship—may God benefit the Muslims thereby.
                           In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

We praise God for His bounties with abundant praise, and we remember Him with a remembrance that leaves no arrogance
or aversion in the heart. And we thank Him for making the night and the day in succession for whoever wishes to remember or desires to be thankful.
And we send blessings upon His Prophet, whom He sent with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and upon his pure family and his
most noble Companions, who strove in the worship of God morning and evening, early and late, until each
one of them became a guiding star in the religion and an illuminating lamp.
   Now then: Verily, God Almighty made the earth subservient for His servants not merely that they may settle upon its expanses,
but that they may take it as an abode, and from it provision themselves with provisions that will carry them on their journey to their homelands, and that they may treasure up
from it gifts for their souls in deed and virtue, guarding against its snares and perils. And they realize that life
carries them along as a ship carries its passenger. Thus, people in this world are travelers, and their first station is the cradle
and their last is the grave. The homeland is either Paradise or the Fire. Life is the distance of the journey; its years are its stages,
its months its leagues, its days its miles, its breaths its steps. Obedience is its merchandise, and its moments are its capital.
Its passions and worldly aims are the highwaymen of its path. Its profit is success in attaining the meeting with God Almighty in the Abode
of Peace, with the Great Sovereign and everlasting bliss. Its loss is remoteness from God Almighty, with shackles
and chains and painful torment in the depths of Hell. Therefore, the heedless one, in any single breath of his that passes
in other than an obedience that draws him nearer to God, is exposing himself on the Day of Mutual Loss to a regret and anguish that has
no end. It is due to this immense peril and tremendous affair that the successful ones have rolled up their sleeves for earnest striving and have bid farewell
completely to the comforts of the self. They have seized the remnants of life and have arranged, according to the recurrence of times, the duties
of devotional practices, out of zeal to revive the night and day in seeking nearness to the Compelling Sovereign and striving
toward the Abode of Permanence. Thus, among the crucial matters of the science of the path to the Hereafter is detailing the discourse on the manner of dividing
the devotional practices and distributing the acts of worship—which have been previously explained—according to the measures of the times. This crucial matter is clarified
by mentioning two chapters: Chapter One: On the virtue of devotional practices and their arrangement in the night and day. Chapter Two: On the manner of reviving the night, its virtue, and what pertains to it.
              (Chapter One: On the virtue of devotional practices, their arrangement, and their rulings)
      (The virtue of devotional practices and the clarification that perseverance in them is the path to God Almighty)
   Know that those who see by the light of insight have realized that there is no salvation except in meeting God Almighty,
and that there is no way to the meeting except that the servant die loving God Almighty and knowing God
—glorified be He—and that love and intimacy are not attained except through the permanence of remembering the Beloved and perseverance in it, and that
knowledge of Him is not attained except through permanence of reflection upon Him and His attributes and His acts. There is nothing in existence save
God Almighty and His acts. And continuous remembrance and reflection will not be facilitated except by bidding farewell to the world and its passions,
and being content with it only to the extent of sufficiency and necessity. All of that is not perfected except by immersing the times of night
and day in the duties of remembrances and reflections. The soul, due to what it is created upon of weariness and boredom, does not
have patience for a single mode of the means that assist in remembrance and reflection. Rather, if it is returned to one single pattern,
it displays boredom and heaviness. And God does not tire until you tire. Thus, from the necessity of being gentle with it, it is refreshed by shifting from one mode to another and from one type to another according to each time, so that its pleasure may increase
through the transition, its desire may become great through the pleasure, and its perseverance may endure through the endurance of its desire. For this reason, the devotional practices
are divided into a varied division. Remembrance and reflection should encompass all times or most of them.
For the soul, by its nature, inclines toward the comforts of the world. If a servant devotes half of his times to the arrangements
of the world and its permissible pleasures, for example, and the other half to acts of worship, the side of inclination toward
the world is weighted, due to its conformity with nature, since the time would be equal. How then can they be balanced when nature gives weight to one of them?
For the outward and inward assist each other in worldly matters, and the heart becomes pure and single-minded in seeking them.
But returning to acts of worship is a strain, and the sincerity of the heart and its presence therein is not secure except
in some times. Thus, whoever wishes to enter Paradise without reckoning, let him immerse his times in obedience.
And whoever wishes for the scale of his good deeds to be weighted and the balances of his goodness to be heavy, let him encompass in obedience most

If his times are such that he mixes a righteous deed with another sinful one, then his affair is precarious, yet hope is not severed, and pardon from the generosity of Allah is awaited. Perhaps Allah the Exalted will forgive him through His bounty and generosity. This is what is unveiled to the observers by the light of insight. If you are not among its people, then look to the address of Allah the Exalted to His Messenger and take it by the light of faith. For Allah the Exalted said to the closest of His servants to Him and the highest in degree with Him: "Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation. And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with complete devotion." And He the Exalted said: "And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening. And during the night prostrate to Him and exalt Him a long night." And He the Exalted said: "And exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and during periods of the night exalt Him and at the ends of the day." And He the Majestic said: "And exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord when you arise. And during the night exalt Him and after the [setting of] the stars." And He the Exalted said: "Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue] and more suitable for words." And He the Exalted said: "And exalt [Allah] during parts of the night and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied." And He the Almighty said: "And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds." Then observe how He described the successful among His servants and with what He described them. He the Exalted said: "Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, 'Are those who know equal to those who do not know?'" And He the Exalted said: "They arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration." And He the Almighty said: "And those who spend [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating and standing [in prayer]." And He the Almighty said: "They used to sleep but little of the night, and in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness." And He the Almighty said: "So exalt Allah when you reach evening and when you reach morning." And He the Exalted said: "And do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His countenance." All of this clarifies for you that the path to the Exalted is the vigilant observance of times and populating them with regular litanies on the basis of continuity. Therefore, He (peace be upon him) said: "The servants of Allah most beloved to Allah are those who observe the sun, the moon, and the shadows for the remembrance of Allah the Exalted." And He the Exalted said: "The sun and the moon [move] by precise calculation." And He the Exalted said: "Have you not considered your Lord – how He extends the shadow, and if He willed, He could have made it stationary? Then We made the sun an indication of it. Then We hold it in hand, an easy grip." And He the Exalted said: "And the moon – We have determined for it phases." And He the Exalted said: "And it is He who placed for you the stars that you may be guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea." So do not think that the purpose of the sun and moon moving by precise calculation, in an ordered, organized system, and of the creation of shadow and light and stars, is to be aided by them in worldly matters. Rather, it is so that you may know by them the measures of the times and thus occupy yourselves therein with acts of obedience and trade for the Abode of the Hereafter. What indicates this to you is His saying, the Exalted: "And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude." That is, one succeeds the other so that what was missed in one may be made up in the other. And He clarified that this is for remembrance and gratitude, nothing else. And He the Exalted said: "And We have made the night and the day two signs, and We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your Lord and may know the number of years and account [of time]." And the bounty sought is reward and forgiveness. And we ask Allah for good success in what pleases Him.

(Explanation of the Numbers of Litanies and Their Order)

Know that the litanies of the day are seven: one between the dawn's emergence and the sun's disc rising; two between sunrise and noon; two between noon and the afternoon time; and two between afternoon and sunset. The night divides into four litanies: two from sunset until people's sleep time, and two from the latter half of the night until dawn's emergence. So let us mention the virtue of each litany, its duty, and what pertains to it.

The first litany: between the dawn's emergence and sunrise. It is a noble time, and its nobility and virtue are indicated by Allah the Exalted swearing by it when He said: "And by the dawn when it breathes," and praising it when He said: "He who breaks the daybreak," and He the Exalted said: "Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak.'" And His manifestation of power in contracting the shadow therein, as He the Exalted said: "Then We hold it in hand, an easy grip." It is the time of contracting the night's shadow by spreading the sun's light. And He guides people to glorification therein by His saying, the Exalted: "So exalt Allah when you reach evening and when you reach morning," and by His saying, the Exalted: "And exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting," and His saying, the Almighty: "And exalt [Allah] during parts of the night and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied," and His saying, the Exalted: "And remember the name of your Lord morning and evening." As for its order, let one take from the time of awakening from sleep. When one awakens,

One should commence by remembering God Almighty, saying: "Praise be to God who gave us life after having caused us to die, and to Him is the resurrection," continuing with the rest of the supplications and verses we mentioned in the supplication for awakening from the Book of Supplications. He should put on his garment while in supplication, intending by it to cover his private parts in compliance with the command of God Almighty and seeking His aid in worship without aiming for ostentation or frivolity. Then he should turn toward the water closet if he has need of it, entering first with his left foot and reciting the supplications we mentioned therein in the Book of Purification upon entering and exiting. Then he should use the tooth-stick according to the Sunnah as previously mentioned and perform ablution, observing all the Sunnah practices and supplications we mentioned in purification, for we have presented individual acts of worship only so that we may mention in this book the aspect of composition and arrangement alone. When he finishes ablution, he prays the two rak'ahs of dawn, meaning the Sunnah prayer, in his home; likewise, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) used to do. After the two rak'ahs, whether performed at home or in the mosque, he recites the supplication narrated by Ibn Abbas (may God be pleased with them both), saying: "O God, I ask You for mercy from You by which You guide my heart," to the end of the supplication. Then he leaves the house heading to the mosque, not forgetting the supplication for going to the mosque. He should not hasten to the prayer with haste, but walk with tranquility and dignity as reported in the tradition, and not interlace his fingers. He enters the mosque with his right foot first and recites the transmitted supplication for entering the mosque. Then he seeks from the mosque the first row if he finds space, and does not step over people's necks nor crowd them as previously mentioned in the Book of Friday. Then he prays the two rak'ahs of dawn if he did not pray them at home, and occupies himself with the supplication mentioned after them. If he had already prayed the two rak'ahs of dawn, he prays the two rak'ahs of greeting and sits waiting for the congregation. It is preferable to perform the dawn prayer early in congregation, for he (peace be upon him) used to perform the dawn prayer in the early darkness. One should not abandon the congregation in prayer in general, and in the dawn and evening prayers in particular, for they have additional merit. It has been narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may God be pleased with him) from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) that he said regarding the dawn prayer: "Whoever performs ablution then turns to the mosque to pray therein, for every step he takes is a good deed, and a bad deed is erased from him, and the good deed is multiplied tenfold. Then when he prays, then at sunrise he is recorded for every hair on his body a good deed and returns with an accepted pilgrimage. If he sits until he prays the forenoon prayer, for every rak'ah a thousand thousand good deeds are recorded for him, and whoever prays the evening prayer has the like of that and returns with an accepted Umrah." It was the custom of the predecessors to enter the mosque before dawn. A man from the Followers said: "I entered the mosque before dawn and met Abu Hurairah who had preceded me. He said to me: 'O my nephew, for what purpose have you left your house at this hour?' I said: 'For the morning prayer.' He said: 'Receive glad tidings, for we used to consider our leaving and sitting in the mosque at this hour equivalent to a campaign in the path of God Almighty,' or he said: 'with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him).'" And from Ali (may God be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to him and Fatimah (may God be pleased with them both) while they were sleeping and said: "Do you not pray?" Ali said: "I said: 'O Messenger of God, our souls are in the hand of God Almighty; when He wills to send them forth, He sends them forth.'" He (peace be upon him) turned away, and I heard him as he turned away striking his thigh and saying: "And man is the most contentious of things." Then after the two rak'ahs of dawn and his supplication, he should occupy himself with seeking forgiveness and glorification until the prayer is established, saying: "I seek forgiveness from God, besides whom there is no deity, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I repent to Him" seventy times, and "Glory be to God, praise be to God, there is no deity but God, and God is the Greatest" one hundred times. Then he prays the obligatory prayer, observing all that we mentioned of the inward and outward etiquettes in prayer and following the example. When he finishes it, he sits in the mosque until sunrise in remembrance of God Almighty as we will arrange, for he (peace be upon him) said: "For me to sit in my gathering remembering God Almighty therein from the morning prayer until sunrise is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves." And it is narrated that he (peace be upon him) used to sit in his prayer place after praying the morning prayer until the sun rose, and in some narrations, he would pray two rak'ahs after sunrise. In the merit of that, what is innumerable has been reported. Al-Hasan narrated that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) used to mention from the mercy of his Lord, saying: "Indeed He said: 'O son of Adam, remember Me after the dawn prayer for an hour and after the afternoon prayer for an hour, and I will suffice you for what is between them.'" When the merit of that becomes apparent, let him sit and not speak until sunrise. Rather, his duty until sunrise should be of four types: supplications and remembrances, repeating them in a rosary, reciting the Quran, and reflection. As for supplications: whenever he finishes his prayer, let him begin and say: "O God, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad."

And peace, O Allah, You are Peace and from You is peace, and to You peace returns. Greet us, our Lord, with peace, and admit us into the Abode of Peace. Blessed are You, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor. Then he should commence the supplication with what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, used to commence it, which is his saying: Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, the Bestower. There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is Ever-Living and does not die. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things. There is no god but Allah, the Possessor of bounty, grace, and excellent praise. There is no god but Allah, and we worship none but Him, devoting our religion sincerely to Him, even if the disbelievers dislike it. Then he should begin with the supplications we have mentioned in the third and fourth chapters of the Book of Supplications, and supplicate with all of them if he is able, or memorize from among them what he finds most suitable to his state, most tender to his heart, and easiest on his tongue. As for the repeated remembrances, they are words for which virtues have been reported in their repetition; we have not extended the discussion by listing them. The minimum that should be repeated for each is three or seven times, the maximum is one hundred or seventy, and the middle is ten. So let him repeat them according to his free time and the extent of his available time. The virtue of more is greater, but the middle course is more moderate: to repeat them ten times is more deserving of being sustained, for the best of matters is that which is most enduring, even if it is little. And every practice whose abundance cannot be maintained consistently, its little with continuity is better and has a stronger effect on the heart than its abundance with interruption. The example of the little that is constant is like drops of water falling consecutively upon the ground, eventually creating a hollow, even if it were upon stone. The example of the much that is sporadic is water poured all at once or in separate, widely spaced pours, leaving no apparent trace. And these words are ten.

The first: His saying: There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. To Him belongs the dominion and to Him belongs all praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is Ever-Living and does not die. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things.
The second: His saying: Glory be to Allah, and all praise is for Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest. And there is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Magnificent.
The third: His saying: Most Glorious, Most Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit.
The fourth: His saying: Glory be to Allah, the Magnificent, and with His praise.
The fifth: His saying: I seek forgiveness from Allah, the Magnificent, besides whom there is no god, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer, and I ask Him for repentance.
The sixth: His saying: O Allah, there is no withholder of what You have given, and no giver of what You have withheld, and the fortune of the fortunate one avails him not against You.
The seventh: His saying: There is no god but Allah, the Sovereign, the Manifest Truth.
The eighth: His saying: In the name of Allah, with whose name nothing in the earth or the heavens can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
The ninth: O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant, Your prophet, and Your messenger, the unlettered prophet, and upon his family and companions, and grant them peace.
The tenth: His saying: I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan. My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the devils, and I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they be present with me.

These are the ten words. If he repeats each one ten times, he will have achieved one hundred repetitions, and this is better than repeating a single remembrance one hundred times, because each of these words has its own virtue, and the heart finds with each one a kind of alertness and delight, and the soul finds in transitioning from one word to another a kind of rest and security from boredom. As for recitation, it is recommended for him to recite a collection of verses for which reports of their virtue have been transmitted. That is, he should recite Surah Al-Fatihah, Ayat al-Kursi, the closing verses of Al-Baqarah from "The Messenger has believed..." and "Say: O Allah, Possessor of sovereignty..." the two verses, and His saying, exalted is He: "There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves..." to its end, and His saying, exalted is He: "Allah has certainly fulfilled His Messenger's vision in truth..." to its end, and His saying, glorified is He: "All praise is for Allah, who has not taken a son..." the verse, and five verses from the beginning of Al-Hadid, and three from the end of Surah Al-Hashr. And if he recites the ten 'Museebat' that Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, gifted to Ibrahim al-Taymi, may Allah have mercy on him, and advised him to say them morning and evening, then he has attained complete virtue and gathered for himself the virtue of all the mentioned supplications. It has been narrated from Kurz ibn Wabrah, may Allah have mercy on him, who was among the 'Abdāl, that he said: A brother of mine from the people of Syria came to me and gifted me a gift, saying: O Kurz, accept this gift from me, for it is an excellent gift. I said: O my brother, and who gifted this to you? He said: Ibrahim al-Taymi gave it to me. I said: Did you not ask Ibrahim who gave it to him? He said: I was sitting in the courtyard of the Ka'bah while engaged in declaring Allah's Oneness, glorifying, praising, and magnifying Him, when a man came to me, greeted me with peace, and sat to my right. I had never seen in my time anyone with a more handsome face, better clothes, whiter complexion, or more pleasant fragrance than him. I said...

O servant of God, who are you and from whence have you come? He said: I am al-Khidr. I said: For what purpose have you come to me? He said: I have come to greet you and out of love for you for the sake of God, and I have a gift I wish to present to you. I said: What is it? He said: That you recite before sunrise, before its light spreads upon the earth, and before sunset: Surat al-Fatihah, and "Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind," and "Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak," and "Say: He is God, the One," and "Say: O you disbelievers," and the Verse of the Throne, each one seven times. And you say: Glory be to God, and praise be to God, and there is no god but God, and God is the Greatest, seven times. And you send blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, seven times, and seek forgiveness for yourself, your parents, the believing men and the believing women, seven times. And you say: O God, do with me and with them, in the immediate and the deferred, in religion, this world, and the Hereafter, what You are worthy of, and do not do with us, O our Master, what we are worthy of. Indeed, You are Forgiving, Forbearing, Generous, Noble, Compassionate, Merciful, seven times. And take care not to neglect this in the morning and the evening. I said: I would love for you to inform me who gave you this great gift. He said: Muhammad, peace be upon him, gave it to me. I said: Inform me of its reward. He said: When you meet Muhammad, peace be upon him, ask him about its reward, for he will inform you of it.

Ibrahim al-Taymi mentioned that one day he saw in his dream as if the angels came to him, carried him, and admitted him into Paradise. He saw what was in it and described great matters of what he beheld in Paradise. He said: I asked the angels, saying: For whom is this? They said: For the one who acts like your action. And he mentioned that he ate from its fruit and they gave him drink from its beverage. He said: Then the Prophet, peace be upon him, came to me with seventy prophets and seventy rows of angels, each row like the distance between the east and the west. He greeted me and took my hand. I said: O Messenger of God, al-Khidr informed me that he heard this narration from you? He said: Al-Khidr spoke the truth, al-Khidr spoke the truth, and everything he relates is true. He is the most knowledgeable of the people of the earth, he is the chief of the substitutes, and he is from the soldiers of God, exalted is He, on earth. I said: O Messenger of God, what of one who does this or acts upon it but does not see the like of what I saw in my dream? Will he be given anything of what You have given me? He said: By the One who sent me with the truth as a prophet, indeed the one who acts upon this, even if he did not see me and did not see Paradise, all the major sins he committed will be forgiven for him, and God, exalted is He, will lift His anger and wrath from him, and He will command the keeper of the left to not record a sin from his misdeeds for a year. By the One who sent me with the truth as a prophet, none acts upon this except one whom God created happy, and none abandons it except one whom God created wretched.

Ibrahim al-Taymi would remain for four months without eating or drinking, perhaps it was after this vision. This is the duty of recitation. If one adds to it something from the Quran that has reached him and he recites it, or confines himself to it, it is good, for the Quran encompasses the merit of remembrance, reflection, and supplication, however much it is with contemplation, as we have mentioned its merit and etiquettes in the chapter of recitation. As for reflections, let that be one of his duties, and the detail of what to reflect upon and its manner will come in the Book of Reflection from the Quarter of the Deliverers. But its comprehensive matters return to two categories: The first is that he reflects on what benefits him in conduct, by holding his soul to account for what has passed of his shortcomings, and arranging his duties in the day that lies before him, and devising how to repel the distractions and obstacles that preoccupy him from good, and he remembers his shortcomings and the flaws that may creep into his deeds so that he may rectify them, and he brings to his heart the righteous intentions for his deeds concerning himself and his conduct with the Muslims. The second category concerns what benefits him in the knowledge of unveiling, which is that he reflects at times on the blessings of God, exalted is He, and the succession of His apparent and hidden instruments, so that his knowledge of them increases and his gratitude for them multiplies; or on His punishments and afflictions, so that his knowledge of the power of the Divine and His self-sufficiency increases, and his fear of them grows. Each of these matters has many branches; reflection expands upon them for some of creation more than others. We will only fulfill the detailing of that in the Book of Reflection. Whatever reflection is made easy, it is the noblest of acts of worship, for within it is the meaning of remembrance of God, exalted is He, and the increase of two matters: The first is the increase of knowledge, for reflection is the key to knowledge and unveiling. The second is the increase of love, for the heart loves only one it believes to be majestic, and the majesty and grandeur of God, glorified is He, are not unveiled except by knowledge of His attributes and knowledge of His power and the wonders of His acts. Thus, from reflection comes knowledge, from knowledge comes veneration, and from veneration comes love. Remembrance also begets intimacy, which is a type of love, but the love whose cause is knowledge is stronger, more established, and greater. The proportion of the lover who is a knower to the intimacy of the rememberer without complete insight is like the proportion of the passion of one who has witnessed the beauty of a person with the eye and become acquainted with the goodness of his character, his deeds, his virtues, and his praiseworthy traits through experience, to the intimacy of one who merely hears repeated the description of a person absent.

He likened Him to beauty in both form and character without specifying the aspects of beauty in them. Thus, love for Him is not like love for what is witnessed, nor is report like direct observation. The servants who persistently remember God with heart and tongue, who affirm what the messengers brought through traditional faith, possess nothing of the beautiful attributes of God Almighty except beautiful matters they have believed through affirmation from their description. The knowers, however, are those who have witnessed that majesty and beauty with the eye of inner insight, which is stronger than outward sight, for no one has encompassed the essence of His majesty and beauty, as that is beyond the capability of any creature. Rather, each one witnesses according to what has been lifted from him of the veils, and there is no end to the beauty of the Divine Presence nor to its veils. Indeed, the number of its veils that deserve to be called light—and the one who reaches them almost thinks he has attained the Source—is seventy veils. He said, peace be upon him: "Verily, God has seventy veils of light; if He were to lift them, the splendors of His Countenance would burn everything His sight perceives." These veils are also arranged in order, and those lights vary in rank like the variation of the sun, the moon, and the stars. In the beginning, the smallest appears, then what follows it. Upon this, some Sufis based the degrees of what appeared to Abraham, the intimate friend, peace be upon him, in his ascension, and he said: "When the night covered him," meaning when the matter became obscure to him, "he saw a star," meaning he reached a veil from the veils of light, expressed as a star, and what is intended by it is not these luminous bodies, for even the common folk are not unaware that divinity is not befitting of bodies; rather, they perceive that with their initial reflection. Thus, what does not mislead the common folk does not mislead the intimate friend, peace be upon him. The veils called lights are not intended to be the light perceived by sight, but rather what is intended by the saying of God Almighty: "God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp," the verse. Let us move beyond these meanings, for they are outside the scope of the science of spiritual practice, and none attains their realities except through unveiling that follows pure reflection, and few are those for whom its door opens. What is accessible to the masses of creation is reflection on what benefits in the science of spiritual practice, and that too is of abundant benefit and great usefulness. These four functions—namely supplication, remembrance, recitation, and reflection—should be the function of the seeker after the dawn prayer, indeed in every session after completing the function of prayer, for there is no function after prayer except these four. One strengthens oneself for that by taking up his weapon and shield, and fasting is the shield that constricts the channels of the hostile devil, turning him away from the path of guidance. After the dawn appears, there is no prayer except the two units of the dawn and the obligatory dawn prayer until sunrise. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and his companions, may God be pleased with them, would occupy themselves during this time with remembrances, and that is preferable until sleep overcomes one before the obligatory prayer, and it is only dispelled by prayer, so if one prays for that, there is no harm. The second session: what is between sunrise and mid-morning, and by mid-morning I mean the midpoint between sunrise and noon, which is after three hours of the day if the day is considered twelve hours, which is a quarter. In this quarter of the day, there are two additional functions: one is the forenoon prayer, which we have mentioned in the Book of Prayer, and the preferable is to pray two units at sunrise, which is when the sun has spread out and risen about half a spear's length, and to pray four, six, or eight when the young camels feel the heat and feet are burned by the sun's heat. The time for the two units is what God Almighty intended by His saying: "They exalt [Him] in the evening and at sunrise," for it is the time of the sun's rising, which is the appearance of its full light by its rising above the parallel of vapors and dust on the earth's surface, for they prevent its complete radiance. The time for the four units is the higher forenoon by which God Almighty swore, saying: "By the morning brightness and by the night when it covers with darkness." (And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, went out to his companions while they were praying at sunrise and called out with his loudest voice: "Verily, the prayer of the oft-returning is when the young camels feel the heat.") Therefore, we say if one limits to a single time for prayer, this time is best for the forenoon prayer, even though the essence of virtue is attained by praying between the two ends of the disliked times, which is between the sun's rising about half a spear's length approximately until just before noon at the hour of zenith, and the name forenoon applies to all of it. It is as if the two units at sunrise occur at the beginning of the time permission for prayer and the end of the disliked time, for he said, peace be upon him: "Verily, the sun rises with the horn of Satan, so when it rises, it leaves it." The minimum rise is for it to rise above the earth's vapors and dust, and this is considered approximately. The function...

The second matter at this time: the good deeds pertaining to people which have become customary in the morning, such as visiting the sick, accompanying a funeral procession, assisting in righteousness and piety, attending a gathering of knowledge, and what follows the same course, like fulfilling a need for a Muslim and other such acts. If there is nothing of that, one returns to the four duties we previously mentioned: supplications, remembrance, recitation, reflection, and the supererogatory prayers if one wishes—for they are disliked after the dawn prayer, but are not disliked now, so prayer becomes a fifth category among the duties of this time for whoever desires it. However, after the obligatory dawn prayer, every prayer without a reason is disliked, and after dawn it is most beloved to confine oneself to the two rak'ahs of the dawn sunnah and the greeting of the mosque, and not to occupy oneself with prayer, but rather with remembrances, recitation, supplication, and reflection.

The third portion: from mid-morning until the sun's zenith. By mid-morning we mean the midpoint and a little before it. Although it is recommended to pray after every three hours, when three hours have passed after sunrise, then at that time and before its passing is the time for the forenoon prayer. When another three hours pass, then the noon prayer; when another three hours pass, then the afternoon prayer; when another three hours pass, then the sunset prayer. The position of the forenoon prayer between the zenith and sunrise is like the position of the afternoon prayer between the zenith and sunset, except that the forenoon prayer was not made obligatory because it is a time when people are engrossed in their occupations, so they were given relief.

The fourth duty in this time: the four categories, with two matters added. The first is occupying oneself with earning a livelihood and managing one's sustenance, and attending the marketplace. If one is a trader, one should trade with honesty and trustworthiness; if one is a craftsman, then with sincerity and compassion, and not forget the remembrance of God Almighty in all one's occupations. One should limit earning to the measure of one's need for that day, as much as one is able to earn each day for one's sustenance. When one attains sufficiency for the day, then let him return to the house of his Lord and provision for his Hereafter, for the need for provision for the Hereafter is more severe, and the enjoyment of it is more lasting. His occupation with his earning is more important than seeking increase beyond the need of the moment. It has been said: the believer is not found except in three places: a mosque he frequents, a house that shelters him, or a necessity he cannot do without. Few know the measure in what is indispensable; rather, most people measure in what is avoidable that they cannot do without it. That is because Satan promises them poverty and commands them to immorality, so they incline to him and hoard what they do not eat, fearing poverty, while God promises them forgiveness from Him and bounty, yet they turn away and have no desire for it.

The second matter: the midday nap, which is a sunnah that aids in standing at night, just as the pre-dawn meal is a sunnah that aids in fasting the day. If one does not stand at night, but if he did not sleep he would not occupy himself with good, and perhaps would mix with the heedless and converse with them, then sleep is more beloved for him if his energy does not stir him to return to the remembrances and mentioned duties, for in sleep there is silence and safety. Some have said: a time will come upon people when silence and sleep are the best of their deeds. How many a worshiper is in his best state when sleeping—that is when he shows off in his worship and is not sincere in it, so what about the heedless transgressor? Sufyan al-Thawri, may God have mercy on him, said: They used to like, when they had free time, to sleep seeking safety. If his sleep is with the intention of seeking safety and the resolve to stand at night, then his sleep is an act of devotion. But one should awaken before the zenith by enough time to prepare for prayer with ablution and attending the mosque before the prayer time enters, for that is among the merits of deeds. If one does not sleep and does not occupy oneself with earning, but occupies oneself with prayer and remembrance, that is the best of the day's deeds, because it is a time when people are heedless of God Almighty and occupied with worldly concerns. The heart free to serve its Lord when the servants turn away from His door is worthy that God Almighty purify it and select it for His nearness and knowledge. The merit of that is like the merit of reviving the night, for the night is a time of heedlessness through sleep, and this is a time of heedlessness through following caprice and being occupied with worldly concerns. One meaning of His saying, exalted is He: "And He it is Who has made the night and the day in succession, for whoever desires to remember" is that one succeeds the other in merit; and the second is that it succeeds it so that one may make up in it what was missed in the other.

The fourth portion: from the zenith until finishing the noon prayer and its regular supererogatory prayers. This is the shortest of the day's portions and the best of them. If one has performed ablution before the zenith and attended the mosque, then whenever the sun has declined and the caller begins the call to prayer, let him wait until finishing the response to his call, then let him rise to revive what is between the call and the establishment of prayer, for it is the time of the noon appearance that God Almighty intended by His saying: "and when you appear at noon." Let him pray in this time four rak'ahs without separating them with a single salutation, and this prayer alone among all the prayers of the day...

The scholars hold that it is prayed with a single salutation, but that narration has been critiqued. The school of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, is that it is prayed two by two, like all other supererogatory prayers, and separated by a salutation. This is what the reports have confirmed. One should prolong these rak'ahs, for in them the gates of heaven are opened, as we mentioned the report in the chapter on voluntary prayer. One should recite in it Surah al-Baqarah, or a surah from the al-Mi'un, or four from the al-Mathani. These are hours in which supplication is answered, and the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, loved that his deeds be elevated therein. Then he prays Dhuhr in congregation after four long rak'ahs, as preceded, or short ones; one should not neglect them. Then after Dhuhr, let him pray two rak'ahs, then four. Indeed, Ibn Mas'ud disliked that an obligatory prayer be followed by its like without a separation. It is recommended to recite in this supererogatory prayer Ayat al-Kursi, the end of Surah al-Baqarah, and the verses we mentioned in the first devotional portion, so that this combines for him supplication, remembrance, recitation, prayer, praise, and glorification, along with the nobility of the time.

The fifth devotional portion: what is after that until 'Asr. It is recommended in it to remain in the mosque, occupied with remembrance and prayer or various forms of good, being in a state of retreat while awaiting the prayer. Among the merits of deeds is awaiting one prayer after another. This was the practice of the predecessors. One entering the mosque between Dhuhr and 'Asr would hear from those praying a hum like the hum of bees from recitation. However, if his home is safer for his religion and more conducive to focusing his resolve, then the home is better for him. Reviving this portion, which is also a time of people's heedlessness, is like reviving the third portion in merit. In this time, sleep is disliked for one who slept before the sun's zenith, for two sleeps during the day are disliked. Some scholars said there are three things God detests: laughing without wonder, eating without hunger, and sleeping during the day without staying awake at night. The limit concerning sleep is that night and day are twenty-four hours; the moderation in one's sleep is eight hours in night and day combined. If one sleeps this amount at night, there is no reason for sleep during the day. If one falls short of it by an amount, one completes it during the day. Indeed, if a son of Adam lives sixty years, twenty years are subtracted from his life. Whenever he sleeps eight hours, which is one-third, he has subtracted one-third from his life. However, since sleep is nourishment for the spirit just as food is nourishment for bodies, and just as knowledge and remembrance are nourishment for the heart, it cannot be cut off from it entirely. This amount is the moderation, and falling short of it may lead to bodily disturbance, except for one who gradually accustoms himself to staying awake; he may train himself upon it without disturbance. This portion is among the longest and most delightful for worshippers. It is one of the *asil* (late afternoons) which God the Exalted mentioned when He said: "And to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows as well, in the mornings and the late afternoons." If inanimate objects prostrate to God, Glory and Might be to Him, how can it be permissible for an intelligent servant to be heedless of the various acts of worship?

The sixth devotional portion: When the time of 'Asr enters, the time of the sixth portion enters. It is that by which God the Exalted swore, saying: "By the afternoon." This is one of the two meanings of the verse and is intended by *al-asil* in one of the two interpretations; it is the late afternoon mentioned in His saying "and in the afternoon" and in His saying "in the late afternoon and at sunrise." There is no specific prayer in this portion except four rak'ahs between the adhan and the iqamah, as preceded for Dhuhr. Then one prays the obligatory prayer and occupies himself with the four categories mentioned in the first portion until the sun rises to the tops of the walls and turns yellow. The best in it, since prayer is prohibited, is the recitation of the Quran with contemplation and understanding, for that combines remembrance, supplication, and reflection, thus encompassing within this category most of the objectives of the other three categories.

The seventh devotional portion: When the sun turns yellow, meaning it draws near to the earth such that its light covers the expressions and vapors upon the earth's surface and a yellowness is seen in its light, the time of this portion enters. It is like the first portion from the dawn until sunrise, because it is before sunset just as that was before sunrise. It is intended by His saying: "So glorify Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning." This is the second extremity intended by His saying: "So glorify and at the extremities of the day." Al-Hasan said: They held the late afternoon in greater reverence than the beginning of the day. Some of the predecessors said: They would make the beginning of the day for the worldly life and its end for the Hereafter. Therefore, it is recommended in this time to glorify and seek forgiveness specifically, and all that we mentioned in the first portion, such as saying: "I seek forgiveness from Allah, besides whom there is no deity, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence, and I ask Him for repentance," and "Glory be to Allah, the Magnificent, and praise be to Him," taken from His saying: "And seek forgiveness for your sin and glorify the praise of your Lord in the late afternoon and the early morning." And seeking forgiveness is upon the names...

Those in the Qur'an are beloved, such as His saying: "Seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed, He is ever Forgiving." "Seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance." "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for You are the best of the merciful." "So forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of the forgivers." It is recommended to recite before sunset: "By the sun and its brightness," "And by the night when it covers," and the two chapters of refuge. Let the sun set upon him while he is in seeking forgiveness. When he hears the call to prayer, he says: "O Allah, this is the approach of Your night and the departure of Your day, and the voices of Your callers," as previously mentioned. Then he responds to the caller and occupies himself with the Maghrib prayer. With sunset, the daily litanies have concluded, so the servant should observe his states and hold himself to account, for a stage of his journey has passed. If his day equals his yesterday, he is at a loss; if it is worse, he is blameworthy, for it has been said: "No blessing is for me in a day in which I do not increase in good." If he sees himself abundant in good throughout his entire day, delighting without hardship, that is glad tidings; let him thank Allah Almighty for His enabling and guiding him on his path. If otherwise, the night follows the day; let him resolve to make up for what preceded of his negligence, for good deeds erase bad deeds. Let him thank Allah Almighty for the health of his body and the remainder of his life, the length of his night, to occupy himself with making up for his shortcomings. Let him hold in his heart that the day of life has an end when the sun of life sets, after which there is no rising. At that point, the door of making up and excuse is closed, for life is but numbered days that inevitably pass, their entirety ending with the passing of each one.

(Explanation of the Nightly Litanies)

They are five: The first: When the sun sets, he prays Maghrib and occupies himself with enlivening the time between the two evening prayers. The end of this litany is at the disappearance of the twilight, meaning the redness whose disappearance marks the time of the late evening prayer. Allah Almighty has sworn by it, saying: "So I swear by the twilight." Prayer during it is the rising of the night, for it is the first rising of its hours and is one of the times mentioned in His saying: "And during the night, exalt Him." It is the prayer of the oft-returning. It is intended by His saying: "Their sides forsake their beds." That has been narrated from Al-Hasan, and Ibn Abi Ziyad attributed it to the Messenger of Allah, that he was asked about this verse and said: "Prayer between the two evening prayers." Then he said: "Upon you is prayer between the two evening prayers, for it removes the frivolities of the day and refines its end." "Frivolities" is the plural of "frivolity" from idle talk. Anas, may Allah have mercy on him, was asked about one who sleeps between the two evening prayers, and he said: "Do not do so, for it is the hour intended by His saying: 'Their sides forsake their beds.'" The merit of enlivening the time between the two evening prayers will come in the second chapter. The order of this litany is to pray after Maghrib two rak'ahs first, reciting in them "Say, O disbelievers" and "Say, He is Allah, the One," and pray them immediately after Maghrib without intervening speech or occupation. Then he prays four, prolonging them, then prays until the disappearance of the twilight what is easy for him. If the mosque is near the home, there is no harm in praying them in his house if he does not intend to remain in the mosque; if he intends to remain in the mosque awaiting the late evening prayer, that is best if he is safe from affectation and showing off. The second litany: It begins with the entry of the time of the late evening prayer until the limit of people's sleep, which is the first consolidation of darkness. Allah Almighty has sworn by it when He said: "And by the night and what it envelops," meaning what it gathers of its darkness, and said: "Until the darkness of the night," for there the night darkens and its darkness becomes complete. The order of this litany involves three matters: First, to pray besides the obligatory 'Isha ten rak'ahs: four before the obligation, enlivening the time between the two calls to prayer, and six after the obligation: two, then four, reciting in them specific verses from the Qur'an, such as the end of Al-Baqarah, Ayat al-Kursi, the beginning of Al-Hadid, the end of Al-Hashr, and others. Second, to pray thirteen rak'ahs, the last being the witr, for it is the most that has been narrated that the Prophet prayed at night. The wise take their time from the beginning of the night, the strong from its end; prudence is in advancing, for perhaps one may not wake up or find the standing heavy except if it becomes a habit for him, though the latter part of the night is better. Then let him recite in this prayer about three hundred verses from specific chapters that the Prophet frequently recited, such as Ya-Sin, the prostration in Luqman, Surah Ad-Dukhan, Tabarak al-Mulk, Az-Zumar, and Al-Waqi'ah. If he does not pray, let him not abandon reciting these chapters or some of them before sleeping, for it has been narrated in three hadiths what the Messenger of Allah recited every night; the most famous are As-Sajdah and Tabarak al-Mulk, Az-Zumar and Al-Waqi'ah; in one narration, Az-Zumar and Bani Isra'il; and in another, that he recited the Musabbihat every night.

And in it is a verse better than a thousand verses. The scholars would make it six, adding "Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High," for in the report is that he, peace be upon him, loved "Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High," and he would recite in the three rak'ahs of Witr three surahs: "Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High," "Say, O disbelievers," and "Sincerity." When he finished, he would say "Glory be to the Sovereign, the Holy" three times. The third is Witr, and one should perform Witr before sleep if it is not his habit to rise at night. Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, enjoined me not to sleep except on Witr. If one is accustomed to night prayer, then delaying it is better. He, peace be upon him, said: "Night prayer is two by two, and if you fear the dawn, then perform Witr with one rak'ah." And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, performed Witr at the beginning of the night, its middle, and its end, and his Witr concluded at the pre-dawn. And Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: Witr is of three ways: if you wish, perform Witr at the beginning of the night, then pray two by two—meaning it becomes Witr by what has passed; if you wish, perform Witr with one rak'ah, then when you awaken, pair it with another, then perform Witr at the end of the night; if you wish, delay Witr to be the last of your prayer. This is what is narrated from him, and the first and third ways are without issue. As for breaking Witr, a prohibition is authentically established therein, so it should not be broken. And it is narrated absolutely that he, peace be upon him, said: "There are not two Witrs in one night." For one who is uncertain of awakening, a gentle practice some scholars deemed good is to pray after Witr two rak'ahs sitting on his bed upon sleeping. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would creep to his bed and pray them, reciting in them "When the earth is shaken" and "Rivalry distracts you," for in them is warning and admonition. In a narration: "Say, O disbelievers," for in it is disavowal and singling out worship for God Almighty. It is said: If he awakens, they stand in place of one rak'ah, and he may perform Witr with one at the end of the night prayer, as if what passed became even by them. Recommencing Witr is good, and Abu Talib al-Makki deemed this good, saying in it are three acts: shortening hope, securing Witr, and Witr at the end of the night, as mentioned. But perhaps it occurs that if they paired what passed, it would be likewise, and if he does not awaken and nullifies his first Witr, then its being paired if he awakens is not paired if he sleeps—this is subject to consideration, unless it is established from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he performed Witr before them and repeated Witr, from which it is understood that the two rak'ahs are even in form and Witr in meaning, so it is counted as Witr if he does not awaken and as even if he awakens. Then it is recommended after the salutation of Witr to say: "Glory be to the Sovereign, the Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit. You have covered the heavens and the earth with majesty and omnipotence, and You are exalted by power and subjugate the servants by death." It is narrated: "He, peace be upon him, did not die until most of his prayer was sitting except the obligatory." And he said: "For the sitting one is half the reward of the standing one, and for the sleeping one is half the reward of the sitting one." That indicates the validity of supererogatory prayer always. The third portion: Sleep, and there is no harm in counting that among the portions, for if its etiquettes are observed, it is reckoned as worship. It is said: When a servant sleeps in a state of purity and remembrance of God Almighty, he is recorded as praying until he awakens, and an angel enters his emblem. If he moves in his sleep and remembers God Almighty, the angel supplicates for him and God forgives him. In the report: "If he sleeps in a state of purity, his spirit is raised to the Throne." This is for the common people, so what of the elect, the scholars, and the possessors of pure hearts? For they are unveiled with secrets in sleep, and therefore he, peace be upon him, said: "The sleep of a scholar is worship and his breath is glorification." And Mu'adh said to Abu Musa: What do you do in standing at night? He said: I stand the entire night, not sleeping from it at all, and I excel in the Quran, excelling in it. Mu'adh said: But I sleep, then I stand, and I reckon in my sleep what I reckon from my standing. They mentioned that to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he said: "Mu'adh has more understanding than you." The etiquettes of sleep are ten: The first is purity and the tooth-stick. He, peace be upon him, said: "When a servant sleeps in a state of purity, his spirit ascends to the Throne, and his dreams are truthful; and if he does not sleep in purity, his spirit falls short of reaching, and those dreams are confused visions that do not come true." This is intended for purity of both the outward and inward, and purity of the inward is what effects the unveiling of the veils of the unseen. The second is to place near his head his tooth-stick and his purification and intend to rise for worship upon awakening, and whenever he stirs, he uses the tooth-stick—some of the predecessors did so. It is narrated from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he would use the tooth-stick every night repeatedly at each sleep and upon stirring from it. If purification is not feasible for him, it is recommended for him to wipe his limbs with water; if he does not find it, let him sit, face the Qiblah, and occupy himself with remembrance, supplication, and reflection on the blessings of God Almighty.

And his capability stands in place of standing in prayer at night. He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever goes to his bed intending to rise and pray at night, but is overcome by sleep until morning, what he intended is recorded for him, and his sleep is a charity given to him by God, the Exalted." Third, that one who has a bequest should not spend the night unless his written bequest is at his head, for he cannot be safe from being seized in sleep. For whoever dies without a bequest is not permitted to speak in the Barzakh until the Day of Resurrection; the dead visit one another and converse, while he cannot speak. Some of them say to others, 'This wretch died without a bequest.' This is recommended out of fear of sudden death, and sudden death is a mercy except for one who is not prepared for death, being burdened with injustices. Fourth, that he sleeps repentant from every sin, with a heart sound towards all Muslims, not entertaining thoughts of wronging anyone nor resolving upon disobedience if he awakens. He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever retires to his bed not intending to wrong anyone nor bearing a grudge against anyone, his transgressions are forgiven." Fifth, that he does not indulge in the smoothing of soft bedding, but rather leaves that or is moderate in it. Some of the pious predecessors disliked smoothing bedding for sleep, seeing it as affectation. The People of the Suffah would not place any barrier between themselves and the earth, saying, 'From it we were created and to it we return.' They considered this more tender for their hearts and more deserving of humility for their souls. Whoever's soul does not permit this, let him be moderate. Sixth, that he does not sleep unless sleep overcomes him, nor does he strive to induce it, except if he intends by it to gain strength for rising in the last part of the night. For their sleep was an overcoming, their eating a necessity, and their speech a need. Therefore, they were described as sleeping little of the night. If sleep overcomes him for prayer and remembrance, and he no longer knows what he is saying, then let him sleep until he is conscious of what he says. Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, disliked sleeping while sitting. In the report: "Do not struggle against the night." It was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "Such-and-such a woman prays at night, and when sleep overcomes her, she clings to a rope." He forbade that and said: "Let one of you pray at night what is easy for him. When sleep overcomes him, let him lie down." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Take on from the deeds what you can bear, for God will not tire until you tire." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The best of this religion is its easiest." And it was said to him, peace be upon him: "Such-and-such a man prays and does not sleep, and fasts and does not break his fast." He said: "But I pray and sleep, and I fast and break my fast. This is my way. Whoever turns away from it is not of me." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Do not make this religion difficult, for it is firm. Whoever contends with it, it will overcome him. So do not make the worship of God hateful to yourself." Seventh, that he sleeps facing the Qiblah. Facing it is of two kinds: one is the facing of the dying person, which is lying on his back, so his facing is that his face and the soles of his feet are towards the Qiblah. The second is the facing of the one in the grave, which is that he sleeps on his side, so that his face is towards it, with his body aligned if he sleeps on his right side. Eighth, supplication upon sleeping. He should say: "In Your name, my Lord, I lay down my side, and in Your name I raise it," up to the end of the transmitted supplications which we have mentioned in the Book of Supplications. It is recommended to recite specific verses, such as the Throne Verse and the end of Surah Al-Baqarah and others, and His saying, the Exalted: "And your god is one God. There is no deity except Him..." to His saying: "...for a people who use reason." It is said that whoever recites it upon sleeping, God preserves the Quran for him so he does not forget it. And let him recite from Surah Al-A'raf this verse: "Indeed, your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six days..." to His saying: "...is near to the doers of good." And the end of Bani Isra'il: "Say, 'Call upon God...'" the two verses, for a king entrusted with his protection enters his emblem, seeking forgiveness for him. And let him recite the two chapters of refuge and blow with them into his hands, then wipe his face and the rest of his body with them, as has been narrated from the practice of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. And let him recite ten from the beginning of Al-Kahf and ten from its end; these verses are for awakening for the night prayer. And Ali, may God honor his face, said: "I do not think a man of complete intellect sleeps before reciting the two verses from the end of Surah Al-Baqarah." And let him say twenty-five times: "Glory be to God, praise be to God, there is no god but God, and God is the Greatest," so that the total of these four phrases is one hundred times. Ninth, that he remembers upon sleeping that sleep is a kind of death, and awakening is a kind of resurrection. God, the Exalted, said: "God takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep." And He said: "And it is He who takes your souls by night." So He named it a taking. And just as the one who awakens has unveiled to him sights not akin to his states in sleep, so too the one resurrected sees what never crossed his mind nor did his senses perceive. The likeness of sleep between life and death is as the Barzakh between this world and the Hereafter. And Luqman said to his son: "O my son, if you doubt..."

Death, so do not sleep; for as you sleep, so shall you die. And if you doubt the Resurrection, then do not awaken; for as you awaken after your sleep, so shall you be resurrected after your death. Ka‘b al-Aḥbār said: When you sleep, lie on your right side and face the Qiblah with your face, for it is a passing away. ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: The last thing the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would say when he slept, placing his cheek on his right hand, believing he would die that night, was: “O God, Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the mighty Throne, our Lord and the Lord of all things and their Sovereign…” the supplication to its end as we have mentioned in the Book of Supplications. Thus it is incumbent upon the servant to examine three things upon sleeping: upon what he sleeps, and what predominates in him—love for God Almighty and love for meeting Him, or love for this world—and to realize that he will pass away according to what predominates in him and be resurrected according to what he passes away upon, for a person is with whom he loves and with what he loves. The tenth supplication concerning awakening: let him say upon waking and turning, whenever he awakens, what the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to say: “There is no god but God, the One, the Subduer, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Mighty, the Forgiving.” And let him strive that the last thing that flows upon his heart when sleeping is the remembrance of God Almighty, and the first thing that returns to his heart upon awakening is the remembrance of God Almighty, for that is a sign of love. Nothing accompanies the heart in these two states except what predominates in it, so let him test his heart with this, for it is a sign of love, a sign that reveals from the inward heart. These remembrances are recommended to draw the heart to the remembrance of God Almighty. When he awakens to rise, let him say: “Praise be to God who gives us life after causing us to die, and to Him is the resurrection,” to the end of what we have cited of the supplications for awakening.

The fourth portion: it begins with the passing of the first half of the night until a sixth of the night remains, at which time the servant rises for the night vigil. The term “tahajjud” specifically refers to what comes after “hujūd” and “hujū‘,” which is sleep, and this is the middle of the night. It resembles the portion after noon, which is the middle of the day, and by it God Almighty swore, saying: “By the night when it covers…” meaning when it becomes still, and its stillness is its calmness at this time, so no eye remains except sleeping, save the Ever-Living, the Sustainer, who neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. It is said: “when it covers” means when it extends and lengthens; and it is said: when it darkens. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked: “Which part of the night is most receptive?” He said: “The depth of the night.” And David, peace be upon him, said: “My God, I love to worship You, so which time is best?” Then God Almighty revealed to him: “O David, do not stand at the beginning of the night nor at its end, for whoever stands at its beginning sleeps at its end, and whoever stands at its end does not stand at its beginning. But stand in the middle of the night, that you may be alone with Me and I with you, and raise your needs to Me.” And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was asked: “Which part of the night is best?” He said: “The latter half of the night,” meaning the remaining part. And in the last part of the night, reports have come of the Throne trembling, the winds spreading from the gardens of Eden, and the descent of the Almighty to the lowest heaven, among other reports.

The arrangement of this portion is that after completing the supplications for awakening, he performs ablution as previously described with its practices, etiquettes, and supplications, then turns to his prayer place, stands facing the Qiblah, and says: “God is the Greatest, greatly, and praise be to God abundantly, and glory be to God morning and evening.” Then let him glorify ten times, praise God ten times, and declare His oneness ten times, and let him say: “God is the Greatest, Possessor of sovereignty, might, majesty, grandeur, glory, and power.” And let him say these words, for they are transmitted from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in his rising for the night vigil: “O God, to You is praise, You are the Light of the heavens and the earth; to You is praise, You are the splendor of the heavens and the earth; to You is praise, You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth; to You is praise, You are the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and what is in them and upon them. You are the Truth, and from You is truth, and meeting You is true, and Paradise is true, and the Fire is true, and the Resurrection is true, and the prophets are true, and Muhammad, peace be upon him, is true. O God, to You I have submitted, and in You I have believed, and upon You I have relied, and to You I have turned, and with You I have contended, and to You I have appealed for judgment. So forgive me what I have sent forth and what I have delayed, what I have concealed and what I have made public, and what I have exceeded in. You are the Advancer and You are the Delayer; there is no god but You. O God, grant my soul its piety and purify it, You are the best to purify it, You are its Guardian and its Master. O God, guide me to the best of deeds, none guides to the best of them but You, and turn me away from evil deeds, none turns away evil deeds but You. I ask You with the asking of the wretched poor, and I call upon You with the call of the needy humble. Do not make me, by my supplication to You, my Lord, miserable, and be gentle and merciful to me, O Best of those asked and Most Generous of givers.” And ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: “When he, peace be upon him, rose at night, he would begin his prayer saying: ‘O God, Lord of Gabriel, Michael, and Isrāfīl, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You judge between Your servants concerning what they differed in…’”

Guide me to the truth in that wherein I differ, by Your leave. Indeed, You guide whom You will to a straight path. Then he begins the prayer and prays two brief units, then he prays two by two as much as is easy for him, and concludes with the Witr if he has not already prayed it. It is recommended to separate between the two prayers upon his salutation with one hundred glorifications, so that he may rest and increase his vigor for prayer. It is authentically reported concerning the night prayer of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, that he first prayed two brief units, then two long units, then two units shorter than the two before them, then he continued to gradually shorten until thirteen units. Aisha, may God be pleased with her, was asked: Did the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recite aloud in the night vigil or silently? She said: Sometimes he recited aloud and sometimes silently. And he, peace be upon him, said: "The night prayer is two by two. When you fear the dawn, then perform Witr with one unit." And he said: "The Maghrib prayer is the Witr of the daytime, so perform Witr for the night prayer." The maximum authentically reported from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, concerning the night vigil is thirteen units. In these units, he recites from his regular portion of the Qur'an or from specific surahs whatever is easy for him, and he is in the ruling of this portion close to the last sixth of the night.

The fifth portion: The last sixth of the night, which is the time of the pre-dawn hours (sahar), for God Almighty said: "And in the hours before dawn they would seek forgiveness." It is said they pray due to the seeking of forgiveness therein, and it is close to the dawn, which is the time of the departure of the night angels and the arrival of the day angels. Salman enjoined this portion upon his brother Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with them both, on the night he visited him, in a long hadith. At its end, he said: When night came, Abu al-Darda' went to stand (for prayer). Salman said to him: Sleep. So he slept. Then he went to stand, and Salman said: Sleep. So he slept. When it was near dawn, Salman said to him: Stand now. So they stood and prayed. Then he said: Verily, your soul has a right over you, your guest has a right over you, and your family has a right over you. So give each possessor of a right his right. That was because the wife of Abu al-Darda' informed Salman that he did not sleep at night. They came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and mentioned that to him. He said: Salman has spoken the truth. This is the fifth portion, and in it the pre-dawn meal (sahur) is recommended, that being when fearing the rise of dawn. The duty in these two portions is prayer. When dawn breaks, the night portions conclude and the day portions begin. He then stands and prays the two units of Fajr, which is intended by His saying, exalted is He: "And glorify Him during part of the night and at the retreat of the stars." Then he recites: "God bears witness that there is no deity except Him, and the angels..." to its end. Then he says: And I bear witness to what God has borne witness to for Himself, and His angels have borne witness, and those endowed with knowledge from His creation. I entrust to God this testimony, and it is for me with God, exalted is He, a trust. I ask Him to preserve it for me until He takes me while upon it. O God, remove from me thereby a burden, and make it for me with You a treasure, and preserve it for me, and take me while upon it until I meet You with it, not having altered it with any alteration.

This is the arrangement of the portions for the worshippers. They used to recommend combining with that, each day, four matters: fasting, charity—even if little—visiting the sick, and attending a funeral. For in the report: "Whoever combines these four in a day, he is forgiven." In another narration: "He enters Paradise." If he spends some of them and is incapable of the others, he has the reward of all of them according to his intention. They disliked that a day should pass without them having given charity therein, even with a date, or an onion, or a morsel of bread, due to his saying, peace be upon him: "A man is in the shade of his charity until judgment is passed among the people," and due to his saying, peace be upon him: "Guard yourselves against the Fire, even with half a date." Aisha, may God be pleased with her, gave a single grape to a beggar. He took it, and those present with her looked at one another. She said: What is the matter with you? Verily, in it are many weights of atoms. They did not recommend turning away a beggar, for that was from the character of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him; no one asked him for anything but he did not say no, but if he could not manage it, he remained silent. In the report: "The son of Adam awakens, and upon every joint of his body is a charity"—meaning the articulation; in his body are three hundred and sixty joints. "Your enjoining good is a charity, your forbidding evil is a charity, your carrying for the weak is a charity, your guiding to the road is a charity, your removing a harmful thing is a charity"—until he mentioned glorification and declaring God's oneness. Then he said: "And the two units of Duha prayer come upon all of that," or "they gather for you all of that."

(Clarification of the Variation of Portions According to States)

Know that the aspirant for the harvest of the Hereafter, the traveler on its path, is not devoid of six states. For he is either a worshipper, or a scholar, or a student, or a governor, or a craftsman, or a unifier absorbed in the One, the Eternal, apart from other than Him. The first: The worshipper, who is devoted exclusively to worship, having absolutely no occupation other than it. Were he to leave worship, he would sit idle. The arrangement of his portions is what we have mentioned. Indeed, it is not far-fetched that they differ...

His duties are to devote most of his time either to prayer, recitation, or glorifications. Indeed, among the Companions, may God be pleased with them, was one whose regular practice was twelve thousand glorifications a day; among them was one whose practice was thirty thousand; and among them was one whose practice was three hundred rak'ahs up to six hundred and up to a thousand rak'ahs. The least reported of their regular prayers was one hundred rak'ahs in a day and night. Some of them increased their practice of the Qur'an, and one of them would complete it once a day, and it is narrated twice from some of them. Some would spend the day or night contemplating a single verse, repeating it. Karaz ibn Wabarah resided in Mecca and would perform seventy circuits each day and seventy circuits each night, and along with that, he would complete the Qur'an twice in a day and night. Calculating that, it amounted to ten parasangs, and with each circuit two rak'ahs, that is two hundred and eighty rak'ahs, two completions, and ten parasangs. If you ask, "Which of these practices is most deserving of having most of one's time devoted to it?" Know that reciting the Qur'an in prayer while standing with contemplation combines all benefits. However, maintaining consistency in it may be difficult. Thus, what is best varies according to a person's state. The purpose of these regular practices is to purify the heart, cleanse it, and adorn it with the remembrance of God Almighty, and to find intimacy with Him. Therefore, let the seeker look to his heart: whatever he finds has the strongest effect upon it, let him be consistent in it. If he senses weariness from it, then let him move to another. For this reason, we see the most correct course for most people is to distribute these various good deeds across times, as previously mentioned, and to transition from one type to another, for weariness generally dominates human nature. The states of a single person also vary in this. But if one understands the jurisprudence and secret of these practices, then let him follow the meaning. For instance, if he hears a glorification and feels its impact on his heart, let him persist in repeating it as long as he finds impact from it. It is narrated from Ibrahim ibn Adham, from one of the righteous substitutes, that he stood one night praying on the seashore and heard a loud voice glorifying, but saw no one. He said, "Who are you? I hear your voice but do not see your person." It replied, "I am an angel from the angels entrusted with this sea. I have been glorifying God Almighty with this glorification since I was created." He said, "I asked, 'What is your name?' It said, 'Mihlaya'il.' I asked, 'What is the reward for one who says it?' It said, 'Whoever says it one hundred times will not die until he sees his place in Paradise, or it is seen for him.'" And the glorification is saying: "Glory be to God, the Most High, the Judge. Glory be to God, the Strong of Pillars. Glory be to Him who takes away the night and brings the day. Glory be to Him whom no affair distracts from another affair. Glory be to God, the Compassionate, the Bestower. Glory be to God, the One glorified in every place." This and its like, when the seeker hears it and finds its impact in his heart, let him adhere to it. Whatever the heart finds with it and opens for him good therein, let him be consistent in it.

Second: The scholar who benefits people with his knowledge through legal rulings, teaching, or authorship—the arrangement of his regular practices differs from that of the worshipper. For he needs to study books, to author works, and to impart benefit, and he inevitably needs a duration for that. If he can devote all his times to it, it is the best thing for him to occupy himself with after the obligatory prayers and their regular supererogatories. All that we have mentioned in the book of knowledge regarding the virtue of teaching and learning indicates this. How could it be otherwise? For in knowledge is consistency in the remembrance of God Almighty and pondering what God Almighty and His Messenger have said, and in it is benefit for creation and guiding them to the path of the Hereafter. Many a single issue a student learns, through which the worship of his lifetime is rectified; had he not learned it, his striving would have been wasted. By the knowledge we mean that which is given precedence over worship is the knowledge that makes people desirous of the Hereafter and disinclines them from this world, or the knowledge that aids them in traversing the path of the Hereafter when they learn it with the intention of seeking help through it for the journey, not the sciences that increase desire for wealth, status, and the acceptance of people. It is most fitting for the scholar to also divide his times. For devoting all times to organizing knowledge is not bearable by human nature. Thus, he should designate the time after dawn until sunrise for remembrances and regular practices, as we mentioned in the first practice. After sunrise until mid-morning, for imparting benefit and teaching, if he has someone to benefit for the sake of the Hereafter; if not, he spends it in reflection, contemplating what is ambiguous to him from the religious sciences. For the clarity of the heart after finishing remembrance and before engaging in worldly concerns aids in discerning difficult matters. From mid-morning until afternoon, for authorship and study, not leaving it except for times of eating, purification, obligatory prayer, and a light nap if the day is long. From afternoon until dusk, he occupies himself with listening to what is recited before him of exegesis, hadith, or beneficial knowledge.

The yellowing towards sunset is occupied with remembrance, seeking forgiveness, and glorification, so his first litany before sunrise is in the work of the tongue, and his second litany in the work of the heart through reflection until mid-morning, and his third litany until afternoon in the work of the eye and hand through study and writing, and his fourth litany after afternoon in the work of hearing to give rest therein to the eye and hand, for study and writing after the afternoon may harm the eye. At the yellowing, he returns to the remembrance of the tongue, so no portion of the day is devoid of work for him with the limbs, with the heart's presence in all. As for the night, the best division therein is the division of Al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him, for he would divide the night into three parts: a third for study and arranging knowledge, and it is the first; a third for prayer, and it is the middle; and a third for sleep, and it is the last. This is facilitated in winter nights, and in summer perhaps it is not tolerable except if most sleep is during the day. This is what we deem preferable from arranging the litanies of the scholar.

Third: The learner and being occupied with learning is better than being occupied with remembrances and supererogatory acts, so his ruling is the ruling of the scholar in arranging the litanies, but he occupies himself with benefiting where the scholar occupies himself with imparting benefit, and with annotation and copying where the scholar occupies himself with authorship, and he arranges his times as we mentioned. All that we have mentioned in the virtue of learning and knowledge from the Book of Knowledge indicates that this is better. Indeed, even if one is not a learner in the sense that he annotates and acquires to become a scholar, but was from the common folk, then his attendance at gatherings of remembrance, admonition, and knowledge is better than his occupation with the litanies we mentioned after dawn and after sunrise and at other times. For in the hadith of Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him: "Attendance at a gathering of remembrance is better than praying a thousand rak'ahs, attending a thousand funerals, and visiting a thousand sick." And He, peace be upon him, said: "When you see the gardens of Paradise, graze therein." It was said: "O Messenger of God, what are the gardens of Paradise?" He said: "The circles of remembrance." And Ka'b al-Ahbar, may God be pleased with him, said: "If the reward of the gatherings of the scholars became apparent to the people, they would fight over it until every person of authority leaves his authority and every person of the market leaves his market." And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, said: "Indeed, a man may leave his house with sins upon him like the mountains of Tihamah, then if he hears a scholar, he fears and turns back from his sins and returns to his house with no sin upon him. So do not abandon the gatherings of the scholars, for God, Mighty and Majestic, has not created on the face of the earth a soil more noble than the gatherings of the scholars." And a man said to Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him: "I complain to you of the hardness of my heart." He said: "Bring it near to the gatherings of remembrance." And 'Ammar al-Zahidi saw Al-Miskinah al-Tufawiyyah in a dream, and she was among those who regularly attended the circles of remembrance, so he said: "Welcome, O Miskinah." She said: "Far from it, far from it! Poverty has gone and wealth has come." He said: "Alas!" She said: "Do not ask about one for whom Paradise has been made lawful in its entirety." He said: "And by what is that?" She said: "By keeping company with the people of remembrance." And in summary, what is untied from the heart of the knots of love for this world by the saying of an admonisher with good speech and pure character is more noble and more beneficial than many rak'ahs while the heart encompasses the love of this world.

Fourth: The professional who needs to earn for his dependents, it is not for him to neglect the dependents and consume the times in acts of worship. Rather, his litany during the time of his craft is attendance at the market and occupation with earning, but he should not forget the remembrance of God, Exalted is He, in his craft. Rather, he should persist in glorifications, remembrances, and recitation of the Qur'an, for that can be combined with work. However, prayer with work is not facilitated except for one who is a lookout, for he is not incapable of establishing the litanies of prayer with it. Then, whenever he is free from his sufficiency, he should return to arranging the litanies. And if he persists in earning and gives in charity what is surplus to his need, it is better than all the other litanies we mentioned, because acts of worship whose benefit extends to others are more beneficial than those confined to oneself, and charity and earning with this intention are an act of worship for him in itself, drawing him nearer to God, Exalted is He. Then, benefit for others is attained by it, and the blessings of the supplications of the Muslims are drawn to him, and the reward is multiplied by it.

Fifth: The ruler, such as the Imam, the judge, and the one entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims, his fulfillment of the needs and purposes of the Muslims in accordance with the Sacred Law and with the intention of sincerity is better than the mentioned litanies. So his right is that he occupies himself with the rights of the people by day and confines himself to the obligatory prayers and establishes the mentioned litanies by night, as 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to do when he said: "What have I to do with sleep? If I slept by day, I would neglect the Muslims, and if I slept by night, I would neglect myself." And we have understood from what we mentioned that two matters take precedence over bodily acts of worship: one is knowledge, and the other is kindness to the Muslims, for each of knowledge and doing good

An act performed within oneself and a form of worship that surpasses other acts of devotion, whose benefit extends and its efficacy spreads, thus both are given precedence. The sixth: The monotheist utterly absorbed in the One, the Eternal, for whom his morning and his concerns are a single concern. He loves none but God Almighty, fears none but Him, expects provision from no other, and looks upon nothing without seeing God Almighty within it. Whoever's rank ascends to this degree has no need for varying litanies and their differences; rather, his litany after the obligatory prayers is one: the presence of the heart with God Almighty in every state. Thus, no matter occurs to their hearts, no caller strikes their hearing, and no spectacle appears to their sight except that it becomes for them a lesson, a contemplation, and an increase. Nothing moves them nor stills them except God Almighty. For such people, all their states become a cause for their increase, so no act of worship is distinguished from another for them. They are those who have fled to God, the Mighty, the Majestic, as He has said: "That you might remember." So they fled to God, and His saying was realized in them: "And when you withdraw from them and that which they worship except God, then take refuge in the cave; your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy." And the allusion to this is in His saying: "Indeed, I am going to my Lord; He will guide me." This is the ultimate degree of the truthful, and it is not attained except after arranging litanies and persisting in them for a long time. Therefore, the seeker should not be deluded by what he hears of this and claim it for himself, thereby neglecting the duties of his worship. The sign of this is that no whisperer whispers in his heart, no sin occurs to his heart, the assaults of terrors do not agitate him, and momentous affairs do not startle him. How could this rank be granted to everyone? Thus, it is incumbent upon all to arrange litanies as we have mentioned. All that we have mentioned are paths to God Almighty. He said: "Say, 'Each works according to his manner, but your Lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way.'" So all are guided, and some are more guided than others. In the report: "Faith has thirty-three and three hundred paths; whoever meets God Almighty with the testimony on one of them enters Paradise." Some scholars said faith is three hundred and thirteen traits, according to the number of messengers. Every believer possessing one of these traits is traversing the path to God. Thus, people, even if their paths in worship differ, are all upon correctness: "Those are the ones who call, seeking a means to their Lord—which of them is nearest." They only differ in degrees of nearness, not in its essence. The nearest of them to God Almighty are the most knowledgeable of Him, and the most knowledgeable of Him must necessarily be the most devout to Him, for whoever knows Him does not worship other than Him. The foundation regarding litanies for every category of people is constancy, for the aim is to change the inner traits. Single acts have little effect, indeed their effects are scarcely felt; rather, the effect is established upon the aggregate. If a single act does not leave a perceptible effect and is not followed by a second and a third in closeness, the first effect is erased, akin to a jurist who wishes to be a jurist of the soul; he only becomes so through much repetition. If he were to exert himself one night in repetition and then leave it for a month or a week, then return and exert himself one night, this would not affect him. But if he distributed that amount over consecutive nights, it would affect him. For this secret, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The most beloved deeds to God are the most constant, even if little." Aisha, may God be pleased with her, was asked about the action of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and she said: "His action was continuous, and when he performed an action, he would establish it." Therefore, he, peace be upon him, said: "Whom God accustoms to a worship and he abandons it out of weariness, God detests him." This was the reason for his prayer after the afternoon prayer, making up for two rak'ahs he missed due to being occupied by the delegation. Then he continued to pray them after the afternoon prayer thereafter, but in his home, not in the mosque, so that others would not follow him in it, as narrated by Aisha and Umm Salamah, may God be pleased with them. If you say: Is it permissible for others to follow him in that, even though the time is a time of dislike? Know that the three meanings we mentioned for the dislike—avoiding resemblance to sun-worshippers, prostration at the time of the horn of Satan appearing, or resting from worship to avoid weariness—are not realized in his case, so no one else is compared to him in that. His action in the home, so that others would not follow him, peace be upon him, testifies to this.

(The Second Chapter: On the Facilitators for Standing the Night, the Nights It Is Recommended to Revive, the Virtue of Reviving the Night and What Is Between the Two Evening Prayers, and How to Divide the Night)
                        (The Virtue of Reviving What Is Between the Two Evening Prayers)
The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, as narrated by Aisha, may God be pleased with her: "The most excellent prayers in the sight of God is the Maghrib prayer; neither the traveler nor the resident neglects it. He began with it, then he performed the night prayer and concluded with it."

Whoever prays the Maghrib prayer and then prays two rak'ahs after it, Allah will build for him a palace in Paradise. The narrator said: I do not know if it is of gold or silver. And whoever prays four rak'ahs after it, his sins of twenty years—or he said forty years—are forgiven. Umm Salamah and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them, narrated from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: Whoever prays six rak'ahs after Maghrib, it is equivalent for him to worshipping a full year, or as if he prayed the Night of Decree. And from Sa'id ibn Jubayr, from Thawban, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Whoever confines himself between Maghrib and 'Isha' in a congregational mosque, speaking only for prayer or recitation of the Qur'an, it is a right upon Allah to build for him two palaces in Paradise, the distance of each being a hundred years' journey, and to plant for him between them such plantations that if the people of the world were to encircle them, it would accommodate them. And he, peace be upon him, said: Whoever bows ten times between Maghrib and 'Isha', Allah will build for him a palace in Paradise. So 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Then our palaces will multiply, O Messenger of Allah! He said: Allah is more abundant and better—or he said: more excellent.

And from Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: Whoever prays Maghrib in congregation, then prays two rak'ahs after it without speaking anything of worldly affairs between them, and recites in the first rak'ah: Al-Fatihah, ten verses from the beginning of Surah Al-Baqarah, two verses from its middle: "Your God is one God. There is no deity except Him, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate," up to the end of the verse, and "Say: He is Allah, the One" fifteen times, then bows and prostrates; then when he stands for the second rak'ah, he recites Al-Fatihah, the Verse of the Throne and the two verses after it up to His saying: "Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally," and three verses from the end of Surah Al-Baqarah from His saying: "To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth" to its end, and "Say: He is Allah, the One" fifteen times. The description of its reward in the hadith is beyond enumeration.

And Kurz ibn Wabarah, who is among the righteous substitutes, said: I said to Al-Khidr, upon him be peace: Teach me something to perform every night. He said: When you have prayed Maghrib, stand until the time of 'Isha' prayer, praying without speaking to anyone, and devote yourself to the prayer you are in, and give the salutation after every two rak'ahs. Recite in each rak'ah Al-Fatihah once and "Say: He is Allah, the One" three times. When you have finished your prayer, depart to your home and do not speak to anyone. Then pray two rak'ahs, reciting Al-Fatihah and "Say: He is Allah, the One" seven times in each rak'ah. Then prostrate after your salutation and seek forgiveness from Allah the Exalted seven times, and say: "Glory be to Allah, all praise is due to Allah, there is no deity except Allah, Allah is the Greatest, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great" seven times. Then raise your head from prostration and sit upright, raise your hands and say: "O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, O Possessor of Majesty and Honor, O God of the first and the last, O Merciful of this world and the Hereafter and their Compassionate, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Allah, O Allah, O Allah." Then stand while raising your hands and supplicate with this supplication. Then sleep wherever you wish, facing the qiblah on your right side, and send blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and persist in sending blessings upon him until sleep overtakes you. I said to him: I would love for you to tell me from whom you heard this. He said: I was present with Muhammad, peace be upon him, when this supplication was taught to him and revealed to him, and I was with him, and that was in my presence, so I learned it from the One who taught it to him. And it is said that this supplication and this prayer, whoever persists in them with good certainty and sincere intention, will see the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in his dream before departing from this world. Some people have done this and saw that they were admitted to Paradise, and saw therein the prophets, and saw therein the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and spoke to him and he taught him.

In summary, what has been reported concerning the virtue of reviving the time between the two evening prayers is abundant. It was even said to 'Ubaydullah, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: Did the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, command prayer other than the obligatory ones? He said: Between Maghrib and 'Isha'. And he, peace be upon him, said: Whoever prays between Maghrib and 'Isha', that is the prayer of the oft-returning. And Al-Aswad said: I never came to Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, at this time except that I saw him praying. I asked him, and he said: Yes, it is the hour of negligence. And Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, used to be consistent upon it and would say: It is the rising of the night. And he said concerning it was revealed the saying of the Exalted: "Their sides forsake their beds." And Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari said: I said to Abu Sulayman al-Darani: Is fasting the day and having supper between Maghrib and 'Isha' more beloved to you, or breaking the fast during the day and reviving what is between them? He said: Combine both. I said: If it is not feasible? He said: Break the fast and pray what is between them.

(The Virtue of Standing in Prayer at Night)
As for from the verses, then His saying, the Exalted: "Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand [in prayer] for nearly two-thirds of the night."

The verse and His saying, exalted is He: "Indeed, the vigil of the night is most potent for subjugation and most upright for speech." And His saying, glorified and exalted is He: "Their sides forsake their beds." And His saying, exalted is He: "Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night..." The verse and His saying, mighty and majestic is He: "And those who spend the night for their Lord, prostrating and standing." And His saying, exalted is He: "And seek help through patience and prayer." It is said this refers to standing in prayer at night; one seeks help through patience in it to strive against the self.

Among the narrations: His saying, peace be upon him: "Satan ties three knots at the back of the head of any one of you when he sleeps, striking each knot with 'You have a long night ahead, so sleep.' If he awakens and remembers God, exalted is He, one knot is undone. If he performs ablution, another knot is undone. If he prays, the third knot is undone, and he awakens energetic and cheerful; otherwise, he awakens lethargic and ill-tempered." In another narration: "A man was mentioned before him who sleeps the entire night until morning. He said, 'That is a man in whose ears Satan has urinated.'" In another narration: "Indeed, Satan has a snuff, a lick, and a powder. If he gives the servant the snuff, his character becomes bad; if he gives him the lick, his tongue becomes sharp with evil; and if he powders him, he sleeps the night until morning." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Two units of prayer a servant performs in the depths of the night are better for him than the world and all it contains. Were it not for the hardship it would impose on my community, I would have made them obligatory upon them." In the authentic collection from Jabir, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "There is an hour during the night; no Muslim servant asks God, exalted is He, for any good but that He grants it to him." In another version: "He asks God, exalted is He, for good of this world and the Hereafter, and that is in every night." And Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, stood in prayer until his feet cracked. It was said to him, 'Has not God forgiven you your past and future sins?' He said, 'Should I not then be a thankful servant?'" The apparent meaning indicates that this is an allusion to an increase in rank, for gratitude is a cause for increase. God, exalted is He, said: "If you are grateful, I will surely increase you." And he, peace be upon him, said: "O Abu Hurairah, do you wish for God's mercy to be upon you alive, dead, in the grave, and when resurrected? Rise at night and pray, desiring the pleasure of your Lord. O Abu Hurairah, pray in the corners of your house, and the light of your house in the heavens will be like the light of the planets and stars to the people of the world." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Adhere to standing in prayer at night, for it was the practice of the righteous before you. Indeed, standing at night is a means of nearness to God, mighty and majestic is He, an expiation for sins, a repeller of illness from the body, and a deterrent from sin." And he, peace be upon him, said: "There is no person who has a habit of prayer at night, then sleep overcomes him, except that the reward of his prayer is written for him, and his sleep is charity for him." And he, peace be upon him, said to Abu Dharr: "If you intended a journey, would you prepare provisions for it?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Then what about the journey of the path to the Resurrection? Shall I not inform you, O Abu Dharr, of what will benefit you on that Day?" He said, "Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you." He said, "Fast a day of intense heat for the Day of Resurrection, pray two units in the darkness of the night for the loneliness of the graves, perform Hajj for momentous affairs, and give charity to a poor person, or speak a word of truth you say, or refrain from a word of evil you keep silent about." It is narrated: "During the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him, there was a man who, when people took to their beds and eyes grew still, would rise to pray, recite the Quran, and say, 'O Lord of the Fire, grant me refuge from it.' This was mentioned to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, 'If that happens, inform me.' He came to him and listened. When morning came, he said, 'O so-and-so, why do you not ask God for Paradise?' He said, 'O Messenger of God, I am not worthy of that, and my deeds do not reach that.' It was not long before Gabriel, peace be upon him, descended and said, 'Inform so-and-so that God has granted him refuge from the Fire and admitted him to Paradise.'" It is narrated: "Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to the Prophet, peace be upon him, 'What an excellent man Ibn 'Umar is, if only he prayed at night.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, informed him of that, and thereafter he persisted in standing at night." Nafi' said: "He would pray at night, then say, 'O Nafi', have we reached the pre-dawn time?' I would say, 'No,' so he would stand for his prayer. Then he would say, 'O Nafi', have we reached the pre-dawn time?' I would say, 'Yes,' so he would sit and seek forgiveness from God, exalted is He, until dawn broke." And 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: "Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon them, ate his fill of barley bread and slept through his regular night prayer until morning. So God, exalted is He, revealed to him: 'O Yahya, have you found an abode better than My abode, or have you found neighbors better than My neighbors? By My might and majesty, O Yahya, if you were to glance once at Paradise, your fat would melt and your soul would depart out of longing. And if you were to glance once at Hell, your fat would melt, you would weep pus after tears, and you would wear skin after sackcloth.'" It was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "So-and-so prays at night, but when morning comes, he steals." He said, "What he does will deter him." And he, peace be upon him, said: "May God have mercy on a man who rises at night and prays, then awakens his wife and she prays. If she refuses, he sprinkles water on her face." And he, peace be upon him, said: "May God have mercy on a woman who rises at night and prays, then awakens her husband and he prays."

If he refuses, sprinkle water on his face. And He (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever wakes up at night and wakes his wife, and they pray two rak'ahs together, they will be recorded among the men and women who remember Allah much." And He (peace be upon him) said: "The best prayer after the obligatory ones is the night prayer." And 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever sleeps through his portion [of recitation] or part of it at night, then recites it between the Fajr and Dhuhr prayers, it will be recorded for him as if he had recited it at night."

Narrations: It is related that 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would come across a verse during his nightly recitation and would be so overcome he would fall down, and would be revisited by it for many days like an ailing person is revisited [by illness]. Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him), when eyes grew still, would stand [in prayer] and a humming sound like that of bees would be heard from him until dawn. It is said that Sufyan al-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on him) ate his fill one night and said, "If a donkey is given more fodder, its work is increased," so he stood in prayer that entire night until morning. Ta'us (may Allah have mercy on him), when he lay on his bed, would toss upon it as a seed tosses in a frying pan, then he would rise and pray until dawn, then say, "The bird that remembers Hell has made the worshippers' sleep fly away." Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "We know of no deed more strenuous than striving through the night and spending this wealth." He was asked, "Why are those who pray at night among the most beautiful of people in countenance?" He replied, "Because they secluded themselves with the Most Merciful, so He clothed them in light from His light." One of the righteous returned from a journey, a bed was prepared for him, and he slept on it until he missed his nightly portion. He then swore never to sleep on a bed again. 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Rawwad, when night enveloped him, would come to his bed, place his hand on it and say, "You are soft, and by Allah, in Paradise there is softer than you," and he would continue praying the entire night. Al-Fudayl said, "I face the night from its beginning and am daunted by its length, so I begin the Qur'an, and dawn arrives before I have satisfied my craving." Al-Hasan said, "A man may commit a sin and be deprived of the night prayer because of it." Al-Fudayl said, "If you are incapable of praying at night and fasting by day, know that you are deprived and your misdeeds have multiplied." Sila ibn Ashim (may Allah have mercy on him) would pray the entire night, and when dawn approached he would say, "My God, one like me does not seek Paradise, but save me by Your mercy from the Fire." A man said to one of the wise, "I am too weak for the night prayer." He replied, "O my brother, do not disobey Allah Almighty by day, and you will not have to stand by night." Al-Hasan ibn Salih had a slave-girl whom he sold to some people. In the depth of night, the girl stood and said, "O people of the house, prayer, prayer!" They said, "We have reached dawn, has the morning appeared?" She said, "Do you only pray the obligatory prayers?" They said, "Yes." She returned to al-Hasan and said, "O my master, you sold me to people who only pray the obligatory prayers. Take me back." So he took her back. Al-Rabi' said, "I spent many nights in the house of al-Shafi'i (may Allah be pleased with him), and he would sleep only a little at night." Abu al-Juwayriyah said, "I accompanied Abu Hanifah (may Allah be pleased with him) for six months, and not a single night did he lay his side on the ground." Abu Hanifah used to revive half the night. He passed by some people who said, "This man revives the entire night." He said, "I am ashamed to be described with what I do not do." After that, he revived the entire night. It is related that he had no bed at night. It is said that Malik ibn Dinar (may Allah be pleased with him) spent a night repeating this verse until morning: "Or do those who commit evils think We will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds?" [Qur'an 45:21]. Al-Mughirah ibn Habib said, "I observed Malik ibn Dinar. He performed ablution after the 'Isha' prayer, then stood at his prayer place, grasped his beard, and was choked by tears. He kept saying, 'Malik's grey hairs are forbidden to the Fire. My God, You know the inhabitant of Paradise from the inhabitant of the Fire. So which of the two men is Malik, and which of the two abodes is Malik's abode?' He did not cease saying this until dawn appeared." And Malik ibn Dinar said, "One night I was overcome by desire and slept, missing my portion. In my dream, I saw a maiden of the most beautiful form, and in her hand was a note. She said, 'Can you read well?' I said, 'Yes.' She handed me the note, and on it was written:
    Have delights and wishes distracted you
    From the fair, youthful maidens in the Gardens?
    You would live eternally, with no death therein,
    And sport in the Gardens with the beautiful ones.
    Awaken from your slumber, for better
    Than sleep is vigil with the Qur'an."
It is said that Masruq performed Hajj and not a single night did he spend except in prostration. It is related from Azhar ibn Mughith, who was among those who stood in prayer, that he said, "I saw in a dream a woman unlike the women of this world. I said to her, 'Who are you?' She said, 'A houri.' I said, 'Marry yourself to me.' She said, 'Ask for my hand from my Master, and pay my dowry.' I said, 'And what is your dowry?' She said, 'Lengthy night vigil.'" Yusuf ibn Mihran said, "It reached me that beneath the Throne is an angel in the form of a rooster, its claws of pearl and its comb of green emerald. When the first third of the night passes, it strikes its wings and crows, saying, 'Let those who stand rise.' When half the night passes, it strikes its wings and crows, saying, 'Let those who pray in the night rise.'"

Two-thirds of the night have passed, it beats its wings and crows, saying, "Let the worshippers rise." Then, when dawn appears, it beats its wings and crows, saying, "Let the heedless rise, burdened with their sins." It is said that Wahb ibn Munabbih al-Yamani did not lay his side upon the ground for thirty years, and he would say, "To see a devil in my house is more beloved to me than to see a cushion, for it invites sleep." He had a leather pillow; when sleep overcame him, he would place his chest upon it, doze for a few moments, then rouse himself for prayer. Some have said: "I saw the Lord of Majesty in a dream and heard Him say, 'By My might and glory, I shall honor the abode of Sulayman al-Taymi, for he prayed the morning prayer with the ablution of the evening prayer for forty years.'" It is related that his doctrine was that if sleep touches the heart, the ablution is invalidated. In some ancient scriptures, it is narrated from God, exalted is He, that He said: "Indeed, My servant who is truly My servant is he who does not await the crowing of the roosters for his rising."

(Explanation of the Means by Which Night Vigil is Facilitated)

Know that night vigil is difficult for creation, except for those granted success in fulfilling its facilitating conditions, both outwardly and inwardly. As for the outward conditions, they are four matters. First: Not to eat much, lest one drinks much, then sleep overcomes him and rising becomes burdensome. A certain shaykh would stand by the dining spread each night and say, "O assembly of seekers, do not eat much, lest you drink much, then sleep much, then regret much at death." This is the great foundation: lightening the stomach from the heaviness of food. Second: Not to exhaust oneself during the day with works that weary the limbs and weaken the nerves, for that also induces sleep. Third: Not to abandon the midday nap, for it is a practice to aid in night vigil. Fourth: Not to accumulate sins during the day, for that hardens the heart and veils it from the means of mercy. A man said to al-Hasan, "O Abu Sa'id, I retire in good health, I desire night vigil, and I prepare my purification, so why do I not rise?" He replied, "Your sins have shackled you." When al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, entered the market and heard their clamor and idle talk, he would say, "I think the night of these people is an evil night, for they do not take the midday rest." Al-Thawri said, "I was deprived of night vigil for five months due to a sin I committed." It was asked, "What was that sin?" He said, "I saw a man weeping and said to myself, 'This is showing off.'" Someone said, "I entered upon Kurz ibn Wabrah while he was weeping, so I said, 'Has news of a family member's death reached you?' He said, 'More severe.' I said, 'A pain afflicts you?' He said, 'More severe.' I said, 'Then what is it?' He said, 'My door is closed, my curtain is drawn, and I did not recite my portion last night, and that is only due to a sin I have newly committed.'" This is because good calls to good and evil calls to evil, and a little of each leads to much. Therefore, Abu Sulayman al-Darani said, "No one misses a congregational prayer except due to a sin." He also said, "Nocturnal emission is a punishment, and major impurity thereafter." Some scholars said, "O poor one, when you fast, consider with whom you break your fast and upon what you break it, for a servant may eat a morsel and his heart turns from what it was upon, never returning to its former state." All sins engender hardness of heart and prevent night vigil, the most effective of them being consumption of the unlawful. A lawful morsel affects the purification of the heart and its inclination to good in a way nothing else does, as known by those who observe hearts through experience, after the legal proof for it. Therefore, some said, "How many a morsel has prevented a night's vigil, and how many a glance has prevented the recitation of a chapter? Indeed, a servant may eat a morsel or commit an act and thereby be deprived of a year's vigil." Just as prayer forbids indecency and wrong, so too does indecency forbid prayer and all other good deeds. A jailer said, "I was a jailer for over thirty years. I would ask every person arrested at night if he had prayed the evening prayer in congregation, and they would say, 'No.'" This alerts us that the blessing of congregation forbids indulgence in indecency and wrong.

(As for the inward facilitators, they are four matters.)

First: Soundness of the heart from malice toward Muslims, from innovations, and from excessive worldly concerns. One absorbed in managing worldly affairs finds vigil difficult, and if he does rise, he only reflects in his prayer upon his preoccupations, and his thoughts wander only among his whisperings. Concerning this, it is said:
    The doorman informs me that you are asleep,
    And when you are awake, you are also asleep.
Second: A dominant fear that takes hold of the heart, coupled with short hope. For when one reflects on the terrors of the Hereafter and the depths of Hell, his sleep flees and his caution becomes great, as Tawus said, "The mention of Hell makes the sleep of the worshippers take flight." As narrated, a youth in Basra named Suhayb used to stand in prayer the entire night. His mistress said to him...

Your standing in prayer at night harms your work during the day." It was said, "Indeed, when Suhayb remembers the Fire, sleep does not come to him."
And it was said to another youth who would stand in prayer the entire night, and he replied, "When I remember the Fire, my fear intensifies, and when I remember Paradise, my longing intensifies, so I am unable to sleep." And Dhu al-Nun al-Misri, may God have mercy on him, said:
The Qur'an, with its promise and its threat, prevented
The pupils of eyes in their night from slumbering.
They understood from the Majestic King His speech,
So their necks were humbled, submitting to Him.
And they also recited:
O you of prolonged slumber and heedlessness!
Abundant sleep bequeaths regrets.
Verily, in the grave, if you descend to it,
Is a slumber that lengthens after death,
And a bed made ready for you therein,
With sins you committed or good deeds.
Did you feel secure from the assault of the Angel of Death?
And how many a secure one has been seized by a sudden assault!
And Ibn al-Mubarak said:
When the night grew dark, they endured it,
And it brightened upon them while they were bowing.
Fear drove away their sleep, so they stood,
While the people of security in the world are slumbering.

The third: That one knows the merit of standing in prayer at night by hearing the verses, reports, and narrations, until his hope and longing for its reward become firmly established within him. Thus, longing stirs him to seek increase and desire for the degrees of Paradise. As it was narrated that one of the righteous returned from his military expedition. His wife prepared his bed and sat waiting for him. He entered the mosque and did not cease praying until dawn. His wife said to him, "We were waiting for you for a period, and when you arrived, you prayed until morning." He said, "By God, I was contemplating a houri from the houris of Paradise the entire night, so I forgot my wife and my home, and I stood my entire night longing for her."

The fourth: And it is the noblest of motives: Love for God and strength of faith that during his standing [in prayer] he does not utter a word except that he is in intimate discourse with his Lord, and He is watching over him, along with witnessing what passes through his heart, and that those passing thoughts from God Almighty are a discourse with him. So when he loves God Almighty, he inevitably loves seclusion with Him and delights in intimate discourse. Thus, the delight of intimate discourse with the Beloved carries him through the length of the standing [in prayer]. And one should not deem this delight improbable, for both intellect and transmitted tradition bear witness to it. As for the intellect, let one consider the state of one who loves a person due to his beauty, or a king due to his favor and wealth—how he delights in seclusion and intimate discourse with him, to the point that sleep does not come to him his entire night.

If you say: "The beautiful one is delighted in by looking at him, and God Almighty is not seen." Then know that if the beloved beautiful one were behind a veil or in a dark house, the lover would still delight in his mere proximity, without looking and without hoping for anything else besides him. And he would take pleasure in expressing his love to him and mentioning him with his tongue within his hearing, even if that were also known to him.

If you say: "He awaits his reply, so let him delight in hearing his reply, and he does not hear the speech of God Almighty." Then know that if he knows He will not answer him and remains silent towards him, there still remains for him a delight in presenting his states to Him and raising his innermost secret to Him. How much more so when the one of certainty hears from God Almighty everything that occurs to his mind during his intimate discourse, and delights in it. Likewise, one who secludes himself with a king and presents his needs to him in the darkness of the night delights in it, hoping for his favor. And hope in relation to God Almighty is truer, and what is with God is better, more lasting, and more beneficial than what is with others. So how could he not delight in presenting his needs to Him in the seclusions?

As for the transmitted tradition, the states of those who stand in prayer at night bear witness to it, in their delight in the night prayer and their considering it short, just as a lover considers the night of union with the beloved short. So much so that it was said to one of them, "How are you with the night?" He said, "I have never observed it showing me its face and then departing, nor have I contemplated it since." And another said, "The night and I are two racehorses; sometimes it outruns me to the dawn, and sometimes it cuts me off from thought." And it was said to another, "How is the night for you?" He said, "An hour in which I am between two states: I rejoice in its darkness when it comes, and I grieve at its dawn when it rises. My joy in it has never been complete." And 'Ali ibn Bakkar said, "For forty years, nothing has grieved me except the rising of dawn." And al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said, "When the sun sets, I rejoice in the darkness for my seclusion with my Lord, and when it rises, I grieve at the entry of people upon me." And Abu Sulayman said, "The people of the night in their night have more delight than the people of diversion in their diversion, and were it not for the night, I would not love to remain in this world." He also said, "If God compensated the people of the night for the reward of their deeds with what they find of delight, that would be more than the reward of their deeds." And one of the scholars said, "There is no time in this world that resembles the bliss of the people of Paradise except what the people of intimate discourse find in their hearts at night from the sweetness of intimate discourse." And another said, "The delight of intimate discourse is not from this world; it is only from Paradise. God Almighty has manifested it for His close friends; none find it except them." And Ibn al-Munkadir said, "Nothing remains of the delights of this world except three: standing in prayer at night, meeting the brothers, and the prayer."

In the congregation. Some of the knowers of God said: Verily, God the Exalted looks during the late night hours at the hearts of those who are awake and fills them with lights, so benefits descend upon their hearts and they become illuminated. Then these benefits spread from their hearts—the wholesome gifts—to the hearts of the heedless. And some of the scholars among the ancients said: God the Exalted revealed to one of the truthful ones: "Indeed, I have servants among My servants whom I love and who love Me, who yearn for Me and I yearn for them, who remember Me and I remember them, who look to Me and I look to them. If you follow their path, I will love you, and if you turn away from them, I will detest you." He said, "O Lord, and what is their mark?" He said, "They watch over the shadows by day as a shepherd watches over his flock, and they yearn for sunset as birds yearn for their nests. When night envelops them and darkness mingles, and every lover is alone with their Beloved, they set their feet firmly toward Me, they prostrate their faces before Me, they commune with Me through My words, and they entreat Me through My favors. Among them is one crying out and weeping, and another sighing and complaining. With My eye I see what they endure for My sake, and with My ear I hear what they complain of for My love. The first thing I grant them is that I cast from My light into their hearts, so they speak of Me as I speak of them. The second: were the seven heavens and the seven earths and all that is in them placed in their scales, I would deem it too little for them. The third: I turn My face toward them. Do you see one upon whom I have turned My face—does anyone know what I intend to bestow upon him?" And Malik ibn Dinar, may God have mercy on him, said: "When a servant rises to pray during the night, the Majestic and Mighty draws near to him." And they used to perceive what they found of tenderness and sweetness in their hearts and the lights as a result of the nearness of the Lord the Exalted to the heart. This has a secret and a reality, an allusion to which will come in the Book of Love. And in the reports from God, Mighty and Majestic is He: "O My servant, I am God who has drawn near to your heart and in the unseen has seen My light." And a certain disciple complained to his master about the length of staying awake at night and sought a means to bring about sleep. His master said: "O my son, indeed God has breaths of mercy in the night and day that reach the awake hearts but miss the sleeping hearts. So make yourself present for those breaths." He said, "O my master, you have left me unable to sleep by night or by day."

Know that these breaths of mercy at night are more hopeful because of the clarity of heart and removal of distractions in the night vigil. In the sound report from Jabir ibn 'Abdullah from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, he said: "There is an hour during the night; no Muslim servant asks God the Exalted for any good in it but that He grants it to him." In another narration: "He asks God for good from the affairs of this world and the Hereafter but that He grants it to him, and that is every night." What those who stand in prayer seek is that hour, and it is significant within the totality of the night like the Night of Decree in the month of Ramadan and like the hour on Friday. It is the hour of the mentioned breaths of mercy, and God knows best.

Explanation of the methods for dividing the parts of the night: Know that reviving the night in terms of quantity has seven levels. The first: Reviving the entire night. This is the state of the strong ones who have devoted themselves to the worship of the night and delighted in communion with Him, and it has become nourishment for them and life for their hearts, so they are not wearied by long standing in prayer, and they defer sleep to the daytime, during the time when people are occupied. This was the way of a group of the predecessors; they would pray the dawn prayer with the ablution of the evening prayer. Abu Talib al-Makki narrated that this was reported through widespread and well-known transmission from forty of the Followers, and among them were those who persisted in it for forty years. He mentioned among them: Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and Safwan ibn Sulaym of Medina; al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad and Wahib ibn al-Ward of Mecca; Tawus and Wahb ibn Munabbih of Yemen; al-Rabi' ibn Khuthaym and al-Hakam of Kufa; Abu Sulayman al-Darani and 'Ali ibn Bakkar of Syria; Abu 'Abdullah al-Khawwas and Abu 'Asim al-'Abadi; Habib Abu Muhammad and Abu Jabir al-Sulmani of Persia; Malik ibn Dinar, Sulayman al-Taymi, Yazid al-Raqashi, Habib ibn Abi Thabit, and Yahya al-Bakka' of Basra; and Kahmas ibn al-Minhali, who would complete the Qur'an ninety times a month, and what he did not understand he would return to and read again. Also from the people of Medina: Abu Hazim and Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, among a group whose number is great. The second level: That one stands for half the night. Those among the predecessors who were constant in this are innumerable. The best in this is to sleep the first third of the night and the last sixth of it, so that his standing occurs in the depth and middle of the night, for that is most excellent. The third level: That one stands for a third of the night. He should sleep the first half and the last sixth. In summary, sleep at the end of the night is beloved because it removes drowsiness in the morning. They used to dislike that and it lessens the pallor of the face and notoriety for it. So if one stood for most of the night and slept during the pre-dawn hours, the pallor of his face would be less and his drowsiness would be less. And 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God..."

If he performs the Witr prayer at the end of the night, then if he has a need for his wives, he draws near to them; otherwise, he reclines in his place of prayer until Bilal comes to give the call to prayer. She also said, may God be pleased with her: "I never found him after the pre-dawn hour except sleeping." So much so that some of the early generations said this reclining before dawn is a practice, among them Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him. Sleep at this time is a cause for unveiling and witnessing from behind the veils of the unseen, and that is for the possessors of hearts. In it is a rest that aids in performing the first portion of the day's litanies and standing in prayer for a third of the night from the latter half, and sleeping the final sixth is the practice of David, peace be upon him.

The Fourth Degree: To stand in prayer for a sixth or a fifth of the night, and the best of it is in the latter half and before the final sixth of it.

The Fifth Degree: To not observe a fixed measure, for that is only feasible for a prophet to whom revelation comes, or for one who knows the stations of the moon and appoints someone to watch it and be diligent with him and wake him. Then perhaps it may be disturbed on cloudy nights, but he stands from the beginning of the night until sleep overcomes him. When he awakens, he stands, and if sleep overcomes him, he returns to sleep. Thus, for him in the night are two sleeps and two standings in prayer. This is from striving through the night and is among the most strenuous and best of works. This was from the character of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and it is the way of Ibn 'Umar and the most resolute of the Companions and a group of the Followers, may God be pleased with them. Some of the early generations would say, "It is the first sleep; if I awaken then return to sleep, may God not give sleep to my eyes." As for the standing of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in terms of quantity, it was not upon a single order. Rather, sometimes he would stand half the night, or a third of it, or a sixth of it; that would differ on various nights. His statement, the Exalted, in the two places in Surah al-Muzzammil indicates this: "Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand [in prayer] almost two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or a third of it." "Almost two-thirds of the night" is as if describing it, and half of its sixth. If the words "and half of it and a third of it" are read in the accusative, it is half of the two-thirds, bringing it close to a third and a quarter. If read in the nominative, it is half the night. 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "He, peace and blessings be upon him, would stand when he heard the crier," meaning the rooster, and this is the sixth or less. More than one has narrated that he said: "I observed the prayer of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, during a journey at night. He slept after the 'Isha' prayer for a time, then awoke and looked at the horizon and said, 'Our Lord, You did not create this in vain' until he reached 'Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise.' Then he took a toothstick from his bedding, cleaned his teeth with it, performed ablution, and prayed until I said he has prayed as long as he slept. Then he reclined until I said he has slept as long as he prayed. Then he awoke and said what he said the first time and did what he did the first time."

The Sixth Degree: It is the least, to stand for the amount of four rak'ahs or two rak'ahs, or if purification becomes impossible for him, he sits facing the Qiblah for a while, occupied with remembrance and supplication, and it is written for him among those who stand the night by the mercy and bounty of God. It has come in the tradition: "Pray at night even if for the duration of milking a sheep." These are the methods of division, so let the aspirant choose for himself what he finds easiest. Where standing in the middle of the night becomes difficult for him, he should not neglect reviving the time between the two evening prayers and the litany after 'Isha', then he stands before dawn at the time of the pre-dawn hour, so dawn does not find him sleeping, and he stands at the two ends of the night. This is the Seventh Degree. Whenever consideration is given to the quantity, the ordering of these degrees is according to the length and shortness of the time. As for the Fifth and Seventh Degrees, quantity is not considered in them, so their order in precedence and sequence does not proceed upon the mentioned order, for the Seventh is not below what we mentioned in the Sixth, nor the Fifth below the Fourth.

(Explanation of the Virtuous Nights and Days)

Know that the nights specifically designated with increased virtue, in which the recommendation for night vigil is emphasized during the year, are fifteen nights. The aspirant should not be heedless of them, for they are seasons of goodness and places of trade. Whenever a trader is heedless of the seasons, he does not profit, and whenever an aspirant is heedless of the virtues of times, he does not succeed. Six of these nights are in the month of Ramadan: five in the odd-numbered nights of the last ten, for in them the Night of Decree is sought, and the night of the seventeenth of Ramadan, for it is the night whose morning is the Day of the Criterion, the day the two hosts met, on it was the Battle of Badr. Ibn al-Zubayr, may God have mercy on him, said it is the Night of Decree. As for the other nine: the first night of Muharram, the night of 'Ashura', the first night of Rajab, the night of its midpoint, and the night of the twenty-seventh of it, which is the night of the Ascension, and in it is a transmitted prayer. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "For the worshipper on this night are good deeds of a hundred years." So whoever prays on this night twelve rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah the Opening of the Book and a surah from the Qur'an, and gives the testimony of faith in each...

Perform two rak'ahs and conclude with the salutation of peace, then say: "Glory be to God, praise be to God, there is no god but God, and God is most great" one hundred times. Then seek God's forgiveness one hundred times, and send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ one hundred times, and supplicate for yourself whatever you wish concerning your worldly and religious affairs, and awaken fasting, for God will answer all his supplication unless he supplicates for something sinful. As for the night of the middle of Sha'ban, in it are one hundred rak'ahs, reciting in each rak'ah after the Opening Chapter the Chapter of Sincerity ten times—they would not abandon it as we have mentioned in the chapter on voluntary prayers—and the night of 'Arafah and the two nights of the two Eids. He ﷺ said: "Whoever revives the two nights of the two Eids, his heart will not die on the day when hearts die." As for the virtuous days, they are nineteen, and it is recommended to maintain the litanies therein: the day of 'Arafah, the day of 'Ashura', the twenty-seventh day of Rajab, which holds immense honor—Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: "Whoever fasts the twenty-seventh day of Rajab, God records for him the fasting of sixty months"—and it is the day on which God sent down Gabriel, peace be upon him, to Muhammad ﷺ with the message; and the seventeenth day of Ramadan, which is the day of the Battle of Badr; and the middle day of Sha'ban; and the day of Friday; and the two days of the two Eids. And the known days, which are the ten of Dhul-Hijjah, and the numbered days, which are the days of Tashriq. It has been reported from Anas from the Messenger of God ﷺ that he said: "If Friday is safe, the days are safe, and if Ramadan is safe, the year is safe." Some scholars said: "Whoever takes it as a day of enjoyment in the five days in this world will not attain enjoyment in the Hereafter," meaning by it the two Eids, Friday, 'Arafah, and 'Ashura'. Among the virtuous days of the week are Thursday and Monday, in which deeds are raised to God Almighty. We have mentioned the merits of the months and days for fasting in the Book of Fasting, so there is no need for repetition, and God knows best, and may God send blessings upon every chosen servant from among all the worlds.

The Book of Litanies and the Merit of Reviving the Night. Chapter One: On the Excellence of Litanies.
[1] The hadith: "The servants of God most beloved to God are those who observe the sun, the moon, and the crescents for the remembrance of God"—narrated by al-Tabarani and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound, from the hadith of Ibn Abi Awfa with the wording: "The best of God's servants."
[2] The hadith on praying the two rak'ahs of dawn at home—agreed upon from the hadith of Hafsa.
[3] The hadith on supplication after the two rak'ahs of dawn: "O God, I ask You for mercy from You..."—mentioned earlier.
[4] The hadith on walking to prayer with tranquility—agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurairah.
[5] The hadith on the transmitted supplication for entering the mosque—mentioned earlier in Chapter Five of the Remembrances.
[6] The hadith on praying dawn in darkness—agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah.
[7] The hadith of Anas: "Whoever performs ablution, then proceeds to the mosque and prays therein, for every step he takes is a good deed, and a sin is erased, and the good deed is multiplied tenfold. And if he prays, then departs at sunrise, for every hair on his body a good deed is recorded for him, and he returns with an accepted pilgrimage. If he sits until he prays, for every rak'ah a thousand thousand good deeds are recorded for him. And whoever prays the night prayer, for him is the like of that, and he returns with an accepted pilgrimage"—I did not find a source for this narration. In Shu'ab al-Iman by al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain: "And whoever prays Maghrib in congregation, for him is like an accepted pilgrimage and an accepted 'Umrah."
[8] The hadith of Abu Hurairah: "We used to consider our going out and sitting in the gathering at this hour equivalent to a campaign in the path of God"—I have not found a source for it.
[9] The hadith of 'Ali: "The Messenger of God ﷺ came to me and Fatimah while we were sleeping and said: 'Will you not pray?' 'Ali said: I said, 'O Messenger of God, our souls are in God's hand...'"—agreed upon.
[10] The hadith: "That I sit in a gathering where I remember God from the dawn prayer until sunrise is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves"—narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Anas, mentioned earlier in Chapter Three of Knowledge.
[11] The hadith: "He would, after praying dawn, sit in his prayer place until the sun rose"—and in some versions: "and pray two rak'ahs," meaning after sunrise—narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah without mention of the two rak'ahs, and al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas and graded it good: "Whoever prays Fajr in congregation, then sits remembering God Almighty until the sun rises, then prays two rak'ahs, for him is the reward of a complete, complete, complete pilgrimage and 'Umrah."
[12] The hadith of al-Hasan: "The Messenger of God ﷺ was, as is mentioned from the mercy of his Lord, that he said: 'O son of...'"

Adam, remember Me after the dawn prayer for an hour and after the afternoon prayer for an hour, and I will suffice you for what lies between them. Ibn al-Mubarak reported this in al-Zuhd as a mursal tradition.

[13] The hadith about beginning supplication with "Glory be to my Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Bestower" has preceded.

[14] The hadith concerning the merit of repeating "There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise. He gives life and causes death, and He is the Living who does not die. In His hand is all good, and He has power over all things" has preceded from the narration of Abu Ayyub, repeating it ten times, excluding the phrase "He gives life and causes death... In His hand is all good." For it is reported by al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah from the narration of Abu Dharr, excluding "and He is the Living who does not die." All of these are found in al-Bazzar from the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf regarding what is said in the morning and evening. The repetition of it one hundred and two hundred times has preceded, and al-Tabarani has the supplication from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, repeating it one thousand times, though its chain is weak.

[15] The hadith concerning the merit of repeating "Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is the Greatest, and there is no power nor strength except with Allah" was reported by al-Nasa'i in al-Yawm wa al-Laylah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "Increase in the enduring righteous deeds," and he mentioned them.

[16] The hadith about repeating "Most Glorious, Most Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit" — I did not find it mentioned as repeated, but in Muslim from the narration of 'A'ishah, that he (peace be upon him) used to say it in his bowing and prostration, and it has preceded. And in al-Thawab by al-Shaykh from the narration of al-Bara', more than saying "Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit."

[17] The hadith about repeating "Glory be to Allah and by His praise" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever says that one hundred times in a day, his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea."

[18] The hadith about repeating "I seek forgiveness from Allah, besides whom there is no god, the Living, the Sustainer, and I ask Him for repentance" was reported by al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat from the narration of Mu'adh: "Whoever says it after dawn and after afternoon three times, his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea." Its wording includes "and I turn to Him," though it is weak. Similarly, al-Tirmidhi reported it from the narration of Abu Sa'id regarding saying it three times. Al-Bukhari has from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "I seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to Him more than seventy times a day," but al-Tabarani did not mention "more." Muslim has from the narration of the Bedouin: "I seek forgiveness from Allah one hundred times every day." These hadiths have preceded in the second chapter of the remembrances.

[19] The hadith about repeating "O Allah, there is no withholder of what You have given, and no giver of what You have withheld, and no possessor of fortune can avail against You" — I did not find its repetition in a hadith, but it is reported unconditionally following the prayers and upon rising from bowing.

[20] The hadith about repeating "There is no god but Allah, the Sovereign, the Manifest Truth" was reported by al-Mustaghfiri in al-Da'awat and al-Khatib in al-Ruwat 'an Malik from the narration of 'Ali: "Whoever says it one hundred times in a day will have security from poverty, security from the loneliness of the grave, will attract wealth, and will knock at the gate of Paradise." In it is al-Fadl ibn Ghanim, who is weak. Abu Nu'aym in al-Hilyah reports: "Whoever says that two hundred times every day and night, Allah will fulfill any need he asks in them." In it is Salim al-Khawwas, and he said regarding it, "I think it is from 'Ali."

[21] The hadith about repeating "In the name of Allah, with whose name nothing in the earth or the heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing" was reported by the authors of the Sunan, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the narration of 'Uthman: "Whoever says that three times when evening comes, no sudden calamity will befall him until morning; and whoever says it three times when morning comes, no sudden calamity will befall him until evening." Al-Tirmidhi said: "Good, authentic, rare."

[22] The hadith about repeating "O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant, Your prophet, and Your messenger, the unlettered prophet, and upon the family of Muhammad" was mentioned by Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahid al-Ghafiqi in Fada'il al-Qur'an from the narration of Ibn Abi Awfa: "Whoever wishes to die in the fourth heaven, let him say every day three times," and he mentioned it, but it is rejected. I say: The repetition in the morning and evening without this specific wording is reported by al-Tabarani from the narration of Abu al-Darda': "Whoever sends blessings upon me ten times when morning comes and ten times when evening comes, my intercession will reach him on the Day of Resurrection," though its chain is interrupted.

[23] Hadith on repeating "I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan. I seek refuge with Allah from the whisperings of the devils, and I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they be present." At-Tirmidhi reported it from the narration of Ma'qil ibn Yasar: "Whoever says in the morning three times: 'I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan,' and recites three verses from the end of Surah al-Hashr, Allah will appoint seventy thousand angels over him..." And whoever says it in the evening will have the same status. He (At-Tirmidhi) said: "Hasan Gharib." Ibn Abi ad-Dunya reported from the narration of Anas a similar hadith, preceded by a disconnected report: "Whoever says it in the morning ten times will be protected from Satan until dawn..." Abu ash-Sheikh reported in "Ath-Thawab" from the narration of 'A'ishah: "Shall I not teach you, O Khalid, words to say three times? Say: 'I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and His punishment, and from the evil of His servants, and from the whisperings of the devils and lest they be present.'" The hadith is with Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Hasan, and Al-Hakim, who authenticated it, concerning what is said upon alarm, without repeating it three times, from the narration of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr.

[24] Hadith on the virtue of Surah al-Fatihah. Al-Bukhari reported it from the narration of Abu Sa'id ibn al-Mu'alla that it is the greatest surah in the Qur'an. Muslim reported from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas concerning the angel who descended to earth and said to the Prophet (peace be upon him): "Rejoice in two lights you have been given which no prophet before you was given: the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) and the concluding verses of Surah al-Baqarah. You will not recite a single letter from them except that you will be granted it."

[25] Hadith on the virtue of Ayat al-Kursi. Muslim reported it from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b: "O Abu al-Mundhir, do you know which verse from the Book of Allah with you is the greatest?" I said: "Allah, there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence..." Al-Bukhari reported from the narration of Abu Hurayrah concerning his being entrusted with guarding the charity dates, and Satan coming to him, and his saying: "When you retire to your bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, for there will remain over you a protector from Allah..." In it, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "He has told you the truth, though he is a liar."

[26] Hadith on the virtue of the conclusion of Al-Baqarah. Agreed upon from the narration of Abu Mas'ud: "Whoever recites the two verses from the end of Surah al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him." The hadith of Ibn 'Abbas preceded it with a narration.

[27] Hadith on the virtue of "Shahida Allahu..." Abu ash-Sheikh and Ibn Hibban reported it in "Kitab ath-Thawab" from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud: "Whoever recites 'Shahida Allahu...' up to 'al-Islam,' then says: 'And I bear witness to what Allah has borne witness to, and I entrust Allah with this testimony, and it is a trust with Him for me,' he will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said: 'My servant, this one made a covenant with Me, and I am the most worthy to fulfill the covenant. Admit My servant into Paradise.'" In its chain is 'Umar ibn al-Mukhtar, who narrated falsehoods, as Ibn 'Adi said. The hadith of 'Ali will follow.

[28] Hadith on the virtue of "Qul allahumma malika al-mulk..." (the two verses). Al-Mustaghfiri reported it in "Ad-Da'awat" from the narration of 'Ali: "The Opening of the Book, Ayat al-Kursi, the two verses from Al 'Imran ('Shahida Allahu...' up to 'al-Islam'), and 'Qul allahumma malika al-mulk...' up to 'bi ghayri hisab' are suspended; between them and Allah there is no veil..." In it: "Allah said: 'No one among My servants recites them after every prayer except that I make Paradise his abode...'" In its chain is Al-Harith ibn 'Umayr. In his biography, Ibn Hibban mentioned him in "Ad-Du'afa'" and said: "Mawdu' (fabricated), it has no basis. Al-Harith narrates from reliable narrators fabricated narrations." I say: Hammad ibn Zayd, Ibn Ma'in, Abu Zur'ah, Abu Hatim, and An-Nasa'i declared him trustworthy, and Al-Bukhari reported from him in a suspended manner.

[29] Hadith on the virtue of "Laqad ja'akum rasulun min anfusikum..." to its end. At-Tabarani reported it in "Ad-Du'a'" from the narration of Anas with a weak chain: "The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) taught me what I guard myself with from every accursed Satan and every obstinate tyrant..." and he mentioned a hadith, at the end of which is: "...so say: 'Hasbiyallahu...' to the end of the surah." Abu al-Qasim al-Ghafiqi mentioned in "Fada'il al-Qur'an," in "Ragha'ib al-Qur'an" by 'Abd al-Malik ibn Habib, from the narration of Muhammad ibn Bakkar, that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever persists in reciting 'Laqad ja'akum rasulun min anfusikum...' to the end of the surah will not die by collapse, drowning, burning, or being struck by iron." It is weak.

[30] Hadith on the virtue of "Laqad sadaqa Allahu rasulahu ar-ru'ya bil-haqq..." I did not find a hadith specifically concerning it. However, concerning the virtue of Surah al-Fath, there is what Abu ash-Sheikh reported in his book from the narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b: "Whoever recites Surah al-Fath, it is as if he witnessed the conquest of Makkah with the Prophet (peace be upon him)." It is a fabricated hadith.

[31] Hadith on the virtue of "Al-hamdu lillahi alladhi lam yattakhidh waladan..." (the verse). Ahmad and At-Tabarani reported it from the narration of Mu'adh ibn Anas: "The verse of might is 'Al-hamdu lillahi alladhi lam yattakhidh waladan...' the entire verse." Its chain is weak.

[32] Hadith on the merit of five verses from the beginning of Surah al-Hadid: Abu al-Qasim al-Ghafiqi mentioned in the virtues of the Qur’an, from a narration of ‘Ali: “When you wish to ask Allah for a need, recite five verses from the beginning of Surah al-Hadid up to His words ‘All-Knower of what is in the breasts,’ and from the end of Surah al-Hashr from His words ‘Had We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain…’ to the end of the surah. Then say, ‘O You who are such-and-such, do such-and-such with me,’ and supplicate for what you want.”

[33] Hadith on the merit of three verses from the end of Surah al-Hashr: Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the narration of Ma‘qil ibn Yasar—and it has preceded before this—and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu‘ab from the narration of Abu Umamah with a weak chain: “Whoever recites the closing verses of Surah al-Hashr by night or by day and then dies that day or that night, Allah has made Paradise obligatory for him.”

[34] Hadith of Karaz ibn Wabrah, from the people of Syria, from Ibrahim al-Taymi: that al-Khidr taught him the ten ‘Muse‘abbaat’ and said at their end, “Muhammad (peace be upon him) gave them to me.” It has no basis, and no sound narration exists at all concerning al-Khidr meeting the Prophet (peace be upon him), nor his not meeting him, nor his being alive, nor his death.

[35] Hadith: “Verily, Allah has seventy veils of light…” The hadith has preceded in the Foundations of Beliefs.

[36] Hadith concerning his occupation with remembrances from dawn until sunrise: The hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah in Muslim has preceded concerning his (peace be upon him) sitting in his place after praying Fajr until the sun rose, but it contains no mention of his occupation with remembrance; rather, it is from his statement regarding what preceded from the hadith of Anas.

[37] Hadith: “He came out to his companions while they were praying at sunrise and called out with his loudest voice: ‘Indeed, the prayer of the oft-returning is when the young camels feel the heat (of the sand).’” Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam without the phrase “and called out with his loudest voice,” and it is in Muslim without mention of sunrise.

[38] Hadith: “Verily, the sun rises and with it is the horn of Satan; when it rises high, it leaves it.” It has preceded in the chapter on Prayer.

[39] Hadith concerning praying four rak‘ahs after midday with one salutation, and that in it the gates of heaven are opened and it is an hour in which supplication is answered, so “I love that a righteous deed be raised up for me in it.” Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah transmitted it from the narration of Abu Ayyub, and it has preceded in the chapter on Prayer in the sixth book.

[40] Hadith: “The prayer of night and day is two by two.” Abu Dawud and Ibn Hibban transmitted it from the narration of Ibn ‘Umar.

[41] Hadith: “No blessing is bestowed upon me in a day in which I do not increase in good.” It has preceded in the chapter on Knowledge in the first book, except that he said “knowledge” instead of “good.”

[42] Hadith: He was asked about His words, the Exalted: “Their sides forsake their beds…” He said: “The prayer between the two evening prayers.” Then he said: “Upon you is the prayer between the two evening prayers, for it removes the day’s idle talk and refines its end.” The author said: Ibn Abi al-Zannad attributed it to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). I say: It is rather Isma‘il ibn Abi Ziyad, with the dotted Ya’. Abu Mansur al-Daylami narrated it in Musnad al-Firdaws from the narration of Isma‘il ibn Abi Ziyad al-Shami, from al-A‘mash: Abu al-‘Ala’ al-‘Anbari narrated to us from Salman, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: “Upon you is the prayer between the two evening prayers, for it removes the idle talk of the day’s beginning and refines its end.” This Isma‘il is abandoned; he fabricates hadith, as al-Daraqutni said. The name of Abu Ziyad is Muslim, and there is discrepancy concerning it from al-A‘mash. Ibn Mardawayh has from the narration of Anas that it was revealed concerning the prayer between Maghrib and ‘Isha’. The hadith is in al-Tirmidhi, and he graded it as good with the wording: “It was revealed concerning waiting for the prayer which is called al-‘Atamah.”

[43] Hadith: “Witr is thirteen rak‘ahs,” meaning at night, and that it is the most the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed at night. Abu Dawud transmitted it from the narration of ‘A’ishah: “He would not perform Witr with less than seven nor more than thirteen rak‘ahs.” And al-Bukhari from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas: “And his prayer was thirteen rak‘ahs,” meaning at night. And Muslim: “He would pray at night thirteen rak‘ahs.” In a narration of the two Shaykhs, among them are the two rak‘ahs of Fajr. And in both of them also: “He would not increase in Ramadan nor otherwise beyond eleven rak‘ahs.”

[44] Hadith concerning his (peace be upon him) frequent recitation of Ya-Sin, the prostration of Luqman, Surah al-Dukhan, Tabarak al-Mulk, and al-Zumar.

And the occurrence is unusual; I have not come across mention of its frequent recitation. Ibn Hibban, in a narration from Jundub: "Whoever recites Ya-Sin at night seeking the face of God, he is forgiven." Al-Tirmidhi, in a narration from Jabir: "He would not sleep until he recited Alif Lam Mim Tanzil (Surah As-Sajdah) and Tabarak alladhi biyadihi al-mulk (Surah Al-Mulk)." And from his narration from 'A'ishah: "He would not sleep until he recited Bani Isra'il (Surah Al-Isra') and Al-Zumar." He said: "It is hasan gharib." And from his narration from Abu Hurayrah: "Whoever recites Ha Mim Al-Dukhan (Surah Ad-Dukhan) at night, seventy thousand angels seek forgiveness for him at dawn." He said: "It is gharib." And for Abu al-Shaykh in "Al-Thawab," from a narration of 'A'ishah: "Whoever recites at night Alif Lam Mim Tanzil, Ya-Sin, and Tabarak alladhi biyadihi al-mulk, and Iqtarabat (Surah Al-Qamar), it will be a light for him," the hadith. And for Abu Mansur al-Muzaffar ibn al-Husayn al-Ghaznawi in "Fada'il al-Qur'an," from a narration of 'Ali: "O 'Ali, increase in reciting Ya-Sin," the hadith, and it is munkar. And for al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah, from a narration of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain: "Whoever recites Surah Al-Waqi'ah every night will never be afflicted by poverty." And al-Tirmidhi, from a narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "Surah Hud and Al-Waqi'ah have aged me," the hadith, and he said: "It is hasan gharib."

[45] Hadith: "He used to recite every night Surah As-Sajdah and Tabarak al-Mulk." And it preceded in the hadith before it.

[46] Hadith: "He used to recite every night Surah Al-Zumar and Bani Isra'il." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and it preceded in the hadith before it.

[47] Hadith: "He used to recite the Musabbihat every night and say: 'In them is a verse better than a thousand verses.'" Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi transmitted it, and he said: "It is hasan." And al-Nasa'i in "Al-Kubra," from a narration of 'Irbād ibn Sāriyah.

[48] Hadith: "He loved 'Sabbih isma rabbika al-a'la' (Surah Al-A'la)." Ahmad and al-Bazzar transmitted it from a narration of 'Ali with a weak chain.

[49] Hadith: "He used to recite in the three rak'ahs of Witr: 'Sabbih isma rabbika al-a'la,' 'Qul ya ayyuha al-kafirun,' and 'Al-Ikhlas.'" Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah transmitted it from a narration of Ubayy ibn Ka'b with a sound chain, and it preceded in the prayer from a narration of Anas.

[50] Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, enjoined me not to sleep except after performing Witr." Agreed upon, with the wording: "That I perform Witr before I sleep."

[51] Hadith: "The night prayer is two by two, and when you fear the dawn, perform Witr with one rak'ah." Agreed upon, from a narration of Ibn 'Umar.

[52] Hadith of 'A'ishah: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, performed Witr at the beginning of the night, the middle of it, and the end of it, and his Witr concluded at the pre-dawn time." Agreed upon.

[53] Hadith on the prohibition of breaking the Witr. The author said: "A prohibition is established in it." I say: It is only established from the statement of 'Abid ibn 'Amr, who had companionship, as narrated by al-Bukhari, and from the statement of Ibn 'Abbas, as narrated by al-Bayhaqi, and it is not explicitly stated that it is marfu' (attributed to the Prophet). Thus, it is apparent that he only intended what we mentioned from the Companions.

[54] Hadith: "There are not two Witr prayers in one night." Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it hasan, and al-Nasa'i transmitted it from a narration of Talaq ibn 'Ali.

[55] Hadith: "The two rak'ahs after Witr while sitting." It preceded in the prayer; Muslim transmitted it from a narration of 'A'ishah.

[56] Hadith: "He did not die until most of his prayer was performed sitting, except for the obligatory prayer." Agreed upon, from a narration of 'A'ishah: "When the Prophet, peace be upon him, became heavy-bodied and weighed down, most of his prayer was performed sitting."

[57] Hadith: "For the one sitting is half the reward of the one standing, and for the one lying down is half the reward of the one sitting." Al-Bukhari transmitted it from a narration of 'Imran ibn Husayn.

[58] Hadith: "It is said that if one sleeps in a state of purity while remembering God, Exalted is He, he is recorded as praying, and an angel enters his garment," the hadith. Ibn Hibban transmitted it from a narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever spends the night in purity, an angel spends the night in his garment, and he does not awaken except that the angel says: 'O God, forgive Your servant so-and-so, for he spent the night in purity.'"

[59] Hadith: "If one sleeps in a state of purity, his spirit is raised to the Throne." Ibn al-Mubarak transmitted it in "Al-Zuhd" as mawquf (attributed to a Companion) on Abu al-Darda', and al-Bayhaqi in "Al-Shu'ab" as mawquf on 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As. And al-Tabarani transmitted in "Al-Awsat" from a narration of 'Ali: "There is no male or female servant who sleeps and becomes heavy with sleep except that his spirit ascends to the Throne. Thus, the one who does not awaken except at the Throne, that is the true dream, and the one who awakens before reaching the Throne, that is the dream that is written." It is weak.

[60] Hadith: "The sleep of the scholar is worship, and his breath is glorification." I say: The well-known version is "the fasting person" instead of "the scholar."

And it has preceded in the chapter on fasting.

[61] A hadith: Mu'adh said to Abu Musa, "What do you do during the night prayer?" He replied, "I stand in prayer the entire night, not sleeping from it at all, and I complete the recitation of the Qur'an." Mu'adh said, "But I sleep, then I rise, and I seek reward in my sleep as I seek reward in my rising." This was mentioned to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, "Mu'adh is more insightful than you." Agreed upon in a similar manner from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and it does not contain that they mentioned that to the Prophet, peace be upon him, nor his saying, "Mu'adh is more insightful than you." Rather, Al-Tabarani added it, so Mu'adh was superior to him.

[62] A hadith: When a servant sleeps in a state of purity, his spirit ascends to the Throne, and his dream is truthful. The hadith has preceded.

[63] A hadith: That he would use the toothstick many times each night, at every sleep and upon awakening from it. It has preceded in the chapter on purification.

[64] A hadith: Whoever goes to his bed intending to rise and pray during the night, but his eyes overcome him until morning, what he intended is recorded for him, and his sleep is charity from God upon him. Narrated by Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Al-Darda' with a sound chain.

[65] A hadith: Whoever takes to his bed not intending to wrong anyone nor bearing a grudge against anyone, his misdeeds are forgiven. Narrated by Ibn Abi Al-Dunya in the Book of Intention from the hadith of Anas: "Whoever among you goes to bed not intending to wrong anyone, his misdeeds are forgiven." Its chain is weak.

[66] A hadith: Do not struggle against the night. Narrated by Abu Mansur Al-Daylami in Musnad Al-Firdaws from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain. And in the collection of Sufyan Al-Thawri, it is attributed to Ibn Mas'ud: "Do not contend with this night."

Narrated by Al-Nasa'i from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr without his saying, "This is my way, etc." This addition is from Ibn Khuzaymah: "Whoever turns away from my way is not of me." And it is agreed upon from the hadith of Anas.

[78] The reports concerning the shaking of the Throne and the spreading of winds from the Gardens of Eden in the last part of the night, and the descent of the Almighty to the lowest heaven. As for the hadith of the Descent, it has preceded. As for the remainder, they are narrations reported by Muhammad ibn Nasr in "Qiyam al-Layl" from the narration of Sa'id al-Jurayri, who said: Dawud said: "O Jibril, which part of the night is best?" He said: "I do not know, except that the Throne shakes at the time of *sahar* (the last third of the night)." And in another narration from him, from al-Jurayri from Sa'id ibn Abi al-Hasan, who said: "When it is the time of *sahar*, do you not see how the fragrance of every tree emanates?"

[96] Hadith: When you see the meadows of Paradise, graze therein. This hadith has preceded in the chapter on knowledge.
[97] Hadith: Faith consists of three hundred and thirty-three paths. Whoever meets Allah having borne witness to one of them enters Paradise. Reported by Ibn Shahin, al-Lalaka'i in al-Sunnah, al-Tabarani, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the narration of al-Mughirah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Ubayd from his father from his grandfather: "Faith is three hundred and thirty-three branches. Whoever fulfills one of them enters Paradise." Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi said: "Three hundred and thirty." There is obscurity in its chain.
[98] Hadith: The most beloved deeds to Allah are the most consistent, even if little. Muttafaq 'alayh from the hadith of 'A'ishah.
[99] Hadith: 'A'ishah was asked about the action of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. She said: "His action was consistent, and when he performed an action, he would adhere to it." Reported by Muslim.

[101] Hadith: A delegation preoccupied him from two rak'ahs, so he prayed them after 'Asr, then he continued to pray them after 'Asr in his home. Muttafaq 'alayh from the hadith of Umm Salamah that he prayed two rak'ahs after 'Asr and said: "People from 'Abd al-Qays preoccupied me from the two rak'ahs after Zuhr." And there is from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "He did not abandon them until he met Allah. The Prophet, peace be upon him, would pray them but not in the mosque, fearing it would become burdensome for his community. And Allah grants success to what is correct."
[102] Hadith of 'A'ishah: The most excellent prayer with Allah is the Maghrib prayer; it is not diminished for a traveler nor a resident. Reported by Abu al-Walid Yunus ibn 'Ubayd Allah al-Saffar in Kitab al-Salah, and al-Tabarani reported it concisely in al-Awsat, and its chain is weak.
[103] Hadith of Umm Salamah from Abu Hurayrah: Whoever prays six rak'ahs after Maghrib, it is equivalent for him to worshipping for a year, or as if he prayed on the Night of Decree. Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah with the wording: "twelve years." Al-Tirmidhi deemed it weak. As for his statement "as if he prayed on the Night of Decree," it is from the saying of Ka'b al-Ahbar, as reported by Abu al-Walid al-Saffar. And for Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: "Whoever prays four rak'ahs after Maghrib before speaking to anyone, a dwelling is placed for him in 'Illiyyin, and he is like one who attained the Night of Decree in al-Masjid al-Aqsa." Its chain is weak.
[104] Hadith of Sa'id ibn Jubayr from Thawban: Whoever confines himself between Maghrib and 'Isha' in a congregational mosque, speaking only for prayer or Qur'an, it is a right upon Allah to build for him two palaces in Paradise. I have not found a basis for it from this route. It has preceded in the chapter on prayer from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar.
[105] Hadith: Whoever bows ten rak'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha', Allah builds for him a palace in Paradise. 'Umar said: "Then our palaces will multiply, O Messenger of Allah?" Reported by Ibn al-Mubarak in al-Zuhd from the hadith of 'Abd al-Karim ibn al-Harith, mursal.
[106] Hadith of Anas: Whoever prays Maghrib in congregation, then prays two rak'ahs after it, and does not speak anything of worldly matters between them, and recites in the first rak'ah the Opening of the Book and ten verses from the beginning of al-Baqarah and two verses from its middle and "Your God is One God..." Reported by Abu al-Shaykh in al-Thawab from the narration of Ziyad ibn Maymun from him with slight variation, and it is weak.
[107] Hadith of Kurz ibn Wabarah: That al-Khidr taught him a prayer between Maghrib and 'Isha'. In it, Kurz asked al-Khidr: "From whom did you hear this?" He said: "I was present with Muhammad, peace be upon him, when he taught this supplication." This is baseless, without foundation.
[108] Hadith of 'Ubayd, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: It was said to him: "Did the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, command a prayer other than the obligatory ones?" He said: "Between Maghrib and 'Isha'." Reported by Ahmad, and in it is a man who is unnamed.
[109] Hadith: Whoever prays between Maghrib and 'Isha', that is the prayer of the oft-returning. This has preceded in the chapter on prayer.

[111] A man who slept until morning was mentioned in his presence. He said, "That is a man in whose ear Satan urinated." Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud.

[112] The hadith: "Indeed Satan has a snuff, a lick, and a powder..." Al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of Anas: "Indeed Satan has a lick and a kohl. When a person licks from his lick, his tongue becomes sharp with evil, and when he applies his kohl, his eyes sleep from remembrance." Al-Bazzar narrated it from the hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub, and their chains are weak.

[113] The hadith: "Two rak'ahs a servant prays in the depths of the night are better for him than the world and all it contains. Were it not that I would impose hardship on my community, I would have made them obligatory upon them." Adam ibn Abi Iyas narrated it in "Al-Thawab" and Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi in "The Book of Night Vigil" from the narration of Hassan ibn 'Atiyyah as mursal. Abu Mansur al-Daylami connected it in "Musnad al-Firdaws" from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar, and it is not authentic.

[114] The hadith of al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, stood (in prayer) until his feet became swollen..." Agreed upon.

[115] The hadith: "O Abu Hurayrah, do you wish for God's mercy to be upon you alive, dead, and in the grave? Rise at night and pray, seeking the pleasure of your Lord. O Abu Hurayrah, pray in the corners of your house, and the light of your house in the heavens will be like the light of the planets and stars." This is baseless, without origin.

[116] The hadith: "You must perform the night vigil, for it was the practice of the righteous before you..." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Bilal and said it is *gharib* and not authentic. Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Umamah with a *hasan* chain, and al-Tirmidhi said it is more authentic.

[117] The hadith: "There is no person who has a regular night prayer and is overcome by sleep concerning it, except that the reward of his prayer is written for him, and his sleep is charity for him." Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah. In it is a man who was not named; al-Nasa'i named him in the narration of al-Aswad ibn Yazid as so-and-so. However, in its chain is Ibn Ja'far al-Razi. Al-Nasa'i said he is not strong. Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of Abu al-Darda' similarly with a sound chain, and it preceded in the previous chapter.

[118] The hadith: "He said to Abu Dharr, 'If you intended a journey, you would prepare provisions for it. So what about the journey on the path of the Resurrection? Shall I not inform you, O Abu Dharr, of what will benefit you on that day?' He said, 'Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you.' He said, 'Fast a day of intense heat for the Day of Resurrection, and pray two rak'ahs in the darkness of the night for the loneliness of the graves...'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it in "The Book of Night Vigil" from the narration of al-Sari ibn Makhlad as mursal, and al-Azdi weakened al-Sari.

[119] The hadith: "During the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, there was a man who, when people took to their beds and eyes grew still, would stand to pray, recite the Qur'an, and say, 'O Lord of the Fire, save me from it.' This was mentioned to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and he said, 'If that is so, then inform me...'" I have not found a basis for it.

[120] The hadith: "Gabriel said to the Prophet, peace be upon him, 'What an excellent man Ibn 'Umar is, if only he prayed at night...'" Agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said that, and it contains no mention of Gabriel.

[121] The hadith: "It was said to him, 'So-and-so prays at night, but when morning comes, he steals.' He said, 'What he does will deter him.'" Ibn Hibban narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[124] The hadith: "The best prayer after the obligatory ones is the night vigil." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[125] The hadith of 'Umar: "Whoever sleeps through his portion [of Qur'an] or part of it, then recites it between the Fajr and Dhuhr prayers, it is recorded for him as if he recited it at night." Muslim narrated it.

[126] The hadith on seeking help through the midday nap for the night vigil... Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of...

Ibn Abbas, as previously mentioned.

[127] The hadith of Jabir: There is an hour during the night; no Muslim servant asks Allah for any good of this world or the Hereafter during it, except that He grants it to him. And this occurs every night. Narrated by Muslim.

[128] The hadith: When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prayed the Witr at the end of the night, if he had a need for his family, he would approach them; otherwise, he would recline in his place of prayer until Bilal came to him to give the call to prayer. Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Aisha: He would sleep at the beginning of the night and stay awake at its end. Then, if he had a need for his family, he would fulfill it, then sleep. And al-Nasa'i said: When it was the pre-dawn time, he would pray Witr, then come to his bed. If he had a need for his family... And for Abu Dawud: When he finished his prayer at the end of the night, he would look; if I was awake, he would talk to me, and if I was asleep, he would wake me and pray two rak'ahs, then recline until the caller to prayer came to announce the dawn prayer. Then he would pray two light rak'ahs, then go out to the prayer. And it is agreed upon with the wording: When he prayed, if I was awake, he would talk to me; otherwise, he would recline until the call to prayer was given. And Muslim said: When he prayed the two rak'ahs of Fajr.

[129] The hadith of Aisha: I never found him after the last part of the night except sleeping. Agreed upon with the wording: I never found the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in the last part of the night in my house or with me except sleeping. Al-Bukhari did not mention "the last part." And Ibn Majah said: I never found or encountered the Prophet, peace be upon him, at the end of the night except that he was sleeping with me.

[130] The hadith about his standing in prayer at the beginning of the night until sleep overcame him. Then when he awoke, he would stand, and if it overcame him, he would return to sleep. Thus, he would have two periods of sleep during the night. Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who graded it authentic, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Umm Salamah: He would pray and sleep for the duration of his prayer, then pray for the duration of his sleep, then sleep for the duration of his prayer until morning. And for al-Bukhari from the hadith of Ibn Abbas: He prayed the 'Isha, then came and prayed four rak'ahs, then slept, then stood... and in it: Then he prayed five rak'ahs, then prayed two rak'ahs, then slept until I heard his snoring... the hadith.

[131] The hadith: Sometimes he would stand for half the night, or a third of it, or two-thirds of it, or a sixth of it. Narrated by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Ibn Abbas: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, stood until the middle of the night, or a little before it, or a little after it... he awoke... the hadith. And in a narration of al-Bukhari: When the last third of the night came, he sat and looked at the sky... the hadith. And for Abu Dawud: He stood until when a third of the night or half of it had passed, he awoke... the hadith. For Muslim from the hadith of Aisha: Then Allah rouses him when He wills to rouse him during the night.

[132] The hadith of Aisha: He would stand when he heard the crier. Agreed upon.

[133] The hadith from more than one: I observed the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, during a night journey. He slept after 'Isha for a time, then awoke and looked at the horizon and said: "Our Lord, You did not create this in vain. Glory be to You!" until he reached: "Indeed, You do not fail in Your promise." Then he took a toothstick from his bedding, cleaned his teeth, performed ablution, and prayed until I thought he prayed as long as he slept. Then he reclined until I thought he slept as long as he prayed. Then he awoke and said what he said the first time and did what he did the first time... the hadith. Narrated by al-Nasa'i from the narration of Humayd ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf that a man from the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: I said while on a journey with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: By Allah, I will observe the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. And he mentioned something similar. And Abu al-Walid ibn Mughith narrated in the Book of Prayer from the narration of Ishaq ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Talhah that a man said: I will watch the prayer of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him. And he mentioned the hadith, and in it: He took his toothstick from behind the man. This indicates that it was also during a journey.

[134] The hadith: Pray during the night, even if only for the duration of milking a sheep. Narrated by Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Ibn Abbas concerning night prayer, raised to the Prophet: Half of it, a third of it, a quarter of it, the time it takes to milk a camel, the time it takes to milk a sheep. And for Abu al-Walid ibn Mughith from the narration of Iyas ibn Mu'awiyah, disconnected: There must be night prayer, even if for the milking of a camel or the milking of a goat.

And Muhammad ibn al-Fadl and Aban are very weak, and the hadith is rejected.

[136] The hadith: Whoever revives the two nights of the two Eids, his heart will not die on the day when hearts die. Narrated with a chain of transmission.

Weak, from the narration of Abu Umamah.

Narrated by Abu Musa al-Madini in his book "The Virtues of Nights and Days," from the narration of Shahr ibn Hawshab, from him.

It was narrated in its entirety by Ibn Hibban in "The Weak Ones" and Abu Nu'aym in "The Adornment," from the narration of 'A'ishah, and it is weak.
