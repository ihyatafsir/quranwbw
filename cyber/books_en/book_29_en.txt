The Book of Condemning Arrogance and Self-Admiration

This is the ninth book of the quarter on the soul's destroyers from the work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, the Creator, the Originator, the Fashioner, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Supreme, the Most High, whom no one can lower from His majesty, the Compeller before whom every tyrant is humbled and submissive, and every arrogant one in the presence of His grandeur is destitute and humble. He is the Subduer whom none can repel from His will, the Self-Sufficient who has no partner nor rival, the Omnipotent whose majesty and splendor dazzle the sight of all creation, whose majestic throne is subdued by His establishment, His exaltation, and His dominion. He has rendered the tongues of the prophets incapable of fully describing and praising Him, and He is exalted beyond the limit of their capacity to enumerate and comprehend Him. Thus, His angels and His prophets have confessed their inability to describe the essence of His majesty. He has broken the backs of the emperors with His might and grandeur, and He has shortened the reach of the Caesars with His greatness and pride. For grandeur is His garment and pride is His cloak, and whoever contends with Him in these, He breaks with the malady of death, whose cure is beyond reach. Exalted is His majesty and hallowed are His names. And blessings upon Muhammad, upon whom was sent down the light whose radiance is diffused, until the corners and regions of the world were illuminated by his light, and upon his family and companions, who are the beloved friends of God and His chosen ones, His elite and His purified ones. And may abundant peace be upon him.

Now then: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "God Almighty has said: 'Grandeur is My cloak and majesty is My garment. Whoever contends with Me regarding them, I shall break him.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Three things are destructive: obeyed stinginess, followed desire, and a person's admiration of himself." Thus, arrogance and self-admiration are two destructive maladies, and the arrogant and the self-admiring are two sick, ailing individuals, and they are both detested and abhorrent in the sight of God. Since the purpose in this quarter of the book *The Revival of the Religious Sciences* is to elucidate destructive traits, it is necessary to clarify arrogance and self-admiration, for they are among the vile, ruinous qualities. We shall exhaustively explain them from the Book in two parts: a part concerning arrogance, and a part concerning self-admiration.

The First Part of the Book: On Arrogance, containing: an exposition on the censure of arrogance, an exposition on the censure of vanity, an exposition on the virtue of humility, an exposition on the reality of arrogance and its ruin, an exposition on whom one becomes arrogant toward and the degrees of arrogance, an exposition on that by which arrogance occurs, an exposition on the motives for arrogance, an exposition on the character of the humble and that in which arrogance manifests, an exposition on the treatment of arrogance, an exposition on testing the soul regarding the trait of arrogance, and an exposition on what is praiseworthy from the trait of humility and what is blameworthy within it.

An Exposition on the Censure of Arrogance

God has condemned arrogance in multiple places in His Book and denounced every tyrant who exalts himself. The Almighty said: "I will turn away from My signs those who act arrogantly on earth without right." And the Exalted said: "Thus does God seal over every heart of a haughty tyrant." And He said: "They sought victory, and disappointed was every obstinate tyrant." And He said: "Indeed, He does not love the arrogant." And He said: "They had certainly become arrogant within themselves and transgressed a great transgression." And He said: "Indeed, those who are too arrogant to worship Me will enter Hell in humiliation." Condemnation of arrogance in the Qur'an is abundant.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "He who has in his heart an atom's weight of arrogance will not enter Paradise, and he who has in his heart an atom's weight of faith will not enter Hellfire." Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God Almighty says: 'Grandeur is My cloak and majesty is My garment. Whoever contends with Me for one of them, I will cast him into Hell, and I do not care.'"

From Abu Salamah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman: 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar met at al-Safa and paused. Ibn 'Amr went on, while Ibn 'Umar remained weeping. They asked, "What makes you weep, O Abu 'Abd al-Rahman?" He said: "This one—meaning 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr—claimed that he heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: 'Whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of arrogance, God will throw him face-first into the Fire.'"

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "A man continues to exalt himself until he is recorded among the tyrants, and he will be afflicted with the punishment that afflicted them."

Sulayman ibn Dawud, peace be upon them, said one day to the birds, mankind, jinn, and beasts: "Come forth!" They came forth: two hundred thousand humans and two hundred thousand jinn. He was raised until he heard the clamor of the angels glorifying in the heavens, then he was lowered until his feet touched the sea, and he heard a voice: "If there were in the heart of your companion an atom's weight of arrogance, it would have caused him to sink deeper than I have raised him."

He, peace be upon him, said: "There will emerge from Hell a neck with two ears that hear, two eyes that see, and a tongue that speaks, saying: 'I have been entrusted with three: every obstinate tyrant, everyone who invoked another god alongside God, and the image-makers.'"

He, peace be upon him, said: "The miser, the tyrant, and the one of bad character will not enter Paradise."

He, peace be upon him, said: "Paradise and Hellfire argued. Hellfire said: 'I have been favored with the arrogant and the tyrants.' Paradise said: 'Why is it that none enter me except the weak, the lowly, and the insignificant among the people?' God said to Paradise: 'You are but My mercy; I show mercy through you to whom I will of My servants.' And He said to Hellfire: 'You are but My punishment; I punish through you whom I will. And each of you shall have its fill.'"

He, peace be upon him, said: "Wretched is the servant who becomes tyrannical and transgresses and forgets the Supreme Sovereign. Wretched is the servant who becomes arrogant and proud and forgets the Most High, the Great. Wretched is the servant who is heedless and negligent and forgets the graves and decay. Wretched is the servant who is insolent and oppressive and forgets the beginning and the end."

From Thabit, it is reported: It reached us that it was said: "O Messenger of God, how great is the arrogance of so-and-so!" He said: "Is there not death after it?"

'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When death approached Nuh, peace be upon him, he called his two sons and said: 'I command you two things and forbid you two things. I forbid you from associating partners with God and from arrogance. And I command you with 'There is no god but God.' For if the heavens and the earths and all within them were placed on one scale of a balance, and 'There is no god but God' were placed on the other, it would outweigh them. And if the heavens and the earths and all within them were a closed ring and 'There is no god but God' were placed upon it, it would shatter it. And I command you with 'Glory be to God and praise be to Him,' for it is the prayer of everything, and by it everything is provided.'"

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Blessed is he whom God teaches His Book and who does not die a tyrant."

He, peace be upon him, said: "The people of Hellfire are every harsh, greedy, arrogant, and withholding collector. And the people of Paradise are the weak and the poor."

He, peace be upon him, said: "The most beloved of you to us and the nearest to us in the Hereafter are those of you with the best character. And the most hateful of you to us and the farthest from us are the garrulous, the pompous, and the pretentious." They said: "O Messenger of God, we know the garrulous and the pompous, but who are the pretentious?" He said: "The arrogant."

He, peace be upon him, said: "The arrogant will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the likeness of ants; people will tread upon them—ants in the form of men—everything will humiliate them due to their insignificance. Then they will be driven to a prison in Hell called Bulas, where the fire of al-Anyar will overcome them, and they will be given to drink from the filth of the inhabitants of Hell."

Abu Hurairah reported: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The tyrants and the arrogant will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the form of ants; people will tread upon them due to their lowliness before God Almighty."

From Muhammad ibn Was': I entered upon Bilal ibn Abi Burdah and said to him: "O Bilal, your father narrated to me from his father from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that he said: 'Indeed, in Hell there is a valley called Hahbahb. It is incumbent upon God to settle in it every tyrant. So beware, O Bilal, that you be among those who are settled in it.'"

He, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, in Hell there is a palace where the arrogant are placed and it is closed upon them."

He, peace be upon him, said: "O God, I seek refuge in You from a breath of arrogance."

He, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever parts from his soul while being free of three things will enter Paradise: arrogance, debt, and embezzlement."

The Narrations: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: Let no one belittle any other among the Muslims, for the small among the Muslims is great in the sight of God. And Wahb said: When God created the Garden of Eden, He looked upon it and said: You are forbidden to every arrogant one. And al-Ahnaf ibn Qays would sit with Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr upon his couch. One day he came while Mus'ab had stretched out his legs, and he did not draw them in. Al-Ahnaf sat down and was somewhat crowded, and Mus'ab saw the trace of that upon his face. He then said: How strange is the son of Adam, that he grows arrogant when he has issued from the passage of urine twice. And al-Hasan said: A wonder it is concerning the son of Adam; he washes filth with his hand once or twice each day, yet then contends with the Sovereign of the heavens. And it has been said regarding "And in your own selves, will you not then see?" that it is the path of excrement and urine. And Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn 'Ali said: Never does any measure of pride enter a person's heart except that a corresponding measure of his intellect diminishes, be that measure small or great. And Sulayman was asked about the sin for which no good deed avails, and he said: Pride. And al-Nu'man ibn Bashir said—from the pulpit—Indeed Satan has his lures and his snares, and among Satan's lures and snares are: insolence in the face of God's blessings, boasting over what God has granted, arrogance toward the servants of God, and following caprice in other than the cause of God. We ask God Almighty for pardon and well-being in this world and the next, by His grace and generosity.

Explanation of the humiliation of arrogance and the manifestation of pride's traces in walking and dragging one's garments.

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "God will not look at a man who drags his lower garment out of arrogance." And he, peace be upon him, said, "While a man was strutting in his cloak, pleased with himself, God caused the earth to swallow him, and he will be sinking in it until the Day of Resurrection." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever drags his garment out of pride, God will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection." Zayd ibn Aslam said: I entered upon Ibn 'Umar, and 'Abdullah ibn Waqid passed by him wearing a new garment. I heard him say, "O my son, raise your lower garment, for I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say, 'God will not look at one who drags his lower garment out of pride.'" It is related that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, once spat into his palm, placed his finger upon it, and said, "God Almighty says: 'O son of Adam, do you defy Me when I created you from something like this? When I fashioned you and made you upright, you walked in two garments, and the earth had from you a firm tread. You amassed and withheld, until when [the soul] reached the collarbone, you said, "I will give charity!" But the time for charity has passed.'" And he, peace be upon him, said, "When my community walks with a haughty gait and is served by the Persians and Romans, God will empower some of them over others." Ibn al-A'rabi said: It is a walk containing arrogance. And he, peace be upon him, said, "Whoever holds himself in high esteem and walks with arrogance will meet God while He is angry with him."

Narrations: Abu Bakr al-Hudhali reported: While we were with al-Hasan, Ibn al-Ahtham passed by us heading toward the mosque enclosure, wearing layered silk cloaks piled one over another upon his legs, his outer garment parted from them, walking with a swagger. Al-Hasan glanced at him and said: "Fie... fie... one who holds his nose high, twists his neck, turns his cheek aside, looking at his own shoulders—how wretched you are, gazing at your shoulders amid blessings neither thanked for nor remembered, not taken by God’s command therein nor rendered to God therefrom. By God, if one walks whose nature is to stagger like the affected gait of the insane in every limb, it is a blessing from God, and Satan has a turn with him." Ibn al-Ahtham heard this and returned to apologize to him. Al-Hasan said: "Do not apologize to me; repent to your Lord. Have you not heard the word of God Almighty: 'And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height'?" And a youth passed by al-Hasan wearing fine garments, so he called him and said: "O son of Adam, enamored with your youth, loving your traits, as if the grave has already covered your body and as if you have already met your deeds. Woe to you! Heal your heart, for God’s need from the servants is the soundness of their hearts." It is related that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz performed Hajj before his caliphate; Tawus saw him strutting in his walk and poked his side with his finger, then said: "Is this the walk of one whose belly contains excrement?" ‘Umar said as if excusing himself: "O uncle, every limb of mine has been trained to this walk until I learned it." And Muhammad ibn Wasī‘ saw his son strutting, so he called him and said: "Do you know who you are? As for your mother, I bought her for two hundred dirhams, and as for your father—may God not multiply his like among the Muslims!" And Ibn ‘Umar saw a man dragging his lower garment and said: "Indeed Satan has brothers"—repeating it two or three times. It is related that Mutarrif ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Shikhkhīr saw al-Muhallab swaggering in a silk cloak and said: "O servant of God, this is a walk hated by God and His Messenger." Al-Muhallab said to him: "Do you not recognize me?" He replied: "Yes, I recognize you: your beginning is a despised drop, and your end is a foul corpse, and between that you carry filth!" So al-Muhallab went away and abandoned that walk of his. Mujahid said regarding God’s word "Then he went to his family in swagger" meaning he strutted. And since we have mentioned the censure of arrogance and swagger, let us mention the virtue of humility—and God Almighty knows best.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Humility

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God increases a servant nothing by forgiveness except honor, and no one humbles himself for God except that God elevates him." And he, peace be upon him, said: "There is no one except that with him are two angels, and upon him is a wisdom by which they restrain him. If he exalts himself, they pull him down and say, 'O God, abase him.' And if he abases himself, they say, 'O God, elevate him.'" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Blessed is he who is humble without being abject, and spends wealth he gathered without disobedience, and shows mercy to the people of lowliness and poverty, and associates with the people of understanding and wisdom."

And from Abu Salamah al-Madini, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was with us in Quba and he was fasting. We came to him at the time of his breaking the fast with a cup of milk, and we put something of honey in it. When he raised it and tasted it, he found the sweetness of the honey and said, 'What is this?' We said, 'O Messenger of God, we put something of honey in it.' So he put it down and said, 'Indeed, I do not forbid it. And whoever humbles himself for God, God elevates him. And whoever is arrogant, God abases him. And whoever is moderate, God enriches him. And whoever is wasteful, God impoverishes him. And whoever remembers God much, God loves him.'"

And it is narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, was with a group of his companions in his house eating, when a beggar stood at the door with a repulsive ailment. He gave him permission, and when he entered, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, seated him on his thigh and then said to him, 'Eat.' It was as if a man from Quraysh was disgusted by him and found him repulsive, and that man did not die until he was afflicted with a similar ailment."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "My Lord gave me the choice between two matters: to be a servant and a messenger, or a king and a prophet. I did not know which of them to choose, and Gabriel, my intimate among the angels, was with me. So I raised my head to him and he said, 'Be humble before your Lord.' So I said, 'A servant and a messenger.'"

And God Almighty revealed to Moses, peace be upon him: "I only accept the prayer of one who humbles himself before My majesty, and does not act arrogantly over My creation, and devotes his heart to fear of Me, and cuts his day with remembrance of Me, and restrains his soul from desires for My sake."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Nobility is piety, honor is humility, and sufficiency is wealth." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Blessed are the humble in the world; they are the people of the pulpits on the Day of Resurrection. Blessed are the peacemakers among people in the world; they are those who will inherit Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Blessed are those whose hearts are purified in the world; they are those who will look upon God Almighty on the Day of Resurrection."

And one of them said: "It reached me that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'When God guides a servant to Islam, beautifies his form, places him in a position not disgraceful to him, and provides him with humility besides that, then that is from God's chosen ones.'"

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Four things God does not give except to one whom He loves: silence, which is the beginning of worship; reliance upon God; humility; and asceticism in the world." And Ibn Abbas said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When a servant is humble, God elevates him to the seventh heaven."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Humility increases the servant only in elevation, so be humble that God may have mercy on you." And it is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was feeding people when a black man with peeling smallpox came. He would not sit next to anyone except that they would get up from his side, so the Prophet, peace be upon him, seated him next to himself."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "It pleases me that a man carries something in his hand which is a service for his family, to repel pride from himself." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to his companions one day: "Why do I not see upon you the sweetness of worship?" They said, "And what is the sweetness of worship?" He said, "Humility."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "When you see the humble among my community, be humble toward them, and when you see the arrogant, be arrogant toward them, for that is humiliation and belittlement for them."

Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: When a servant humbles himself before God, God elevates his wisdom and says, 'Arise, may God elevate you.' And when he grows arrogant and exceeds his bounds, God casts him down to the earth and says, 'Be abased, may God abase you.' Thus, he is great in his own eyes but contemptible in the eyes of people, so much so that he is more contemptible to them than a swine. Jarir ibn 'Abdullah said: I once came upon a tree under which a man was sleeping, having shaded himself with his leather mat. The sun had moved past the mat, so I adjusted it over him. When the man awoke, it was Salman al-Farisi. I told him what I had done, and he said to me: 'O Jarir, humble yourself before God in this world, for whoever humbles himself before God in this world, God will elevate him on the Day of Resurrection. O Jarir, do you know what the darkness of the Fire will be on the Day of Resurrection?' I said, 'No.' He said: 'It is the darkness of the wrongs people committed against one another in the world.' 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: 'You are heedless of the best of acts: humility.' Yusuf ibn Asbat said: 'A little piety is rewarded more than much action, and a little humility is rewarded more than much striving.' Al-Fudayl was asked about humility and what it is. He said: 'That you submit to the truth and yield to it, even if you hear it from a child, you accept it; and even if you hear it from the most ignorant of people, you accept it.' Ibn al-Mubarak said: 'The essence of humility is that you lower yourself before one who is beneath you in worldly favor, so that you make him know that your worldly status gives you no superiority over him; and that you raise yourself above one who is above you in worldly matters, so that you make him know that his worldly status gives him no superiority over you.' Qatadah said: 'Whoever is given wealth, beauty, garments, or knowledge and is not humble concerning it, it will be a burden upon him on the Day of Resurrection.' It is said that God Almighty revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him: 'When I bestow a favor upon you, receive it with humility, and I will complete it for you.' Ka'b said: 'Whenever God bestows a favor upon a servant in this world and he is grateful to God for it and is humble with it before God, God grants him its benefit in this world and elevates his rank in the Hereafter. And whenever God bestows a favor upon a servant in this world and he is not grateful for it nor humble with it before God, God deprives him of its benefit in this world and opens for him a level of Hell to punish him, if God wills, or to pardon him.' 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was asked: 'Which of men is best?' He said: 'He who humbles himself despite having power, abstains despite having desire, and refrains from seeking victory despite having strength.' Ibn al-Sammak entered upon Harun and said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, your humility in your high station is more noble for you than your station itself.' He said: 'How excellent is what you have said!' He continued: 'O Commander of the Faithful, a man to whom God gives beauty in his form, a place in his lineage, and abundance in his possession, yet he is chaste in his beauty, generous with his wealth, and humble in his lineage, is recorded in God's register among the sincere friends of God.' Harun then called for ink and paper and wrote it with his own hand. Solomon, son of David, peace be upon them, when morning came, would survey the faces of the wealthy and the nobles until he came to the poor, and would sit with them, saying: 'A poor man among the poor.' Someone said: 'Just as you would dislike the wealthy seeing you in lowly garments, so too should you dislike the poor seeing you in elevated garments.' It is narrated that Yunus, Ayyub, and al-Hasan went out discussing humility. Al-Hasan said to them: 'Do you know what humility is? Humility is that you leave your house and meet no Muslim without seeing that he has merit over you.' Mujahid said: 'When God Almighty drowned the people of Noah, peace be upon him, the mountains became haughty and rose high, but al-Judi remained humble, so God elevated it above the mountains and made it the resting place of the Ark.' Abu Sulayman said: 'God Almighty looked into the hearts of the children of Adam and found no heart more humble than the heart of Moses, peace be upon him, so He singled him out from among them for speech.' Yunus ibn 'Ubayd, returning from 'Arafat, said: 'I would not have doubted mercy were it not that I was with them; I fear they were deprived because of me.' It is said: 'The believer is at his highest with God when he is at his lowest with himself, and at his lowest with God when he is at his highest with himself.' Ziyad al-Numayri said: 'An ascetic without humility is like a tree that bears no fruit.' Malik ibn Dinar said: 'If a caller were to call at the mosque door for the worst of you to come out, by God, no one would reach the door before me except a man with superior strength or speed.' When Ibn al-Mubarak heard his saying, he said: 'It is by this that Malik became Malik.' Al-Fudayl said: 'Whoever loves leadership will never prosper.' Musa ibn al-Qasim said: 'We experienced an earthquake and a red wind, so I went to Muhammad ibn Muqatil and said: "O Abu 'Abdullah, you are our leader, so pray to God Almighty for us." He wept and then said: "Would that I were not the cause of your destruction."' He said: 'Then I saw the Prophet, peace be upon him, in a dream, and he said: "God Almighty has lifted it from you due to the supplication of Muhammad ibn Muqatil."' A man came to al-Shalibi, may God have mercy on him, and he asked him: 'What are you?'—this being his habit and custom. The man said: 'I am the dot beneath the letter Ba.' Al-Shalibi said to him: 'May God annihilate your witness, or else assign a place for yourself.' Al-Shalibi said in some of his speech: 'My humility has nullified the humiliation of the Jews.' It is said: 'Whoever sees value in himself has no share of humility.' From Abu al-Fath ibn Shakhraf, he said: 'I saw 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him, in a dream and said to him: "O Abu al-Hasan, admonish me." He said to me: "How excellent is the humility of the wealthy in the gatherings of the poor, out of their desire for God's reward! And more excellent than the arrogance of the poor over the wealthy is their trust in God Almighty."' Abu Sulayman said: 'A servant does not humble himself until he knows himself.' Abu Yazid said: 'As long as a servant thinks there is anyone among creation worse than him, he is arrogant.' He was asked: 'When is he humble?' He said: 'When he sees for himself no station and no state. And every person's humility is according to his knowledge of his Lord Almighty and his knowledge of himself.' Abu Sulayman said: 'If all of creation were to gather to lower me as I lower myself in my own eyes, they would not be capable of it.' 'Urwah ibn al-Ward said: 'Humility is one of the snares of honor, and every blessing is envied except humility.' Yahya ibn Khalid al-Barmaki said: 'When a noble person adopts devotion, he humbles himself; when a base person adopts devotion, he becomes arrogant.' Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: 'To be humble before one who is arrogant toward you because of his wealth is humility.' It is said: 'Humility is good in all people, but it is better in the wealthy; arrogance is ugly in all people, but it is uglier in the poor.' It is said: 'There is no honor except for him who humbles himself before God Almighty; no elevation except for him who is humble before God Almighty; no security except for him who fears God Almighty; and no profit except for him who purchases his soul from God Almighty.' Abu 'Ali al-Jawzjani said: 'The soul is kneaded with arrogance, greed, and envy. So when God Almighty wills the destruction of someone, He deprives him of humility, sincere advice, and contentment. And when He wills good for someone, He is gentle with him in that. When the fire of arrogance stirs in his soul, humility from God's support overtakes it; when the fire of envy stirs in his soul, sincere advice with God's enabling overtakes it; and when the fire of greed stirs in his soul, contentment with God's aid overtakes it.' From al-Junayd,

An Exposition on the Reality of Arrogance and Its Malady

Know that pride is divided into inner and outer. The inner is a trait within the soul, and the outer are actions emanating from the limbs. The name "pride" is more fitting for the inner trait, while the actions are its fruits. The trait of pride necessitates actions; thus, when it manifests on the limbs, it is called pride, and when it does not manifest, it is said to be pride within oneself. The foundation is the trait within the soul, which is the delight and inclination to view oneself above the one looked down upon, for pride requires both someone to be proud over and something to be proud of. This distinguishes pride from vanity—as will come—for vanity does not require anyone other than the admirer; even if a human were created alone, one could conceive of him being vain, but one cannot conceive of him being proud unless he is with others and sees himself above that other in attributes of perfection. At that point, he becomes proud. It is not enough for one to deem himself great to be proud, for he may deem himself great but see others as greater than or equal to himself, so he does not become proud over them. Nor is it enough to belittle others, for even with that, if he sees himself as lowly, he does not become proud, and if he sees others as equal to himself, he does not become proud. Rather, he must see for himself a rank and for others a rank, then see his own rank above the rank of others. Upon these three beliefs, the trait of pride arises within him. It is not that this vision negates pride; rather, this vision and this belief inflate him, so there occurs in his heart self-importance, agitation, joy, and inclination toward what he believes, and honor within himself because of it. That honor, agitation, and inclination toward the belief is the trait of pride. Therefore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "I seek refuge in You from the puff of pride." Likewise, Umar said to one who sought permission to admonish after the dawn prayer, "I fear you will puff up until you reach the Pleiades." It is as if whenever a person sees himself with this eye—which is self-aggrandizement—he becomes proud, puffed up, and honored. Pride is the expression for the state occurring in the soul from these beliefs, and it is also called honor and self-aggrandizement. Therefore, Ibn Abbas said regarding God's words, "There is indeed in their hearts nothing but pride which they will never attain," he said, "A greatness they will not reach," thus interpreting pride as that greatness.

Then this honor necessitates actions, both outward and inward, which are its fruits, and that is called arrogance. For whenever his status is magnified in relation to others, he belittles those beneath him, despises them, excludes them from himself, distances them, and holds himself aloof from their company and sharing meals. He sees it as his right that they stand before him if his pride is intense. If it is stronger than that, he disdains to employ them and does not deem them worthy to stand before him or serve his threshold. If it is less than that, he scorns equality with them, precedes them in narrow paths, elevates himself above them in gatherings, expects them to initiate the greeting, is astonished at any shortcoming in fulfilling his needs, and if he debates or argues, he scorns being answered; if admonished, he disdains acceptance; if he admonishes, he is harsh in advice; if any of his words are countered, he becomes angry; if he teaches, he is not gentle with learners but humiliates them, rebukes them, boasts over them, and uses them. He looks upon the common people as if looking at donkeys, considering them foolish and contemptible. The actions emanating from the trait of pride are many, too numerous to count, so there is no need to enumerate them, for they are well-known. This is pride, and its harm is great, its consequence immense. In it, the elect among creation perish, and rarely are worshippers, ascetics, and scholars free from it, let alone the common people. How could its harm not be great when the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "He will not enter Paradise who has in his heart a mustard seed's weight of pride!" It becomes a veil blocking Paradise because it stands between the servant and all the traits of the believers, and those traits are the gates of Paradise. Pride and self-honor close all those gates, for one cannot love for the believers what he loves for himself when there is any honor involved; he cannot practice humility, which is the foremost trait of the God-fearing, when there is honor; he cannot abandon malice when there is honor; he cannot persist in truthfulness when there is honor; he cannot abandon anger when there is honor; he cannot suppress rage when there is honor; he cannot abandon envy when there is honor; he cannot offer gentle counsel when there is honor; he cannot accept advice when there is honor; he is not safe from despising people and backbiting them when there is honor. There is no need to prolong; there is no blameworthy trait but the possessor of honor and pride is compelled to it to preserve his honor, and there is no praiseworthy trait but he is incapable of it for fear of losing his honor. Thus, for this reason, he who has in his heart a mustard seed's weight of it will not enter Paradise. Blameworthy traits are interconnected, each inevitably inviting the others. The worst type of pride is that which prevents acquiring knowledge, accepting truth, and submitting to it. Concerning this, the verses that condemn pride and the proud have come. God Almighty said, "And the angels will be stretching forth their hands" up to His words, "and you were arrogant toward His signs." Then He said, "Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant." Then He informed that the most severely punished people of Hell are those most insolent against God Almighty, saying, "Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were most insolent toward the Most Merciful." And He said, "So those who do not believe in the Hereafter—their hearts are denying, and they are arrogant." And He, glorified and exalted, said, "Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, 'If not for you, we would have been believers.'" And He said, "Indeed, those who are arrogant toward My worship will enter Hell humiliated." And He said, "I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right." It is said in interpretation: "I will lift understanding of the Quran from their hearts," and in some interpretations: "I will veil their hearts from the dominion." Ibn Jurayj said: "I will turn them away from reflecting upon them and taking lesson from them." Therefore, Jesus (peace be upon him) said: "Crop grows on plains but not on solid rock; likewise, wisdom works in the heart of the humble but not in the heart of the proud. Do you not see that whoever raises his head to the ceiling strikes it, and whoever lowers it is shaded and sheltered?" This is a parable he struck for the proud and how they are deprived of wisdom. Therefore, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) mentioned rejecting truth as part of pride and uncovering its reality, saying, "Whoever belittles truth and despises people."

An Exposition of Those Upon Whom Arrogance is Directed, Its Degrees, Its Categories, and the Fruits of Arrogance Within It

Know that the object of arrogance is either God Most High, His messengers, or the rest of His creation. Indeed, man was created prone to injustice and ignorance; at times he grows arrogant toward creation, and at times he grows arrogant toward the Creator. Therefore, arrogance, with respect to its object, is of three types.

The first is arrogance toward God; this is the most vile form of pride, and it stems from nothing but sheer ignorance and rebellion, as was the case with Nimrod, who entertained the thought of fighting the Lord of the heavens, and as is related concerning groups of the ignorant. Indeed, it is related of all who claimed divinity, like Pharaoh and others, that out of arrogance he said, "I am your highest lord," for he disdained to be a servant of God. For this reason, God Most High said, "Indeed, those who disdain to worship Me will enter Hell in humiliation." And He said, "Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of God, nor would the angels brought near." And He said, "And when it is said to them, 'Prostrate to the Most Merciful,' they say, 'And what is the Most Merciful? Should we prostrate to that which you command us?' And it increases them in aversion."

The Second Category: Arrogance towards the Messengers, arising from the soul's sense of superiority and its elevation above submitting to a human being like all other people. This sometimes diverts one from reflection and insight, leaving him in the darkness of ignorance due to his arrogance, so he refuses to submit while believing he is in the right. At other times, he refuses despite knowledge, but his soul does not comply with submitting to the truth and humbling himself before the Messengers, as God has related their saying, "Shall we believe in two human beings like ourselves?" and their saying, "You are but human beings like us, and if you obey a human being like yourselves, then indeed you would be losers." And those who do not expect the meeting with Us said, "Why have angels not been sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?" They have certainly become arrogant within themselves and insolent with great insolence. And they said, "Why was an angel not sent down to him?" And Pharaoh, as God informed about him, said, "Or [until] the angels are brought to him, chained together." And God the Exalted said, "And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without right." Thus, he was arrogant towards God and towards all His Messengers. Wahb said: Moses, peace be upon him, said to him, "Believe, and your kingdom will remain yours." He said, "Until I consult Haman." So he consulted Haman, and Haman said, "While you are a lord being worshipped, you have become a slave who worships?" So he disdained servitude to God and following Moses, peace be upon him. And the Quraysh, as God the Exalted informed about them, said, "Why was this Qur'an not sent down to a great man from one of the two cities?" Qatadah said: The great man of the two cities is al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah and Abu Mas'ud al-Thaqafi. They sought someone of greater leadership than the Prophet, peace be upon him, when they said, "An orphan boy—how could God send him to us?" So the Exalted said, "Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord?" And God the Exalted said, "So that they may say, 'Are these the ones whom God has favored among us?'" meaning belittling them and considering their precedence unlikely. And the Quraysh said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "How can we sit with you when these are present?" and they pointed to the poor Muslims, looking down upon them with their eyes due to their poverty, and were too arrogant to sit with them. So God the Exalted revealed, "And do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon" up to His saying, "Their account is not upon you." And He said, "And restrain yourself with those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His countenance, and do not let your eyes pass beyond them, desiring the adornment of worldly life." Then God the Exalted informed of their astonishment when they entered Hell, as they did not see those they had looked down upon, and they said, "What is [wrong] with us that we do not see men we used to count among the wicked?" It is said they meant 'Ammār, Bilāl, Ṣuhayb, and al-Miqdād, may God be pleased with them. Among them were those whose arrogance prevented them from reflection and knowledge, so they were ignorant of his, peace be upon him, being in the right. And among them were those who knew, but arrogance prevented them from acknowledgment. God the Exalted said, informing about them, "But when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it." And He said, "And they denied them, while their souls were convinced thereof, out of injustice and arrogance." This arrogance is close to arrogance towards God, Glory and Exalted is He, although it is lesser than it, but it is arrogance towards accepting God's command and humbling oneself before His Messenger.

The Third Category: Arrogance towards the servants of God; this is when one magnifies oneself and belittles others, so that one's soul refuses to submit to them and calls one to exalt oneself over them, thus despising them, considering them insignificant, and disdaining to be their equal. Although this is lesser than the first and second categories, it is also grave from two aspects. The first: that pride, might, majesty, and loftiness are fitting only for the Sovereign, the All-Powerful. As for the servant, owned, weak, and incapable, who has no power over anything—how can pride be fitting for his state? Whenever a servant acts arrogantly, he has contended with God Almighty in an attribute that is fitting only for His majesty. Its likeness is that of a boy who takes the king's crown and places it on his head, then sits upon his throne. How great is his deserving of wrath, and how great his exposure to disgrace and punishment! How severe his audacity towards his master, and how ugly his undertaking! To this meaning points His Exalted Word: "Majesty is My garment and pride My cloak; whoever contends with Me in them, I will break him." That is, it is specific to My attribute and fitting only for Me. The contender therein contends in one of My attributes. And since pride over His servants is fitting only for Him, whoever is arrogant towards His servants has indeed wronged Him. For whoever disdains the special attendants of the king, employs them, exalts himself over them, and monopolizes what it is the king's right to monopolize from them, he contends with him in some of his authority—even if he does not reach the degree of one who seeks to sit upon his throne and seize his kingdom. All creation are servants of God, and to Him belongs majesty and pride over them. So whoever is arrogant towards any servant of God has contended with God in His right. Indeed, the difference between this contention and the contention of Nimrod and Pharaoh is the difference between contending with the king in belittling some of his servants and employing them, and contending with him in the very essence of kingship.

The second aspect by which the vice of arrogance is magnified is that it leads to opposing God, Exalted is He, in His commands. For when the arrogant hears the truth from a servant among God’s servants, he scorns accepting it and prepares to deny it. Hence you see those who debate religious matters claiming they are investigating the secrets of religion, yet they deny one another like the arrogant. Whenever the truth becomes clear on the tongue of one of them, the other is too proud to accept it, prepares to deny it, and schemes to repel it with whatever confusion he can muster. This is among the traits of the disbelievers and hypocrites, as God, Exalted is He, described them, saying, “And those who disbelieve say, ‘Do not listen to this Qur’an and drown it out [with noise] that you may overcome.’” Thus, whoever debates for victory and silencing, not to seize the truth when he attains it, has shared in this trait. Likewise, this applies to being too proud to accept admonition, as God, Exalted is He, said, “And when it is said to him, ‘Fear God,’ pride seizes him in sin.” It is related that ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, recited this verse and said, “To God we belong and to Him we return. A man stood enjoining good and was killed, then another stood and said, ‘They kill those who enjoin justice among the people,’ and he was killed.” The arrogant one killed him who opposed him and him who commanded him out of arrogance. Ibn Mas‘ud said, “It is enough sin for a man that when it is said to him, ‘Fear God,’ he says, ‘Mind your own self!’” And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man, “Eat with your right hand.” He said, “I cannot.” The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “May you never be able to.” Nothing prevented him but his arrogance. It is said, “He never raised it after that,” meaning his hand became impaired. Therefore, his arrogance toward creation is grave, for it will lead him to be arrogant toward God’s command. Indeed, Iblis was made an example of this, and what is recounted of his states is only that one may take heed from it. For he said, “I am better than him.” This arrogance is regarding lineage, for he said, “I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay.” That led him to refuse to prostrate, which God, Exalted is He, commanded him. Its origin was arrogance toward Adam and envy of him, which dragged him to arrogance toward God’s command, Exalted is He, and that became the cause of his destruction forever. This is a grave affliction among the afflictions of arrogance toward the servants. Therefore, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, explained arrogance with these two afflictions when Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammas asked him, “O Messenger of God, I am a man who loves beauty as you see; is that arrogance?” He, peace be upon him, said, “No, but arrogance is rejecting the truth and looking down on people.” In another narration, “despising the truth.” And his saying, “looking down on people” means disdaining them and belittling them, though they are God’s servants like him or better than him. This first affliction is “despising the truth,” which is rejecting it, and that is the second affliction. Thus, whoever sees himself as better than his brother, belittles his brother, disdains him, and looks at him with contempt, or rejects the truth while knowing it, has been arrogant between himself and creation. And whoever is too proud to submit to God, Exalted is He, and humble himself to God through obedience and following His messengers, has been arrogant between himself and God, Exalted is He, and His messengers.

Explanation of That Through Which Arrogance Manifests

Know that one becomes arrogant only when he esteems himself greatly, and he esteems himself only when he believes he possesses an attribute of perfection. All of this ultimately stems from either religious or worldly perfection. Religious perfection lies in knowledge and action, while worldly perfection consists of lineage, beauty, strength, wealth, and numerous supporters. Thus, these are the seven causes.

The First: Knowledge; and how swiftly pride overtakes the scholars! For this reason, the Prophet ﷺ said, "The bane of knowledge is arrogance." Thus, it is not long before the scholar exalts himself with the exaltation of knowledge, sensing within himself the beauty and perfection of knowledge, esteeming himself greatly, belittling the people, looking upon them as one looks upon beasts, considering them ignorant, and expecting that they should initiate the greeting of peace to him. If one of them does greet him first, or responds to him with a cheerful face, or stands for him, or accepts his invitation, he regards that as a favor from them and an obligation upon him for which he must give thanks, and he believes that he is the most honorable among them and that he has done for them what one of his stature does not owe them, and that they ought to show him deference and serve him in gratitude for his favor. Indeed, the prevalent pattern is that they maintain ties of kinship with him, but he does not maintain them; they visit him, but he does not visit them; they inquire after him when he is ill, but he does not inquire after them. He employs those among them with whom he associates and exploits them for his needs; if they fall short in this, he finds it objectionable as if they were his slaves or his hired workers, and as if his teaching them knowledge were a favor from him to them, a kindness bestowed upon them, and a right he has earned over them. This pertains to worldly matters.

As for matters of the Hereafter, his pride over them manifests in that he sees himself before God Almighty as higher and better than them, so he fears for them more than he fears for himself and hopes for himself more than he hopes for them. Such a one is more deserving of being called ignorant than being called a scholar. Rather, true knowledge is that by which a person knows himself, his Lord, the peril of the final outcome, God's argument against the scholars, and the immense gravity of knowledge within him—as will come in the discussion on treating pride with knowledge. This knowledge increases fear, humility, and reverence, and necessitates that he sees all people as better than himself due to the greatness of God's argument against him on account of knowledge and his own shortcoming in fulfilling the gratitude due for the blessing of knowledge. For this reason, Abu al-Darda' said, "Whoever increases in knowledge increases in anguish," and it is as he said.

If you ask: Why is it that some people increase in arrogance and false security through knowledge? Know that there are two reasons for this:

"One" is that he occupies himself with what is called knowledge but is not true knowledge. True knowledge is only that by which the servant knows his Lord and his own soul, and the gravity of his affair in meeting God and being veiled from Him. This produces fear and humility, not arrogance and false security. God Almighty has said, "Only those among His servants who have knowledge fear God." As for what lies beyond that—such as the knowledge of medicine, arithmetic, language, poetry, grammar, settling disputes, and methods of debate—if a person devotes himself solely to these until he is filled with arrogance and hypocrisy, these are more fittingly called crafts than they are called sciences. Rather, knowledge is the recognition of servitude and Lordship and the path of worship, and this most often produces humility.

The second cause is that a servant delves into knowledge while having an impure intention, a corrupt soul, and bad character. For he did not first occupy himself with disciplining his soul and purifying his heart through various forms of spiritual striving, nor did he satisfy his soul in the worship of his Lord, so his essence remains corrupt. When he then delves into knowledge—whatever knowledge it may be—the knowledge finds a corrupt abode in his heart, so its fruit does not ripen and its effect in goodness does not manifest. Wahb gave an example for this, saying: "Knowledge is like rain that descends from the sky, sweet and pure. The trees drink it with their roots and transform it according to the nature of their tastes, so the bitter becomes more bitter and the sweet becomes sweeter. Likewise, knowledge is preserved by men, and they transform it according to the measure of their aspirations and desires, so it increases the arrogant in arrogance and the humble in humility." This is because whoever's aspiration is arrogance while ignorant, when he preserves knowledge, he finds something to be arrogant about and thus increases in arrogance. And if a man is fearful in his ignorance, when his knowledge increases, he knows that the proof against him has been confirmed, so he increases in fear, apprehension, lowliness, and humility. Indeed, knowledge is among the greatest things by which one becomes arrogant. Therefore, the Almighty said to His Prophet, peace be upon him: "And lower your wing to those of the believers who follow you" (Qur'an 26:215). And the Almighty said: "And had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you" (Qur'an 3:159). And He described His allies, saying: "Humble towards the believers, mighty against the disbelievers" (Qur'an 5:54). Likewise, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said as narrated by al-'Abbas, may God be pleased with him: "There will be a people who recite the Qur'an, but it will not go beyond their throats. They will say, 'We have recited the Qur'an, so who recites more than us? Who knows more than us?'" Then he turned to his companions and said, "Those are from among you, O community. Those are the fuel of the Fire." For this reason, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Do not be tyrannical scholars, lest your knowledge not suffice against your ignorance." Therefore, Tamim al-Dari sought permission from 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, to narrate stories, but he refused to grant him permission, saying, "That is slaughter." And a man who was the imam of his people sought his permission to remind them when he finished his prayer, and he said, "I fear you will become inflated until you reach the Pleiades." Hudhayfah led people in prayer, and when he finished his prayer, he said, "You must seek an imam other than me, or pray alone, for I saw in myself that there is no one better than me among the people." If one like Hudhayfah is not safe, then how can the weak among the later generations of this community be safe? How rare upon the face of the earth is a scholar who deserves to be called a scholar, yet is not moved by the pride and haughtiness of knowledge. If such is found, he is the truthful one of his time. He should not be left, but rather observing him is an act of worship, let alone benefiting from his breaths and his states. If we knew of such a one, even in the farthest reaches of China, we would strive to reach him, hoping that his blessing would encompass us and that his conduct and character would flow to us. But alas! How could the end of time yield the likes of them? They were the masters of divine acceptance and the possessors of spiritual states; they became extinct in the first century and those after it. Rather, it is rare in our time to find a scholar in whose heart stirs regret and sorrow over missing this quality. That one, too, is either non-existent or exceedingly rare. Were it not for the glad tidings of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, in his saying, "A time will come upon people when whoever holds fast to one-tenth of what you are upon will be saved," it would be fitting for us—we seek refuge in God Almighty—to plunge into the pit of despair and hopelessness, given the state of our evil deeds. And who among us can even hold fast to one-tenth of what they were upon? Would that we held fast to one-tenth of one-tenth of it! So we ask God Almighty to deal with us as is worthy of Him and to cover our shameful deeds as His generosity and grace necessitate.

The second is action and worship, which is not free from the vice of pride and arrogance, and from seeking to attract the hearts of ascetics and worshippers, whereby arrogance seeps from them in matters of religion and worldly life.

As for in this world, it is that they see others as more deserving of visiting them than they are of visiting others, and they expect people to rise to fulfill their needs, honor them, make room for them in gatherings, mention them with piety and God-consciousness, and give them precedence over all others in shares—to all that we have mentioned concerning the rights of the scholars—as if they consider their worship a favor upon the Truth.

As for in religion, it is when one sees people as perishing and sees himself as saved, while he is truly the perisher—whenever he sees that. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "When you hear a man say, 'The people are ruined,' he is the most ruined of them." He said that because this statement of his indicates that he is contemptuous of God's creation, deceived by God, secure from His cunning, and unafraid of His overpowering might. How can he not fear? It suffices as an evil that he despises his fellow Muslim. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "It is enough evil for a man that he despises his Muslim brother." How great is the difference between him and one whom God loves and honors for his worship, esteems him, and hopes for him what he does not hope for himself! The creation attains salvation by honoring him for God's sake, thus drawing near to God Almighty by closeness to him, while he distances himself from God by disdaining and keeping away from them, as if he is too elevated to sit with them. How deserving are they, since they loved him for his righteousness, that God should elevate them to his rank in deeds! And how deserving is he, since he scorned them with his eye, that God should lower him to the level of neglect! As it is narrated that a man among the Children of Israel, called the profligate of the Children of Israel—due to his great corruption—passed by another man called the worshipper of the Children of Israel, and over the worshipper's head was a cloud shading him. When the profligate passed by him, the profligate said to himself, "I am the profligate of the Children of Israel, and this is the worshipper of the Children of Israel. Perhaps if I sit with him, God will have mercy on him!" So he sat with him. The worshipper said, "I am the worshipper of the Children of Israel, and this is the profligate of the Children of Israel. How can he sit with me?" He felt aversion toward him and said to him, "Get away from me!" Then God revealed to the prophet of that time, "Command them both to renew their works, for I have forgiven the profligate and nullified the deeds of the worshipper." In another narration: The cloud then moved to the head of the profligate.

This reveals to you that God Almighty desires from His servants their hearts. Thus, the ignorant sinner who humbles himself in awe of God and submits in fear of Him has indeed obeyed God with his heart, and he is more obedient to God than the arrogant scholar and the self-admiring worshipper. It has also been related that a man from the Children of Israel came to a worshipper among them and stepped on his neck while he was prostrating. The worshipper said, "Lift your foot, for by God, God will not forgive you!" Then God revealed to him: "O presumptuous one! Rather, it is you whom God will not forgive." Similarly, al-Hasan said: "Even the wearer of wool is more arrogant than the wearer of embroidered silk, meaning the wearer of silk humbles himself before the wearer of wool and acknowledges his superiority, while the wearer of wool sees superiority in himself." This affliction also rarely spares many worshippers, which is that if someone belittles or harms them, they deem it far-fetched that God would forgive that person, and they do not doubt that he has become detested in God's sight. Yet, if they were to harm another Muslim, they would not find such a reaction strange. This is due to the great stature of their own selves in their eyes, which is ignorance and a combination of arrogance, self-admiration, and presumption regarding God. Indeed, the folly and stupidity of some may reach the point where they challenge, saying, "You will see what befalls him!" And if afflicted by a calamity, they claim it is a mark of their distinction and that God intended nothing by it except to quench their burning grudge and exact vengeance for them from him, while they see multitudes of disbelievers who revile God and His Messenger, and they know of groups who harmed the prophets—peace be upon them—some of whom they killed and others they struck. Yet God granted respite to most of them and did not punish them in this world; indeed, some of them even embraced Islam and no harm befell them in this world or the Hereafter. Then the deluded ignorant one imagines he is more honored by God than His prophets and that God has avenged him in a manner He does not avenge His prophets. Perhaps he is already in God's displeasure due to his self-admiration and arrogance, heedless of his own destruction. This is the creed of the deluded.

As for the discerning among the worshippers, they say what ‘Aṭā’ al-Sulamī used to say when a wind would blow or a storm would occur: “What befalls people befalls them only because of me; were ‘Aṭā’ to die, they would be relieved.” And what another said after departing from ‘Arafāt: “I had hoped for mercy for all of them were it not for my presence among them.” So observe the difference between the two men: this one fears God outwardly and inwardly; he is a man who disparages his own deeds and efforts. That one perhaps conceals within himself hypocrisy, arrogance, envy, and malice—which are a cause for Satan’s mockery—then he presumes to impose a favor upon God through his deeds. Whoever firmly believes that he is superior to any of God’s servants has, by his ignorance, nullified the entirety of his works, for ignorance is the gravest of sins and the greatest thing that distances a servant from God. His judgment of himself as better than others is pure ignorance and a false sense of security from God’s subtle plan; and none feel secure from God’s plan except the people who are losers. Thus it is related that a man was mentioned favorably to the Prophet (peace be upon him). One day he came forward, and they said: “O Messenger of God, this is the one we mentioned to you.” He said: “I see upon his face a mark from Satan.” The man greeted and stood before the Prophet (peace be upon him), and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him: “I ask you by God, did your soul whisper to you that there is no one among the people better than you?” He said: “O God, yes.” The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) saw by the light of prophethood what lay hidden in his heart—a mark upon his face. This is an affliction from which none of the worshippers is free except those whom God protects.

However, scholars and worshippers afflicted by pride fall into three levels. The first level is when pride is firmly rooted in his heart, and he sees himself as better than others, yet he strives, humbles himself, and acts as one who sees others as better than himself. This person has the tree of pride deeply planted in his heart, but he has completely cut off its branches.

The second manifestation is when this pride becomes evident in one's actions—such as seeking elevated seating, pushing ahead of peers, and displaying disapproval toward those who fall short in honoring him. The least form of this in a scholar is turning his cheek away from people as if turning aside from them; and in an ascetic, frowning and knitting his brow as if holding himself aloof from people, despising them, or being angry with them. Yet the poor soul does not know that piety is not in the forehead so that it should be knit, nor in the face so that it should frown, nor in the cheek so that it should be turned, nor in the neck so that it should bow, nor in the hem so that it should be gathered. Rather, piety resides in the hearts. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "God-consciousness is here," and he pointed to his chest. Indeed, the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was the noblest of creation and the most God-conscious, yet he was the most expansive in character, the most cheerful, smiling, and approachable. For this reason, al-Harith ibn Juz’ al-Zubaydi, a companion of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), said: "What pleases me among the reciters is every affable, smiling one; but as for him who meets you with cheerfulness and you meet him with a frown, imposing his knowledge upon you—may God not increase his like among the Muslims." If God, exalted and glorified, were pleased with such behavior for you, He would not have said to His Prophet (peace be upon him), "And lower your wing to the believers who follow you." Those upon whose demeanor the trace of arrogance appears are in a lighter condition than those in the third rank—who manifest pride through their speech, to the point that it leads them to claim superiority, boast, brag, self-praise, recount their states and spiritual stations, and strive to surpass others in knowledge and deeds.

As for the worshipper, he says in the context of boasting to other worshippers: "Who is he and what is his deed, and from where is his asceticism?" Thus, the tongue becomes lengthy in disparaging them. Then he praises himself and says: "I have not broken my fast for such and such time, nor do I sleep at night, and I complete the Qur'an every day. Yet so-and-so sleeps at dawn and does not recite much, and the like." He may even implicitly commend himself by saying: "So-and-so intended harm against me, so his child perished, his wealth was taken, or he fell ill, or something similar," claiming miraculous favor for himself. As for his rivalry: it is that if he finds himself among people praying at night, he stands and prays more than he used to pray. If they endure hunger, he burdens himself with endurance to surpass them and to manifest his strength and their weakness. Likewise, he intensifies in worship out of fear that it might be said someone else is more devout or stronger in the religion of God than he.

As for the scholar, he boasts and says: I am versed in various sciences and acquainted with realities, and I have met such-and-such shaykhs. But who are you, and what is your merit? Whom have you met? And what have you heard of Hadith? All this to belittle others and magnify himself. As for his ostentation: it is that he strives in debate to prevail and not be defeated, and he stays awake night and day acquiring sciences with which to adorn himself in gatherings—such as debate, argumentation, refining expressions, and rhyming words—and memorizing obscure sciences to astonish his peers and exalt himself over them. He memorizes the wordings and chains of Hadith so that he may correct anyone who errs in them, thus displaying his superiority and the deficiency of his peers. He rejoices whenever one of them errs so that he may refute him, and he is displeased when someone is correct and excels, fearing that he might be seen as greater than himself.

All of this is the character of arrogance and its effects, which pride in knowledge and deeds yields. And where is he who is free from all or some of that? Would that I knew: how can one who recognizes these traits in himself and hears the saying of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, “He who has in his heart an atom’s weight of arrogance shall not enter Paradise,” still consider himself great and arrogant toward others, when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, declares that such a one is among the people of the Fire? Truly, the great one is he who is free from this; and he who is free from it has no self-importance or arrogance. The true scholar is he who understands that God Almighty has said to him: “You have a standing with Us as long as you do not see standing for yourself; but if you see standing for yourself, then you have no standing with Us.” Whoever does not know this from religion, the name ‘scholar’ upon him is a lie; and whoever knows it is bound not to be arrogant nor to see standing for himself. This is arrogance through knowledge and deeds.

The third is arrogance based on lineage and ancestry, where one of noble descent looks down upon those without such lineage, even if they surpass him in deeds and knowledge. Some among them grow arrogant, viewing people as mere possessions and slaves, and they disdain mingling and sitting with them. Its fruit upon the tongue is boasting, so he says to another: "O Nabatean! O Indian! O Armenian! Who are you, and who is your father? I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so. How dare the likes of you speak to me or even look at me? Do you converse with one like me?" and the like. This is a deep-rooted trait in the soul, from which a person of lineage does not free himself, even if he is righteous and sensible, except that it may not manifest from him when conditions are balanced. But if anger overcomes him, it extinguishes the light of his insight, and it then manifests, as narrated from Abu Dharr, who said: "I argued with a man in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said to him: 'O son of a black woman!' The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'O Abu Dharr, ease up, ease up! The son of a white woman has no superiority over the son of a black woman.'" Abu Dharr (may God have mercy on him) said: "So I lay down and said to the man: 'Step on my cheek.'" See how the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) alerted him that he saw superiority in himself for being the son of a white woman, and that this was error and ignorance? And see how he repented and uprooted the tree of arrogance from himself with the sole of the foot of the one he had arrogantly looked down upon, once he knew that pride is only subdued by humility? Among such matters is what is narrated that two men boasted in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and one said to the other: "I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so, so who are you, may you have no mother?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Two men boasted before Moses (peace be upon him). One said: 'I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so,' until he counted nine. Then God Almighty revealed to Moses (peace be upon him): 'Say to the one who boasted: Indeed, the nine are among the people of Hell, and you are the tenth of them.'" And the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "Let a people abandon pride in their fathers, for they have become charcoal in Hell, or they will be more insignificant to God than the dung beetles that roll filth with their noses."

The fourth is boasting about beauty, which occurs most frequently among women and leads to belittling others, slander, backbiting, and mentioning people's faults. Among such instances is what is narrated from 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, that she said: A woman entered upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, and I gestured with my hand like this—meaning that she was short—so the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "You have backbitten her." This originates from the subtlety of pride, for if she herself had also been short, she would not have mentioned the other's shortness. Thus, it is as if she was pleased with her own stature and considered the woman short in comparison to herself, leading her to say what she said.

The fifth is arrogance through wealth; this occurs among kings regarding their treasuries, among merchants regarding their merchandise, among landowners regarding their lands, and among those who adorn themselves regarding their clothing, horses, and conveyances. Thus, the rich person belittles the poor and acts arrogantly toward him, saying: "You are a pauper and a wretch, while I, if I wished, could purchase the likes of you and employ someone superior to you. Who are you? What do you possess? The furnishings of my house are worth more than all your wealth. I spend in a day what you do not consume in a year." All of this stems from his magnifying wealth and belittling poverty, and all of it is ignorance on his part of the virtue of poverty and the affliction of wealth. To this, the Almighty alludes in His saying: "He said to his companion while conversing with him, 'I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in men,'" until he answered him, saying: "If you see me less than you in wealth and children, then perhaps my Lord will give me better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky, and it will become a smooth, bare plain, or its water will become deep-sunken, so that you will be unable to seek it out." That was arrogance on his part regarding wealth and children. Then God made clear the outcome of his affair in His saying: "Oh, would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord." Among this also is the arrogance of Qarun, as God the Exalted informs of his arrogance: "So he came out before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the worldly life said, 'Oh, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given. Indeed, he is one of great fortune.'" The sixth: arrogance through strength and forceful might, and arrogance with it over the weak. The seventh: arrogance through followers, supporters, students, servants, tribe, relatives, and sons. This occurs among kings in vying over the multitude of soldiers, and among scholars in vying over the multitude of students.

In summary, every blessing that can be perceived as a perfection—even if it is not inherently perfect—can become a cause for arrogance. Indeed, even the effeminate man may grow arrogant among his peers due to his greater knowledge and skill in the craft of effeminacy, for he regards it as a perfection and thus takes pride in it, though his action is nothing but a disgrace. Likewise, the immoral sinner may boast of excessive drinking and rampant debauchery with women and boys, and grow arrogant because of it, believing it to be a perfection—though he is mistaken in that belief. These are the general grounds upon which servants become arrogant toward one another: one who possesses something looks down upon another who lacks it, or upon one who possesses what he considers inferior. Yet what he holds may be equal or even superior in the sight of God Almighty—as with the scholar who grows arrogant with his knowledge over one who is more learned than him, because he believes himself to be the most knowledgeable and has a high opinion of himself. We ask God for assistance through His grace and mercy, for He has power over all things.

Explanation of the Motives for Arrogance and the Causes that Incite It

Know that pride is an inward disposition, while what manifests in character and actions are its fruit and consequence, which should be termed arrogance. The name "pride" is specifically reserved for the inward meaning, which is self-aggrandizement and viewing one's own worth above that of others. This inward state has a single cause: self-admiration pertaining to the proud—as its meaning will be explained—for when one admires himself, his knowledge, his deeds, or any of his means, he becomes self-important and proud.

As for manifest arrogance, its causes are three: a cause within the arrogant one, a cause concerning the one upon whom arrogance is displayed, and a cause related to other matters.

The cause within the arrogant one is self-admiration (‘ujb). That which concerns the one upon whom arrogance is displayed is rancor (hiqd) and envy (hasad). That which is related to other matters is ostentation (riyā’). Thus, the causes by this consideration become four: self-admiration, rancor, envy, and ostentation.

As for self-admiration, we have already mentioned that it begets inward arrogance, and arrogance yields manifest pride in deeds, words, and states.

As for rancor, it compels one to arrogance without self-admiration, like one who behaves arrogantly towards someone he considers his equal or superior. However, anger towards him due to a prior offense has produced in him a settled rancor from that anger, and hatred has become entrenched in his heart. Therefore, his soul does not comply with humbling himself before him, even if he deems him deserving of humility. How many a base person finds his soul unwilling to show humility to one of the great ones due to rancor towards him or some offense from him? This drives him to reject the truth if it comes from that person, to be too proud to accept his counsel, to strive to surpass him even when he knows he does not deserve it, and to not hold him excused even if he wrongs him—so he does not apologize to him if he has wronged him, nor does he ask him about what he is ignorant of.

As for envy, it also necessitates hatred for the envied one, even if there is no harm or cause for anger and malice from his side. Envy further calls one to deny the truth, to the point of preventing the acceptance of advice and the learning of knowledge. How many an ignorant person yearns for knowledge, yet remains in the baseness of ignorance because he scorns benefiting from anyone from the people of his town or his relatives out of envy and malice toward him? Thus, he turns away from him and acts arrogantly toward him, despite knowing that he deserves humility due to the excellence of his knowledge. But envy incites him to treat him with the manners of the arrogant, even if, in his inner self, he does not see himself as superior to him.

As for ostentation, it also leads to the traits of the arrogant, to the extent that a man may debate with someone he knows is superior to him, with no prior acquaintance, envy, or malice between them. Yet he refrains from accepting correction from him and does not humble himself to learn from him, fearing that people might say he is inferior. Thus, what drives him to arrogance toward him is pure ostentation. Were he alone with him, he would not behave arrogantly toward him.

As for one who becomes arrogant due to self-admiration, envy, or malice, he also displays arrogance in solitude whenever no third party is present. Likewise, he may falsely claim noble lineage while knowing he is lying, then grows arrogant over those not ascribed to that lineage, elevates himself above them in gatherings, precedes them on the path, and is not content with equality in honor and respect—all while inwardly aware that he deserves none of it. There is no true arrogance within his heart, for he knows his claim to lineage is false; rather, hypocrisy drives him to imitate the acts of the arrogant. It is as though the name "arrogant" is mostly applied to one who performs these acts out of an inner arrogance stemming from self-admiration and viewing others with contempt. If he is called arrogant, it is due to his resemblance to the deeds of the truly arrogant. We ask God for good success, and God Most High knows best.

Description of the Manners of the Humble

The gatherings where the effects of humility and arrogance become manifest.

Know that arrogance manifests in a man's demeanor, such as a twist in his face, a disdainful glance, or the lowering of his head; in his sitting cross-legged or reclining; and in his speech, even in his tone, melody, and phrasing in delivery. It appears in his walk, his strutting, his standing and sitting, his movements and stillness, in the manner he performs his actions, and in all his shifts in states, words, and deeds. Among the arrogant are those who combine all of this, and among them are those who are arrogant in some aspects and humble in others.

Among them is arrogance, which manifests as desiring people to stand for him or before him. Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: "Whoever wishes to see a man from the people of the Fire, let him look at a man seated while people stand before him." And Anas said: "No person was more beloved to them than the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and when they saw him, they would not stand for him, knowing his dislike for that."

Among them is that one does not walk except with another walking behind him. Abu al-Darda’ said: “A servant continues to increase in distance from God as long as he has someone walking behind him.” And ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf was not recognizable among his own servants, since he did not distinguish himself from them in outward appearance. Some people walked behind al-Hasan al-Basri, and he prevented them, saying: “Nothing of this remains in the servant’s heart.” And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would at times walk with some of his companions, then order them to go ahead and walk among them, either to teach others or to repel from himself the whisperings of Satan concerning pride and vanity—just as he wore a new garment in prayer and then exchanged it for an old one for one of these two meanings.

And among them is that one does not visit another, even if some religious good for the other would result from the visit, and this is contrary to humility. It is related that Sufyan al-Thawri came to Ramlah, and Ibrahim ibn Adham sent to him: “Come and teach us.” So Sufyan came and said to him: “O Abu Ishaq, do you send for someone like me?” He replied: “I wanted to see how you would humble yourself.” And among them is that one feels too proud to have another sit near him unless that person sits before him, whereas humility is the opposite. Ibn Wahb said: “I sat next to ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Abi Rawad, and his thigh touched mine, so I moved myself away from him. He took hold of my garment and drew me to himself, saying: ‘Why do you treat me as you treat tyrants? I do not know of any man better than you.’” And Anas said: “A young servant-girl from among the servant-girls of Medina would take the hand of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he would not withdraw his hand from hers until she had taken him wherever she wished.”

Among them is to avoid sitting with the sick and the afflicted and to keep away from them, and likewise from pride: A man entered upon the Messenger of God ﷺ—and he had smallpox that had scabbed over—while some of his companions were eating with him. No one sat beside him except that they would rise from his side, so the Prophet ﷺ seated him next to himself. And Abdullah ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them both, would not prevent a leper, nor a person with leprosy, nor any afflicted person from his food; rather, he would seat them at his table.

And among them is that he should not undertake with his own hand any work in his house, and humility is its opposite. It is related that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz was visited one night by a guest while he was writing, and the lamp was about to go out. The guest said, "Shall I rise to the lamp and fix it?" He replied, "It is not from the nobility of a man that he employs his guest." The guest said, "Shall I wake the servant?" He said, "This is the first sleep he has had." So he rose himself, took the oil flask, and filled the lamp with oil. The guest said, "You rose yourself, O Commander of the Faithful?" He replied, "I went as 'Umar and I returned as 'Umar; nothing has diminished from me!" And the best of people is he who is humble before God.

Among them is that one does not take his belongings and carry them to his home, which is contrary to the custom of the humble. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to do that. And Ali, may God honor his face, said: "Carrying something to his family does not diminish a perfect man from his perfection." And Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, while he was a commander, would carry a wooden bucket of his to the bathhouse. And Thabit ibn Abi Malik said: "I saw Abu Hurayrah coming from the market carrying a bundle of firewood, while he was at that time the deputy of Marwan. He said: 'Make way for the commander, O son of Abi Malik!'" And from al-Asbagh ibn Nabanah, he said: "It is as if I see Umar, may God be pleased with him, with meat hung in his left hand and in his right hand a whip, going around the markets until he entered his dwelling." And some of them said: "I saw Ali, may God be pleased with him, who had bought meat for a dirham and carried it in his cloak. I said to him: 'Shall I carry it for you, O Commander of the Faithful?' He said: 'No, the father of the household is more entitled to carry.'"

And among them is clothing, for through it arrogance and humility are manifested. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Simplicity in dress is from faith." Harun said: "I asked Ma'bad about 'simplicity in dress,' and he said: 'It is the lowly among garments.'" And Zayd ibn Wahb said: "I saw Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, go out to the market with a whip in his hand, wearing a waist-wrapper with fourteen patches, some of them of leather." And Ali, may God honor his face, was reproached for a patched waist-wrapper, and he said: "The believer takes him as an example, and the heart is humbled by it." And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Finery of garments is pride in the heart." And Tawus said: "I wash these two garments of mine, and my heart disapproves as long as they are clean." And it is narrated that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, may God have mercy on him, before he became caliph, a robe would be bought for him for a thousand dinars, and he would say: "How excellent it is, were it not for the coarseness in it!" But when he became caliph, a garment would be bought for him for five dirhams, and he would say: "How excellent it is, were it not for its softness!" So it was said to him: "Where are your clothes, your mounts, and your perfume, O Commander of the Faithful?" He said: "I have a soul that savors, and it has not tasted any level of this world except it longed for the level above it, until when it tasted the caliphate, which is the highest of levels, it longed for what is with God, the Mighty and Majestic." And Sa'id ibn Suwayd said: "Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz led us in the Friday prayer, then he sat while wearing a shirt with a patched collar in front and behind. A man said to him: 'O Commander of the Faithful, God has given to you, so why not wear (better)?' He lowered his head for a long while, then raised his head and said: 'The best moderation is in times of plenty, and the best pardon is in times of power.'" And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever forsakes the adornment of God and puts on good garments and humility for God, seeking His pleasure, it is a right upon God to store for him the perfume of Paradise."

If you say: Indeed, Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Fine garments are the pride of the heart." And our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about elegance in clothing—is it from arrogance? He replied, "No, but it is from squandering the truth and belittling people." So how can the path of reconciling the two be understood? Know then that a new garment does not necessarily entail arrogance for every person in every situation. This is what the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, alluded to, and it is what he recognized in the condition of Thabit ibn Qays when he said: "I am a man to whom beauty—as you see—has been made beloved." Thus, he knew that his inclination toward cleanliness and fine garments was not to be arrogant over others, for it is not necessarily from arrogance. Yet it may be from arrogance, just as contentment with inferior clothing may be from humility. The sign of the arrogant one is that he seeks adornment when people see him, but cares not how he is when alone. The sign of the one seeking beauty is that he loves beauty in everything, even in his solitude and even in the cat of his house; that is not from arrogance. When the circumstances are distinguished, the statement of Jesus, peace be upon him, applies to some situations, with his saying "pride of the heart" meaning it may engender pride in the heart. And the statement of our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, "It is not from arrogance" means that arrogance does not necessitate it, and it is possible that arrogance does not necessitate it, yet it may be an engenderer of arrogance.

In summary, states differ in such matters, and the beloved middle path in clothing is that which does not attract notice for its excellence nor for its shabbiness. The Prophet ﷺ said, "Eat, drink, clothe yourselves, and give charity without extravagance or pride." "Indeed, Allah loves to see the effect of His blessing upon His servant." And Bakr ibn 'Abdullah al-Muzani said, "Wear the garments of kings and let your hearts die in awe," addressing thereby a people who seek pride in the garments of the righteous. And 'Isa, peace be upon him, said, "Why do you come to me wearing the garments of monks while your hearts are the hearts of ravenous wolves? Wear the garments of kings and let your hearts die in awe."

And among them is to humble oneself by enduring when insulted, harmed, or deprived of one's right, for that is the foundation. We have previously cited what has been transmitted from the early pious regarding enduring harm in the Book of Anger and Envy. In summary, the epitome of noble character and humility is the conduct of the Prophet ﷺ in this regard, so one ought to emulate him and learn from him. Abu Salama said: I asked Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, "What is your view concerning what people have newly introduced in terms of clothing, drink, mounts, and food?" He replied, "O my nephew, eat for the sake of God, drink for the sake of God, and clothe yourself for the sake of God. Anything of that in which pride, ostentation, hypocrisy, or reputation enters is sinful and wasteful. And attend in your home to the service that the Messenger of God ﷺ used to attend to in his home: he would feed the draft animal, tie the camel, sweep the house, milk the sheep, mend the sandal, patch the garment, eat with his servant, and grind for him when he was tired. He would buy something from the market and was not prevented by shyness from carrying it in his hand or placing it in the fold of his garment. He would return to his family, shaking hands with the rich and the poor, the elder and the younger. He would initiate greetings to everyone he met, whether small or great, black or red, or a slave among the people of prayer. He had no special garment for entering and no special garment for exiting. He was not ashamed to accept an invitation if called, even if disheveled and dusty, nor did he disdain what he was invited to, even if he found nothing but dry, inferior dates. He did not postpone a lunch for a dinner nor a dinner for a lunch. He was easy in provision, gentle in disposition, noble in nature, beautiful in companionship, cheerful of face with a smile but not laughter, sorrowful without frowning, firm without harshness, humble without humiliation, generous without extravagance, merciful to every relative and Muslim, tender-hearted, constantly lowering his gaze. He never belched from satiety nor stretched out his hand from greed." Abu Salama said: Then I entered upon 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, and related to her what Abu Sa'id said concerning the asceticism of the Messenger of God ﷺ. She said, "He did not err in a single word, yet he fell short, for he did not inform you that the Messenger of God ﷺ never filled his belly with satiety, nor did he ever complain to anyone. Indeed, poverty was more beloved to him than affluence and wealth. He would sometimes remain hungry, twisting through the night until morning, yet that did not prevent him from fasting his day. Had he wished to ask his Lord, He would have brought him the treasures of the earth, its fruits, and its comfortable living from the east and west of the earth, he would have done so. Sometimes I would weep in compassion for him due to the hunger he was given, and I would stroke his belly with my hand and say, 'May my soul be your ransom! If only you would take from the world enough to sustain you and protect you from hunger?' He would say, 'O 'A'isha, my brothers among the resolute messengers endured what is more severe than this and passed on in their state, presenting themselves to their Lord, so He honored their return and multiplied their reward. I find myself ashamed if I were to live in comfort that I would fall short of them. So I endure a few days that are more beloved to me than that my portion tomorrow in the Hereafter be diminished. There is nothing more beloved to me than joining my brothers and my companions.'" 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said, "By God, he did not complete a week after that until God, the Mighty and Majestic, took him."

The accounts of his character ﷺ encompass the totality of the morals of the humble. Whoever seeks humility, let him follow his example. And whoever sees himself above his station ﷺ and is not content for himself with what He was content with, how profound is his ignorance! For indeed, He was the greatest of God's creation in rank in this world and in religion. Thus, there is no honor nor elevation except in emulating Him.

It is for this reason that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "We are a people whom God has honored with Islam, so we shall never seek honor in anything else," when he was reproached for the simplicity of his appearance upon entering Syria. And Abu al-Darda' said: "Know that God has servants who are called the 'Substitutes' (al-Abdal), successors to the Prophets; they are the pegs of the earth. When prophethood ended, God replaced them with a people from the community of Muhammad ﷺ. They do not surpass others through abundant fasting or prayer, nor through fine adornment, but through sincere piety, good intention, purity of heart towards all Muslims, and sincere counsel for them, seeking God's pleasure—with patience devoid of cowardice and humility devoid of abasement. They are a people whom God has chosen and selected for Himself. They are forty righteous ones, or thirty men, whose hearts are upon the certainty of Abraham, the Friend of the Merciful, peace be upon him. Not one of them dies until God has raised up someone to succeed him.

And know, O my brother, that they curse nothing, harm nothing, belittle nothing, act arrogantly over nothing, envy no one, and do not covet this world. They are the purest of people in goodness, the gentlest in disposition, the most generous in soul. Their mark is generosity, their nature is cheerfulness, and their attribute is safety. They are not today in fear and tomorrow in heedlessness, but are constant in their outward state, while between them and their Lord, the raging winds and swift horses cannot overtake them. Their hearts ascend, delighting in God and yearning for Him, and they are foremost in racing towards good deeds. 'These are the party of God. Unquestionably, the party of God—they are the successful.'

The narrator said: I said, 'O Abu al-Darda', I have not heard a description more daunting to me than this description. How can I attain it?' He said: 'Nothing stands between you and being among its broadest ranks except that you despise the world. For if you despise the world, you will turn to the love of the Hereafter. In proportion to your love for the Hereafter, you will renounce the world, and in proportion to that, you will perceive what benefits you. And when God knows of a servant's sincere seeking, He pours upon him correctness and envelops him with protection.'

And know, O my nephew, that this is in the Book of God, the Exalted, which was revealed: 'Indeed, God is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.' Yahya ibn Kathir said: 'We reflected upon that, and we found that those who take delight take no delight comparable to the love of God and the pursuit of His pleasure.'

O God, make us among those who love You, O Lord of the worlds, for none is fit for Your love except whom You have approved. And may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and companions and grant them peace.

Explanation of the Method for Treating Arrogance and Acquiring Humility for Him

Know that arrogance is among the destructive traits, and no one among creation is free from some measure of it. Its removal is an individual obligation, and it does not vanish by mere wishing, but rather through treatment and the application of remedies that suppress it. In its treatment, there are two stations: the first is uprooting its origin from its rootstock and tearing out its tree from its planting place in the heart. The second is repelling its incidental manifestations through the causes by which a person becomes arrogant toward others.

The first station concerns uprooting its origin, and its treatment is both theoretical and practical; healing is not complete except through their combination:

As for the knowledge-based aspect: it is that he knows himself and knows his Lord, exalted be He, and that suffices him in removing arrogance. For whenever he knows himself with true knowledge, he knows that he is more abased than every abased one and lesser than every insignificant thing, and that nothing befits him except humility, lowliness, and abasement. And when he knows his Lord, he knows that grandeur and majesty are fitting only for God. As for knowing his Lord, His greatness, and His glory, discourse on that is lengthy, and it is the ultimate knowledge of unveiling. As for knowing himself, it is also lengthy, but we mention from it what is beneficial in arousing humility and lowliness. It suffices him to know the meaning of a single verse in the Book of God, for the Qur’an is the knowledge of the ancients and the later ones for him whose insight has been opened. And He, exalted be He, has said: “Perish man! How ungrateful he is! From what thing did He create him? From a drop of sperm He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He causes him to die and buries him. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him.” The verse points to the beginning of man’s creation: he was not a thing remembered, and he was in the realm of non-existence for ages—indeed, his non-existence had no beginning. And what thing is more vile and lesser than obliteration and non-existence? He was such in pre-eternity. Then God created him from the vilest of things, then from the filthiest of them, for He created him from dust, then from a drop, then from a clinging clot, then from a lump of flesh, then He made him bones, then He clothed the bones with flesh. This was the beginning of his existence when he became a thing remembered. He did not become a thing remembered except while possessing the vilest of attributes and descriptions! For he was not created perfect at his beginning; rather, He created him as an inanimate, dead thing—hearing not, seeing not, feeling not, moving not, speaking not, grasping not, perceiving not, knowing not. He began with his death before his life, with his weakness before his strength, with his ignorance before his knowledge, with his blindness before his sight, with his deafness before his hearing, with his muteness before his speech, with his misguidance before his guidance, with his poverty before his wealth, and with his incapacity before his power. This is the meaning of His saying: “From what thing did We create man? From a mixed drop,” and the meaning of His saying: “Has there come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing remembered? Indeed, We created man from a mixed drop to test him.” Thus He created him first, then bestowed favor upon him, saying: “Then He made the way easy for him.” This points to what is facilitated for him during the span of his life until death. And likewise He said: “From a mixed drop We test him, and We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful.” Its meaning is that He gave him life after he was an inanimate, dead thing—first dust, then a drop; and He gave him hearing after he was deaf, and sight after he lacked vision, and strength after weakness, and knowledge after ignorance, and created for him limbs with their wonders and signs after their absence, and enriched him after poverty, and satisfied him after hunger, and clothed him after nakedness, and guided him after misguidance. So consider how He managed him and formed him, and to the way how He made it easy, and to the insolence of man how ungrateful he is, and to the ignorance of man how He manifests it? He said: “Does man not consider that We created him from a drop, and at once he is a clear adversary? And of His signs is that He created you from dust, then, at once, you are human beings dispersing.” So look at God’s favor upon him, how He transferred him from that lowliness, insignificance, vileness, and filth to this elevation and honor, so that he became existent after non-existence, alive after death, speaking after muteness, seeing after blindness, strong after weakness, knowing after ignorance, guided after misguidance, capable after incapacity, and rich after poverty? In his essence he was nothing, and what is viler than nothing? And what insignificance is less than pure non-existence? Then through God he became something. He created him only from the lowly dust that is trodden underfoot and the filthy drop after pure non-existence also to make him know the vileness of his essence, so that he may know himself thereby. And He perfected the favor upon him only that he may know his Lord thereby and know His greatness and majesty, and that majesty is fitting only for Him, glorious and exalted. And for that reason He bestowed favor upon him, saying: “Have We not made for him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips, and guided him to the two paths?” And He made known his vileness first, saying: “Was he not a drop of emitted semen? Then he became a clinging clot.” Then He mentioned His favor upon him, saying: “Then He created and proportioned, and made from him the two sexes, male and female,” so that his existence may endure through reproduction, just as his existence first occurred through origination. So he whose beginning is this and whose states are these—from where does he get arrogance, pride, boasting, and haughtiness, when in truth he is the vilest of the vile and the weakest of the weak? But this is the habit of the base one: when raised from his baseness, he turns up his nose and acts arrogantly, and that is due to the baseness of his origin. And there is no power nor strength except with God. Indeed, if He had perfected him and entrusted his affair to him and perpetuated his existence by his own choice, it would be permissible for him to transgress and forget the beginning and the end. But He subjected him, in the continuity of his existence, to formidable illnesses, great ailments, diverse afflictions, and conflicting temperaments—from bile, phlegm, wind, and blood—some parts of his components nullifying others, whether he wills or refuses, is pleased or displeased. So he hungers unwillingly, thirsts unwillingly, falls ill unwillingly, and dies unwillingly. He possesses for himself neither benefit nor harm, neither good nor evil. He wishes to know a thing but is ignorant of it; he wishes to remember a thing but forgets it; he wishes to forget a thing and be heedless of it but is not heedless of it; he wishes to turn his heart to what concerns him, but it wanders through valleys of whisperings and thoughts by compulsion. So he does not possess his own heart, nor his own soul. He desires a thing, and perhaps his destruction lies in it; he dislikes a thing, and perhaps his life lies in it. He delights in foods, and they destroy him and ruin him; he is satiated by medicines, and they benefit him and revive him. And he is not secure for a moment of his night or day from having his hearing and sight taken away, his limbs paralyzed, his intellect snatched, his spirit seized, and all that he desires in his worldly life stripped from him. Thus he is compelled and lowly: if left, he remains; if seized, he perishes—a slave, owned, incapable of anything concerning himself or anything concerning others. So what thing is more abased than him, if he knew himself? And how could arrogance be fitting for him, were it not for his ignorance? This is the intermediate state of his condition; so let him reflect upon it.

As for its end and final destination, it is death, alluded to in the saying of the Exalted: "Then He causes him to die and places him in a grave. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him." Its meaning is that He strips him of his spirit, his hearing, his sight, his knowledge, his power, his sensation, his perception, and his movement, so he returns to inanimate matter as he was at first. Nothing remains but the form of his limbs and his shape, with no sensation or movement within him. Then he is placed in the earth and becomes a putrid, foul carcass, just as he was initially a despised drop of fluid. Then his limbs decay, his parts disintegrate, his bones crumble, and he becomes scattered remains, dust. Worms consume his parts, beginning with his pupils, plucking them out, and his cheeks, cutting through them, and all his other parts, until he becomes dung in the bellies of worms and a carcass from which animals flee, which every person finds repulsive and flees from due to the intensity of the stench. The best of his states is to return to what he was, becoming dust from which cups are made and from which buildings are constructed, so he becomes lost after having been present. He becomes as if he had not prospered yesterday, reaped, just as he was in the beginning of his affair for a long duration. Would that he had remained thus! How excellent it would have been if he had been left as dust. Nay, rather He will revive him after long decay to suffer severe torment. He will emerge from his grave after his scattered parts are gathered, and he will go out to the terrors of the Resurrection. He will see a Resurrection standing, a sky split and torn apart, an earth transformed, mountains set in motion, stars fallen, a sun eclipsed, and dark conditions, and harsh, severe angels, and Hellfire blazing, and a Paradise which the criminal looks upon and laments. He will see scrolls unfurled, and it will be said to him, "Read your book!" He will say, "And what is it?" It will be said: "There were assigned over you, in the life in which you rejoiced, boasted in its comforts, and took pride in its means, two recording angels writing upon you what you uttered or did, be it little or much, small or large, eating and drinking, standing and sitting. You had forgotten that, but Allah has enumerated it for you. So come now to the reckoning and prepare to answer, or be driven to the abode of punishment." His heart will be severed in terror from the dread of this address before the scroll is even spread open and he witnesses what is in it of his disgrace. When he witnesses it, he will say, "Woe to us! What is with this book that leaves nothing small or great but that it has enumerated it?" This is the end of his affair, and it is the meaning of the saying of the Exalted, "Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him." So what is there for one in this state for pride and self-aggrandizement? Rather, what is there for him for joy in a single moment, let alone for insolence and wantonness? Indeed, the beginning and middle of his state have become clear to him. If its end were to become clear—and refuge is with Allah, the Exalted Lord—perhaps he would choose to be a dog or a swine, to end up as dust with the beasts and not be a human who hears an address or meets punishment. Even if he is, with Allah, deserving of the Fire, the swine is more noble, cleaner, and higher than him, for its beginning is dust and its end is dust, and it is removed from the reckoning and the torment. And people do not flee from the dog and the swine.

If the people of this world were to see the sinful servant in the Fire, they would be struck senseless from the horror of his state and the ugliness of his form. Were they to smell his odor, they would die from its foulness. Were a single drop of the drink he is given to fall into the oceans of the world, they would become more putrid than carrion. Given that this is his ultimate state—unless God pardons him, and he is in doubt of that pardon—how can he rejoice and be arrogant? How can he be haughty and tyrannical? How can he see himself as anything, to the point of believing he possesses merit? And what servant has not committed a sin deserving punishment, were it not for the pardon of the Generous God by His grace, mending the broken by His favor? Hope for that is from His generosity and having a good opinion of Him. There is no power except with God.

Consider one who commits a crime against a king, deserving for his crime a thousand lashes. He is held in prison, awaiting to be brought out for public display where the punishment will be carried out before a crowd, not knowing whether he will be pardoned or not. How would his humiliation be in that prison? Do you think he would act arrogantly towards the other prisoners? There is no sinful servant except that this world is his prison, and he has deserved punishment from God Almighty, not knowing what his final outcome will be. This alone should suffice as grief, fear, apprehension, degradation, and humiliation for him. This is the intellectual remedy that uproots the foundation of pride.

As for the practical remedy, it is humility before God through action, and towards all creation by consistently adopting the manners of the humble, as we have described and narrated from the states of the righteous and from the states of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)—to the extent that he would eat on the ground and say, "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats." Salman was asked, "Why do you not wear new clothes?" He replied, "I am but a servant. If I am emancipated one day, I will wear new clothes," alluding to emancipation in the Hereafter. Humility is not perfected after knowledge except through action. For this reason, the Arabs who were arrogant towards God and His Messenger were commanded with faith and prayer together. It is said prayer is the pillar of religion. In prayer are secrets for which it is a pillar, among them what it contains of humility by standing in presence, bowing, and prostrating. The Arabs of old used to disdain bowing. If a man's whip fell from his hand, he would not bend to pick it up. If his sandal strap broke, he would not lower his head to fix it. Hakim ibn Hizam even said, "I pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the condition that I would not prostrate except while standing," and the Prophet (peace be upon him) accepted his pledge. Later, he gained understanding and perfected his faith. Since prostration was, to them, the ultimate in humiliation and lowliness, they were commanded with it so that their arrogance might thereby be broken, their pride removed, and humility established in their hearts. All creation is commanded with this, for bowing, prostrating, and standing in presence are the actions demanded by humility. Likewise, let one who knows himself observe every action that pride demands and persist in its opposite until humility becomes his ingrained character. For hearts do not become adorned with praiseworthy traits except through both knowledge and action, due to the subtle connection between hearts and limbs and the secret link between the realm of dominion and the realm of sovereignty. The heart belongs to the realm of sovereignty, the second station regarding what occurs of pride due to the seven mentioned causes. We have mentioned in the Book of the Condemnation of Worldly Status that true perfection is knowledge and action. As for what is besides that, which perishes with death, it is an illusory perfection. From this, it is difficult for a knowledgeable person not to be proud, but we mention the path of remedy through knowledge and action for all seven causes.

The First: Lineage. Let one afflicted with pride due to lineage treat his heart by knowing two matters. The first is that this is ignorance, for he is exalting himself through the perfection of another. Thus it is said:
If you boast of forefathers of nobility, you have spoken truth, but vile is what they begot.

The one who boasts of lineage, if he is base in his own attributes, how can his baseness be compensated by the perfection of another? Indeed, if the one he claims lineage to were alive, he would have the right to say: The excellence is mine; and who are you? You are but a worm created from my urine. Do you suppose that the worm created from a human's urine is nobler than the worm from a horse's urine? Far from it! Rather, they are equal, and the nobility belongs to the human, not to the worm. The second is to know his true lineage, to know his father and his forefather. For his immediate father is a filthy drop, and his distant forefather is lowly dust. And God the Exalted has made his lineage known, saying, "He who perfected everything He created and began the creation of man from clay. Then He made his progeny from an extract of a despised fluid." So from his origin is the despised dust that is trodden underfoot, then He fermented the clay until it became stinking black mud—how can he be arrogant? The most vile of things is that to which he traces his lineage, for it is said: O you who are more abased than dust, and more foul-smelling than black mud, and more filthy than a clot of blood.

If his being from his father is closer than his being from dust, then we say: he boasts of the near while disregarding the distant. Yet the sperm-drop and the embryo are closer to him than the father, so let him despise himself by that. Then, if that proximity necessitates elevation, the father is more elevated than dust—so from where does his elevation come? And if he himself possesses no elevation, from where would elevation come to his offspring? Thus, his origin is from dust and his extraction is from a sperm-drop; he has neither true origin nor noble extraction. This is the ultimate baseness of lineage: the origin is trodden underfoot, and the extraction is washed from the bodies. This is the true lineage of man. Whoever knows it will not grow arrogant because of lineage, and his state after this knowledge and the unveiling of the veil concerning the reality of his origin will be like that of a man who always considered himself among the Banu Hashim—his parents having informed him of that—so that pride of nobility remained in him. Then, while he was in that state, trustworthy persons, in whose words he had no doubt, informed him that he was the son of an Indian cupper who handled filth, and they uncovered for him the face of the deception practiced upon him, so no doubt remained in him of their truthfulness. Do you think that would leave anything of his arrogance? No, rather he would become in his own eyes the most contemptible and lowly of people. Thus, from feeling the disgrace of his baseness, he becomes too occupied to be arrogant over others. This is the state of the insightful one when he reflects on his origin and knows that he is from a sperm-drop, an embryo, and dust.

For if his father were one who carried dust or handled blood through cupping or the like, he would know the baseness of his own self because of his father’s limbs coming into contact with dust and blood—so how when he knows that he himself is from dust and blood and the filthy things from which he himself would recoil? The second cause: arrogance due to beauty. Its remedy is that he look at his interior with the gaze of the intelligent, not with the gaze of beasts. Whenever he looks at his interior, he sees such ugliness that it clouds over his pride in beauty, for he is entrusted with filth in all his parts: excrement in his intestines, urine in his bladder, mucus in his nose, spittle in his mouth, dirt in his ears, blood in his veins, pus beneath his skin, and stench under his armpits. He washes the filth with his hand every day once or twice, and he goes to the privy every day once or twice to expel from his interior what, if he saw it with his eye, he would find filthy—let alone touch it or smell it. All of this is so that he may recognize his filthiness and lowliness, and this is in his intermediate state.

At the beginning of his affair, he was created from the repulsive forms of filth—from the sperm-drop and menstrual blood—and he emerged from the passage of filth: he came out from the loins, then from the male organ, the passage of urine; then from the womb, the outflow of menstrual blood; then he emerged from the passage of filth. Anas, may God have mercy on him, said: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, would preach to us and make us despise ourselves, saying, “Each of you has come out from the passage of urine twice.” Likewise, Tawus said to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, “What is this strutting of one whose belly contains excrement?” when he saw him swaggering—and that was said before his caliphate, and this is its beginning and its middle.

If a person were to neglect his body for a single day during his life, failing to attend to its cleansing and washing, foulness and filth would arise from him, and he would become more putrid and foul than neglected animals that never attend to themselves. When he reflects that he was created from impurities, dwells amidst impurities, and will die to become a carcass more repulsive than all other impurities, he will not boast of his beauty, which is like the greenness atop dung or the color of flowers in the wilderness—only to become scattered dust blown by the winds. How could it be otherwise? Even if his beauty were to remain and he were free from such repulsiveness, he should not grow arrogant over the ugly, for the ugliness of the ugly is not due to him so that he might reject it, nor is the beauty of the beautiful due to him so that he might be praised for it. How could it be, when there is no permanence to it? Rather, at every moment, it is conceivable that it may vanish due to illness, smallpox, sores, or any other cause. How many beautiful faces have been marred by such causes? Knowledge of these matters uproots from the heart the disease of pride in beauty for one who ponders them deeply.

The third cause: Pride in one's strength and capabilities. What prevents this is knowing what afflictions and illnesses have been empowered over him—that if a single vein in his hand were to ache, he would become more incapacitated than any incapacitated person and more humbled than any humbled one; that if a fly were to snatch something from him, he could not retrieve it; that if a louse were to enter his nose or an ant his ear, it would kill him; that if a thorn were to enter his foot, it would incapacitate him; and that a single day of fever can dissolve from his strength what cannot be restored in a long time. So how can one who cannot endure a thorn, nor resist a louse, nor has the power to ward off a fly from himself, take pride in his strength? Moreover, even if a person is strong, he is not stronger than a donkey, a cow, an elephant, or a camel. What pride is there in a trait wherein beasts surpass you?

The fourth and fifth causes: wealth and abundance of possessions, and in this same meaning, numerous followers and supporters, and arrogance due to proximity to rulers and empowerment through them. All of this is arrogance based on something external to the essence of a person, like beauty, strength, or knowledge. This is the ugliest form of arrogance, for one who is arrogant due to his wealth is as if arrogant due to his horse or his house; if his horse were to die and his house collapse, he would return to a state of humiliation. And one who is arrogant due to the empowerment and proximity of a ruler, not due to a quality within himself, has built his affair upon a heart more turbulent than a boiling cauldron, for if it changes against him, he becomes the most humiliated of creation. Every person arrogant due to a matter external to his essence is clearly ignorant. How can it be otherwise, when the one arrogant due to wealth, if he were to reflect, would see among the Jews those who surpass him in wealth, riches, and adornment? Fie upon an honor that a Jew precedes you in! And fie upon an honor that a thief can take in a single moment, leaving its possessor humiliated and destitute? These are causes not inherent in his essence, and that which is in his essence is not within his power to perpetuate its existence, and in the Hereafter it will be a cause of ruin and punishment. Therefore, boasting about it is the height of ignorance. Everything that is not within your power is not truly yours. Not a single one of these matters is within your power, but rather belongs to the One who bestowed it; if He preserves it for you, it remains, and if He reclaims it, it departs from you. You are but a possessed slave, incapable of anything. Whoever truly knows this, his arrogance must inevitably vanish.

An example of this is when the heedless one boasts of his strength, beauty, wealth, freedom, independence, spacious dwellings, numerous horses, and servants. Then two just witnesses testify against him before a fair judge, declaring that he is a slave belonging to so-and-so, and that his parents were both owned by him. This is established and ruled upon by the judge. His master then comes, seizes him, and takes all that is in his possession. Moreover, he fears that his master will punish and chastise him for his negligence with the wealth and his failure to diligently seek his master to acknowledge his ownership. Then the slave looks and sees himself imprisoned in a dwelling surrounded by snakes, scorpions, and venomous creatures, living in constant dread of each one. He remains possessing neither himself nor his wealth, knowing no way of escape whatsoever. Do you think someone in such a state would boast of his power, riches, strength, and perfection? Or would he rather humble himself and submit? This is the state of every rational person who comes to realization: he sees himself thus, possessing no control over his own neck, body, limbs, or wealth, while being amidst afflictions, desires, illnesses, and maladies that are like scorpions and snakes, from which he fears destruction. One in such a condition does not grow arrogant with his strength and power, for he knows he has no power and no strength. This is the way to cure arrogance arising from external causes, and it is easier than curing arrogance arising from knowledge and deeds, for these two are perfections within the soul worthy of rejoicing over. Yet, arrogance from them is also a form of hidden ignorance, as we shall mention.

The sixth cause: Arrogance due to knowledge, which is the greatest of afflictions, the most prevalent of maladies, and the farthest from accepting treatment except with extreme severity and immense effort. This is because the status of knowledge is great with God and with people, and it is greater than the status of wealth, beauty, and others. Indeed, they have no status at all unless accompanied by knowledge and action. Therefore, Ka'b al-Ahbar said: "Knowledge has a rebelliousness like the rebelliousness of wealth." Likewise, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "When a scholar slips, a world slips with his slip." The scholar is incapable of not esteeming himself in comparison to the ignorant due to the abundance with which the Sacred Law has spoken of the virtues of knowledge.

A scholar will only be able to repel arrogance by knowing two matters: First, that he knows God's argument against the people of knowledge is more stringent, and that He tolerates from the ignorant what He would not tolerate a tenth of from the scholar. For whoever disobeys God Almighty with knowledge and awareness, his transgression is more heinous, as he has not fulfilled the right of God's favor upon him in knowledge. Therefore, He said: "The scholar will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown into the Fire, and his intestines will spill out, and he will circle with them as a donkey circles a millstone. The people of the Fire will gather around him and say, 'What is wrong with you?' He will say, 'I used to command good and not do it, and forbid evil and do it.'" God Almighty has likened the one who knows but does not act to the donkey and the dog. He said: "The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Torah but did not uphold it is that of a donkey carrying volumes." He meant by this the scholars of the Jews. And regarding Balaam son of Beor, He said: "And recite to them the story of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he detached himself from them..." until "...His likeness is that of a dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he pants." Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "He was given knowledge of the Book, but he clung to the desires of the earth"—meaning, his love for this world settled in his heart. So which scholar has not followed his desire? And which scholar has not commanded good that he himself does not do? Whenever a scholar feels the greatness of his status compared to the ignorant, let him reflect on the great peril he faces, for his peril is greater than the peril of others, just as his status is greater than the status of others; this corresponds to that. It is like a king who risks his soul in his kingdom due to the multitude of his enemies; if he is captured and subdued, he wishes he had been a pauper. How many a scholar wishes in the Hereafter for the safety of the ignorant? We seek refuge in God from that. This peril prevents arrogance, for if he is among the people of the Fire, the swine is better than him, so how can one in such a state be arrogant?

The scholar should not consider himself greater than the Companions, may God be pleased with them, when some of them would say, "Would that my mother had not borne me!" Another would take a stalk of straw from the ground and say, "Would that I were this stalk!" Another would say, "Would that I were a bird to be eaten!" And another would say, "Would that I had not been a thing remembered!" All of that out of fear of the peril of the outcome. They considered themselves in a worse state than birds and dust. Whenever he prolongs his reflection on the peril he faces, his arrogance vanishes completely, and he sees himself as if he were the worst of creation.

Its example is that of a slave whose master ordered him with certain matters, and he began them, but he left some, introduced deficiency into some, and doubted concerning some whether he performed them as his master would be pleased or not. Then an informer told him that his master had sent a messenger to him who would not bring him out of all he was in except naked and humiliated, and would cast him at his door in the heat and sun for a long time, until when his affair became straitened and exertion overwhelmed him, he would order his account to be taken and all his deeds, small and large, to be scrutinized, then order him to a constricted prison and perpetual punishment, not relieved for an hour. And he knows that his master has done the like of that to groups of his slaves and pardoned some, and he does not know of which group he will be. If he reflects on that, his soul is broken, he is humbled, his pride and arrogance are nullified, and his sorrow and fear become apparent. He does not become arrogant over any of creation; rather, he humbles himself hoping that they might be his intercessors when the punishment descends. Likewise, when the scholar reflects on what he has neglected of his Lord's commands through transgressions with his limbs and inward sins of ostentation, malice, envy, vanity, hypocrisy, and others, and knows the great peril he faces, his arrogance inevitably leaves him.

The second matter is that the scholar knows that arrogance is not fitting except for God, the Exalted and Glorified, alone, and that if he becomes arrogant, he becomes detested and odious in the sight of God. God has loved from him that he be humble and said to him: "You have a standing with Me so long as you do not see a standing for yourself. But if you see a standing for yourself, then you have no standing with Me." Thus, he must compel himself to what his Master loves from him. This removes arrogance from his heart, even if he is certain, for example, that he has no sin or imagines that. And by this, arrogance was removed from the Prophets, peace be upon them, for they knew that whoever contests God, the Exalted, for the mantle of majesty, He will break him. God commanded them to humble themselves so that their station with God would be magnified. This, too, inevitably prompts him toward humility.

If you ask: How can one humble oneself before an open sinner or an innovator, and how can one see oneself as inferior to them when one is a knowledgeable worshipper? How can one be ignorant of the merit of knowledge and worship before God Almighty, and how can it suffice for one to merely consider the status of knowledge while knowing that the status of sin and innovation is greater? Know that this is only possible by reflecting on the peril of the final outcome. Indeed, if one were to look at an unbeliever, it would be impossible to feel pride over him, for one imagines that the unbeliever may embrace Islam and end with faith, while this scholar may go astray and end with disbelief. The truly great is he who is great in the sight of God in the Hereafter. The dog and the swine are of higher rank than one who, in God's sight, is among the people of Hell—and one does not know this. How many a Muslim looked upon 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, before his Islam and despised and scorned him for his unbelief, yet God granted him Islam and he surpassed all Muslims except Abu Bakr alone? Outcomes are concealed from the servants, and the wise person looks only to the final outcome. All virtues in this world are sought for the sake of the outcome. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the servant not to be proud over anyone. If he looks at an ignorant person, he says: This one disobeyed God out of ignorance, while I disobeyed Him with knowledge—so he is more excusable than I. If he looks at a scholar, he says: This one knows what I do not know—how can I be like him? If he looks at an elder older than himself, he says: This one obeyed God before me—how can I be like him? If he looks at a youth, he says: I disobeyed God before him—how can I be like him? If he looks at an innovator or an unbeliever, he says: How do I know? Perhaps he will end with Islam, and I will end with what he is upon now. For the permanence of guidance is not in my hands, just as its beginning was not in my hands. By contemplating the final outcome, one is able to remove pride from oneself. All of this is by knowing that perfection lies in the bliss of the Hereafter and nearness to God, not in what appears in this world—that which has no permanence. By my life, this peril is shared between the one who is proud and the one over whom pride is taken! But it is incumbent upon each individual to direct his concern to himself and occupy his heart with fear for his own outcome, not to busy himself with fear for others. For the compassionate one is prone to suspicion, and every person's compassion is for himself. If a group is imprisoned for a crime and promised that their necks will be struck, they do not indulge in pride over one another, even if the peril encompasses them all, for each one is preoccupied with himself from attending to the concerns of others—as if each one were alone in his calamity and peril.

If you ask: How can I despise the innovator and the sinner for God's sake, when I am commanded to despise them, yet at the same time show humility toward them? For combining these two seems contradictory. Know that this is a matter of confusion that perplexes most people, for your anger for God in rejecting innovation and sin becomes mixed with the pride of the self and the arrogance born of knowledge and piety. How many an ignorant worshipper or a deluded scholar, upon seeing a sinner sitting beside him, is disturbed in his presence and withdraws in a state of hidden inner pride, while imagining that he is angered for God's sake—as occurred with the worshipper of the Children of Israel in relation to their libertine? This is because pride toward the obedient is clearly evil and it is possible to be wary of it, whereas pride toward the sinner and the innovator resembles anger for God, which is good. For the angry one also behaves arrogantly toward the object of his anger, and the arrogant one becomes angry; each begets and necessitates the other. They are blended and confused, and none can distinguish between them save those who are divinely guided.

What will deliver you from this is that three matters be present in your heart when encountering an innovator or a sinner, or when commanding them to good and forbidding them from evil: The first is your turning to what has preceded of your own sins and misdeeds, so that your stature may thereby become small in your own eyes. The second is that your consideration of what distinguishes you—knowledge, holding to the truth, and righteous action—be from the perspective that these are a favor from God Most High upon you, so the grace therein belongs to Him, not to you. Thus you see that as coming from Him, so that you do not become impressed with yourself; and if you are not impressed, you will not become arrogant. The third is considering the obscurity of your own outcome, and your outcome is that perhaps He may seal you with evil and seal him with goodness, so that fear preoccupies you from being arrogant toward him.

If you ask: How can I be angry in such states? I say: Be angry for your Master and Lord, since He commanded you to be angry for His sake, not for your own. And in your anger, you do not see yourself as saved and your companion as doomed. Rather, your fear for yourself—due to what God knows of the hidden depths of your sins—is greater than your fear for him, given ignorance of the final outcome. I shall make this known to you with an example, so you may learn that it is not necessary, when anger is for God, to be arrogant toward the one you are angry with, or to see your own standing as above his. I say: If a king has a servant and a son who is the apple of his eye, and he entrusts the servant with the son to watch over him, ordering him to strike the son whenever he misbehaves or engages in what is unbecoming, and to be angry with him. If the servant is loving and obedient to his master, he cannot but become angry whenever he sees the son misbehaving. Yet he is angry with him for his master’s sake and because he was commanded to do so, and because he wishes to draw near by obeying his command, and because what his master dislikes has occurred from the son. Thus he strikes the son and is angry with him without arrogance toward him; rather, he is humble before him, seeing the son’s standing with the master as above his own, for the son is undoubtedly more precious than the servant. Therefore, arrogance and lack of humility are not necessary components of anger. Likewise, you can look upon the innovator and the sinner and suppose that perhaps their standing in the Hereafter with God is greater, due to the good that was decreed for them in pre‑eternity, and due to the evil decree that was ordained for you in pre‑eternity—though you are heedless of it. Yet despite this, you become angry by the ruling of the command, out of love for your Master, since what He dislikes has occurred, while remaining humble toward one who may well be closer to Him than you in the Hereafter. Thus it is with some of the wise scholars: fear and humility are joined in them. As for the deluded one, he grows arrogant and hopes more for himself than he hopes for others, in his ignorance of the final outcome—and that is the height of delusion. This, then, is the way of humility toward one who disobeys God or holds to innovation, while being angry with him and keeping away from him by the ruling of the command.

The seventh cause: Arrogance through piety and worship, which is also a great trial for the servants. Its remedy is to instill in one's heart humility toward all servants, by knowing that whoever surpasses him in knowledge should not be looked down upon in any way, due to the recognized virtue of knowledge. The Almighty has said, "Are those who know equal to those who do not know?" and He, exalted is He, said, "The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like my superiority over the lowest of my companions," among other texts that have come regarding the merit of knowledge.

If the worshipper says: "That scholar acts upon his knowledge, while this one is a wicked scholar," it is said to him: Do you not know that good deeds erase evil deeds? And just as knowledge can prevent being a proof against the scholar, so too can it be a means for him and an expiation for his sins. Each of these possibilities is valid, and reports have come that testify to this. Since this matter is hidden from him, it is not permissible for him to despise a scholar; rather, he must show humility toward him.

If you say: "If this is valid, then the scholar should consider himself superior to the worshipper, due to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): 'The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like my superiority over the lowest of my companions'?" Then know that this would only be possible if the scholar knew the final outcome of his affair. Yet the end is uncertain; it is possible that he may die in a state where his standing before God is worse than that of the ignorant sinner, due to a single sin he considered minor but which is grave in God's sight and for which He detests him. Since this is possible, he should be fearful for himself. Thus, when both the worshipper and the scholar are fearful for themselves, and each is responsible for his own soul, not for another's, the dominant attitude regarding oneself should be fear, and regarding others, hope. This prevents arrogance in all circumstances. This is the case of the worshipper in relation to the scholar.

As for those other than the scholar, they are divided in his regard into those whose state is concealed and those whose state is apparent. One should not be arrogant toward those whose state is concealed, for perhaps they have fewer sins and more worship, and a greater love for God, than oneself. As for the one whose condition is apparent, if you see from him only sins that exceed your own over your long life, you still should not be arrogant toward him. Nor can you say he is more sinful than you, for you cannot count the number of your sins over a long life, nor the sins of another over his lifetime, so as to know who is greater in number. However, you may know that his sins are more severe—such as if you see him commit murder, drinking, or hypocrisy. Even then, you should not be arrogant toward him, for sins of the heart—like arrogance, envy, hypocrisy, malice, false beliefs, and insinuating doubts about God's attributes—are all severe in God's sight. Perhaps within your inner self there are hidden sins that make you detested by God, while the outwardly sinful person may possess inward obediences—such as love for God, sincerity, fear, and reverence—that you lack, and through which God may have expiated his evil deeds. On the Day of Resurrection, the veil will be lifted, and you may see him elevated above you by many degrees. This is possible, and what is remotely possible concerning you should be regarded as near if you are truly concerned for yourself. So do not dwell on what is possible for others, but on what is to be feared for yourself, for no soul bears the burden of another, and the punishment of another does not lessen your punishment in the least. If you reflect on this peril, you will be too preoccupied to be arrogant or to consider yourself above others.

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: A servant's intellect is not perfected until it possesses ten traits. He enumerated nine, then reached the tenth and said: The tenth—and what a tenth it is! By it his glory is built, and through these two his renown is elevated: that he sees all people as better than himself. For him, people are only of two groups: a group that is better and higher than he, and a group that is worse and lower. So he humbles himself before both groups in his heart. If he sees someone better than himself, he rejoices at that and wishes to attain his level. If he sees someone worse than himself, he says: Perhaps this one will be saved while I am ruined—so you will only see him fearful of the outcome. And he reflects: Perhaps this one’s outward piety is sincere, so that is better for him; I do not know—perhaps he possesses a noble character between him and God, so God will have mercy on him, accept his repentance, and seal his deeds with the best of works; while my outward piety may be flawed, so that is worse for me. Thus he does not feel secure that the obedience he displays might be tainted by defects that nullify it. Then he said: At that point his intellect is perfected and he becomes the foremost among the people of his time. These are his words.

In sum, whoever considers it possible that he may be wretched in God’s sight—since the decree of wretchedness was ordained in eternity—has no way whatsoever to become arrogant under any circumstance.

Yes indeed, when fear overcomes a person, he sees everyone as better than himself, and that is virtue. As it was related that an ascetic took refuge in a mountain, and it was said to him in a dream: "Go to so-and-so the cobbler and ask him to pray for you." So he went to him and asked him about his deeds. The cobbler informed him that he fasts during the day, earns a living, gives charity, and feeds his family with some of it. The ascetic returned saying: "This is indeed good, but it is not like being free for the obedience of God." Then he was approached in a dream a second time and was told: "Go to so-and-so the cobbler and say to him: 'What is this pallor on your face?'" So he went to him and asked him. The cobbler said to him: "I have not seen anyone among the people but that it occurs to me: he will be saved and I will be ruined." The ascetic said: "It is by this."

What indicates the virtue of this quality is God’s saying, exalted is He: “They give what they give while their hearts tremble, knowing that they are returning to their Lord” — meaning they perform acts of obedience while in a state of great fear that they may not be accepted. And He, exalted is He, said: “Indeed, those who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord.” And He said: “Indeed, we used to be apprehensive before among our families.” God, exalted is He, also described the angels — peace be upon them — despite their sanctity from sins and their constant, diligent worship, with apprehension, saying, informing about them: “They glorify night and day without ceasing, and they are apprehensive from fear of Him.” So whenever apprehension and caution vanish regarding what has been decreed by destiny from eternity — and which is unveiled at the end of one’s term — security from God’s subtle plan prevails, and that necessitates arrogance, which is a cause of perdition. Thus arrogance is a sign of security, and security is ruinous. Humility is a sign of fear, and it brings felicity. Therefore, what the worshiper corrupts by harboring arrogance, contempt for creation, and looking down upon them with disdain is greater than what he rectifies through outward deeds. These are insights by which the disease of arrogance is removed from the heart, and nothing else. Yet, after this knowledge, the soul may feign humility and claim innocence from arrogance while lying. When an occasion arises, it reverts to its nature and forgets its promise. Therefore, one should not be content in treatment with mere knowledge alone; rather, it must be completed by action and tested through the deeds of the humble in situations where arrogance stirs within the soul.

And its explanation is that one tests the soul with five tests, which are proofs for extracting what lies within, even if the tests are many.

The first trial is to debate an issue with one of his peers. If some truth emerges from his companion's tongue, yet he finds it burdensome to accept it, submit to it, acknowledge it, and thank him for alerting him, making him aware, and bringing forth the truth, then that indicates there is hidden arrogance within him. Let him fear God concerning it and occupy himself with its cure. As for the aspect of knowledge, it is by reminding himself of the baseness of his soul and the peril of his end, and that arrogance is not fitting except for God Almighty. As for the aspect of action, it is by compelling himself to do what is burdensome for him: to acknowledge the truth, to set his tongue free with praise and commendation, to admit his own incapacity, and to thank him for the benefit gained, saying: "How excellent is what you have perceived, while I was heedless of it! May God reward you with good for having alerted me to it." For wisdom is the lost property of the believer; whenever he finds it, he should thank the one who guided him to it. If he persists in this repeatedly, it will become second nature to him, the burden of truth will fall from his heart, and accepting it will become pleasant for him. Whenever praising his peers for what is in them becomes burdensome for him, there is arrogance in him. If this is not burdensome for him in solitude but is burdensome in public, then there is no arrogance in him, but rather hypocrisy. Let him treat the hypocrisy with what we have mentioned about severing hope from people, and remind his heart that his benefit lies in his perfection within himself and with God, not with the creation, among other remedies for hypocrisy. If it is burdensome for him both in solitude and in public, then there is both arrogance and hypocrisy in him. Deliverance from one will not benefit him unless he is delivered from the other. Let him treat both diseases, for they are both destructive.

The second test is to gather with peers and equals in assemblies, to give them precedence over oneself, to walk behind them, and to sit in the foremost seats beneath them. If this feels burdensome to him, then he is arrogant; so let him persist in it by exertion until its weight falls away from him, for thereby pride will depart from him. And here lies a snare of Satan: that he sits in the row of sandals or places between himself and his peers some vile persons, thinking that to be humility, when it is the very essence of pride. For that is light upon the hearts of the arrogant, since they imagine they have left their place by merit and favor, thus becoming proud and displaying pride through the show of humility as well. Rather, he should give precedence to his peers and sit among them beside them, without descending from them to the row of sandals, for that is what expels the impurity of pride from within.

The third trial is to answer the call of the poor and to go to the market for the needs of companions and relatives. If this is burdensome for him, it is pride, for these actions are among the noble traits of character, and the reward for them is immense. The soul's aversion to them is only due to an inner corruption, so let him occupy himself with removing it by persisting in these acts while recalling all the insights we have mentioned that remove the disease of pride.

The fourth trial is to carry the needs of oneself, one's family, and one's companions from the market to the home. If one's soul refuses this, it is due to arrogance or ostentation. If it feels burdensome to him despite the nature of the road, it is arrogance. If it only feels burdensome when people are watching, it is ostentation. All of this is from the diseases and destructive ailments of the heart, if not remedied. People have neglected the healing of hearts and busied themselves with healing bodies, even though bodies are inevitably destined for death, while hearts cannot attain felicity except through their soundness, as the Almighty has said: "Save him who comes to God with a sound heart." It is related that 'Abdullah ibn Salam carried a bundle of firewood, and it was said to him, "O Abu Yusuf, you have servants and a daughter who could suffice you!" He said, "Yes, but I wished to test myself to see if it would disdain it." He was not content with what it had given him of resolve to abandon haughtiness until he tested it—whether it was truthful or false. And in the report: "Whoever carries fruit or something has been cleansed of arrogance."

The fifth trial is to wear humble garments, for the soul's aversion to this in public is hypocrisy, and in private it is pride. Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, may God be pleased with him, had a coarse woolen cloak he would wear at night. And He, exalted is He, has said, "Whoever tethers his camel and wears wool has absolved himself of pride." And upon him be peace and blessings, he said, "I am but a servant; I eat on the ground, wear wool, tether the camel, lick my fingers, and answer the invitation of the slave. Whoever is averse to my way is not of me." It is related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari was told that some people were staying away from the Friday prayer due to their clothes, so he wore a simple cloak and led the people in prayer in it. These are matters where hypocrisy and pride converge: what pertains to public is hypocrisy, and what is in private is pride. So understand, for he who does not recognize evil cannot guard against it, and he who does not perceive the illness cannot treat it.

Explanation of the Ultimate Aim of Spiritual Discipline in Cultivating the Character Trait of Humility

Know that this trait, like all traits, has two extremes and a middle ground. The extreme that leans toward excess is called arrogance, and the extreme that leans toward deficiency is called abasement and humiliation, while the middle is called humility. What is praiseworthy is to be humble without humiliation and without abasement, for both extremes of matters are blameworthy, and the most beloved matters to God Almighty are their balanced middles. Thus, whoever places himself ahead of his equals is arrogant, and whoever places himself behind them is humble—meaning he lowers something of the status he rightfully deserves. If a scholar, when a cobbler enters upon him, vacates his seat for him, seats him in it, then proceeds to adjust his sandals and runs behind him to the door, he has indeed demeaned and humiliated himself, and this too is not praiseworthy. Rather, what is praiseworthy before God is justice—giving each rightful person their due. Therefore, one should show humility in this manner to his peers and those close to his rank. As for his humility toward a common market-goer, it lies in standing for him, cheerfulness in speech, gentleness in questioning, answering his invitation, striving to fulfill his need, and the like—and not considering himself better than him. Rather, he should be more fearful for his own soul than for others, neither despising nor belittling him, for he does not know how his own affair will end.

Thus, the path to acquiring humility is to be humble toward peers and those below until the praiseworthy form of humility in noble habits becomes light upon him, thereby removing arrogance from him. If it becomes light upon him, then the trait of humility has been attained. But if it feels burdensome while he does it, he is forcing it, not being humble, for a true trait is that from which action proceeds with ease, without burden and without deliberation. If it becomes light and reaches a point where upholding his own status feels burdensome, so that he loves flattery and abasement, then he has slipped to the extreme of deficiency. Let him then elevate himself, for it is not for a believer to humiliate himself, until he returns to the middle ground, which is the straight path. This is subtle in this trait and in all traits. Leaning from the middle toward the extreme of deficiency—which is flattery—is lighter than leaning toward the extreme of excess through arrogance, just as leaning toward the extreme of wastefulness in wealth is more commendable among people than leaning toward the extreme of miserliness. The ultimate of wastefulness and the ultimate of miserliness are both blameworthy, yet one is more vile. Similarly, the ultimate of arrogance and the ultimate of self-degradation and humiliation are both blameworthy, yet one is uglier than the other. The absolutely praiseworthy is justice and placing matters in their proper places as they should be and as is required, as known through the Sacred Law and custom. Let us limit ourselves to this extent in clarifying the traits of arrogance and humility.

The Second Part

From the Book on Self-Admiration

This section elucidates the censure of self-admiration and its perils, clarifies the true nature of self-admiration and conceit individually, explains the comprehensive remedy for self-admiration, and details the categories of that which inspires self-admiration along with the specifics of its treatment.

An Exposition on the Censure of Self-Admiration and Its Pernicious Consequences

Know that self-admiration is condemned in the Book of God Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him). God Almighty said: "And on the Day of Hunayn, when your great numbers impressed you, but they availed you nothing" — this was mentioned in a context of reproach. And He, the Exalted, said: "And they thought their fortresses would protect them from God, but God came upon them from where they did not expect" — rebuking the disbelievers for their pride in their fortresses and might. And He said: "While they think they are doing well" — this also refers to self-admiration in one's deeds. A person may admire a deed in which he is mistaken, just as he may admire a deed in which he is correct. And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Three things are destructive: obeyed greed, followed desire, and a man's admiration of himself." And he said to Abu Tha‘labah — when the latter mentioned the latter days of this community — "When you see greed obeyed, desire followed, and every opinion-holder admiring his own opinion, then mind your own soul." And Ibn Mas‘ud said: "Ruin lies in two things: despair and self-admiration." They are paired because felicity is attained only through striving, seeking, earnest effort, and exertion. The despairing one does not strive or seek, and the self-admiring one believes he has already attained felicity and achieved his aim, so he does not strive. What is already present is not sought, and what is deemed impossible is not sought. Felicity is present in the belief of the self-admiring one — he thinks it is already his — and impossible in the belief of the despairing one; hence they are paired. And God Almighty said: "So do not claim purity for yourselves." Ibn Jurayj said: Its meaning is, when you do good, do not say, "I have done." Zayd ibn Aslam said: Do not declare them righteous, meaning do not believe they are righteous — and this is the meaning of self-admiration. And Talhah shielded the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) with his own body on the day of Uhud, covering him until his hand was wounded. It was as if he admired his great deed of ransoming him with his life until he was injured. ‘Umar perceived this in him and said: "Pride has been noticeable in Talhah ever since his finger was wounded with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)." Al-na’w is self-admiration in language, except that it is not reported that he displayed it or despised any Muslim. And when the time of consultation came, Ibn ‘Abbas said to him: "What about Talhah?" He replied: "That is a man in whom there is haughtiness." If such as they are not free from self-admiration, how can the weak be free unless they take caution? And Mutarrif said: "To sleep at night and wake remorseful is dearer to me than to stand at night and wake self-admiring." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "If you did not sin, I would fear for you something greater than that: self-admiration, self-admiration." Thus he made self-admiration the greatest of sins. And Bishr ibn Mansur was among those who, when they saw remembrance of God Almighty and the Hereafter, were assiduous in worship. One day he prolonged the prayer while a man behind him watched. Bishr became aware of him, and when he finished the prayer, he said to him: "Do not be impressed by what you saw from me, for Iblis — may God curse him — worshipped God Almighty with the angels for a long time, then ended up as he did." And ‘A’ishah (may God be pleased with her) was asked: "When is a man doing evil?" She said: "When he thinks he is doing good." And God Almighty said: "Do not invalidate your charities with reminders of generosity and injury" — and the reminder results from magnifying the charity, and magnifying the deed is self-admiration. Thus it is clear from this that self-admiration is greatly condemned.

Explanation of the Affliction of Self-Admiration

Know that the afflictions of self-admiration are many, for self-admiration leads to arrogance, as it is one of its causes—as we have mentioned—so arrogance is born from self-admiration, and from arrogance come numerous afflictions that are not hidden. This is in relation to worshipers. As for in relation to God Almighty, self-admiration leads to forgetting and neglecting sins. Thus, some of his sins he does not recall nor examine, due to his assumption that he is above needing to examine them, so he forgets them. And those he does remember, he belittles and does not consider grave, so he does not strive to rectify and make amends for them; rather, he assumes they will be forgiven. As for acts of worship and deeds, he magnifies them, boasts of them, and considers them a favor to God for having performed them, forgetting God’s grace upon him in granting success and enabling him to do them. Then, when he admires them, he becomes blind to their faults. Whoever does not examine the faults of his deeds, most of his striving is wasted. For outward deeds, if they are not pure and free from impurities, seldom do they benefit. Only one who is dominated by concern and fear, not self-admiration, examines them. The self-admired is deluded by himself and his opinion, feels secure from God’s guile and punishment, and thinks he holds a station with God and that he has a claim and right with God due to his deeds—which are themselves a grace and gift from His gifts. Self-admiration leads him to praise himself, commend himself, and deem himself pure. If he is enamored with his opinion, his deed, and his intellect, it prevents him from benefiting, from seeking counsel and asking questions, so he becomes self-reliant with his own opinion and scorns asking those more knowledgeable than him. Perhaps he admires an erroneous opinion that occurs to him, rejoicing that it is from his own thoughts, and does not rejoice at the thoughts of others, so he insists on it and does not heed sincere advice or an admonisher’s exhortation. Rather, he looks at others with an eye of disdain and persists in his error. If his opinion concerns a worldly matter, he may achieve it; but if it concerns a religious matter, especially pertaining to the fundamentals of creed, he perishes by it. Had he doubted himself, not trusted his opinion, illuminated himself with the light of the Qur’an, sought the aid of religious scholars, persisted in studying knowledge, and followed the questioning of the insightful, that would have led him to the truth. This and the like are among the afflictions of self-admiration, which is why it is among the destructive traits. Among its greatest harms is that one slackens in striving due to the assumption that he has succeeded and become self-sufficient—and that is clear destruction in which there is no doubt. We ask God Almighty, the Great, for good success in obeying Him.

An Exposition on the True Nature of Self-Admiration and Conceit, and Their Singular Reality

Know that pride arises only from an attribute that is undoubtedly a perfection. For the one who possesses perfection in himself—in knowledge, deeds, wealth, or otherwise—there are three states. The first is when he fears its disappearance, is anxious about its corruption, or dreads its loss from the very root; this is not pride. The second is when he does not fear its loss but rejoices in it because it is a blessing from God Almighty upon him, not because he attributes it to himself; this also is not pride. The third state is pride itself: when he is not fearful of its loss but rather rejoices in it and feels secure in it, and his joy stems from it being a perfection, a blessing, a good, and an elevation—not because it is a gift and a blessing from God Almighty. Thus, his joy is because it is his attribute and ascribed to him as his possession, not because it is ascribed to God as being from Him. Whenever it dominates his heart that it is a blessing from God, which He may withdraw whenever He wills, pride thereby vanishes from him. Therefore, pride is magnifying the blessing and relying upon it while forgetting to attribute it to the Bestower. If, in addition to this, it dominates his soul that he has a right with God and that he holds a station with Him, such that he expects honor in this world due to his deeds, and he deems it far-fetched that any harm should befall him—more so than he deems it far-fetched for the wicked—this is called presuming upon one's deeds. It is as if he sees for himself a claim upon God. Likewise, if someone is given something and he magnifies it and boasts of it, he is proud. If he then makes demands or expects his rights to be fulfilled without fail, he is presuming upon it.

Qatadah said regarding God’s words, "And do not confer favor to gain more" (Quran 74:6), meaning: do not presume upon your deeds. And in the tradition: "The prayer of one who presumes is not raised above his head, and it is better for you to laugh while acknowledging your sin than to weep while presuming upon your deeds." Presumption lies beyond pride, for there is no one who presumes without being proud, though one may be proud without presuming. For pride occurs through magnifying and forgetting the blessing without expecting a reward for it, whereas presumption is not complete except with the expectation of a reward. If he expects his supplication to be answered and inwardly deems its rejection strange and is astonished by it, he is presuming upon his deeds, because he is not astonished by the rejection of a wicked person’s supplication but is astonished by the rejection of his own supplication for that reason. This, then, is pride and presumption, and it is among the precursors and causes of arrogance. And God Almighty knows best.

Explanation of the Treatment of Self-Admiration in Summary

Know that the remedy for every ailment lies in opposing its cause with its opposite. The ailment of pride is pure ignorance, thus its remedy is solely the knowledge that counters that ignorance. Let us suppose pride arises from an action within the servant's volition, such as worship, charity, jihad, governing people, or reforming them; for pride in this is more prevalent than pride in beauty, strength, lineage, or what does not fall under his volition and what he does not see from himself.

We say: The piety, God-consciousness, worship, and deed with which one is pleased is only admired either because it is within him, being its locus and channel, or because it is from him, by his cause, his power, and his strength. If he admires it because it is within him, being its locus and channel through which it flows from another direction, this is ignorance, for the locus is subjugated and a mere channel with no role in bringing about or achieving; how then can one admire what is not attributable to him? But if he admires it because it is from him and to him, and it occurred by his choice and was perfected by his power, then he ought to reflect upon his power, his will, his limbs, and all the other means by which his deed is accomplished: from where did they become his? If all of that is a favor from God upon him, without any prior right on his part and without any means he presented, then his admiration ought to be for the generosity, munificence, and grace of God, for He bestowed upon him what he does not deserve and favored him with it over others without any precedent or means. Whenever a king emerges before his servants and looks upon them, and bestows a robe of honor upon one among them—not for a quality in him, nor for a means, nor for his beauty, nor for service—then the one upon whom the favor is bestowed ought to marvel at the king’s grace, his wisdom, and his favoring without desert, and to wonder at himself: from where and what is its cause? He ought not to admire himself. Yes, it is permissible for the servant to marvel and say: The king is a just ruler who does not wrong, and does not advance or delay except for a reason. Were it not that he discerned in me a quality from among the praiseworthy inward qualities, the bestowal of the robe would not have been warranted, nor would he have favored me with it. It is said: That quality, too, is from the king’s robe of honor and his gift which He singled you out for, apart from others, without any means; or is it a gift from another? If it is also from the king’s gift, you have no right to admire it, just as if he gave you a horse and you did not admire it, then he gave you a servant and you began to admire it, saying: He only gave me a servant because I am a possessor of a horse, whereas others have no horse. It is said: He is the one who gave you the horse, so there is no difference between Him giving you the horse and the servant together or giving you one after the other! Since all is from Him, your admiration ought to be for His generosity and grace, not for yourself. As for if that quality is from another, then it is not far-fetched to admire that quality. This is conceivable regarding kings, but it is inconceivable regarding the Compelling, the Supreme, the King of kings, the One unique in creating all, unique in bringing into existence the described and the description. For if you admire your habit and say: He guided me to worship because of my love for Him, it is said: And who created the love in your heart? You say: He did. It is said: Then both the love and the worship are two favors from Him with which He initiated you without any desert on your part, since you have no means and no connection. Thus, admiration is for His generosity, since He bestowed upon you your existence, the existence of your attributes, and the existence of your deeds and the means of your deeds! Therefore, there is no meaning to the worshiper’s admiration of his worship, the scholar’s admiration of his knowledge, the beautiful person’s admiration of his beauty, or the rich person’s admiration of his wealth! For all of that is from the grace of God, and he is merely a locus for the overflowing of God’s grace and His generosity—and the locus, too, is from His grace and His existence.

If you say: I cannot be ignorant of my deeds, for I performed them and I await reward for them; and were they not my deeds, I would not expect reward. If deeds are created by God through pure invention, then whence comes my reward? And if the deeds are from me, yet by His power, then why should I not take pride in them? Know that your answer lies in two aspects: one is the explicit truth, and the other involves some concession.

As for the explicit truth: it is that you, your power, your will, your movement, and all of that are from the creation and invention of God. Thus, you did not act when you acted, nor did you pray when you prayed, "nor did you throw when you threw, but God threw." This is the truth unveiled to the possessors of hearts through a vision clearer than eyesight. Indeed, He created you and created your limbs, and created within them strength, capability, and health; He created for you intellect and knowledge, and created for you will. If you wished to deny any of this concerning yourself, you would not be able. Then He created the movements in your limbs, independently originating them without any partnership from your side in their invention—except that He created it in an order: He did not create movement without first creating power in the limb and will in the heart; nor did He create will without creating knowledge of what is intended; nor did He create knowledge without creating the heart, which is the seat of knowledge. Thus, His gradual creation, step by step, has deluded you into thinking that you brought your deed into existence, and you have erred. The clarification of this, and how reward is given for a deed that is from God’s creation, will be explained in the Book of Gratitude, for it is more fitting there—so refer to it.

We now resolve your difficulty with the second answer, which involves a certain leniency: that you should consider that the action occurred by your power. But from where is your power? An action cannot be conceived except through your existence, the existence of your action, your will, and all the other causes of your action—and all of that is from God, exalted is He, not from you! If the action is by power, then power is its key, and this key is in the hand of God. Whenever He does not give you the key, you cannot act. The acts of worship are treasuries by which one attains felicities, and their keys are power, will, and knowledge, which are inevitably in God’s hand. Consider if you saw the treasures of the world gathered in a fortified castle, its key in the hand of a keeper. If you sat at its gate and around its walls for a thousand years, you could not look upon a single dinar within it. But if he gave you the key, you would take it readily by merely stretching out your hand to take it. So if the keeper gave you the keys, empowered you over them, and enabled you to take them, and you stretched out your hand and took them, would your amazement be at the keeper’s giving of the keys, or at your own stretching of the hand and taking? Do not doubt that you would see that as a favor from the keeper, for the effort in moving the hand to take the wealth is trivial; the entire matter lies in the handing over of the keys. Likewise, whenever power is created, decisive will is empowered, motives and incentives are set in motion, and obstacles and deterrents are turned away from you—until no deterrent remains but is repelled, and no incentive remains but is entrusted to you—then the action becomes easy for you. Yet the setting in motion of incentives, the turning away of obstacles, and the preparation of all causes are from God; not a single one of them is from you. How wondrous, then, that you should marvel at yourself and not marvel at Him to whom belongs all command, nor marvel at His generosity, bounty, and grace in preferring you over the dissolute among His servants—when He empowered the incitements to corruption upon the dissolute and turned them away from you, and empowered the companions of evil and the summoners to wickedness upon them and turned them away from them, and enabled you for the means of desires and pleasures and veiled them from you, and turned away from them the incentives to good and its incitements and empowered them upon you, so that good was made easy for you and evil was made easy for them! He did all of that for you without any prior means from you, nor any prior transgression from the sinful disobedient one. Rather, He preferred you, advanced you, and chose you by His grace, and distanced the disobedient one and made him wretched by His justice. So how astounding is your self-admiration when you know this! Therefore, your power does not turn toward what is within its capacity except by God’s empowering upon you an incitement for which you find no way to oppose. Thus, it is as if He compelled you to the act, if you are a true agent, so gratitude and favor belong to Him, not to you. (Further clarification on the chain of causes and effects will come in the Book of Divine Unity and Reliance, making clear that there is no agent except God and no creator besides Him. And wondrous is he who wonders!) And when God provides someone with intellect and impoverishes him—from whom He bestowed wealth without knowledge—he says: "Why has He deprived me of my daily sustenance, I who am the intelligent, virtuous one, and bestowed upon this one the comforts of the world, he who is heedless and ignorant?" He almost considers this an injustice. The deluded one does not know that if intellect and wealth were combined for him and I were deprived of both, why did He not combine them for me, or why did He not provide me with one of them? To this, ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, alluded when it was said to him: "Why are the intelligent poor?" He replied: "A man’s intellect is counted against his provision." It is astonishing that the intelligent poor person may see the ignorant rich person in a better state than himself. Yet if he were asked: "Would you prefer his ignorance and wealth in exchange for your intellect and poverty?" he would refuse! Therefore, that indicates that God’s favor upon him is greater; so why should he wonder at that? And the beautiful poor woman sees ornaments and jewels upon the ugly, repulsive woman and wonders, saying: "How is such beauty deprived of adornment, and such ugliness specially favored?" The deluded one does not know that beauty is counted against her provision, and that if she were given the choice between beauty and ugliness with wealth, she would prefer beauty. Therefore, God’s favor upon her is greater. And the saying of the wise, poor, intelligent-hearted one: "O Lord, why have You deprived me of the world and given it to the ignorant?" is like the saying of one to whom a king gave a horse, who then says: "O King, why do you not give me the groom, when I am the owner of the horse?" The king would reply: "You would not wonder at this had I not given you the horse! Suppose I had not given you a horse at all—would My favor upon you then become a means and an argument by which you seek another favor?" These are illusions from which the ignorant are not free, and the origin of all that is ignorance. It is removed by verified knowledge that the servant, his action, and his attributes are all from God, exalted is He—a favor with which He began him prior to any deserving. This negates self-admiration and pride, and engenders humility, gratitude, and fear of the removal of favor. Whoever knows this cannot conceive of admiring his own action, for he knows that it is from God, exalted is He. For that reason, David, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, no night passes except that a man from the House of David is fasting" (and in another narration: "No hour of night or day passes except that a worshipper from the House of David worships You, either praying, fasting, or remembering You"). So God, exalted is He, revealed to him: "O David, what sin befell him who admired his own action, attributing it to the House of David, boasting of it, and thus entrusting himself to himself, so that he committed a sin that brought him sorrow and regret." And David said: "O Lord, the Children of Israel ask You by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." He said: "I tested them, and they were patient." He said: "O Lord, if You test me, I will be patient." Thus, he boasted of an action before its time. So God, exalted is He, said: "But I did not inform them with what I tested them, nor in which month, nor on which day. I will inform you in this year of yours, in this month of yours: I will test you tomorrow with a woman, so beware of yourself." Then he fell into what he fell into. Likewise, when the companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, on the day of Hunayn relied on their strength and multitude and forgot God’s favor upon them, saying, "We shall not be overcome today by fewness," and entrusted themselves to themselves, God said: "And on the day of Hunayn, when your great number impressed you, but it availed you nothing, and the earth, for all its vastness, constrained you, and you turned back in retreat." Ibn ‘Uyaynah related that Job, peace be upon him, said: "My God, You have tested me with this trial, and no matter came to me except that I preferred Your desire over my desire." Then he was called from his turban by ten thousand voices: "O Job, how is that for you?"—meaning, from where do you have that? He said: So he took ashes and placed them on his head and said: "From You, O Lord, from You, O Lord," returning from forgetfulness to attributing that to God, exalted is He. For this reason, God said: "And were it not for the favor of God upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure." And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to his companions, who are the best of people: "There is not one of you whom his deeds will save." They said: "Not even you, O Messenger of God?" He said: "Not even I, unless God covers me with His mercy." Indeed, his companions after him wished they were dust, straw, or birds, despite the purity of their deeds and hearts. So how can one of insight admire his own action or boast of it, and not fear for himself? Therefore, this is the remedy that suppresses the substance of self-admiration from the heart. Whenever this overcomes the heart, it occupies it with the dread that this favor will be stripped away due to admiration for it. Rather, he looks at the disbelievers and the dissolute, who have been stripped of the favor of faith and obedience without any prior sin they committed, and he fears that. He says: "

Explanation of the Categories of That Which Causes Self-Admiration and the Detailed Remedy for It

Know that pride in the means through which one becomes arrogant—as we have mentioned—may also arise from that which does not lead to arrogance, such as pride in erroneous opinions that ignorance makes appealing to him. Thus, the causes of pride are eight categories: The first is to take pride in one’s body—in its beauty, form, strength, proportion of limbs, comeliness of appearance, and pleasantness of voice—in sum, the details of one’s creation. He then turns to admire the beauty of his own soul as a blessing from God, the Exalted, though it is subject to vanishing at any moment. Its remedy is what we mentioned concerning arrogance due to beauty: reflecting on the impurities within, on its beginning and its end, and on how those beautiful faces and delicate bodies are torn apart in the earth and become foul in the graves until natural dispositions find them repulsive.

The second is might and strength, as narrated concerning the people of ‘Ad when they said, as God informed about them, “Who is mightier than us in strength?” and as ‘Uj relied upon his strength and was impressed by it, so he uprooted a mountain to hurl it upon the army of Moses, peace be upon him, but God the Exalted pierced that piece of the mountain with the pecking of a weak-beaked hoopoe until it became around his neck. Likewise, a believer may rely upon his strength, as related concerning Solomon, peace be upon him, that he said, “I shall go around to a hundred women tonight!” and he did not say “if God wills,” so he was deprived of the offspring he desired. Similarly, the saying of David, peace be upon him, “If I am tested, I will be patient,” was an expression of his pride in his own strength, but when he was tested with the woman, he did not remain patient. Pride in strength leads to reckless charging in battles, casting oneself into destruction, and hastening to strike and kill anyone who intends harm. Its remedy is what we have mentioned: that one should know that the day will come when his strength weakens, and that if he becomes impressed with it, God the Exalted may strip it from him through the slightest affliction He sends upon him.

The third is pride in one's intellect, shrewdness, and keen perception of subtle matters pertaining to the interests of religion and worldly life. Its fruit is insisting on one's own opinion, abandoning consultation, and deeming foolish those who disagree with him and his views. This leads to scarcely listening to the people of knowledge, turning away from them out of self-sufficiency with one's own opinion and intellect, belittling and disrespecting them. Its remedy is to give thanks to God Almighty for the intellect He has granted, and to reflect that with the slightest illness affecting his brain, how he becomes deluded and insane to the point that others laugh at him! Thus, he should not feel secure that his intellect may be stripped away if he becomes proud of it and fails to offer gratitude. Let him consider his intellect and knowledge as limited, and know that what he has been given of knowledge is but little, even if his knowledge expands, and that what he is ignorant of from what others know is greater than what he knows. How then about what people do not know from the knowledge of God Almighty? And let him suspect his own intellect and observe the foolish—how they take pride in their intellects while people laugh at them—so that he may beware of being among them without realizing it. For the one with deficient intellect never knows the deficiency of his own intellect. Therefore, he should recognize the measure of his intellect from others, not from himself, and from his enemies, not from his friends. For whoever flatters him praises him and increases his pride, while he thinks nothing but good of himself and is not aware of his own ignorance, thus his pride only grows.

The fourth is pride in noble lineage, such as the pride of the Hashimite woman, to the point that some imagine they will be saved by the nobility of their lineage and the salvation of their forefathers, and that they are forgiven. Some even fancy that all creation are their clients and slaves. Its remedy is to know that if one opposes one's forefathers in their actions and character and yet thinks one is attached to them, then one is ignorant. If one follows one's forefathers, then what characterized them was not pride, but rather fear and self-contempt, magnifying the creation and blaming the self. Indeed, they were ennobled through obedience, knowledge, and virtuous traits, not through lineage. So let one seek nobility through that by which they were ennobled. For there are those who share their lineage and are from the same tribes who did not believe in God and the Last Day, and they were, in God's sight, worse than dogs and baser than swine. Therefore, the Almighty said: "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female" — meaning there is no distinction in your lineages, for you all share a single origin. Then He mentioned the benefit of lineage, saying: "and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another." Then He clarified that nobility is through piety, not lineage, saying: "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you." And when it was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "Who are the noblest of people? Who are the wisest of people?" he did not say, "Those who trace their lineage to me," but rather said: "The noblest among them are those who remember death most and are most prepared for it." This verse was revealed when Bilal gave the call to prayer on the Ka'bah on the Day of the Conquest. Al-Harith ibn Hisham, Suhayl ibn 'Amr, and Khalid ibn al-Asid said, "Is this black slave to give the call to prayer on the Ka'bah?" So the Almighty said: "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, God has removed from you the boastful pride of the Age of Ignorance — meaning its major aspect — you are all children of Adam, and Adam was created from dust." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "O company of Quraysh, do not come to the people with deeds on the Day of Resurrection while you bring the world, carrying it on your necks, saying, 'O Muhammad, O Muhammad!' for I will say thus" — meaning, I will turn away from you — thus making clear that if they incline toward the world, their Qurayshi lineage will not benefit them. And when the verse was revealed: "And warn, [O Muhammad], your closest kindred," he called them clan by clan, until he said: "O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad! O Safiyyah, daughter of 'Abd al-Muttalib, aunt of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him! Act for yourselves, for I cannot avail you anything against God." So whoever knows these matters and understands that his nobility is according to his piety, and it was the custom of his forefathers to be humble, let him follow them in piety and humility. Otherwise, he is — by the state of his condition — disparaging his own lineage, however much he may claim descent from them, if he does not resemble them in humility, piety, fear, and compassion.

If you say: Did He not say, after His words to Fatimah and Safiyyah, "I indeed—I indeed—have nothing from God for you except that you have a kinship tie which I shall maintain as it ought to be maintained"? And did the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, not say, "Do you, Salim, hope for my intercession, while the sons of 'Abd al-Muttalib do not hope for it?" Does this indicate that he will single out his relatives for intercession?

Know that every Muslim is awaiting the intercession of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the kinsman is also worthy of hoping for it, but on the condition that he fears God and does not provoke His anger. For if He is angered with him, He will not grant anyone permission to intercede for him, because sins are divided into those that incur wrath, for which intercession is not permitted, and those that are forgiven due to intercession, like sins with the kings of this world. For no one of standing with the king is able to intercede in a matter over which the king's anger is severe. Thus, there are sins from which intercession does not save, as indicated by His words, exalted is He, "Nor will they intercede except for him with whom He is pleased," and His saying, "Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?" and His saying, "And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits," and His saying, "So the intercession of the intercessors will not avail them." Since sins are divided into those for which intercession is made and those for which it is not, fear and apprehension are inevitably necessary. If there were a sin for which intercession were accepted, He would not have commanded the Quraysh to obey, nor would the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, have forbidden Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, from disobedience, and He would have permitted her to follow her desires to perfect her worldly pleasure, then interceded for her in the Hereafter to perfect her pleasure in the Hereafter. Therefore, plunging into sins and abandoning piety in reliance on the hope of intercession resembles a sick person plunging into his desires relying on a skilled, close, and compassionate physician, be he a father, brother, or other. This is ignorance, for the physician's effort, zeal, and skill are beneficial in removing some illnesses, not all of them. Thus, it is not permissible to abandon precaution entirely in reliance on medicine alone. Rather, the physician has an effect overall, but in mild illnesses and when the temperament is predominantly balanced. Likewise, one should understand the concern of intercessors from among the prophets and the righteous for relatives and strangers, for it is certainly so. Yet this does not remove fear and caution. How could it remove it, when the best of creation after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, were his Companions, and they used to wish they were beasts out of fear of the Hereafter, despite their perfect piety, good deeds, purity of hearts, and what they heard from the promise of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, specifically for them of Paradise and generally for all Muslims of intercession? They did not rely upon it, and fear and humility never departed their hearts. So how can one who does not have the like of their companionship and precedence be amazed with himself and rely on intercession?

"Fifth": Being amazed with the lineage of oppressive rulers and their aides, to the exclusion of the lineage of religion and knowledge. This is the height of ignorance. Its remedy is to reflect on their disgrace, the injustice they have perpetrated against God's servants, the corruption they have caused in God's religion, and that they are detested by God, exalted is He. If one were to see their images in the Fire, their filth and impurities, he would shrink from them and disavow any relation to them, and he would resent anyone who ascribed him to them out of disgust and contempt for them. If their humiliation on the Day of Resurrection were unveiled to him, when the claimants cling to them and the angels seize their forelocks, dragging them on their faces to Hell for the wrongs done to the servants, he would seek refuge with God from them, and his ascription to a dog or a pig would be dearer to him than ascription to them. It is incumbent upon the children of oppressors, if God has protected them from their oppression, to thank God, exalted is He, for the safety of their religion and to seek forgiveness for their fathers if they were Muslims! As for being amazed, it is pure ignorance.

The sixth is pride in the multitude of numbers—of children, servants, attendants, clan, relatives, supporters, and followers—as the disbelievers said, “We are greater in wealth and children,” and as the believers said on the day of Hunayn, “We shall not be defeated today by fewness.” Its remedy is what we mentioned concerning arrogance: that one reflects on his own weakness and theirs, and that all of them are feeble slaves who possess for themselves neither harm nor benefit. “How many a small company has overcome a large company by God’s permission.” Then how can one take pride in them when they will part from him at death, and he will be buried in his grave humbled, left alone, with no family, child, relative, intimate friend, or clansman accompanying him. They surrender him to decay, serpents, scorpions, and worms, and they avail him nothing in the time of his greatest need for them. Likewise, they will flee from him on the Day of Resurrection, “the day a man will flee from his brother, his mother, his father, his spouse, and his sons.” What good is there in those who part from you in your most severe circumstances and flee from you? How can you take pride in those who will not benefit you in the grave, nor on the Day of Resurrection, nor on the Bridge, but only your deeds and the grace of God Almighty? How then do you rely on those who cannot benefit you, and forget the favors of the One who holds your benefit and harm, your death and your life?

The seventh is pride in wealth, as God Almighty said in reporting about the owner of the two gardens when he said, "I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in men." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw a wealthy man beside whom a poor man sat, so he withdrew from him and gathered his garments. The Prophet, upon him be peace, said, "Did you fear that his poverty would leap over to you?" That was due to pride in riches. Its remedy is to reflect on the perils of wealth, the multitude of its obligations, and the magnitude of its calamities; to look at the virtue of the poor and their precedence to Paradise on the Day of Resurrection; to consider that wealth comes and goes and has no permanence; to consider that among the Jews are those who exceed him in wealth; and to reflect on his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, "While a man was strutting in a garment that pleased him, God commanded the earth, and it swallowed him, and he will be sinking in it until the Day of Resurrection." He indicated by this the punishment for his pride in his wealth and himself. And Abu Dharr said, "I was with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he entered the mosque. He said to me, 'O Abu Dharr, raise your head.' So I raised my head, and there was a man wearing fine garments. Then he said, 'Raise your head.' So I raised my head, and there was a man wearing worn garments. He said to me, 'O Abu Dharr, this one is better with God than an earthful of people like that one.'" All that we have mentioned in the Book of Asceticism, the Book of Condemning the World, and the Book of Condemning Wealth clarifies the baseness of the rich and the nobility of the poor with God Almighty. So how can it be conceivable for a believer to be proud of his riches? Rather, the believer is not free from fear of his shortcoming in fulfilling the obligations of wealth—in taking it from its lawful sources and placing it in its rightful uses. Whoever does not do that, his end is disgrace and ruin. So how can he be proud of his wealth?

The eighth is pride in erroneous opinion. God Almighty said: "Is he, then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair-seeming, so that he considers it good?" And He said: "And they think that they are doing good." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, informed that this would prevail over the latter part of this community, and by this the past nations perished when they split into sects, each one proud of his opinion, "and every faction rejoicing in what they have." All the people of innovation and misguidance only persisted in them due to their pride in their opinions. Pride in innovation is the approval of what passion and desire lead to, while believing it to be truth. The remedy for this pride is more severe than the remedy for others, because the possessor of erroneous opinion is ignorant of his error; if he knew it, he would abandon it. An ailment that is not known cannot be treated, and ignorance is an ailment that is not known, so its cure is extremely difficult. For the knowledgeable one is able to show the ignorant his ignorance and remove it from him, except if he is proud of his opinion and his ignorance, for then he does not listen to the knowledgeable one and accuses him. God has subjected him to an affliction that destroys him while he thinks it a blessing, so how can his treatment be possible, and how can he seek escape from what he believes is the cause of his happiness? Its remedy, in summary, is that he should always be suspicious of his own opinion, not being deceived by it except when a decisive proof from the Book, the Sunnah, or a sound rational evidence encompassing the conditions of proofs testifies. And a person will not know the proofs of the Sacred Law and reason, their conditions, and the pitfalls of error in them except with a perfect innate disposition, a penetrating intellect, diligence and exertion in seeking, prolonged engagement with the Book and the Sunnah, lifelong companionship with the people of knowledge, and study of the sciences. Even with all that, he is not safe from error in some matters. The correct course for one who has not branched out, devoting his entire life to knowledge, is not to delve into doctrines, nor to listen to them, nor to hear them, but to believe that God Almighty is One without partner and that "there is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing," and that His Messenger is truthful in what he informed, and to follow the way of the predecessors, and to believe in the totality of what the Book and the Sunnah have brought without investigation, probing, and questioning about details, but rather to say, "We believe and affirm," and to occupy himself with piety, avoiding sins, performing acts of obedience, compassion towards Muslims, and all other righteous works. For if he delves into doctrines, innovations, and bigotry in beliefs, he will perish from where he does not perceive. This is the truth for everyone who resolves to occupy his life with something other than knowledge. As for the one who resolves to devote himself exclusively to knowledge, his first important task is to know the proof and its conditions, and that is a matter which requires lengthy treatment. Attaining certainty and knowledge in the greatest of objectives is severe, not achievable except by the strong ones supported by the light of God Almighty, and it is exceedingly rare. So we ask God Almighty for protection from misguidance, and we seek refuge in Him from being deceived by the illusions of the ignorant.

The Book of Condemnation of Arrogance and Pride is completed. Praise be to God alone, and sufficient for us is God, and He is the best Disposer of affairs. There is no power nor strength except with God, the Most High, the Most Great. And may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and companions and grant them peace.







[1] God Almighty said: "Grandeur is My cloak and majesty is My garment. Whoever contends with Me regarding them, I shall break him." Al-Hakim recorded this in Al-Mustadrak without mentioning "majesty" and said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. It was mentioned previously in the Book of Knowledge and will come again after two hadiths with another wording.

[2] The hadith: "Three destructive things..." was recorded by Al-Bazzar, Al-Tabarani, and Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas with a weak chain. It was also mentioned previously.

[3] The hadith: "He will not enter Paradise who has in his heart an atom's weight of pride, and he will not enter the Fire who has in his heart an atom's weight of faith," was recorded by Muslim from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud.

[4] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: God Almighty says: "Grandeur is My cloak and majesty is My garment. Whoever contends with Me regarding one of them, I will cast him into Hell." Muslim, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah recorded it, and the wording is his. Abu Dawud said: "I will hurl him into the Fire," and Muslim said: "I will punish him," and said: "His cloak and garment" with the meaning of backbiting. With Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa'id was also added.

[5] The hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "Whoever has in his heart an atom's weight of pride, God will cast him on his face into the Fire," was recorded by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman through his chain with an authentic chain.

[6] The hadith: "A man continues to exalt himself until he is recorded among the tyrants..." was recorded by Al-Tirmidhi who graded it good, from the narration of Salamah ibn Al-Akwa', without his saying "from the punishment."

[7] The hadith: "A neck with two ears will emerge from the Fire..." was recorded by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is good, authentic, and rare.

[8] The hadith: "A tyrant, a miser, and one of bad character will not enter Paradise," was mentioned previously in the Book of the Causes of Earning, Livelihood, and Known Good, with "treacherous" in place of "tyrant."

[9] The hadith: "Paradise and Hell argued. Hell said: 'I have been favored with the arrogant and the tyrants...'" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[10] The hadith: "How evil is the servant who is tyrannical and transgresses..." was recorded by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Asma' bint 'Umays with an addition in it, with some words preceding and others following, and he said it is rare and its chain is not strong. Al-Hakim recorded it in Al-Mustadrak and authenticated it, and Al-Bayhaqi recorded it in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Nu'aym ibn 'Ammar and weakened it.

[11] The hadith of Thabit: "It reached us that it was said: 'O Messenger of God, how great is the pride of so-and-so!' He said: 'Is there not death after him?'" Al-Bayhaqi recorded it in Al-Shu'ab thus, as a *mursal* report, with the wording "tyrannical."

[12] The hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr: "When death approached Noah, he called his two sons and said: 'I command you two things and forbid you two things: I forbid you from associating partners with God and from pride...'" was recorded by Ahmad, Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab, and Al-Hakim with an addition in its transmission. He said its chain is authentic.

[13] The hadith: "The people of the Fire are every coarse, greedy, arrogant, and withholding collector..." and this is the addition in the narration of both of them from Harithah ibn Wahb Al-Khuza'i: "Shall I not inform you of the people of the Fire? Every cruel, greedy, arrogant..."

[14] The hadith: "The most beloved of you to us and the closest of you to us in the Hereafter are those of you with the best character..." was recorded by Ahmad from the narration of Abu Tha'labah Al-Khushani with the wording "to me and from me," and there is a break in its chain, as Makhul did not hear it from Abu Tha'labah. The beginning of the hadith was mentioned previously in the Book of Disciplining the Soul.

[15] The hadith: "The arrogant will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the form of men..." was recorded by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb from his father from his grandfather, and he said it is rare.

[16] The hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "The tyrants and the arrogant will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the form of ants..." was recorded by Al-Bazzar thus, abbreviated, without his saying "the tyrants," and its chain is good.

[17] The hadith of Abu Musa: "Indeed, in Hell there is a valley called Habhab. It is incumbent upon God to settle in it every tyrant." Abu Ya'la, Al-Tabarani, and Al-Hakim recorded it, and he said its chain is authentic. I say: In it is Azhar ibn Sinan, whom Ibn Ma'in and Ibn Hibban weakened, and they cited this hadith for him among the weak narrators.

[18] The hadith: "Indeed, in the Fire there is a palace into which the arrogant are placed and it is closed upon them," was recorded by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas, and he said "coffins" in place of "palace," and said "and it is locked" in place of "it is closed upon them." In it is Aban ibn Abi 'Ayyash, and he is weak.

[19] The hadith: "O God, I seek refuge with You from a breath of pride." I have not seen it with this wording. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded from the narration of Jubayr ibn Mut'im from the Prophet, peace be upon him, in the course of a hadith: "I seek refuge with God from Satan, from his blowing, his spitting, and his piercing." He said: "His spitting is poetry, his blowing is pride, and his piercing is death." The compilers of the Sunan have from the narration of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri something similar. Abu Dawud commented on it, and Al-Tirmidhi said it is the most famous hadith in this chapter.

[20] The hadith: "Whoever parts from his soul while his body is free from three things will enter Paradise: pride, debt, and embezzlement." Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah recorded it from the narration of Thawban. The author's mention of this hadith here conforms to the well-known narration that it is "pride" (al-kibr) with a *ba'* and a *ra'*. However, Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned in *Jami' al-Masanid* from Al-Daraqutni that he said it is actually "hoarded treasure" (al-kanz) with a *nun* and a *zay*. Likewise, Ibn Mardawayh also mentioned the hadith in his commentary on "And those who hoard gold and silver..."

[21] The hadith: "God will not look at one who trails his garment out of arrogance," is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[22] The hadith: "While a man was strutting in his two garments, pleased with himself..." is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah.

[23] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "God will not look at one who trails his garment out of pride." Muslim recorded it, limited to the *marfu'* portion, without mentioning the passing of 'Abdullah ibn Waqid by Ibn 'Umar, which is a narration of Muslim that the passerby was a man from Banu Layth, unnamed.

[24] The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, spat one day into his palm and placed his finger on it and said: 'God says: O son of Adam, can you defy Me when I created you from something like this?'" Ibn Majah and Al-Hakim recorded it, and he authenticated its chain from the narration of Bishr ibn Jahhash.

[25] The hadith: "When my nation walks with a swagger..." Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban in his *Sahih* recorded it from the narration of Ibn 'Umar. "Al-mutayta'" with a *dammah* on the *mim* and a *fathah*
