In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
                               The Book of the Etiquettes of Eating
           Which is the First Book of the Quarter of Habitual Practices from the Book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences"

Praise be to God, who perfected the ordering of all creation, creating the earth and the heavens, and sent down fresh water from the rain-clouds, bringing forth thereby grain and vegetation, and apportioned provisions and appointed their times, and preserved through foodstuffs the strengths of living creatures, and aided in acts of obedience and righteous deeds through the consumption of wholesome things. And blessings upon Muhammad, possessor of manifest miracles, and upon his family and his companions, blessings that follow in succession with the passage of times and multiply with the alternation of hours, and abundant peace.

Now then, the objective of those possessing intellect is the meeting with God, the Exalted, in the Abode of Reward. There is no path to attaining the meeting with God except through knowledge and action, and one cannot persist in these two except with soundness of body. The soundness of the body is only purified through foods and sustenance, and partaking of them to the extent of need at recurring times. From this perspective, some of the righteous predecessors said, "Eating is from religion." Upon this, the Lord of all worlds alerted by His saying—and He is the Most Truthful of speakers—"Eat of the wholesome things and do righteous deeds." Therefore, whoever proceeds to eat in order to seek aid through it for knowledge and action, and to strengthen himself by it for piety, it is not fitting that he leave himself neglected and aimless, indulging in eating as beasts indulge in pasture. For that which is a means to religion and a path towards it ought to have the lights of religion appear upon it. The lights of religion are its etiquettes and its established practices, by which the servant is reined with its bridle and the God-fearing is curbed with its bit, until the appetite for food is balanced by the scale of the Sacred Law in its advance and its restraint. Thus, through them, it becomes a repeller of sin and an attractor of reward, even if within it lies the fullest share for the soul. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, a man is rewarded even for the morsel he raises to his mouth." And in another narration, "Indeed, a man is rewarded for the morsel he raises to his mouth and to the mouth of his wife." Al-Bukhari transmitted it from the narration of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. And, "Whatever you spend is charity, even the morsel you raise to the mouth of your wife." That, however, is if he raises it for the sake of religion and in observance of religion, mindful therein of its etiquettes and its duties. Here, we now guide to the duties of religion regarding eating: its obligations, its recommended practices, its etiquettes, its marks of noble character, and its manners, in four chapters, with a section at their end.

Chapter One: Concerning what the eater must observe, even if eating alone.
Chapter Two: Concerning the additional etiquettes due to communal eating.
Chapter Three: Concerning what is specific to presenting food to visiting brethren.
Chapter Four: Concerning what is specific to invitation, hospitality, and the like.

Chapter One: Concerning what is necessary for one who is alone. It is of three parts: a part before eating, a part during eating, and a part after finishing.

The First Part: Concerning the etiquettes that precede eating. They are:

First: That the food, after being lawful in itself, be wholesome in the manner of its acquisition, conforming to the Prophetic practice and scrupulous piety, not acquired by a means disliked in the Sacred Law nor by a ruling of base desire and religious compromise, according to what will come regarding the meaning of absolute wholesomeness in the Book of the Lawful and the Prohibited. God, the Exalted, has commanded the eating of the wholesome, which is the lawful, and gave precedence to the prohibition of consuming wealth wrongfully over killing, magnifying the matter of the prohibited and exalting the blessing of the lawful. He, the Exalted, said, "O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly..." to His saying, "...and do not kill yourselves..." The foundation regarding food is its being wholesome, and this is from the obligations and fundamentals of religion.

Second: Washing the hands. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Ablution before food drives away poverty, and after it drives away minor sins." In another narration, "It drives away poverty before food and after it." Al-Quda'i transmitted it in *Musnad al-Shihab* from the narration of Musa al-Rida from his forefathers, connected with the first wording. And al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* from the narration of Ibn 'Abbas: "Ablution before food and after it is among what drives away poverty." And Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Salman: "The blessing of food is ablution before it and ablution after it." All are weak narrations. And because the hand is not free from soiling in handling affairs, washing it is closer to cleanliness and purity. And because eating for the purpose of seeking aid for religion is an act of worship, it is worthy that what serves as its purification, like the purification for prayer, be undertaken beforehand.

Third: That the food be placed on a cloth spread on the ground, for this is closer to the practice of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings upon him, than raising it on a table. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings upon him, when food was brought to him, would place it on the ground.

On the earth, Ahmad recorded it in the Book of Asceticism from the narration of Al-Hasan as a mursal report, and Al-Bazzar narrated something similar from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. In its chain are a group of narrators whom Ahmad considered reliable, but Al-Daraqutni considered it weak. This is closer to humility. If not that, then upon a *safrah* (a leather mat or cloth spread for food), for it reminds one of travel, and from travel one is reminded of the journey of the Hereafter and his need for the provision of God-consciousness. And Anas ibn Malik, may God have mercy on him, said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, never ate from a *khawan* (a raised table) nor from a *sukurjah* (a small bowl)." The hadith of Anas: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, never ate from a *khawan* nor from a *sukurjah*." Al-Bukhari narrated it. It was said: "Then upon what did you eat?" He said: "Upon a *safrah*." And it was said: "Four things were innovated after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him: dining tables (*mawa'id*), sieves, washing with lote-tree leaves (*ashnan*), and satiety." Know that although we say eating upon a *safrah* is preferable, we do not say that eating upon a dining table is prohibited by a prohibition of dislike or unlawfulness, as no prohibition concerning it has been established. And what is said—that it was innovated after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him—does not mean that everything innovated is prohibited. Rather, the prohibited innovation is one that opposes an established sunnah and abolishes a matter of the Shari'ah while its cause remains. Indeed, innovation may even become obligatory in some circumstances when causes change. As for the dining table, it merely raises the food from the ground to facilitate eating and similar purposes, in which there is no dislike. The four things gathered under being innovations are not equal. Rather, washing with *ashnan* is good due to the cleanliness it contains, for washing is recommended for cleanliness, and *ashnan* is more complete in cleansing. They did not use it perhaps because it was not customary among them, or not readily available, or they were occupied with matters more important than excessive concern for cleanliness. Indeed, they would not even wash their hands, and their napkins were the soles of their feet. Yet that does not negate the recommendation of washing. As for the sieve, its purpose is to refine the food, which is permissible as long as it does not reach excessive luxury. As for the dining table, it facilitates eating, which is also permissible as long as it does not lead to arrogance and self-importance. As for satiety, it is the most severe of these four, for it incites passions and stirs up ailments in the body. So, let the distinction between these innovations be grasped. The fourth matter is to assume a good posture upon the *safrah* at the beginning of sitting and maintain it thus. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would sometimes kneel for eating upon his knees and sit on the tops of his feet. And sometimes he would extend his right leg and sit on his left. The hadith: "He would sometimes kneel for eating upon his knees and sit on the tops of his feet. And sometimes he would extend his right leg and sit on his left." Abu Dawud narrated it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Bashir within a longer hadith: "They brought the large dish and gathered around it. When they became many, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, knelt..." The hadith. And he (Abu Dawud) and Al-Nasa'i have from the hadith of Anas: "I saw him eating while crouching from hunger." And Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Maqri narrated in *Al-Shama'il* from his hadith: "When he sat for food, he would rise up on his left knee and keep the right upright. Then he would say: 'I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats and I do as a servant does.'" Its chain is weak. And he would say: "I do not eat while reclining." The hadith: "He would say: 'I do not eat while reclining.'" Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Abu Juhaifah. "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats and I sit as a servant sits." The hadith: "I am but a servant; I eat as a servant eats and I sit as a servant sits." It was mentioned before from the hadith of Anas with the wording "and I do" instead of "and I sit." And Al-Bazzar narrated it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar without his saying "and I sit." Drinking while reclining is also disliked for the stomach. And eating while lying down or reclining is disliked, except for what one transfers of grains. It is narrated from 'Ali, may God honor his face, that he ate a cake on a shield while lying down. And it is said: lying flat on one's stomach, and the Arabs would do that. The fifth matter is to intend by his eating to gain strength for obeying God Almighty, so that he is being obedient by eating, and not aim for pleasure and luxury in eating. Ibrahim ibn Shayban said: "For eighty years I have not eaten anything for my appetite." And along with that, he should resolve to eat little, for if he eats for the sake of strength for worship, his intention is not sincere except by eating less than satiety, for satiety prevents worship and does not give strength for it. From the necessity of this intention is breaking the appetite and preferring contentment over abundance. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The son of Adam fills no vessel worse than his stomach. Sufficient for the son of Adam are morsels that keep his back upright. But if he must, then one-third for his food, one-third for his drink, and one-third for his breath." The hadith: "The son of Adam fills no vessel worse than his stomach..." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and said it is *hasan* (good). And Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of Al-Miqdad ibn Ma'dikarib. From the necessity of this intention is that he not stretch his hand to the food except when he is hungry, so that hunger becomes one of the prerequisites that must precede eating. Then it is fitting...

To lift the hand before satiety; whoever does so becomes independent of the physician. The benefit of eating little and the method of gradually reducing it will come in the Book of Breaking the Craving for Food, from the Sixth Quarter of the Destroyers.

The sixth is to be content with the existing provision and the present food, and not to strive for luxury, seek increase, or wait for condiments. Rather, part of honoring bread is not to wait for condiments with it. The command to honor bread has been reported: "Honor bread," narrated by Al-Bazzar, Al-Tabarani, and Ibn Qani' from the hadith of Abdullah ibn Umm Haram with a very weak chain. Ibn al-Jawzi mentioned it in Al-Mawdu'at. So, anything that sustains life and strengthens for worship is abundant good; it should not be despised. Rather, one should not delay prayer for bread if its time arrives, provided there is ample time. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When supper is served and the evening prayer is due, begin with supper." This has preceded in the chapter on prayer. It is well-known that when the prayer is established, Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, would sometimes hear the Imam's recitation and not rise from his supper. Whenever the soul does not yearn for food and there is no harm in delaying the meal, it is preferable to perform the prayer first. However, if food is present and the prayer is established, and delaying would cause the food to cool or disturb its affair, then eating first is more beloved when there is ample time, whether the soul yearns for it or not, due to the generality of the report and because the heart is not free from turning to the food placed before it, even if hunger is not overwhelming.

The seventh is to strive to increase the hands partaking of the food, even if from one's family and children. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Gather together over your food, and blessing will be bestowed upon you therein," narrated by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Wahshi ibn Harb with a good chain. And Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, would not eat alone," narrated by Al-Khara'iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq with a weak chain. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best food is that over which many hands gather."

The second section concerns the etiquettes during eating. It is to begin with "In the name of Allah" at the start and end with "Praise be to Allah." If one says "In the name of Allah" with every morsel, it is good, so that greed does not distract from the remembrance of Allah Almighty. He should say with the first morsel "In the name of Allah," with the second "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious," and with the third "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful," and say it aloud to remind others. He should eat with the right hand, begin with salt and end with it, make the morsel small, chew it well, and not reach for another until he has swallowed it, for that is haste in eating. He should not criticize food, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would not criticize food; if he liked it, he ate it, otherwise he left it, as agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurairah. He should eat from what is nearest to him, except for fruit, for he may move his hand around it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Eat from what is near you," agreed upon from the hadith of Umar ibn Abi Salamah. Then, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would move around the fruit platter. When asked about that, he said: "It is not of one kind," narrated by Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of 'Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, and in it: "The hand of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, moved around the dish, and he said: 'O 'Ikrimah, eat from wherever you wish, for it is not of one color.'" Al-Tirmidhi said it is ghareeb (strange), and Ibn Hibban narrated it in Al-Du'afa'. He should not eat from the top of the bowl nor from the middle of the food, but rather from the roundness of the loaf, unless bread is scarce, then he may break the bread and not cut it with a knife. The prohibition of cutting bread with a knife is narrated by Ibn Hibban in Al-Du'afa' from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, containing Nuh ibn Abi Maryam, who is a liar, and Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in Al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Umm Salamah with a weak chain. Nor should he cut meat, for it is prohibited, and he said: "Tear it with your teeth." The prohibition of cutting meat with a knife is narrated by Abu Dawud from the hadith of Aisha, and he said: "Then tear it with your teeth." Al-Nasa'i said it is munkar (rejected), and Al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah narrated it from the hadith of Safwan ibn Umayyah: "And tear the meat with your teeth," with a weak chain. He should not place a bowl or anything else on the bread except what he eats with it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Honor bread, for Allah Almighty sent it down from the blessings of heaven." He should not wipe his hand with bread. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If a morsel falls from one of you, let him take it and remove any harm from it, and not leave it for Satan." He should not wipe his hand with a napkin until he licks his fingers, for he does not know in which of them the blessing lies.

If a morsel falls from one of you, let him take it, remove any harm from it, and not leave it for Satan. He should not wipe his hand with a napkin until he licks his fingers, for he does not know in which part of his food the blessing lies. This was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Anas and Jabir. One should not blow on hot food; there is a prohibition against blowing on food and drink. This was narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad from the hadith of Ibn Abbas, and it is found in Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi who authenticated it, and Ibn Majah, though they said "in the vessel." Al-Tirmidhi also authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "There is a prohibition against blowing in the drink." Thus, it is forbidden; rather, one should be patient until it becomes easy to eat. One should eat dates in odd numbers: seven, eleven, twenty-one, or whatever is available. One should not gather dates and pits on a plate, nor gather them in his palm. Instead, he should place the pit from his mouth onto the back of his hand and then discard it. The same applies to anything with a seed or residue. One should not leave what he has picked out from the food and throw it in the bowl; rather, he should leave it with the residue so it is not confused by others and eaten. One should not drink excessively during the meal unless choking on a morsel or truly thirsty, for it has been said that this is recommended in medicine and that it tans the stomach. As for drinking, its etiquette is to take the cup with the right hand, say "In the name of God," and drink it in sips, not in gulps. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Sip water in sips and do not gulp it, for gulping causes liver inflammation." This was narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Anas with the first part, and by Abu Dawud in al-Marasil from the narration of 'Ata ibn Abi Rabah: "When you drink, drink in sips." One should not drink while standing or reclining, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, prohibited drinking while standing. This was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Anas, Abu Sa'id, and Abu Hurairah. It is also narrated that he, peace be upon him, drank while standing, agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn Abbas, and that was from Zamzam water, and perhaps it was due to an excuse. One should observe the bottom of the cup so it does not drip on him, and look into the cup before drinking. One should not belch or breathe into the cup; rather, he should move it away from his mouth with praise and return it with the name of God. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said after drinking: "Praise be to God who made it sweet and fresh by His mercy and did not make it salty and bitter due to our sins." This was narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Du'a' as a mursal narration from the report of Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn al-Husayn. The cup and anything passed around a gathering should be passed to the right. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, once drank milk with Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, on his left, a Bedouin on his right, and 'Umar in his direction. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Give to Abu Bakr," but he gave it to the Bedouin and said: "The right, then the right." One should drink in three breaths, praising God at the end of each and beginning with the name of God. At the end of the first breath, he says: "Praise be to God"; in the second: "Lord of the worlds"; and in the third, he adds: "The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." This is close to twenty etiquettes in the state of eating and drinking indicated by the reports and traditions. The third section is what is recommended after food: to stop before fullness, lick his fingers, then wipe with a napkin, then wash them, and pick up the fallen crumbs. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever eats what falls from the table will live in abundance and his children will be protected." This was narrated by Abu al-Shaykh in Kitab al-Thawab from the hadith of Jabir with the wording: "He will be safe from poverty, leprosy, and insanity, and his children will be protected from foolishness." And from the hadith of al-Hajjaj ibn 'Ilat: "He will be given abundance of provision and protected in his children." Both are very weak. One should use a toothpick and not swallow everything that comes out from between his teeth with the pick, except what he gathers from the bases of his teeth with his tongue. As for what is removed with the pick, he should discard it. He should rinse his mouth after using the toothpick; there is a report about this from the Household, peace be upon them. He should lick the bowl, drink its water, and it is said: "Whoever licks the bowl, washes it, and drinks its water will have the reward of freeing a slave," and that picking up crumbs is the dowry of the wide-eyed maidens. He should thank God Almighty in his heart for what He has fed him, seeing the food as a blessing from Him. God Almighty said: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you and be grateful to God." Whenever he eats something lawful, he should say: "Praise be to God by whose grace good deeds are completed and blessings descend. O God, feed us what is good and employ us in righteousness." If he eats something doubtful, he should say: "Praise be to God in every situation. O God, do not make it a strength for us in disobeying You." After food, he should recite: "Say: He is God, the One," and "For the security of Quraysh," and he should not rise from...

The table until it is first lifted; if one eats another's food, let him supplicate for him and say: O Allah, increase his good and bless him in what You have provided, and make it easy for him to do good with it, and make him content with what You have given him, and make us and him among the grateful. And if he breaks his fast at someone's home, let him say: May the fasting ones break their fast with you, and the righteous eat your food, and may the angels send blessings upon you. And let him increase in seeking forgiveness and feel sorrow for what he ate of doubtful things, to extinguish with his tears and grief the heat of the Fire that is presented to him, due to the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him: Any flesh that grows from the unlawful, the Fire is more deserving of it. The hadith "Any flesh that grows from the unlawful, the Fire is more deserving of it" is in Shu'ab al-Iman from the hadith of Ka'b bin 'Ujrah with the wording "suhut," and it is in Tirmidhi who graded it as good with the wording: No flesh grows from suhut except that the Fire is more deserving of it. And one who eats and weeps is not like one who eats and amuses himself. And when he drinks milk, let him say: O Allah, bless us in what You have provided us and increase us in it. The hadith of the people regarding drinking milk: O Allah, bless us in what You have provided us and increase us in it, was reported by Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi who graded it as good, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas: When any of you eats food, let him say: O Allah, bless us in it and provide us with better than it. And whoever Allah gives milk to drink, let him say: O Allah, bless us in it and increase us in it. If he eats something else, he says: O Allah, bless us in what You have provided us and provide us with better than it. That supplication is among what the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, specifically designated for milk due to its general benefit. And it is recommended after food to say: Praise be to Allah who fed us, gave us drink, sufficed us, and sheltered us, our Master and Protector, O Sufficer from everything, and nothing suffices from You. You fed from hunger, gave security from fear, so to You is praise. You sheltered from orphanhood, guided from misguidance, and enriched from poverty, so to You is praise, abundant, constant, good, beneficial, and blessed praise, as You are worthy and deserving of it. O Allah, You have fed us good food, so make us act righteously and make it a means of assistance for us in obeying You, and we seek refuge in You from using it to aid in disobeying You. As for washing the hands with ushnan, its method is to place the ushnan in his left palm, wash the three fingers of the right hand first, strike his fingers on the dry ushnan, then wipe his lips with it, then thoroughly wash his mouth with his finger, rubbing the outer and inner surfaces of his teeth, the palate, and the tongue, then wash his fingers from that with water, then rub with the remainder of the dry ushnan his fingers on the back and palm, and he can dispense with returning the ushnan to the mouth and rewashing it. The second chapter: On what increases due to gathering and sharing in eating, and they are seven. The first: Not to begin eating when with someone who deserves precedence due to older age or greater merit, unless he is the one being followed and emulated. Then, he should not make them wait long if they are eager to eat and have gathered for it. The second: Not to remain silent over food, for that is the way of non-Arabs, but to speak of what is good and converse with stories of the righteous regarding food and other matters. The third: To be gentle with his companion in the shared dish, not intending to eat more than what his companion eats, for that is unlawful if not in accordance with his companion's pleasure, as long as the food is shared. Rather, he should intend selflessness and not eat two dates at once unless they do so or he seeks their permission. If his companion eats little, he encourages him and urges him to eat, saying to him: Eat, but not exceeding saying it three times, for that is insistence and excess. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, when addressed about something three times, would not respond after three. The hadith: When he was addressed about something three times, he would not respond after three, was reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Jabir in a long hadith and from the hadith of Abu Hurdah as well, and their chains are good. And he, peace be upon him, would repeat speech three times. The hadith: He would repeat the word three times, was reported by Bukhari from the hadith of Anas: He would repeat the word three times. So it is not from good manners to exceed that. As for swearing to him to eat, it is prohibited. Al-Hasan bin 'Ali, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: Food is too trivial to swear over. The fourth: Not to compel his companion to say to him: Eat. Some people of manners said: The best of eaters is he who does not compel his companion to check on him in eating and spares his brother the burden of speech. And he should not leave something he desires because of others looking at him, for that is affectation. Rather, he proceeds according to habit and does not decrease from his habit in solitude. But he accustoms himself to good manners in solitude so as not to need affectation when gathering. Yes, if he reduces his eating out of selflessness for his brothers and consideration for them when there is need for that, it is good. And if he increases in eating with the intention of helping and stimulating the enthusiasm of the people in eating, there is no harm in that; rather, it is good. And Ibn al-Mubarak would present the finest...

He would bring fresh dates to his brothers and say, "Whoever eats more, I will give him a dirham for every pit." He would count the pits and give each person who had extra pits a number of dirhams equal to their count. This was to dispel shyness and increase liveliness in socializing. Ja'far ibn Muhammad, may God be pleased with them both, said, "The dearest of my brothers to me is the one who eats the most, takes the largest mouthful, and the heaviest burden upon me is one who obliges me to attend to him while eating." All of this points to following customary practice and abandoning affectation. Ja'far, may God have mercy on him, also said, "The quality of a man's love for his brother is shown by the quality of his eating in his house."

Fifth: Washing the hands in a basin is permissible. If one eats alone, he may spit into it. But if he eats with others, he should not do that. If someone else presents the basin to him as an honor, he should accept it. Anas ibn Malik and Thabit al-Bunani, may God be pleased with them both, gathered for a meal. Anas presented the basin to him, but Thabit declined. Anas said, "When your brother honors you, accept his honor and do not reject it, for it is God, Mighty and Majestic, who is being honored." It is narrated that Harun al-Rashid invited Abu Mu'awiyah the blind man. Al-Rashid poured water over his hands into the basin. When he finished, he said, "O Abu Mu'awiyah, do you know who poured water over your hands?" He said, "No." He said, "The Commander of the Faithful poured it." He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, you honored knowledge and held it in esteem, so may God honor and esteem you as you have honored knowledge and its people." There is no harm in people gathering to wash their hands in the basin at one time, for it is closer to humility and farther from prolonged waiting. If they do not do that, the water of each person should not be poured separately; rather, the water should be gathered in the basin. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Gather your ablution water, and God will gather your unity." The hadith "Gather your ablution water, and God will gather your unity" was narrated by al-Quda'i in *Musnad al-Shihab* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a chain that is acceptable. Ibn Tahir put Ibrahim in place of Abu Hurayrah and said it is interrupted and is subject to scrutiny. It is said this is the intended meaning. 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz wrote to the provinces: "The basin should not be lifted from before a people except when full, and do not resemble the non-Arabs." Ibn Mas'ud said, "Gather to wash your hands in one basin, and do not follow the custom of the non-Arabs." As for the servant who pours water on the hands, some disliked him standing and preferred him sitting because it is closer to humility. Some disliked him sitting. It is narrated that he poured water on the hands of a man with a servant sitting, so the one whose hands were being washed stood up. He was asked, "Why did you stand?" He said, "One of us must be standing." This latter is preferable because it is easier for pouring and washing and is closer to the humility of the one pouring. If he has an intention in it, then enabling him to serve is not arrogance, for custom proceeds with that. Thus, regarding the basin, there are seven etiquettes: not to spit in it; to present it to the one being followed; to accept the honor of being presented with it; to pass it to the right; for a group to gather at it; for the water to be gathered in it; for the servant to be standing; and to expel water from the mouth and release it from the hand gently so it does not splash on the bedding or on his companions. The host should personally pour water on the hand of his guest. Malik did this with al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with them both, when he first stayed with him, and said, "Let not what you see from me alarm you," for serving the guest is an obligation.

Sixth: He should not look at his companions or watch their eating, lest they become shy. Rather, he should lower his gaze from them and occupy himself with himself. He should not withhold his hand before his brothers if they are reserved about eating after him. Rather, he should extend his hand and withdraw it, taking a little at a time until they have had their fill. If he eats little, he should pause at the beginning and eat little until, when they have partaken freely of the food, he eats with them at the end. Many of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, did this. If he refrains for a reason, he should apologize to them to spare them embarrassment.

Seventh: He should not do what others find repulsive. He should not shake his hand in the bowl, nor should he bring his head forward to the bowl when placing the morsel in his mouth. If he removes something from his mouth, he should turn his face away from the food and take it with his left hand. He should not dip a greasy morsel in vinegar, nor vinegar in grease, for others may dislike it. The morsel he has bitten with his tooth, he should not dip the remainder in the broth or vinegar. He should not speak of things that remind of repulsive matters.

Chapter Three: On the Etiquettes of Presenting Food to Visiting Brothers
Presenting food to brothers holds much merit. Ja'far ibn Muhammad, may God be pleased with them both, said, "When you sit with brothers at the dining cloth, prolong the sitting, for it is an hour not counted against you from your lifespans." Al-Hasan, may God have mercy on him, said, "Every expense a man spends on himself, his parents, and those below them, he will be accountable for it entirely, except a man's expense on his brothers for food, for God is too gracious to ask about that." This is besides what has come in reports about feeding others. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not..."

The angels continue to send blessings upon one of you as long as the dining cloth remains spread before him until it is removed. A narration states: The angels continue to send blessings upon one of you as long as the dining cloth remains spread before him until he removes it. This was reported by Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat from a narration of ‘A’ishah with a weak chain. It is narrated from some scholars of Khurasan that he would present abundant food to his brothers, more than they could consume, and he would say: We have received from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: When brothers lift their hands from the food, the one who eats the remainder is not held accountable. A narration: When brothers lift their hands from the food, the one who eats from the remainder of that food is not held accountable. I have not found a source for it, but I love to offer you more than we can eat so that we may consume the surplus. In a report: A servant is not held accountable for what he eats with his brothers. A narration: A servant is not held accountable for what he eats with his brothers. It is in the following narration with the same meaning. Some of them would eat more in a gathering for that reason and eat less when alone. In a report: Three things for which a servant is not held accountable: the pre-dawn meal, what he breaks his fast with, and what he eats with brothers. A narration: Three things for which a servant is not held accountable: the pre-dawn meal, what he breaks his fast with, and what he eats with brothers. This was reported by Al-Azdi in Al-Du‘afa’ from a narration of Jabir: Three are not questioned about bliss: the fasting person, the one taking the pre-dawn meal, and the man who eats with his guest. He cited it in the biography of Sulayman ibn Dawud Al-Jazari and said it is a rejected narration. Abu Mansur Al-Daylami has something similar in Musnad Al-Firdaws from a narration of Abu Hurayrah. And ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: To gather my brothers upon a measure of food is more beloved to me than freeing a slave. Ibn ‘Umar, may God be pleased with them both, used to say: Among a man’s nobility is the goodness of his provision on a journey and his generosity with it to his companions. The Companions, may God be pleased with them, used to say: Gathering for food is among noble character traits. They, may God be pleased with them, would gather for the recitation of the Qur’an and would not part except after a taste. It is said: The gathering of brothers upon sufficiency with intimacy and affection is not of this world. In a report: God Almighty will say to the servant on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam, I was hungry and you did not feed Me. He will say: How could I feed You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Your Muslim brother was hungry and you did not feed him; had you fed him, you would have fed Me. A narration: God will say to the servant on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam, I was hungry and you did not feed Me. The hadith is reported by Muslim from a narration of Abu Hurayrah with the wording: I asked you for food and you did not feed Me. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: When a visitor comes to you, honor him. A narration: When a visitor comes to you, honor him. This was reported by Al-Khara’iti in Makarim Al-Akhlaq from a narration of Anas, and it is a rejected narration, as stated by Ibn Abi Hatim in Al-‘Ilal from his father. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: In Paradise there are chambers whose inside can be seen from the outside and whose outside can be seen from the inside; they are for those who speak gently, feed others, and pray at night while people are asleep. A narration: In Paradise there are chambers whose inside can be seen from the outside and whose outside can be seen from the inside; they are for those who speak gently, feed others, and pray at night while people are asleep. This was reported by Al-Tirmidhi from a narration of ‘Ali, and he said it is rare; we only know it from the narration of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Ishaq, and he has been criticized regarding his memory. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: The best of you are those who feed others. A narration: The best of you are those who feed others. This was reported by Ahmad and Al-Hakim from a narration of Suhayb, and he said the chain is sound. And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: Whoever feeds his brother until he is satisfied and gives him drink until he is quenched, God will distance him from the Fire by seven trenches, between each two trenches is a distance of five hundred years. A narration: Whoever feeds his brother until he is satisfied and gives him drink until he is quenched, God will distance him from the Fire by seven trenches, between each two trenches is a distance of five hundred years. This was reported by Al-Tabarani from a narration of ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Umar. Ibn Hibban said it is not from the hadith of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. Al-Dhahabi said it is rare and rejected. As for its etiquettes, some pertain to entering and some to presenting the food. Regarding entering, it is not from the Sunnah to intend a people while waiting for their mealtime and then enter upon them at the time of eating, for that is a surprise, and it has been prohibited. God Almighty says: Do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, without waiting for its preparation. Meaning: awaiting its time and readiness. In a report: Whoever walks to a meal to which he was not invited walks as a transgressor and eats unlawfully. A narration: Whoever walks to a meal to which he was not invited walks as a transgressor and eats unlawfully. This was reported by Al-Bayhaqi from a narration of ‘A’ishah, something similar, and he weakened it. Abu Dawud has from a narration of Ibn ‘Umar: Whoever enters without an invitation enters as a thief and leaves as a plunderer. Its chain is weak. However, it is the right of the one who enters, if he did not wait and happened to find them with food, not to eat unless he is given permission.

It is said: In every instance of being looked upon, if one knows that people speak out of love to assist him, then let them assist. But if they speak out of shyness towards him, then it is not fitting for him to eat; rather, he should make an excuse. However, if he is hungry and intends to visit some of his brothers so they may feed him, and he does not lie in wait for their mealtime, there is no harm in it. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, along with Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them, intended the house of Abu al-Haytham ibn al-Tayhan and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari for the sake of food they would eat, and they were hungry. The narration of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, along with Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them, intending the house of Abu al-Haytham ibn al-Tayhan and Abu Ayyub al-Ansari for the sake of food they would eat—as for the story of Abu al-Haytham, al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and said it is *hasan gharib sahih*. The story is in Muslim, but it does not mention Abu al-Haytham; rather, it says "a man from the Ansar." As for the narration of their intending the house of Abu Ayyub, al-Tabarani narrated it in *al-Mu'jam al-Saghir* from the hadith of Ibn Abbas with a weak chain.

Entering in such a state is an assistance to that Muslim in attaining the reward of feeding, and it was the practice of the predecessors. 'Awn ibn 'Abdullah al-Mas'udi had three hundred and sixty friends upon whom he would call throughout the year, another had thirty upon whom he would call each month, and another had seven upon whom he would call each week. Their brothers were known to them in place of their own earnings, and the maintenance of those by them was with the intention of seeking blessing, an act of worship for them. If one enters and does not find the master of the house, yet is confident in his friendship and knows of his joy if he eats from his food, then he may eat without his permission, for the purpose of permission is contentment, especially concerning food and its matters, which are broad. For many a man may explicitly give permission and even swear, yet he is not content, so eating his food is disliked. And many an absent person who did not give permission, yet eating his food is beloved. Indeed, God Almighty has said: "or your friend." And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered the house of Barirah and ate her food while she was absent, and the food was from charity. He said, "The charity has reached its proper place." The hadith: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered the house of Barirah and ate her food while she was absent, and it was from charity. He said, "The charity has reached its place." It is agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah: Meat was gifted to Barirah, and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "It is charity for her and a gift for us." As for his saying, "It has reached its proper place," he said it concerning the sheep she gave to Nusaybah from charity, and it is also agreed upon from the hadith of Umm 'Atiyyah. That is due to his knowledge of her delight in that. Therefore, it is permissible to enter the house without seeking permission, relying on one's knowledge of the permission. If one does not know, then seeking permission first, then entering, is necessary.

Muhammad ibn Wasī' and his companions would enter the house of al-Hasan and eat what they found without permission. Al-Hasan would enter and see that and rejoice, saying, "Thus we used to be." It is narrated from al-Hasan, may God be pleased with him, that he was standing, eating from a grocer's goods in the market, taking a fig from this basket and a piece of dried meat from that. Hisham said to him, "What has appeared to you, O Abu Sa'id, concerning scrupulousness? You eat a man's goods without his permission." He said, "O foolish one, recite to me the verse of eating." So he recited up to God's saying: "or your friend." He said, "So who is the friend, O Abu Sa'id?" He replied, "He to whom the soul is drawn and the heart finds tranquility."

A group of people went to the house of Sufyan al-Thawri and did not find him. They opened the door, laid out the dining cloth, and began to eat. Al-Thawri entered and began to say, "You have reminded me of the manners of the predecessors; thus they were." A group visited one of the Followers, and he had nothing to offer them. So he went to the house of one of his brothers but did not find him at home. He entered, saw a pot he had cooked, bread he had baked, and other things, carried it all, and presented it to his companions, saying, "Eat." The master of the house came and did not see anything. It was said to him, "So-and-so took it." He said, "He has done well." When he met him, he said, "O my brother, if they return, then do so again."

These are the etiquettes of entering. As for the etiquettes of offering, the first is to avoid affectation and to offer what is present. If nothing is present and one does not possess anything, then one should not borrow for that purpose, causing disturbance to oneself. If one has what he needs for his own sustenance and his soul is not generous in offering it, then he should not offer it. One of them entered upon an ascetic while he was eating. He said, "Were it not that I acquired it through debt, I would feed you from it." Some of the predecessors said in explanation of affectation: "That you feed your brother what you yourself do not eat, but rather you intend an increase for him in quality and value." Al-Fudayl used to say, "People only cut off ties due to affectation. One of them invites his brother and then puts on airs for him, so it cuts him off from returning to him." Another said, "I do not care which of my brothers comes to me, for I do not put on airs for him. I only bring forth what is near me, and if I were to put on airs for him, I would dislike his coming and grow weary of him." Another said, "I used to enter upon a brother of mine, and he would put on airs for me. I said to him, 'You do not eat this alone, nor do I, so why is it that when we are together...'"

We gathered and ate together, so either you must abandon this affectation or I will cease coming. So he abandoned the affectation, and our gatherings continued because of it. Among affectation is that a person presents all that he has, thereby wronging his family and hurting their hearts.

It is narrated that a man invited ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, and ‘Ali said: I will accept your invitation on three conditions: that you do not bring anything from the market, that you do not hoard what is in the house, and that you do not wrong your family. Some of them would present from everything in the house, leaving no type of food without bringing something of it.

Some said: We visited Jabir ibn ‘Abd Allah and he presented to us bread and vinegar, saying: "Were we not prohibited from affectation, I would have gone to lengths for you." A narration states: We visited Jabir ibn ‘Abd Allah and he presented to us bread and vinegar, saying: "Were we not prohibited from affectation, I would have gone to lengths for you." Ahmad narrated it without the phrase "Were we not prohibited," and it is from the hadith of Salman al-Farisi, and it will come after this. Both are weak. Al-Bukhari narrates from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab: "We were prohibited from affectation."

Some said: If you intend a visit, present what is readily available; but if you are specifically invited, do not hold back or leave anything out. Salman said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us not to go to lengths for a guest with what we do not have, and to present to him what we have readily. The hadith of Salman: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded us not to go to lengths for a guest with what we do not have, and to present to him what we have readily. Al-Khara'iti recorded it in *Makārim al-Akhlāq*. Ahmad has: "Were it not that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited us—or were it not that we were prohibited—that any of us should go to lengths for his companion, we would have gone to lengths for you." Al-Tabarani has: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited us from going to lengths for a guest with what we do not have." In the hadith of Yunus, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was visited by his brothers, and he presented to them pieces of bread and cut for them some vegetables he used to cultivate. Then he said to them: "Eat. Were it not that God has cursed those who affect, I would have gone to lengths for you."

From Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, and other Companions, they would present what was readily available of dry pieces of bread and inferior dates, saying: "We do not know which sin is greater: he who scorns what is presented to him, or he who scorns what he has to present."

The second etiquette, which is for the visitor, is not to demand or insist on something specific, for perhaps it would be difficult for the host to procure it. If his brother gives him a choice between two foods, let him choose the easier one for him. Such is the Sunnah, for in the report: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was never given a choice between two things except that he chose the easier one." The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was never given a choice between two things except that he chose the easier one," is agreed upon from the hadith of ‘A’ishah, with the addition: "so long as it was not a sin." Muslim did not mention this in some of his chains.

Al-A‘mash narrated from Abu Wa’il that he said: I went with a companion of mine to visit Salman, and he presented to us barley bread and coarse salt. My companion said: "If there were some thyme in this salt, it would be more pleasant." Salman went out, pawned his prayer garment, and got some thyme. When we had eaten, my companion said: "Praise be to God who has made us content with what He has provided." Salman said: "Had you been content with what you were provided, my prayer garment would not be pawned." This applies when one imagines that it is difficult for his brother or that he dislikes it. If he knows that his suggestion pleases him and that it is easy for him, then suggesting is not disliked. Al-Shafi‘i, may God be pleased with him, did this with Al-Za‘farani when he was staying with him in Baghdad. Al-Za‘farani would write a note every day listing the dishes to be cooked and give it to the servant girl. Al-Shafi‘i took the note one day and added another dish in his own handwriting. When Al-Za‘farani saw that dish, he objected, saying: "I did not order this." The note was shown to him with Al-Shafi‘i's handwriting added to it. When his eye fell upon his handwriting, he rejoiced at that and freed the servant girl out of joy at Al-Shafi‘i's suggestion to him.

Abu Bakr al-Kattani said: I entered upon Al-Sarri, and he brought some crumbled bread and began putting half of it in the cup. I said to him: "What are you doing? I drink it all at once." He laughed and said: "This is better for you than a pilgrimage." Some said: Eating is of three types: with the poor, by giving preference; with brothers, by ease and openness; and with the people of the world, with etiquette.

The third etiquette is that the host should stimulate his brother the visitor's appetite and seek his suggestion whenever his own soul is pleased to do what is suggested, for that is good and in it is great reward and merit. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "He who fulfills a desire of his brother will be forgiven, and he who gladdens his believing brother has gladdened God Almighty." The hadith: "He who fulfills a desire of his brother, God will forgive him, and he who gladdens his believing brother has gladdened God, Mighty and Glorious," was recorded by Al-Bazzar and Al-Tabarani from the hadith of Abu al-Darda’: "He who matches a desire of his brother will be forgiven." Ibn al-Jawzi said: "This is a fabricated hadith." Ibn Hibban and Al-‘Uqayli in *Al-Du‘afa’* narrate from the hadith of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq: "He who gladdens a believer has indeed gladdened God." The hadith.

Al-'Uqayli said it is baseless and without origin. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said in what was narrated by Jabir: "Whoever delights his brother with what he desires, Allah writes for him a million good deeds, erases from him a million evil deeds, raises him a million degrees, and Allah feeds him from three gardens: the Garden of Paradise, the Garden of Eden, and the Garden of Eternity." The hadith of Jabir, "Whoever delights his brother with what he desires, Allah writes for him a million good deeds," was mentioned by Ibn al-Jawzi in "Al-Mawdu'at" from the narration of Muhammad ibn Nu'aym from Ibn al-Zubayr from Jabir. Ahmad ibn Hanbal said, "This is baseless, a lie."

The fourth etiquette is not to say to him, 'Shall I bring you food?' Rather, one should present it if it is available. Al-Thawri said, "If your brother visits you, do not say to him, 'Will you eat?' or 'Shall I bring you something?' But present it. If he eats, good; if not, then remove it." And if one intends to feed them food, it is not proper to make it apparent to them or describe it to them. Al-Thawri said, "If you wish not to feed your family from what you eat, then do not mention it to them nor let them see it with you." Some Sufis said, "If the poor enter upon you, present food to them. If the jurists enter, ask them about a legal issue. If the reciters enter, direct them to the prayer niche."

The fourth chapter is on the etiquettes of hospitality, and the places for these etiquettes are six: the invitation first, then the acceptance, then the attendance, then presenting the food, then eating, then departure. We shall proceed to explain them, God willing.

The virtue of hospitality: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not burden yourselves for a guest and thereby cause him to be disliked, for whoever dislikes the guest dislikes Allah, and whoever dislikes Allah, Allah dislikes him." The hadith, "Do not burden yourselves for a guest and thereby cause him to be disliked, for whoever dislikes the guest dislikes Allah, and whoever dislikes Allah, Allah dislikes him," was transmitted by Abu Bakr ibn Lal in "Makārim al-Akhlaq" from the hadith of Salman: "Let none of you burden himself for his guest with what he cannot afford." In its chain is Muhammad ibn al-Faraj al-Azraq, who is criticized. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "There is no good in one who does not offer hospitality." The hadith, "There is no good in one who does not offer hospitality," was transmitted by Ahmad from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir; in its chain is Ibn Lahi'ah.

The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by a man who had many camels and cattle, and he did not offer him hospitality. And he passed by a woman who had some sheep, and she slaughtered for him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Look at these two. Indeed, these morals are in the hand of Allah; whomever He wills, He grants good character." The hadith, "The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by a man who had many camels and cattle, and he did not offer him hospitality, and he passed by a woman who had some sheep, and she slaughtered for him," was transmitted by al-Khara'iti in "Makārim al-Akhlaq" from the narration of Abu al-Minhal, as a mursal report.

And Abu Rafi', the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said that a guest came to him, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, "Tell so-and-so the Jew, 'A guest has come to me, so lend me some flour until Rajab.'" The Jew said, "By Allah, I will not lend it except with a pledge." He informed him, and he said, "By Allah, I am trustworthy in the heavens and trustworthy on earth. Had he lent to me, I would have repaid him. Go with my armor and pledge it with him." The hadith of Abu Rafi' that a guest came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, "Tell so-and-so the Jew, 'A guest has come to me, so lend me some flour until Rajab,'" was narrated by Ishaq ibn Rahawayh in his Musnad, al-Khara'iti in "Makārim al-Akhlaq," and Ibn Mardawayh in "Al-Nafir" with a weak chain.

And Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah, prayers and peace be upon him, when he wanted to eat, would go out a mile or two seeking someone to dine with him. He was nicknamed Abu al-Dayfān (Father of Guests). Due to the sincerity of his intention in this, his hospitality has continued at his site to this day; not a night passes except that a group, from three to ten to a hundred, eats there. And Qawwām al-Mawḍi' said that to this moment, no night has been without a guest.

The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked, "What is faith?" He said, "Feeding food and offering peace." The hadith: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked, "What is faith?" He said, "Feeding food and offering peace," agreed upon from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr with the wording, "Which Islam is best?" He said, "That you feed food and offer greetings of peace to those you know and those you do not know." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding expiations and degrees, "Feeding food and praying at night while people are asleep." The hadith: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said regarding expiations and degrees, "Feeding food and praying at night while people are asleep," transmitted by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sahih, and al-Hakim from the hadith of Mu'adh. Some of it has preceded in the fourth chapter of the remembrances, and it is the hadith, "O Allah, I ask You for the doing of good deeds."

He was asked about the accepted pilgrimage, and he said, "Feeding food and good speech." The hadith: He was asked about the accepted pilgrimage, and he said, "Feeding food and good speech," has preceded in the chapter on Hajj. And Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Any house into which a guest does not enter, the angels do not enter." The reports that have come regarding the virtue of hospitality and feeding are numerous.

As for the invitation, it is incumbent upon the host to direct his invitation to the pious, not the dissolute. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "May only the righteous eat your food." This hadith, "May only the righteous eat your food," was narrated by Abu Dawud from Anas with a sound chain, in his supplication for someone he had invited. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Eat only the food of a pious person, and let only a pious person eat your food." This hadith, "Eat only the food of a pious person, and let only a pious person eat your food," was mentioned previously in the chapter on Zakat. He should intend the poor specifically, not the rich. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The worst food is the food of a wedding feast to which the rich are invited and the poor are not." This hadith, "The worst food is the food of a wedding feast," is agreed upon, narrated from Abu Hurayrah. He should not neglect his relatives in his hospitality, for neglecting them causes alienation and severs kinship ties. Likewise, he should observe order among his friends and acquaintances, for singling out some causes hurt in the hearts of the others. He should not intend by his invitation ostentation and boastfulness, but rather winning the hearts of the brethren and following the Sunnah of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in feeding food and bringing joy to the hearts of the believers. He should not invite one whom he knows would find it burdensome to accept, and if he were to attend, he would be distressed by the attendees for some reason. He should only invite one whose acceptance he would welcome. Sufyan said, "Whoever invites someone to food while disliking his acceptance bears a sin. If the invited one accepts, then upon him are two sins, for he compelled him to eat despite his dislike, and had he known that, he would not have eaten." Feeding the pious is an aid to obedience, and feeding the dissolute is a strengthening in dissoluteness. A tailor said to Ibn al-Mubarak, "I sew the garments of rulers; do you fear I am among the helpers of the oppressors?" He said, "No. The helpers of the oppressors are those who sell you the thread and needle. As for you, you are from the oppressors themselves."

As for accepting the invitation, it is a confirmed Sunnah, and it has been said to be obligatory in some situations. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "If I were invited to a sheep's trotter, I would accept, and if a forearm were gifted to me, I would accept." This hadith, "If I were invited to a sheep's trotter, I would accept," was narrated by al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah. For acceptance, there are five etiquettes. The first is not to prefer the rich over the poor in acceptance, for that is the prohibited arrogance. For this reason, some refrained from acceptance altogether, saying, "Waiting for the broth is humiliation." Another said, "If I place my hand in another's bowl, my neck has become humbled to him." Among the arrogant are those who accept the invitations of the rich and not the poor, and this is contrary to the Sunnah. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would accept the invitation of a slave and the invitation of a poor person. This hadith, "He would accept the invitation of a slave and the invitation of a poor person," was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from Anas, without mention of the poor person; al-Tirmidhi deemed it weak, and al-Hakim authenticated it. Al-Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them both, passed by a group of poor people who would ask people on the road; they had spread pieces of bread on the sand and were eating, while he was on his mule. He greeted them, and they said to him, "Come to lunch, O son of the daughter of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." He said, "Yes, indeed God does not love the arrogant." So he dismounted and sat with them on the ground and ate. Then he greeted them, mounted, and said, "I have accepted your invitation, so accept mine." They said, "Yes." So he appointed a known time for them, they attended, and he presented to them the finest food and sat eating with them. As for the saying of one who said, "Whoever I place my hand in his bowl, my neck has become humbled to him," some said this is contrary to the Sunnah, and it is not so. For it is humiliation if the host does not rejoice at the acceptance and does not consider it a favor from himself, and he sees that as a right over the guest. But the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would attend knowing that the host for him would consider it a favor and see that as an honor and a treasure for himself in this world and the Hereafter. This differs according to the situation. So whoever suspects that he finds feeding burdensome and only does it for ostentation or affectation, it is not from the Sunnah to accept his invitation. The hadith, "It is not from the Sunnah to accept one who feeds out of ostentation or affectation," was narrated by Abu Dawud from Ibn Abbas that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade the food of the two contenders. Abu Dawud said whoever narrated it from Jarir did not mention Ibn Abbas in it. And al-'Uqayli in "al-Du'afa'" has: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade the food of the two boasters. The two contenders are those who compete in their action for ostentation and show. So said Abu Musa al-Madini. Rather, it is preferable to make an excuse. For this reason, some Sufis said, "It is only obligatory to accept the invitation of one who sees that you have eaten your provision and that he has delivered to you a trust that was with him for you, and he sees your favor upon him in accepting that trust from him." And Sari al-Saqati, may God have mercy on him, said, "Alas for a morsel for which there is no accountability to God and no [debt] to any creature."

In it is a favor, so if the invited knows there is no favor in it, he should not decline. Abu Turab al-Nakhshashi, may God have mercy on him, said: "I was offered food and I declined, then I was afflicted with hunger for fourteen days, so I knew it was a punishment for that." And it was said to Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, may God be pleased with him: "Eat from whoever invites you." He said: "I am a guest; I alight where they alight me."

The second is that one should not decline an invitation due to the distance, just as one does not decline due to the poverty of the inviter or his lack of status. Rather, any distance that can ordinarily be borne should not be a reason for declining. It is said in the Torah or some books: "Walk a mile to visit a sick person, walk two miles to accompany a funeral, walk three miles to answer an invitation, walk four miles to visit a brother for God's sake." Answering the invitation and the visit were given precedence because it involves fulfilling the right of the living, so it takes precedence over the dead. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "If I were invited to a sheep's trotter at al-Ghamim, I would accept." The mention of al-Ghamim is for recognition, and the known [narration] is: "If I were invited to a sheep's trotter..." as preceded by three hadiths. This addition is countered by what al-Tirmidhi narrated from the hadith of Anas: "If a sheep's trotter were gifted to me, I would accept it." It is a place miles from Medina where the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, broke his fast in Ramadan. The hadith of him breaking his fast in Ramadan when he reached Kura' al-Ghamim was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Jabir in the Year of the Conquest when it reached him, and he shortened his prayer there during his journey. The hadith of him shortening his prayer, peace and blessings be upon him, during his journey at Kura' al-Ghamim—I have not found an original source for it. And al-Tabarani in *al-Saghir* from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "He would shorten the prayer at al-'Aqiq," meaning when he reached it. This counters the first, for between al-'Aqiq and Medina are three miles or more, and Kura' al-Ghamim is between Mecca and 'Usfan, and God knows best.

The third is that one should not decline because he is fasting; rather, he should attend. If it would please his brother for him to break his fast, then let him break it and intend, in his breaking the fast, to bring joy to his brother's heart what he would intend in fasting—and that is better. This is regarding voluntary fasting. If he is not certain of his heart's joy, then let him accept the outward [invitation] and break his fast. If he ascertains that he is forcing himself, then let him make an excuse. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to one who declined with the excuse of fasting: "Your brother has taken trouble for you, and you say 'I am fasting'?" The hadith: He said to one who declined with the excuse of fasting: "Your brother has taken trouble for you, and you say 'I am fasting'?" Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: "I prepared food for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he and his companions came to me. When the food was placed, a man among the people said: 'I am fasting.' So the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Your brother has invited you and taken trouble for you...'" The hadith. And al-Daraqutni has something similar from the hadith of Jabir. And Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: "Among the best good deeds is honoring one's companions by breaking the fast." So breaking the fast is an act of worship with this intention and good character, so its reward is above the reward of fasting. And whenever he does not break his fast, his hospitality is perfume, incense, and good conversation. And it has been said: "Kohl and oil are one of the two adornments."

The fourth is to decline the invitation if the food is of dubious origin, or the place, or the spread laid out is from what is not lawful, or if in the place there is an objectionable matter—such as spreads of silk, silver vessels, depictions of living beings on the ceiling or wall, or listening to something of flutes and amusements, or busying oneself with a kind of play, music, jesting, and games, and listening to backbiting, tale-bearing, falsehood, slander, lying, and the like of what prohibits the invitation and its recommendation, and necessitates its prohibition or dislike. Likewise, if the inviter is an oppressor, an innovator, a transgressor, an evildoer, or one who forces himself seeking ostentation and pride.

The fifth is that one should not intend, by accepting, to satisfy the belly's appetite, thus acting in the affairs of the world. Rather, he should rectify his intention so that by accepting he becomes an actor for the Hereafter. That is by intending to follow the tradition of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in his saying: "If I were invited to a sheep's trotter, I would accept." And he intends caution from disobeying God Almighty due to His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever does not answer the inviter has disobeyed God and His Messenger." The hadith: "Whoever does not answer the inviter has disobeyed God and His Messenger," agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. And he intends to honor his believing brother, following His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever honors his believing brother, it is as if he has honored God." The hadith: "Whoever honors his believing brother, then he only honors God Almighty," mentioned by al-Isfahani in *al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib* from the hadith of Jabir, and al-'Uqayli in *al-Du'afa'* from the hadith of Abu Bakr, and their chains are weak. And he intends to bring joy to his heart, complying with His saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever gladdens a believer has gladdened God." The hadith: "Whoever gladdens a believer has gladdened God," preceded in the chapter before it. And he intends, along with that, to visit him so that it may be...

Among those who love each other for the sake of God, since the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, stipulated in it mutual visiting and mutual giving for God’s sake, there is the hadith: "My love becomes due for those who visit each other for My sake, and those who give to each other for My sake," narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. The author did not mention this hadith but only alluded to it. Giving has occurred from one side, so visiting is also attained from his side, and he intends to preserve himself from being suspected of ill intent in his refusal, and to free his tongue from being accused of arrogance, bad character, contempt for a Muslim brother, or the like. These are six intentions that attach his response to acts of worship individually, so how much more so collectively. Some of the early pious predecessors said: "I love to have an intention in every action, even in eating and drinking." In this regard, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Actions are but by intentions, and every person shall have only what they intended. So whoever’s emigration is to God and His Messenger, then his emigration is to God and His Messenger; and whoever’s emigration is for worldly gain or a woman to marry, then his emigration is to that for which he emigrated." The hadith "Actions are but by intentions" is agreed upon from the hadith of Umar ibn al-Khattab. Intention only affects permissible matters and acts of obedience; as for prohibitions, it does not. For if one intended to please his brothers by helping them drink wine or another forbidden act, the intention would not benefit, and it cannot be said "actions are but by intentions." Rather, if one aimed in jihad, which is an act of obedience, for boasting or seeking wealth, it deviates from the aspect of obedience. Likewise, a permissible act oscillating between aspects of goodness and others attaches to aspects of goodness through intention. Thus, intention affects these two categories, not the third. As for presence, its etiquette is to enter the house and not take the foremost seat, occupying the best places, but to be humble. He should not prolong waiting upon them nor hasten so as to surprise them before preparation is complete, nor crowd the place, causing discomfort to those present. If the host indicates a place to him, he should not oppose it at all, for he may have arranged in his mind a spot for each person, and opposing it disturbs him. If some guests honor him by offering a higher seat, let him be humble. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Part of humility before God is being content with a lower seat." The hadith "Part of humility before God is being content with a lower seat" is narrated by al-Khara’iti in Makarim al-Akhlaq and Abu Nu’aym in Riyadat al-Muta’allimin from the hadith of Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd with a good chain. One should not sit facing the door of the women’s room and their curtain, nor look frequently at the place from which food emerges, for that indicates greed. He should specifically greet and inquire after those near him when seated. If a guest enters for overnight stay, the host should inform him upon entry of the direction of prayer, the water place, and the place for ablution, as Malik did with al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with them both. Malik washed his hands before the meal before the others and said: "Washing before the meal is first for the head of the household because he invites people to his generosity, so his rule is to precede in washing; and at the end of the meal, he delays washing to wait for anyone who may come to eat, so he may eat with them." If he enters and sees an evil he can change, he should do so; otherwise, he should denounce it with his tongue and depart. The evil includes silk carpets, using vessels of silver and gold, images on walls, listening to entertainments and flutes, and the presence of women with uncovered faces, and other prohibitions. So much so that Ahmad, may God have mercy on him, said: "If he sees a kohl container with a silver head, he should leave," and he did not permit sitting except in necessity. He said: "If he sees a curtain, he should leave, for that is affectation with no benefit, neither warding off heat nor cold, nor covering anything." Similarly, he said: "He should leave if he sees the walls of the house covered with silk as the Kaaba is covered." He said: "If he rents a house with an image or enters a bath and sees an image, he should erase it; if unable, he should leave." All that he mentioned is correct, but the consideration regarding curtains and adorning walls with silk is that it does not reach prohibition, for silk is forbidden for men. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "These two are forbidden for the males of my community, permissible for their females." The hadith "These two are forbidden for the males of my community" is narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasa’i, and Ibn Majah from the hadith of ‘Ali, in which there is Abu Aflah al-Hamdani, whose reliability was questioned by Ibn al-Qattan, while al-Nasa’i and al-Tirmidhi authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Musa similarly. I say: The apparent is an interruption between Sa’id ibn Abi Hind and Abu Musa, so Ahmad inserted an unnamed man between them. What is on the wall is not attributed to males, and if this were forbidden, adorning the Kaaba would be forbidden, but rather its permissibility is more likely due to the implication of His saying: "Say, 'Who has forbidden the adornment of God?'" especially during times of adornment if not taken as a habit for boasting. Even if one imagines that men benefit from looking at it, it is not forbidden for men to benefit.

Regarding the brocade, regardless of whether slave-girls, women, or walls wear it—'walls' here meaning women, as they are not described by masculinity—as for serving food, it has five etiquettes. The first is hastening the food, for that is part of honoring the guest. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him honor his guest." This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Suraij. Whenever most are present and one or two are absent and delayed from the promised time, the right of those present to hastening takes precedence over the right of those to delay, unless the delayed one is poor or his heart would be broken by it, then there is no harm in delay. One of the two meanings in His saying, exalted is He, "Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Abraham?" is that they were honored by hastening the food to them. This is indicated by His saying, "So he did not delay in bringing a roasted calf," and His saying, "Then he turned to his household and brought a fat calf." 'Turning' means going swiftly; it is also said secretly. It is said he brought a thigh of meat. It is called a calf because he hastened it and did not delay. Hatim al-Asamm said, "Haste is from Satan except in five matters, for they are from the tradition of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him: feeding the guest, preparing the deceased, marrying the virgin, repaying a debt, and repenting from sin." This hadith is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd: "Deliberation is from God and haste is from Satan," though its chain is weak. As for the exception, Abu Dawud reported from Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: "Deliberation in everything except in the work of the Hereafter." Al-A'mash said, "I only know that he raised it." Al-Mizzi reported in al-Tahdhib in the biography of Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Nufay' from a group of his elders that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Deliberation in everything except in three: when called to the horses of God, when called to prayer, and when there is a funeral." The hadith is mursal. Al-Tirmidhi reported from 'Ali: "Three matters do not delay: prayer when its time comes, the funeral when it is present, and the unmarried woman when a suitable match is found," and its chain is good. Hastening the wedding feast is recommended. It is said the wedding feast on the first day is a tradition, on the second is customary, and on the third is ostentation. The second etiquette is arranging the foods by presenting fruit first if available, for that is more suitable according to medicine, as it digests more quickly and thus should settle at the bottom of the stomach. The Qur'an hints at presenting fruit first in His saying, "And fruit from which they choose," then He said, "And the meat of fowl from what they desire." The best to present after fruit is meat and tharid, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The superiority of 'A'ishah over women is like the superiority of tharid over other foods." If sweetness is added after it, then the good things are combined. His saying regarding the guests of Abraham when he presented the roasted calf—meaning well-roasted, which is one meaning of honoring, namely presenting meat—indicates attaining honor through meat. And He said in describing the good things, "And We sent down upon you manna and quails." Manna is honey and quails are meat; it is called 'salwa' because one is consoled by it over all other dishes, and nothing else takes its place. Therefore, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The master of dishes is meat." Then after mentioning manna and quails, He said, "Eat from the good things We have provided you." Thus meat and sweetness are among the good things. Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God be pleased with him, said, "Eating good things leads to contentment with God." These good things are completed by drinking cold water and pouring lukewarm water on the hands when washing. Al-Ma'mun said, "Drinking water with ice perfects gratitude." Some men of refinement said, "If you invite your brothers and feed them hasramiyyah and buraniyyah and give them cold water to drink, you have perfected hospitality." Someone spent dirhams on hospitality, and a sage said, "We did not need this if your bread is good, your water cold, and your vinegar sour, that is sufficient." Another said, "Sweetness after food is better than many dishes, and comfort at the table is better than two extra dishes." It is said angels attend a table if greens are upon it, and that is also recommended due to the adornment with greenery. In a report, the table that was sent down upon the Children of Israel had every green except leek, and upon it was a fish with vinegar at its head and salt at its tail, and seven loaves, each with an olive and a pomegranate seed. This, when combined, is good for agreement. The third is to present the most delicate of dishes first so that whoever wishes may partake sufficiently and not overeat afterward. The habit of the indulgent is to present the coarse first to renew the appetite's movement upon encountering the delicate afterward, and that is contrary.

As for the custom, it is a contrivance to increase eating. It was the practice of the ancients to bring forth all the dishes at once and arrange the platters of food upon the table, so that each person may eat of what he desires. Even if one had but a single dish, he would mention it so they could be satisfied with it and not wait for something more delectable. It is related of a man of noble character that he would write a list of the dishes he had prepared and present it to his guests. A certain elder said: "A dish was presented to some shaykhs in Syria, and I said, 'In Iraq, we only present this last.' He replied, 'And so it is with us in Syria,' but he had no other dish, and I was ashamed for him." Another said: "We were a company being hosted, and varieties of roasted heads were presented to us—cooked and dried. We did not eat, waiting for a dish or a lamb after them. Then the wash-basin was brought to us, and nothing else was presented. We looked at one another, and a certain elder, who was a jester, said, 'God Almighty is capable of creating heads without bodies.' He said, 'We spent that night hungry, seeking crumbs until the pre-dawn meal.' Therefore, it is recommended to present everything at once or to inform them of what one has.

Fourth: That one should not hasten to remove the dishes before they have had their fill, until they withdraw their hands from them. For perhaps among them is one for whom the remainder of that dish is more appetizing than what they have prepared, or a need to eat remains, and he is deprived by the hastiness. This is part of the ease at the table, which is said to be better than two dishes. It may be interpreted as cutting off haste, or it may be that he intended by it spaciousness of place. It is related of al-Sustari—and he was a Sufi and a jester—that he was present at the table of one of the worldly people. A lamb was presented to them, and the host was miserly. When he saw the people tear the lamb into pieces, his heart constricted, and he said, "O servant, take it to the children." So the lamb was taken inside the house. Al-Sustari got up running after the lamb. He was asked, "Where are you going?" He said, "I will eat with the children." The man was ashamed and ordered the lamb to be returned.

From this category is that the host should not withdraw his hand before the others, for they would be ashamed. Rather, he should be the last of them to eat. A certain generous man would inform the people of all the dishes and leave them to satisfy themselves. When they neared finishing, he would kneel on his knees, extend his hand to the food, eat, and say, "In the name of God, assist me, may God bless you and upon you." The predecessors considered that good from him.

Fifth: That one should present from the food a sufficient amount. For providing less than sufficiency is a deficiency in noble character, and exceeding it is affectation and ostentation, especially if his soul is not content that they eat all of it. Unless he presents much while being of good cheer if they take it all, and intends to seek blessing in the leftovers of their food, for in the hadith it is said: "He is not accountable for it." Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, had much food upon his table. Sufyan said to him, "O Abu Ishaq, do you not fear that this is extravagance?" Ibrahim said, "There is no extravagance in food." If this intention is not present, then making much is affectation. Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "We were forbidden to accept the invitation of one who boasts with his food." A group of the Companions disliked eating the food of ostentation. Because of this, leftovers of food were never removed from before the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, for they would only present what was needed and would not eat to complete satiety.

One should first set aside the portion of the household, so their eyes are not eagerly hoping for something to return from it, lest it not return and their hearts become constricted, and their tongues become loose among the guests. And he would have fed the guests what is followed by the dislike of a people, and that is a betrayal of their right. What remains of the foods, it is not for the guests to take—it is what the Sufis call "the slip"—unless the owner of the food explicitly permits it from a contented heart, or that is known by an indication of his state and that he is pleased with it. If one suspects his dislike, it should not be taken. And when his pleasure is known, justice and fairness with companions should be observed. One should not take except what is specifically his or what his companion consents to willingly, not out of shame.

As for departure, it has three etiquettes: The first is to go out with the guest to the door of the house, and it is a sunnah. That is from honoring the guest, and he has been commanded to honor him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him honor his guest." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, from the sunnah of the guest is that he be escorted to the door of the house." Abu Qatadah said: "A delegation of the Negus came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he stood to serve them himself. His companions said to him, 'We will suffice you, O Messenger of God.' He said, 'No, for they honored my companions, and I love to repay them.'" The completion of honor is a cheerful countenance and goodly speech upon entry and exit, and upon...

The table was set, and it was said to Al-Awza'i, may God be pleased with him, "What is the honor due to a guest?" He replied, "A cheerful countenance and gracious speech." And Yazid ibn Abi Ziyad said, "I never entered upon 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla except that he would relate to us a goodly tradition and feed us goodly food." The second is that the guest departs with a contented heart, even if some shortcoming occurred in his regard, for that is from good character and humility. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, a man may attain, through his good character, the rank of one who fasts and prays constantly."

One of the pious predecessors was invited by a messenger, but the messenger did not find him. When he heard, he came, but the people had dispersed, finished, and departed. The master of the house came out to him and said, "The people have left." He asked, "Is there any leftover?" The man said, "No." He asked, "Perhaps a crust, if it remains?" He said, "None remains." He asked, "The cooking pot—let me wipe it?" He said, "I have already washed it." So he departed, praising God Almighty. He was asked about that, and he said, "The man intended well in inviting us, and we intended well in responding. This is the meaning of humility and good character."

It is related that the teacher of Abu al-Qasim al-Junayd was invited by a boy to his father's invitation four times. The father turned him away all four times, yet he returned each time to gladden the boy's heart by his coming and the father's heart by his departing. These are souls humbled through humility before God Almighty, made tranquil by divine unity, witnessing in every acceptance and refusal a lesson between them and their Lord. Thus, they are not broken by any humiliation that comes from creatures, just as they do not rejoice in any honor that comes from them. Rather, they see all from the One, the All-Compelling. Therefore, one of them said, "I do not accept an invitation except because it reminds me of the food of Paradise," meaning it is wholesome food that spares us its toil, expense, and accounting.

The third is not to leave except with the satisfaction and permission of the host, and to be considerate of his heart regarding the length of stay. When staying as a guest, one should not exceed three days, for perhaps the host may become weary and need to ask him to leave. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Hospitality is for three days; what is beyond that is charity." The hadith, "Hospitality is for three days; what is beyond that is charity," is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Shurayh al-Khuza'i. Indeed, if the host insists with a sincere heart, then staying is permissible at that time. It is recommended to have a bed for the guest who stays. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "A bed for the man, a bed for the woman, a bed for the guest, and the fourth is for Satan." The hadith, "A bed for the man, a bed for the woman, a bed for the guest, and the fourth is for Satan," was narrated by Muslim from the narration of Jabir.

A chapter gathering various wholesome and legally prescribed etiquettes and prohibitions. The first: It is related from Ibrahim al-Nakha'i that he said, "Eating in the market is lowly." The hadith, "Eating in the market is lowly," was narrated by al-Tabarani from the narration of Abu Umamah, and it is weak. Ibn 'Adi narrated it in *al-Kamil* from his narration and the narration of Abu Hurayrah, attributing it to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and its chain is acceptable. Its opposite has been transmitted from Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, who said, "We used to eat in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while walking, and drink while standing." The hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "We used to eat in the time of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while walking, and drink while standing," was narrated by al-Tirmidhi who graded it sound, and by Ibn Majah and Ibn Hibban. Some known Sufi shaykhs were seen eating in the market. When asked about it, he said, "Woe to you! I get hungry in the market and eat at home." It was said, "Do you enter the mosque?" He said, "I am ashamed to enter His house to eat therein." The way to reconcile is that eating in the market is humility and abandoning affectation for some people, so it is good; but for others, it is a breach of noble conduct, so it is disliked. It varies according to the customs of lands and the states of individuals. For one whose other actions do not suit this, it is considered a lack of noble conduct and excessive greed, and it impairs testimony. For one whose all states and actions suit this in abandoning affectation, it is humility from him.

The second: 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said, "Whoever begins his meal with salt, God will remove seventy types of affliction from him. Whoever eats seven 'Ajwah dates in a day, it will kill every harmful creature in his belly. Whoever eats twenty-one red raisins every day will see nothing hateful in his body. Meat grows flesh. Tharid is the food of the Arabs. Basarjagat enlarge the belly and relax the buttocks. Beef is a disease, its milk is a cure, its fat is a medicine. Fat expels its like from disease. A postpartum woman will not find healing with anything better than fresh dates. Fish dissolves the body. Reciting the Qur'an and using the toothstick dispel phlegm. Whoever desires longevity—though there is no permanence—let him breakfast early, repeat supper, wear shoes, and people will not be treated with anything like clarified butter. Let him reduce frequenting women and lighten his outer garment, which is religion."

The third: Al-Hajjaj said to a physician, "Describe for me a regimen I may follow and not exceed." He said, "Do not marry except a young woman, and do not eat meat except..."

So do not eat cooked food until it is fully cooked, and do not drink medicine except for an ailment, and do not eat fruit except when ripe, and do not eat food unless you chew it well. Eat whatever you like of food, but do not drink upon it; and if you drink, then do not eat anything upon it. Do not withhold stool or urine. If you eat during the day, then sleep; and if you eat at night, then walk before you sleep, even if a hundred steps. In its meaning is the saying of the Arabs: "Take your lunch and stretch, take your supper and walk," meaning to stretch out, as God Almighty said: "Then he went to his family, walking proudly." It is said that withholding urine corrupts the body just as a river corrupts its surroundings if its course is blocked.

The fourth in the report: "Cutting the veins is a disease, and abandoning the supper is emaciation." The hadith, "Cutting the veins is a disease, and abandoning the supper is emaciation," was reported by Ibn 'Adi in Al-Kamil from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Jurad with the first part, and by Al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas with the second part, and both are weak. Ibn Majah reported the second part from the hadith of Jabir. The Arabs say: "Abandoning lunch takes away the fat of the tail," meaning the rump. Some wise men said to his son: "O my son, do not leave your house until you take your wisdom," meaning to eat breakfast, for by it wisdom remains and foolishness departs. It also lessens his appetite for what he sees in the market. A sage said to an obese man: "I see upon you a cloak woven by your molars; from what is it?" He said: "From eating the heart of wheat, young goats, anointing with violet oil, and wearing raw linen."

The fifth: Abstinence harms the healthy just as abandoning it harms the sick. Thus it is said. Some said: "Whoever takes precautions is certain of harm and doubtful of well-being." This is good in the state of health. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saw Suhayb eating dates while one of his eyes was sore. He said: "Do you eat dates while you have sore eyes?" He said: "O Messenger of God, I only eat with the other side." The hadith: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saw Suhayb eating dates while one of his eyes was sore. He said to him: 'Do you eat dates while you have sore eyes?' He said: 'I only chew with the other side.' So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, laughed." Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of Suhayb with a good chain, meaning the healthy side. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, laughed.

The sixth: It is recommended to carry food to the family of the deceased. When the news of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib's death came, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The family of Ja'far are preoccupied with their deceased from preparing their food, so carry to them what they may eat." The hadith: "When the news of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib's death came, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'The family of Ja'far are preoccupied with their deceased from their food, so carry to them what they may eat.'" Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah reported it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far similarly with a good chain. Ibn Majah has a similar report from the hadith of Asma' bint 'Umays. So that is a Sunnah. When that is presented to the gathering, it is permissible to eat from what is prepared for the mourners and those assisting them with weeping and grief, but it is not fitting to eat with them.

The seventh: It is not fitting to attend the food of an oppressor. If compelled, then let him eat little and not aim for the finest food. Some witness rejector rejected the testimony of one who attended the food of a sultan. He said: "I was compelled." He said: "I saw you aiming for the finest and taking large morsels; you were not compelled to it." The sultan forced this rejector to eat. He said: "Either I eat and abandon the testimony, or I testify and do not eat." They found no alternative but to accept his testimony, so they left him. It is narrated that Dhu al-Nun al-Misri was imprisoned and did not eat for days in prison. He had a sister in God who sent him food from her spinning by the hand of the jailer. He refrained and did not eat. The woman reproached him afterward. He said: "It was lawful, but it came to me on the plate of an oppressor," referring to the hand of the jailer. This is the utmost scrupulousness.

The eighth: It is narrated from Fath al-Mawsili, may God have mercy on him, that he entered upon Bishr al-Hafi as a visitor. Bishr brought out a dirham and gave it to Ahmad al-Jalla', his servant, and said: "Buy with it good food and excellent condiment." He said: "So I bought clean bread and said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not say for anything: 'O God, bless it for us and give us more of it,'" except for milk, as mentioned at the end of the first chapter on the manners of eating. So I bought milk and bought good dates, and I presented it to him. He ate and took the remainder. Bishr said: "Do you know why I said: 'Buy good food'? Because good food extracts pure gratitude. Do you know why he did not say to me: 'Eat'? Because it is not for the guest to say to the host: 'Eat.' Do you know why he carried what remained? Because when trust in God is sound, carrying does no harm." Abu 'Ali al-Rudhbari, may God Almighty have mercy on him, narrated that he prepared a feast and lit a thousand lamps for it. A man said to him: "You have been extravagant." He said to him: "Enter and eat; what I have lit is for other than God, so extinguish it." The man entered and could not extinguish a single one of them, so he desisted.

Abu Ali al-Rudhbari purchased loads of sugar and ordered confectioners to build a wall of sugar, complete with battlements and prayer niches on carved columns, all made of sugar. Then he invited the Sufis to demolish and plunder it. The ninth: Al-Shafi‘i, may God be pleased with him, said: Eating is of four kinds: eating with one finger is miserliness, with two fingers is arrogance, with three fingers is the Sunnah—the hadith about eating with three fingers being from the Sunnah is reported by Muslim from the narration of Ka‘b ibn Malik: “The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, used to eat with three fingers.” Ibn al-Jawzi narrated in “Al-‘Ilal” from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbas, as a statement of a Companion: “Eat with three fingers, for it is from the Sunnah.” Eating with four or five fingers is greed. Four things strengthen the body: eating meat, smelling pleasant scents, frequent washing without intercourse, and wearing linen. Four things weaken the body: frequent intercourse, excessive worry, drinking much water on an empty stomach, and eating much sour food. Four things strengthen eyesight: sitting facing the qibla, applying kohl before sleep, looking at greenery, and cleaning one’s clothes. Four things weaken eyesight: looking at filth, looking at a crucified person, looking at a woman’s private parts, and sitting with one’s back to the qibla. Four things increase sexual potency: eating sparrows, eating the greater itrifal, eating pistachios, and eating watercress. Sleeping is of four kinds: sleeping on the back, which is the sleep of the prophets, peace be upon them, as they contemplate the creation of the heavens and the earth; sleeping on the right side, which is the sleep of scholars and worshippers; sleeping on the left side, which is the sleep of kings to aid their digestion; and sleeping on the face, which is the sleep of devils. Four things increase intellect: avoiding superfluous speech, using the tooth-stick (siwak), keeping company with the righteous and scholars. Four things are from worship: not taking a step except in a state of ablution, frequent prostration, frequenting mosques, and frequent recitation of the Qur’an. He also said: I am amazed at one who enters the bathhouse on an empty stomach and then delays eating after coming out—how does he not die? And I am amazed at one who is cupped and then hastens to eat—how does he not die? He said: I have not seen anything more beneficial in a plague than violet—it is used as an oil and drunk. And God knows best what is correct.
