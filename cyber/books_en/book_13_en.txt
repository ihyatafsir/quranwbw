The Book of the Etiquettes of Earning and Livelihood
          Being the Third Book of the Quarter of Customs from the Book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences"
                           In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

We praise God with the praise of one who is annihilated in His Oneness, so that all besides the One True Reality is effaced and vanishes. We glorify Him with the glorification of one who declares plainly that everything besides God is falsehood, without hesitation, and that all who are in the heavens and the earth could never create a fly, even if they gathered together for it, nor a moth. And we thank Him for raising the sky as a well-built canopy for His servants, and spreading the earth as a carpet and a bed for them, and for wrapping the night over the day, making the night a garment and the day a time for livelihood, so that they may go forth seeking His bounty and be revived by it from the humility of needs, a true revival. And we send prayers upon His Messenger, from whose pool the believers will depart quenched after arriving at it thirsty, and upon his family and his companions, who did not hold back in supporting his religion, neither by rolling up their sleeves nor by shrinking back, and we send abundant peace.

Now then: The Lord of Lords and the Causer of Causes has made the Hereafter the abode of reward and punishment, and this world the abode of toil, agitation, exertion, and acquisition. Exertion in this world is not confined to the Hereafter to the exclusion of livelihood; rather, livelihood is a means to the Hereafter and an aid towards it. For this world is the field for the Hereafter and a pathway to it. People are of three kinds: A man whose preoccupation with his livelihood distracts him from his Hereafter—he is among the losers. And a man whose preoccupation with his Hereafter distracts him from his livelihood—he is among the extremists. Closest to moderation is the third kind: he whose preoccupation with his livelihood is for the sake of his Hereafter—he is among the successful. The rank of moderation will not be attained by one who does not adhere, in seeking his living, to the path of rectitude. Nor will one who seeks this world as a means and a path to the Hereafter succeed unless he observes in his seeking the etiquettes of the Sacred Law. And so we now present the etiquettes of trade, crafts, and various modes of earning, and their established practices, explaining them in five chapters.

Chapter One: The Merit of Earning and the Exhortation to it.
Chapter Two: On the Knowledge of Sound Buying, Selling, and Transactions.
Chapter Three: On Clarifying Justice in Transactions.
Chapter Four: On Clarifying Excellence in them.
Chapter Five: On the Merchant's Compassion for Himself and His Religion.

Chapter One: On the Merit of Earning and the Exhortation to it.
As for evidence from the Book: The saying of the Exalted, "And We made the day for livelihood," mentioning it in the context of conferring favor. And His saying, the Exalted, "And We placed therein livelihoods for you—little thanks do you give," so your Lord made it a blessing and enjoined gratitude for it. And His saying, the Exalted, "There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord." And His saying, the Exalted, "And others who travel through the land seeking of the bounty of God." And His saying, the Exalted, "So disperse throughout the land and seek of the bounty of God."

As for the narrations: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Among sins are sins that are not expiated except by anxiety in seeking a livelihood." (The hadith: "Among sins are sins that are not expiated except by anxiety in seeking a livelihood" was mentioned earlier in the Book of Marriage.) And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The truthful merchant will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with the truthful and the martyrs." (The hadith: "The truthful merchant will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with the truthful and the martyrs" was reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Sa'id. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan* (good). Al-Hakim said it is among the *mursal* reports of al-Hasan. A similar narration is found in Ibn Majah and al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn 'Umar.) And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever seeks the world lawfully, abstaining from begging, striving for his dependents, and showing compassion to his neighbor, will meet God with his face like the moon on the night of the full moon." (The hadith: "Whoever seeks the world lawfully, abstaining from begging..." was reported by Abu al-Shaykh in *Kitab al-Thawab*, Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah*, and al-Bayhaqi in *Shu'ab al-Iman* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain.)

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting with his companions one day when they saw a youth of vigor and strength who had risen early to strive. They said, "Woe to this one! If only his youth and strength were in the path of God." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do not say that. For if he is striving for himself to spare himself from begging and to make himself independent of people, then he is in the path of God. And if he is striving for weak parents or weak offspring to enrich them and suffice them, then he is in the path of God. But if he is striving out of pride and rivalry, then he is in the path of Satan." (The hadith: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, was sitting with his companions one day when he saw a youth of vigor and strength who had risen early to strive..." was reported by al-Tabarani in his three *Mu'jams* from the narration of Ka'b bin 'Ujrah with a weak chain.)

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "God loves a servant who takes up a craft to become independent of people, and He hates a servant who learns knowledge and takes it as a craft." (The hadith: "God loves a servant who takes up a craft to become independent of people..." I have not found it exactly thus. Abu Mansur al-Daylami reported it in his *Musnad*...)

From the narration of Ali: Indeed, Allah loves to see His servant striving in seeking lawful provision. In it, Muhammad ibn Sahl al-‘Attar said: Al-Daraqutni declared the hadith weak. In another report: Indeed, Allah the Exalted loves the believing craftsman. The hadith “Indeed, Allah loves the believing craftsman” was transmitted by Al-Tabarani and Ibn ‘Adi, and it was weakened. From the narration of Ibn ‘Umar, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “The most lawful thing a man eats is from his own earnings, and every honest sale.” The hadith “The most lawful thing a man eats is from his own earnings, and every honest sale” was transmitted by Ahmad from the narration of Rafi‘ ibn Khadij. It was said: O Messenger of Allah, which earning is best? He said: “A man’s work with his own hands, and every honest deed.” Al-Bazzar and Al-Hakim narrated it from the narration of Sa‘id ibn ‘Umayr from him. Al-Hakim said: Its chain is sound. He mentioned that Yahya ibn Ma‘in said that Sa‘id’s uncle was Al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib. Al-Bayhaqi narrated it from the narration of Sa‘id ibn ‘Umayr as mursal and said: This is the preserved version, and the statement of whoever said “from his uncle” is mistaken. He reported it from Al-Bukhari. Ahmad and Al-Hakim narrated it from the narration of Jami‘ ibn ‘Umayr from his maternal uncle Abu Burdah, and Jami‘ is weak. And Allah knows best. In another report: “The most lawful thing a servant eats is the earning of the craftsman’s hand if he is sincere.” The hadith “The most lawful thing a servant eats is the earning of the craftsman if he is sincere” was transmitted by Ahmad from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: “The best earning is that of the worker if he is sincere,” and its chain is good. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Engage in trade, for indeed in it are nine-tenths of provision.” The hadith “Engage in trade, for indeed in it are nine-tenths of provision” was transmitted by Ibrahim al-Harbi in Gharib al-Hadith from the narration of Nu‘aym ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman: “Nine-tenths of provision is in trade,” and its narrators are trustworthy. Regarding this Nu‘aym, Ibn Mandah said: He is mentioned among the Companions, but it is not sound. Abu Hatim al-Razi and Ibn Hibban said he is a Successor, so the hadith is mursal. It was narrated that Jesus, peace be upon him, saw a man and said: What do you do? He said: I worship. He said: Who provides for you? He said: My brother. He said: Your brother is more worshipful than you. And our Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “I do not know of anything that brings you closer to Paradise and distances you from the Fire except that I have commanded you to it, and I do not know of anything that distances you from Paradise and brings you closer to the Fire except that I have forbidden you from it. Indeed, the Trustworthy Spirit has inspired in my heart that a soul will not die until it has received its full provision, even if it is delayed for it. So fear Allah and be moderate in seeking.” He commanded moderation in seeking and did not say abandon seeking. Then he said at the end: “And let not the delay of any provision cause you to seek it through disobedience to Allah the Exalted, for Allah is not reached by what is with Him through disobedience.” The hadith “I do not know of anything that distances you from Paradise and brings you closer to the Fire except that I have forbidden you from it, for the Trustworthy Spirit has inspired in my heart that a soul will not die until it has received its full provision” was transmitted by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in Al-Qana‘ah and Al-Hakim from the narration of Ibn Mas‘ud, and he mentioned it as supporting evidence for the hadith of Abu Hamid and Jabir, and he authenticated them according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs, and they are abbreviated. Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in Shu‘ab al-Iman and said it is interrupted. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “The markets are the tables of Allah the Exalted, so whoever comes to them obtains from them.” The hadith “The markets are the tables of Allah, so whoever comes to them obtains from them” we narrated in Al-Tayuriyyat from the statement of Al-Hasan al-Basri, and I did not find it attributed to the Prophet. And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “That one of you take his rope and gather firewood on his back is better than that he comes to a man whom Allah has given from His bounty and asks him, whether he gives or withholds.” The hadith “That one of you take his rope and gather firewood on his back is better for him than that he comes to a man” is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. And he said: “Whoever opens for himself a door of begging, Allah opens for him seventy doors of poverty.” The hadith “Whoever opens for himself a door of begging, Allah opens for him seventy doors of poverty” was transmitted by Al-Tirmidhi from the narration of Abu Kabshah al-Anmari: “No servant opens a door of asking except that Allah opens for him a door of poverty,” or words to that effect, and he said it is good and sound. As for the narrations, Luqman the Wise said to his son: “O my son, be independent through lawful earning from poverty, for no one has ever become poor except that three traits afflict him: weakness in his religion, feebleness in his intellect, and loss of his dignity. And greater than these three is people’s belittling of him.” And ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: “Let not one of you sit from seeking provision, saying: O Allah, provide for me, for you know that the sky does not rain gold or silver.” Zayd ibn Maslamah was planting in his land, and ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said to him: “You have done well. Be independent of people, so it will be more protective of your religion and more honorable for you among them, as your companion Ahihah said: ‘I will not cease on Al-Zawra’ to immerse it, for the noble one among brothers is the one with wealth.’” And Ibn Mas‘ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: “I dislike seeing a man idle, neither in the matter of his worldly life nor in the matter of his Hereafter.” Ibrahim was asked about the truthful merchant: Is he more beloved to you...

The one devoted solely to worship said: The truthful merchant is more beloved to me, for he is in a struggle where Satan comes to him through the scales and measures, and through giving and taking, and he strives against him. Al-Hasan al-Basri disagreed with this and said: Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "There is no place where death comes to me more beloved than a marketplace where I am trading for my family, buying and selling." And al-Haytham said: "Sometimes news reaches me of a man who falls into [sin], and I remember my independence from him, and that makes it easier for me." And Ayyub said: "Earning that contains something [lawful] is more beloved to me than asking people."

A fierce wind came upon the sea, and the people on the ship said to Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, who was with them: "Do you not see this hardship?" He said: "This is not hardship. True hardship is needing people." And Ayyub said: "Abu Qilabah said to me: 'Frequent the marketplace, for wealth is from well-being'—meaning wealth from independence from people."

Ahmad was asked: "What do you say about one who sits in his house or mosque and says, 'I will do nothing until my provision comes to me'?" Ahmad said: "This is a man ignorant of knowledge. Has he not heard the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: 'Indeed, God has placed my provision beneath the shadow of my spear'?" The hadith "Indeed, God has placed my provision beneath the shadow of my spear" is narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Ibn Umar: "He placed my provision beneath the shadow of my spear," and its chain is sound. And his saying, peace and blessings be upon him, when he mentioned the birds, said: "They go out in the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full bellies." The hadith mentioning the birds: "They go out in the morning with empty stomachs and return in the evening with full bellies" is reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Umar. Al-Tirmidhi said it is *hasan sahih*. He mentioned that they go out seeking provision. And the Companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, used to trade on land and sea and work in their palm groves, and they are to be followed.

And Abu Qilabah said to a man: "To see you seeking your livelihood is more beloved to me than to see you in a corner of the mosque." It is narrated that al-Awza'i met Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on them, with a bundle of firewood on his neck and said to him: "O Abu Ishaq, how long will this be? Your brothers suffice you." He said: "Leave me be in this, O Abu Amr, for it has reached me that whoever stands in a position of humility seeking the lawful, Paradise is guaranteed for him."

And Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: "Worship, according to us, is not that you position your feet [in prayer] while another provides for you. Rather, begin by securing your two loaves of bread, then worship." And Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may God be pleased with him, said: "A caller will call out on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where are those who were burdens upon God in His earth?' Then those who begged in the mosques will stand." This is the censure of the Sacred Law for begging and relying on the sufficiency of others. And for one who has no inherited wealth, nothing saves him from that except earning and trade.

If you say: "But he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'It was not revealed to me to amass wealth and be among the traders. Rather, it was revealed to me to glorify with the praise of your Lord and be among those who prostrate, and worship your Lord until certainty comes to you.'" The hadith "It was not revealed to me to amass wealth and be among the traders, but it was revealed to me to glorify with the praise of your Lord and be among those who prostrate" is narrated by Ibn Mardawayh in the *Tafsir* from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a chain containing weakness. And it was said to Salman al-Farsi: "Advise us." He said: "Whoever among you is able to die as a pilgrim, or a warrior, or one who builds his Lord's mosque, let him do so, and let him not die as a trader or a betrayer."

The answer is that the way to reconcile these reports is by detailing the circumstances. We say: We do not say that trade is absolutely superior to everything. Rather, trade is either sought for sufficiency, or for wealth, or for increase beyond sufficiency. If increase beyond sufficiency is sought from it, to amass and hoard wealth, not to spend on good deeds and charities, then it is blameworthy, for it is turning towards this world, love of which is the root of every sin. If along with that he is oppressive and treacherous, then it is oppression and transgression. This is what Salman meant by his saying: "Do not die as a trader or a betrayer," and by "trader" he meant one who seeks increase.

As for if it is sought for sufficiency for himself and his children, and he is capable of providing for them through begging, then trade out of abstinence from begging is superior. And if he does not need to beg and gives without asking, then earning is superior, for he only gives because he is asking by the state of his condition and announcing his poverty among people. So abstinence and concealment are more complete than idleness, indeed more than busying oneself with bodily worship.

And leaving earning is superior for four: an ascetic devoted to bodily worship; or a man with an inward journey and work of the heart in the sciences of spiritual states and unveilings; or a scholar busied with cultivating the outward knowledge from which people benefit in their religion, like the jurist, exegete, hadith scholar, and their like; or a man busied with the welfare of the Muslims who has undertaken their affairs, like the ruler, judge, and witness. These, if they are provided for from funds designated for welfare purposes, or endowments established for the poor or scholars, then their turning to what they are in is superior to busying themselves with earning. For this reason, it was revealed to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him...

He glorified His Lord with praise and was among those who prostrate, but it was not revealed to him to be among the traders, for he encompassed these four meanings along with additions beyond description. Thus, the Companions advised Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with them, to abandon trade when he assumed the caliphate, as it would distract him from public affairs, and he would take his sufficiency from the public treasury, deeming that preferable. Then, upon his death, he instructed that it be returned to the treasury, though he initially saw it as more fitting. For these four, there are two other states: one is that their sufficiency, upon abandoning earning, comes from the hands of people and what is given to them as alms or charity, without need to ask, so abandoning earning and busying themselves with what they are engaged in is preferable, as it aids people in good deeds and accepts from them what is rightfully due and better for them. The second state is the need to ask, and this is subject to scrutiny and the strict traditions we have narrated concerning asking and its censure, which outwardly indicate that abstaining from asking is preferable. To speak absolutely on this without considering circumstances and individuals is difficult; rather, it is left to the servant's diligence and self-reflection, weighing the humiliation, loss of dignity, and burden of insistence encountered in asking against the benefit gained for oneself and others from engagement in knowledge and action. For some, the benefit to creation and themselves in engaging with knowledge or action is great, and obtaining sufficiency through the slightest hint in asking is made light for them; others may be the opposite, and sometimes the desired and the feared may be balanced, so the seeker should consult his heart in this, even if advisors give fatwas, for fatwas cannot encompass the details of situations and subtleties of conditions. Among the predecessors were those with three hundred and sixty friends, staying with each one a night, and others with thirty, who engaged in worship, believing that those burdened with them undertook a favor by accepting their good deeds, so accepting their good deeds was an added good to their worship. Thus, one should scrutinize these matters, for the reward of the taker is like that of the giver, provided the taker uses it to aid in religion and the giver gives with a content heart. Whoever comprehends these meanings can recognize his own state and clarify from his heart what is best relative to his condition and time. This is the virtue of earning, and let the contract by which earning occurs combine four matters: soundness, justice, benevolence, and compassion for religion. We shall dedicate a chapter to each, beginning with the causes of soundness in the second chapter.

The second chapter: on the knowledge of earning through sale, usury, advance payment, lease, partnership, and agency, and explaining the legal conditions for the validity of these transactions, which are the basis of earnings in the law. Know that acquiring knowledge of this chapter is obligatory for every earning Muslim, for seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim, specifically the knowledge needed. The earner needs knowledge of earning, and once the knowledge of this chapter is attained, one becomes aware of corruptions in transactions and avoids them, and what eludes him of intricate subsidiary matters, he discerns the cause of their intricacy and pauses in them until he asks. For if he does not know the causes of corruption through comprehensive knowledge, he will not know when he must pause and ask. If one says, "I will not pursue knowledge, but I will wait until the situation occurs, then I will learn and seek a fatwa," it is said to him, "And how will you know the occurrence of the situation if you do not know the general corruptions of contracts? For you will continue in transactions thinking them valid and permissible." Thus, he must have this measure of commercial knowledge to distinguish for him the permissible from the forbidden and the ambiguous from the clear. Therefore, it is narrated from Umar, may God be pleased with him, that he would patrol the market and strike some traders with a whip, saying, "None should sell in our market except one who understands, otherwise he consumes usury, willingly or unwillingly." The knowledge of contracts is vast, but these six contracts are inseparable from earnings: sale, usury, advance payment, lease, partnership, and agency. Let us explain their conditions.

The first contract: sale, which God Almighty has made lawful, has three pillars: the contracting parties, the subject matter, and the utterance. The first pillar: the contracting parties. The trader should not transact in sale with four: the minor, the insane, the slave, and the blind, because the minor is not legally responsible, as is the insane, and their sale is invalid. Thus, the sale of a minor is not valid, even if the guardian permits it, according to al-Shafi'i. What is taken from them is guaranteed to them, and what is delivered to them in the transaction and lost in their hands is considered lost by them. As for the sane slave, his sale and purchase are not valid except with his master's permission. Therefore, grocers, bakers, butchers, and others should not deal with slaves unless their masters have permitted them.

Their dealings, meaning that he hears it explicitly or it becomes widespread in the locality that he is authorized to purchase for his master and to sell on his behalf, thus relying on widespread report or the statement of a just person who informs him of that. If he transacts without the master's permission, then his contract is void, and what he took from him is guaranteed to his master. What he received, if it perishes in the slave's possession, does not attach to his neck, nor is his master liable for it; rather, he has no recourse except to claim it if he is freed. As for the blind person, he buys and sells what he cannot see, so that is not valid. Let him be instructed to appoint a sighted agent to buy or sell for him; then his appointment is valid, and his agent's sale is valid. If the merchant transacts by himself, the transaction is invalid, and what he took from him is guaranteed at its value, and what he delivered to him is also guaranteed to him at its value. As for the disbeliever, transaction with him is permissible, but a copy of the Qur'an or a Muslim slave should not be purchased from him, nor should weapons be purchased from him if he is from the people of war. If one does so, those transactions are rejected, and he is disobedient to his Lord thereby. As for the military class among the Turks, Turkomans, Arabs, Kurds, thieves, traitors, usurers, oppressors, and everyone whose wealth is mostly unlawful, it is not fitting to acquire anything from their possessions because it is unlawful, except if one knows something specific to be lawful. Details of that will come in the Book of the Lawful and the Unlawful. The second pillar is the subject of the contract, which is the property intended to be transferred from one contracting party to the other, whether as a price or a priced item. Six conditions are considered for it: First, that it not be impure in itself. Thus, it is not valid to sell a dog or a pig, nor to sell dung and excrement, nor to sell ivory and vessels made from it, for bone is defiled by death, and the elephant is not purified by slaughter, nor is its bone purified by ritual slaughter. It is not permissible to sell wine, nor impure fat extracted from animals that are not eaten, even if it is suitable for lighting or coating ships. There is no harm in selling pure oil in itself that became impure by the occurrence of impurity or a dead mouse falling into it, for it is permissible to benefit from it in other than eating, and it is not impure in itself. Likewise, I see no harm in selling silkworm eggs, for they are the origin of an animal from which benefit is derived; comparing them to eggs, which are the origin of an animal, is more appropriate than comparing them to dung. It is permissible to sell musk pods, and they are judged pure if separated from the deer while alive. Second, that it be beneficial. Thus, it is not permissible to sell insects, nor the mouse, nor the snake, paying no heed to the benefit of the snake charmer with the snake, nor paying heed to the benefit of those with snake pits by taking it out of the basket and displaying it to people. It is permissible to sell the cat and bees, and to sell the cheetah and lion, and what is suitable for hunting or whose skin is beneficial. It is permissible to sell the elephant for carrying, and to sell the parrot, which is the parakeet, and the peacock, and birds with beautiful forms, even if they are not eaten, for delighting in their sounds and looking at them is an intended, permissible purpose. However, the dog is that which it is not permissible to keep out of admiration for its form, due to the prohibition of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, concerning it. The hadith prohibiting keeping dogs is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn 'Umar: "Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding or hunting, loses two qirats from his reward every day." It is not permissible to sell 'ud (lute), cymbals, flutes, and musical instruments, for they have no benefit according to the Shari'ah. Likewise, selling images made of clay, like animals that are sold during festivals for children's play, for breaking them is obligatory according to the Shari'ah. Images of trees are overlooked. As for garments and plates upon which images of animals are depicted, their sale is valid, and likewise curtains. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, "Make cushions from them." The hadith "Make cushions from them" he said to 'A'ishah is agreed upon from her narration. It is not permissible to use them hung up, but it is permissible if they are placed down. When benefit from one aspect is permissible, the sale is valid for that aspect. Third, that the item being dealt with be owned by the contractor or authorized from the side of the owner. It is not permissible to purchase from other than the owner in anticipation of permission from the owner; rather, even if he consents afterward, renewing the contract is obligatory. One should not purchase from the wife the property of the husband, nor from the husband the property of the wife, nor from the parent the property of the child, nor from the child the property of the parent, relying on the assumption that if they knew, they would consent, for if consent is not prior, the sale is not valid. Similar matters that occur in the markets—it is incumbent upon the religiously observant servant to avoid them. Fourth, that the subject of the contract be capable of being delivered according to the Shari'ah and tangibly. What cannot be delivered tangibly is not valid to sell, such as a runaway slave, fish in the water, a fetus in the womb, and the stud fee of a stallion. Likewise, selling wool on the animal's back and milk in the udder is not permissible, for it...

It is invalid to deliver it due to the mixing of what is not sold with what is sold, and what is legally prevented from delivery, such as what is pawned, endowed, or what has given birth, for their sale is also invalid. Likewise, selling the mother without the offspring if the offspring is young, and likewise selling the offspring without the mother, because delivering it separates between them, and that is forbidden, so it is invalid to separate them by sale. Fifth: the sold item must be known in its specific entity, quantity, and description. As for knowledge of the entity, it is by pointing to it specifically. If one says, "I sell you a sheep from this flock, whichever sheep you want," or "a garment from these garments before you," or "a cubit from this cloth—take it from whichever side you wish," or "ten cubits from this land—take it from whichever side you wish," the sale is void. All of this is what those negligent in religion are accustomed to, unless one sells a shared portion, such as selling half of something or ten, for that is permissible. As for knowledge of quantity, it is achieved by measurement, weight, or sight. If one says, "I sell you this garment for the price at which so-and-so sold his garment," and they do not know that price, it is void. If one says, "I sell you for the weight of this ingot," it is void if the ingot is not known. If one says, "I sell you this heap of wheat," it is void, or if one says, "I sell you for this purse of dirhams," or "for this piece of gold," and he sees it, the sale is valid, and his estimation by sight suffices for knowing the amount. As for knowledge of description, it is achieved by sight for tangible entities, and it is not valid to sell an absent item unless it was seen previously within a period where change is not likely. Description does not take the place of sight—this is one of the two schools. It is not permissible to sell cloth on the loom relying on the patterns, nor to sell wheat in its ear. It is permissible to sell rice in its husk in which it is stored, and likewise to sell walnuts and almonds in their outer shell, but not in both shells. It is permissible to sell fresh broad beans in their pod out of necessity, and there is concession for selling fermented drink due to the established custom of the predecessors, but we consider it permissible for a compensation. If one buys it to sell it, the analogy is its invalidity because it is not concealed with the concealment of its creation, but it is not far-fetched to make concession for it since removing it spoils it, like pomegranates and what is concealed with the concealment of its creation. Sixth: the sold item must be taken possession of if ownership was acquired through exchange, and this is a specific condition. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited selling what has not been taken possession of—the hadith prohibiting the sale of what is not taken possession of is agreed upon from the narration of Ibn Abbas. It applies equally to real estate and movable property. Whatever one buys or sells before taking possession, its sale is void. Possession of movable property is by transfer, possession of real estate by making it available, and possession of what is bought on the condition of measurement is not complete except by measuring it. As for selling inheritance, bequest, deposit, and what ownership is not acquired in through exchange, it is permissible before taking possession. The third pillar is the wording of the contract, so there must be an offer and acceptance connected to it with wording indicating the intent, whether explicit or implicit. If one says, "I give you this for that," instead of saying "I sell you," and the other says, "I accept," it is permissible as long as they intend sale by it, because it could imply lending if it is regarding two garments or two animals, and intention dispels the possibility. The explicit is more decisive in dispute, but the implicit also conveys ownership, and permissibility lies in what they choose. One should not stipulate a condition contrary to the requirement of the contract. If one stipulates adding something else, or that the sold item be delivered to his house, or buys firewood on the condition of delivery to his house, all that is invalid unless hiring for delivery is separately arranged with a known fee separate from the purchase of the movable property. Whenever nothing passes between them except exchange by action without verbal articulation, the sale does not take effect according to al-Shafi'i at all, but it takes effect according to Abu Hanifah if it is regarding trivial items. However, defining trivial items is difficult. If the matter is referred to customs, people have exceeded trivial items in exchange by action, for the broker goes to the cloth merchant, takes from him a silk garment worth ten dinars, for example, carries it to the buyer, returns to him saying he is satisfied, then says to him, "Take ten," so he takes the ten from his companion, carries it, and delivers it to the cloth merchant, who takes it and disposes of it, and the buyer of the garment cuts it, and no offer and acceptance passed between them at all. Likewise, the preparers gather at the seller's shop, and he displays goods worth a hundred dinars, for example, to whoever increases, so one says, "This is mine for ninety," and another says, "This is mine for ninety-five," and another says, "This is mine for a hundred," so it is said to him, "Weigh it," so he weighs, takes possession, and takes the goods without offer and acceptance. Customs have continued with this, and these are among the dilemmas that do not accept remedy, for the possibilities are three: either opening the door of exchange by action absolutely for the trivial and the valuable, which is impossible, since...

In this case, the transfer of ownership occurs without an explicit verbal indication. God has made trade lawful, and 'trade' is a term for offer and acceptance. The term 'trade' is not applied to the mere act of handing over and receiving goods. By what means, then, is the transfer of ownership between the two parties judged, especially concerning slave-girls, slaves, real estate, and valuable livestock—matters over which dispute is frequent? For a Muslim may retract and say, "I have regretted it, and I did not sell it," since nothing issued from him except the mere act of handing over, and that is not a sale. The second possibility is to close the door entirely, as Imam al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, said regarding the invalidity of the contract. This presents a difficulty from two aspects. First, it appears that this [practice of transfer without explicit words] was customary in trivial matters during the time of the Companions. Had they burdened themselves with offer and acceptance for every purchase from a greengrocer, baker, or butcher, it would have been arduous for them, and such reports would have been widely transmitted. It would have become famous when they completely abandoned that custom, for eras differ in such matters. Second, people are now deeply engrossed in this practice; a person does not buy any food or other item without knowing that the seller has transferred ownership to him through the tacit exchange. What benefit is there in his uttering the contract if the matter is thus? The third possibility is to distinguish between trivial and non-trivial matters, as Abu Hanifah, may God have mercy on him, said. At that point, defining the trivial becomes difficult, and the manner of transferring ownership without a verbal indication remains problematic. Ibn Suraij inclined to derive a position for Imam al-Shafi‘i, may God have mercy on him, in accordance with this, and it is the closest of the possibilities, save for moderation. There is no harm in leaning toward it due to the pressing nature of needs, its prevalence among people, and the strong presumption that it was customary in earlier eras. As for the answer to the two difficulties, we say: Regarding defining the distinction between trivial and non-trivial matters, we are not tasked with contriving a precise measure, for that is not possible. Rather, it has two clear extremes. It is evident that purchasing vegetables, a small amount of fruit, bread, or meat from a vendor is counted among trivial matters where only tacit exchange is customary. One who demands offer and acceptance for such is considered overly meticulous; his being obligated to do so is viewed as burdensome and odd, and he is accused of making a weighty matter out of something trivial. This is the extreme of triviality. The second extreme is livestock, slaves, real estate, and valuable garments; for these, it is not far-fetched to require offer and acceptance. Between them are ambiguous, similar intermediate cases that are in the realm of doubt. It is right for the person of religion to incline toward caution in them. All the legal definitions of what is known by custom are likewise divided into clear extremes and problematic intermediates. As for the second difficulty, which seeks a cause for the transfer of ownership, it is to consider the manual act of taking and handing over as a cause in itself, or rather as an indication. This act, by established custom, continuously indicates the intent of sale. To this is added the pressing nature of need, the practice of the early generations, and the consistency of all customs in accepting gifts without offer and acceptance while disposing of them. What difference does it make whether there is a consideration or not, since ownership must also be transferred in a gift? However, the prevailing custom did not distinguish in gifts between the trivial and the valuable; rather, demanding offer and acceptance was considered unbecoming regardless. In sales, it was not considered unbecoming for non-trivial matters. This is what we see as the most equitable of the possibilities. It is the duty of the pious, God-fearing person not to abandon offer and acceptance to avoid the suspicion of disagreement. He should not abstain from it on the grounds that the seller has already transferred ownership to him without offer and acceptance, for that is not known with certainty. Perhaps he bought it with acceptance and offer. If he was present at the time of purchase or the seller acknowledges it, he should abstain from it and buy from another. If the item is trivial and he is in need of it, let him utter the offer and acceptance, for he thereby gains the cutting off of future dispute with him, since retraction from explicit words is not possible, while from action it is possible. If you say, "If this is possible for what he buys, how should he act if he is present as a guest or at a table, knowing that its owners are content with tacit exchange in buying and selling, or he has heard this from them or seen it? Is he obliged to abstain from eating?" I say: He is obliged to abstain from buying if that thing they bought is a valuable amount and is not among trivial matters. As for eating, he is not obliged to abstain from it. For I say: If we are uncertain about making the act an indication of the transfer of ownership, we should not fail to make it an indication of permissibility. For the matter of permissibility is broader, and the matter of transferring ownership is narrower. Thus, for any food over which a sale by tacit exchange has occurred, the seller's handing it over is permission to eat, known by the circumstantial context, like the bathkeeper's permission to enter the bath, and permission to feed one who desires it.

The buyer thus occupies the position of one who is told, "I have permitted you to eat this food or to feed whomever you wish." It is therefore lawful for him. Even if the seller explicitly states, "Eat all this food, and I will later claim compensation from you," the eating is permissible, but he becomes liable for compensation after eating. This is the juristic analogy in my view. However, after the tacit transaction, the eater consumes what is another's property and destroys it; thus, he is liable for compensation, which is an obligation upon him. As for the price he paid, if it is equivalent to the value, the rightful claimant has obtained the equivalent of his due and may appropriate it, especially if he is unable to demand it from the liable party. If he is capable of demanding it, he may not appropriate what he has obtained from the other's property, because the owner might not consent to apply that specific item toward his debt. Therefore, he must refer back to the owner. Here, however, his consent is known from the circumstantial evidence at the time of delivery, so it is not far-fetched to consider the action an indication of consent to settle his debt from what is delivered to him, taking it as his right. Nevertheless, in all cases, the seller's position is more ambiguous, because what he took, the owner might intend to use, and he cannot appropriate it unless the specific food is destroyed in the buyer's possession. He may then need to renew his intention to appropriate. Appropriation may occur merely through consent inferred from the action, without words. As for the buyer's position regarding the food, since he only intends to eat, it is straightforward, as that is permitted by the implicit permission understood from the circumstances. However, it may entail that the guest is liable for what he destroys, and liability is waived only if the seller appropriates what he took from the buyer, thus waiving it, akin to a judge settling his debt or assuming it on his behalf. This is our view on the principle of tacit transaction despite its ambiguity, and knowledge rests with God. These are possibilities and conjectures we have considered, and a legal opinion can only be based on such conjectures. As for piety, one should consult his heart and avoid matters of doubt.

The second contract is the contract of usury, which God Almighty has forbidden and strictly prohibited. Caution must be exercised by money changers dealing in the two currencies and by those dealing in foodstuffs, for usury exists only in currency or food. The money changer must guard against deferred payment and excess. As for deferred payment, he must not sell any item of the two currencies for another item of the two currencies except hand to hand, meaning exchange must occur in the same session. This is a precaution against deferment. Money changers delivering gold to the mint and purchasing minted dinars is forbidden due to deferment and because it typically involves disparity, as the minted coin is not returned with its exact weight. As for excess, one must guard against it in three matters: in selling broken coin for sound coin, transaction is only permissible with equivalence; in selling good quality for poor quality, one should not buy poor quality with good of lesser weight, nor sell poor quality for good of greater weight—meaning when selling gold for gold and silver for silver. If the kinds differ, there is no harm in excess. The third is in compounds of gold and silver, such as dinars mixed with gold and silver. If the amount of gold is unknown, transaction is invalid unless it is a currency circulating in the locality, in which case we permit transaction if not exchanged for currency. Similarly, dirhams adulterated with copper, if not circulating in the locality, transaction is invalid because the intent is the pure metal, which is unknown. If it is a currency circulating in the locality, we permit transaction due to necessity and because the pure metal is not intended to be extracted, but it must not be exchanged for pure metal at all. Likewise, any jewelry composed of gold and silver may not be purchased with gold or silver; rather, it should be bought with other goods if the amount of gold is known, unless it is plated with gold in a manner that yields no significant gold when exposed to fire, in which case it may be sold for its like in pure metal with what is intended other than pure metal. Also, a money changer may not buy a necklace containing beads and gold with gold, nor sell it, but with silver hand to hand if it contains no silver. It is not permissible to buy a garment woven with gold that yields significant gold when exposed to fire with gold, but it is permissible with other silver. As for those dealing in foodstuffs, they must exchange in the same session, whether the kind of food sold and bought differs or not. If the kind is the same, they must exchange and observe equivalence and customary practice. In this regard, the transaction of the butcher—where one gives him sheep and buys meat from him for immediate or deferred payment—is forbidden. The transaction of the baker—where one gives him wheat and buys bread from him for deferred or immediate payment—is forbidden. The transaction of the oil presser—where one gives him seeds, sesame, or olives to take oils from him—is forbidden. Similarly, giving milk to take cheese, clarified butter, or butter from it is forbidden.

And all wages for milk are also forbidden. Food may not be sold for a different kind of food except with immediate payment, nor for the same kind except with immediate payment and equivalence. Anything derived from an edible substance may not be sold for it, whether equivalently or with a surplus. Thus, wheat may not be sold for flour, bread, or porridge; nor grapes and dates for syrup, vinegar, or juice; nor milk for clarified butter, butter, buttermilk, whey, or cheese. Equivalence is not valid unless the food is in a state of complete preservation; thus, fresh dates may not be sold for fresh dates, nor grapes for grapes, whether with a surplus or equivalently. These are comprehensive principles defining sale and alerting the merchant to sources of corruption, so that he may seek a ruling if uncertain or confused by any of them. If he does not know this, he will not discern the points requiring inquiry and will plunge into usury and the forbidden unknowingly.

The third contract: Salam (advance payment). The merchant must observe ten conditions in it. First, the capital must be known and of its kind, so that if delivery of the item sold becomes impossible, one may revert to the value of the capital. If one pays a handful of dirhams vaguely for a load of wheat, it is invalid according to one opinion. Second, the capital must be paid in the contract session before separation; if they separate before taking possession, the salam is annulled. Third, the item sold must be something whose attributes can be defined, such as grains, animals, minerals, cotton, wool, silk, dairy, meats, and apothecary goods, and the like. It is not permissible for pastes, compounds, or items whose parts differ, such as various bows, crafted arrows, shoes, sandals with differing parts and craftsmanship, and animal hides. Salam is permissible for bread, and the variation in the amount of salt and water due to more or less cooking is overlooked and tolerated. Fourth, one must exhaustively describe these describable matters so that no attribute remains by which value varies in a manner people do not overlook, except that it is mentioned; for that attribute stands in place of sight in a sale. Fifth, the term must be specified if deferred; it should not be deferred to harvest or ripening, but rather to months and days, for ripening may advance or delay. Sixth, the item sold must be something deliverable at the appointed time and generally assured in existence; thus, one should not sell grapes for a term in which they are not ripe, and likewise all fruits. If existence is generally assured and the time arrives but delivery fails due to a calamity, one may grant respite if desired or annul and reclaim the capital if desired. Seventh, the place of delivery must be specified for items where location matters, to avoid dispute. Eighth, it must not be tied to a specific entity, such as saying "from the wheat of this field" or "the fruit of this orchard," for that invalidates its being a debt. However, if attributed to the fruit of a town or large village, it does not harm. Ninth, one must not sell something precious and scarce, like a described pearl whose like is rare, or a beautiful slave girl with her child, or similar things generally not attainable. Tenth, one must not sell food for food as capital, whether of the same kind or not, nor sell currency if the capital is currency—we have mentioned this in usury.

The fourth contract: Ijarah (leasing). It has two pillars: the wage and the benefit. As for the contracting parties and wording, what we mentioned in sale applies. The wage is like the price, so it should be known and described with all we stipulated for the sold item if it is an object; if it is a debt, its description and amount should be known. One must beware of customary matters, such as renting a house with its maintenance, which is void because the extent of maintenance is unknown. Even if dirhams are specified and the lessee is obliged to spend them on maintenance, it is not permissible because his work in spending on maintenance is unknown. Among these are hiring a skinner to take the hide after skinning, hiring a carcass carrier for the hide of the carcass, hiring a miller for bran or some flour—all are void. Likewise, anything whose acquisition and separation depend on the worker's labor may not be made a wage. Also, if in leasing houses and shops the amount of rent is specified—such as saying "a dinar per month"—but the months of the lease are not specified, the period is unknown and the lease is not concluded. The second pillar: the intended benefit of the lease, which is the work alone. If it is permissible, known work that entails effort for the worker and is voluntarily done by one for another, hiring for it is permissible. The detailed branches of this topic fall under this connection, but we will not elaborate, having already extended discussion in legal matters. We only point to what is commonly needed, so observe in it...

The hired labor must fulfill five conditions. First, it must be substantial, involving effort and toil. If one hires food to adorn a shop, trees to dry clothes upon, or coins to decorate a shop, it is not permissible, for these benefits are akin to a sesame seed or a grain of wheat among tangible goods, which may not be sold. They are like looking into another's mirror, drinking from his well, seeking shade by his wall, or taking light from his fire. Hence, if one hires a seller to speak a word that promotes his goods, it is not permissible. What sellers take in exchange for their dignity, status, and the acceptance of their word in promoting goods is unlawful, for it amounts to nothing but a word involving no effort or value. It is only lawful for them if they toil through frequent visits or extensive speech in arranging a transaction, and then they deserve only the customary wage. As for what sellers conspire upon, it is oppression and not taken rightfully. Second, the lease must not entail the consumption of a specific intended entity. Thus, leasing a vineyard for its benefit, livestock for their milk, or orchards for their fruits is not permissible. Hiring a wet nurse is allowed, with the milk being incidental, as isolating it is impossible. Likewise, tolerance is shown for the ink of paper and the thread of the tailor, as they are not sought independently. Third, the work must be capable of delivery both physically and legally. Hiring a weak person for work he cannot perform, or a mute for teaching and the like, is invalid. What is forbidden to do, the law prevents its delivery, such as hiring to extract a healthy tooth, amputate a limb not permitted by law, hiring a menstruating woman to sweep the mosque, a teacher to teach magic or obscenity, hiring another's wife for nursing without her husband's permission, hiring an artist to depict animals, or a goldsmith to fashion vessels from gold and silver—all such are void. Fourth, the work must not be obligatory upon the hired person, nor such that representation cannot be exercised on behalf of the hirer. Thus, taking wages for jihad or other acts of worship where no representation is allowed is not permissible, as it does not occur on behalf of the hirer. It is permissible for Hajj, washing the deceased, digging graves, burying the dead, and carrying biers. There is disagreement regarding taking wages for leading Tarawih prayers, for the call to prayer, and for undertaking teaching and Quranic instruction. However, hiring to teach a specific issue or a specific surah to a particular person is valid. Fifth, the work and benefit must be known. The tailor knows his work by the garment, the teacher by specifying the surah and its extent, and the beast of burden carrier by the amount carried and the distance. Anything that typically provokes dispute must not be neglected. Detailing this is lengthy; we have mentioned this much to elucidate rulings and alert to points of difficulty, so one may inquire, for thoroughness is the task of the jurist, not the common folk.

The fifth contract: Qirad (commenda). Three pillars must be observed. The first pillar: capital. Its condition is that it be known currency, delivered to the agent. Qirad is not permissible with fulus (low-value coins) or goods, for trade is constrained therein. It is not permissible with a purse of dirhams, as the profit share cannot be determined. If the owner stipulates control for himself, it is invalid, as it narrows the path of trade. The second pillar: profit. Let it be known proportionally, stipulating a third, half, or as desired. If one says, "For you from the profit is one hundred, and the remainder is mine," it is invalid, as the profit may not exceed one hundred. It is not permissible to specify a fixed amount, but rather a common proportion. The third: the work incumbent upon the agent. Its condition is that it be trade, not constrained by specification or time limit. If stipulated that he buy livestock with the capital to seek offspring, sharing the offspring, or wheat to bake it, sharing the profit, it is invalid, for Qirad is authorized in trade, meaning buying and selling and what necessarily arises therefrom only. This is a craft, namely baking and tending livestock. If constrained, stipulating not to buy except from a certain person, or not to trade except in red silk, or stipulating what narrows the scope of trade, the contract is void. Once concluded, the agent is a trustee, acting with diligence as trustees do. Whenever the owner wishes to annul, he may do so. If annulled while all the capital is in currency, division is straightforward. If in goods with no profit, it is returned to him, and the owner may not oblige him to convert it to currency, for the contract is annulled and he is not committed to anything. If the agent says, "I will sell it," and the owner refuses, the prevailing view is...

The owner is not entitled [to profit] unless the worker finds a customer through whom a profit on the capital becomes apparent. Whatever the profit may be, the worker must sell an amount equivalent to the capital in the same kind as the capital, not in another currency, so that the surplus becomes distinguished as profit, in which they both share. They are not required to sell the surplus over the capital. Whatever the [state at the] end of the year, they must ascertain the value of the wealth for the purpose of zakah. If something from the profit has become apparent, the more correct opinion is that the zakah on the worker's share is incumbent upon the worker, and that he owns the profit by its becoming apparent. The worker may not travel with the capital of the qirad without the owner's permission. If he does so, his transactions are valid, but if he does so, he is liable for both the commodities and their prices, because his transgression through moving [the goods] extends to the price of what is moved. If he travels with permission, it is permissible, and the expense of transport and safeguarding the wealth is upon the capital of the qirad, just as the expense of weighing, measuring, and carrying—which a merchant of his like is not accustomed to—is upon the capital. As for spreading out cloth, folding it, and other minor, customary tasks, he may not charge a fee for them; the expense for these, along with his lodging in the city, is upon the worker. The rent of the shop is not upon him. If he dedicates himself exclusively to travel for the capital of the qirad, his travel expenses are upon the capital of the qirad. When he returns, he must return the remaining travel utensils, such as the purification vessel and the travel bag, etc.

The sixth contract: Partnership. It is of four types, three of which are invalid. The first is the partnership of mutual agency (mufawadah), which is when two parties say, "We have mutually authorized each other to share in all our wealth and obligations," while their assets are distinct. This is invalid. The second is the partnership of bodies (abdan), which is when they stipulate sharing in the wages of labor. This is invalid. The third is the partnership of credit (wujuh), which is when one of them has prestige and acceptable speech, so credit is extended on his side, and labor is on the side of the other. This too is invalid. The only valid contract is the fourth, called the partnership of contributions ('inan), which is when their two assets are mixed such that distinguishing between them is impossible except by division, and each authorizes his partner to transact. Then their ruling is that profit and loss are distributed according to the proportion of the two capitals. It is not permissible to alter this by stipulation. Then, by dismissal, the dismissed party is prevented from transacting, and by division, ownership is separated from ownership. The correct opinion is that a partnership contract is permissible on purchased commodities, and currency is not stipulated, unlike the qirad. This amount of legal knowledge must be learned by every earner, lest he plunge into the unlawful unknowingly.

As for transactions with the butcher, the baker, and the grocer, neither the earner nor others can do without them. The flaw in them arises from three aspects: neglecting the conditions of sale, neglecting the conditions of a forward sale (salam), or limiting oneself to hand-to-hand exchange (mu'atah), since customs are prevalent of writing notes to these [vendors] for daily needs, then settling accounts periodically, then valuation according to what mutual agreement settles upon. This is something we see the judiciary permitting due to necessity. Their handing over [of goods] is construed as permitting consumption while awaiting compensation, so eating it is lawful. However, liability is incurred by eating it, and its value on the day of consumption becomes obligatory, so those values accumulate as a debt. If mutual agreement is reached on a specific amount, one should seek from them an absolute release, so that no obligation remains upon him should any discrepancy arise in the valuation. This is what one must be content with, for requiring the weighing of the price for every single need, every day and every hour, is an excessive imposition. Likewise, requiring offer and acceptance and determining the price for every small amount is difficult. When each type becomes plentiful, its valuation becomes easy. And God is the Grantor of success.

The Third Chapter: On Clarifying Justice and Avoiding Injustice in Transactions.
Know that a transaction may proceed in a manner which the jurist rules as valid and binding, yet it contains an injustice through which the transactor exposes himself to the wrath of God Almighty, for not every prohibition necessitates the invalidity of the contract. This injustice refers to that by which another is harmed, and it is divided into that whose harm is general and that which is specific to the transactor.

The first division concerns that whose harm is general, and it is of several types. The first type is hoarding (ihtikar). The seller of food who hoards food, awaiting a rise in prices, commits a general injustice and is blameworthy in the Sacred Law. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever hoards food for forty days and then gives it in charity, his charity will not atone for his hoarding." [A narration from Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from 'Ali, and al-Khatib in his History from Anas with two weak chains.] It is narrated from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said, "Whoever hoards food for forty days has absolved himself from God, and God has absolved Himself from him." [Narrated by Ahmad and al-Hakim with a good chain, though Ibn 'Adi said it is not preserved from Ibn 'Umar.] It is said, it is as if...

The killing of all people is a grave matter. And from Ali, may God be pleased with him: "Whoever hoards food for forty days, his heart hardens."

And from him also is that he burned the food of a hoarder with fire. And it is narrated regarding the virtue of abstaining from hoarding, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever brings food and sells it at the market price of its day, it is as if he has given it in charity." And in another wording: "It is as if he has emancipated a slave." A hadith: "Whoever brings food and sells it at the market price of its day, it is as if he has given it in charity." And in another wording: "It is as if he has emancipated a slave." Ibn Mardawayh narrated it in his Tafsir from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain. "There is no supplier who brings food to a town of the Muslims and sells it at the market price of its day, except that his station with God is like that of a martyr." And Al-Hakim has from the hadith of Al-Yasa' ibn al-Mughirah: "The supplier to a market is like a warrior in the path of God," and it is *mursal*. And it is said regarding His saying, the Exalted: "And whoever intends therein deviation with injustice, We will make him taste of a painful punishment" [Qur'an 22:25], that hoarding is from injustice and falls under this threat.

And from some of the predecessors: He was in Wasit and sent a ship of wheat to Basra, writing to his agent: "Sell this food on the day it enters Basra, and do not delay it to the morrow." It coincided with a time of ample supply and low prices. The merchants said to him, "If you delay it a week, you would profit many times over." So he delayed it a week and profited its like. He wrote to his partner informing him of this. The owner of the food wrote back to him: "O you! We were content with a small profit along with the safety of our religion. You have contravened, and we do not love to profit manyfold with the loss of anything from our religion. You have committed a transgression against us. When my letter reaches you, take all the money and give it in charity to the poor of Basra. Would that I emerge from the sin of hoarding with a clean slate, neither for me nor against me."

Know that the prohibition is general, and consideration pertains to the time and the type of commodity. As for the type, the prohibition applies categorically to the types of staple foods. As for what is not a staple food nor an aid to it, like medicines, herbs, saffron, and their like, the prohibition does not extend to it, even if it is edible. As for what aids the staple food, like meat, fruits, and what substitutes for it, providing sufficiency in some circumstances—even if one cannot persist on it—this is a matter for consideration. Some scholars extended the prohibition to clarified butter, honey, sesame oil, cheese, olive oil, and what is similar. As for the time, it also potentially entails extending the prohibition to all times, as indicated by the story we mentioned regarding the food that coincided with ample supply in Basra. And it is possible to specify it to a time of scarcity of food and the people's need for it, such that delaying its sale causes some harm. But if foods are abundant and plentiful, and people are independent of them and only desire them for a low price, and the owner of the food awaits that and does not await a famine, then there is no harm in this. When the time is a time of famine, storing honey, clarified butter, sesame oil, and the like causes harm, so it should be ruled as prohibited. The basis for negating or affirming prohibition is harm, for it is definitively understood from the specification of food. If there is no harm, hoarding staple foods is not free from dislike, for one awaits the beginnings of harm, which is the rise in prices. Awaiting the beginnings of harm is a danger, like awaiting the actual harm, but it is lesser. And awaiting the actual harm is also less than causing harm. Thus, according to the degrees of harm, the degrees of dislike and prohibition vary.

In summary, trading in staple foods is not recommended, because it seeks profit, and staple foods are foundational substances created for sustenance. Profit is from luxuries, so profit should be sought in what is created from the category of luxuries which the creation has no essential need for. For this reason, one of the Followers advised a man, saying: "Do not apprentice your son in two sales, nor in two crafts: the sale of food and the sale of shrouds, for he will wish for high prices and the death of people. And the two crafts: that he be a butcher, for it is a craft that hardens the heart; or a goldsmith/silversmith, for he adorns the world with gold and silver."

The second type is circulating counterfeit coins during monetary exchange. This is injustice, for the trading partner is harmed by it if he does not recognize it; and if he recognizes it, he will circulate it to another. So too the third and fourth, and it continues to circulate in hands, generalizing the harm and spreading corruption, and the sin and burden of all of it returns to him, for he is the one who opened this door. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever initiates a bad practice and it is acted upon after him, he will bear its sin and the sin of all who act upon it, without that diminishing anything from their sins." A hadith: "Whoever initiates a bad practice and it is acted upon after him, he will bear its sin and the sin of all who act upon it, without that diminishing anything from their sins." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Jarir ibn 'Abdullah. And some said: "Spending a single counterfeit dirham is more severe than stealing a hundred dirhams, for theft is a single transgression that is completed and ended, but spending counterfeit coins is an innovation he has introduced into the religion and a bad practice that will be acted upon after him."

He will bear the burden of its sin after his death for a hundred years or two hundred years, until that dirham perishes. And he will bear the responsibility for the corruption of people's wealth caused by his precedent. Blessed is he whose sins die with him when he dies. And prolonged woe to him who dies while his sins remain for a hundred years and two hundred years or more, being punished for them in his grave and questioned about them until their very extinction. And God Almighty said: "And We record what they have sent ahead and their traces." That is, We also record what they have left behind of the traces of their deeds, just as We record what they have sent ahead. And concerning this is His saying: "Man will be informed that day of what he sent ahead and what he left behind." What he left behind are the traces of his deeds from an evil precedent that others acted upon.

Know that concerning counterfeit currency there are five matters. First: If something of it is returned to him, he should cast it into a well where hands cannot reach it. Beware of circulating it in another sale. If he renders it unusable to the point that transaction with it is impossible, that is permissible. Second: It is obligatory for the merchant to learn about currency verification, not to scrutinize for his own sake, but so that he does not hand over counterfeit to a Muslim unknowingly, thus becoming sinful due to his negligence in learning that knowledge. For every knowledge by which the sincere counsel of Muslims is perfected must be acquired. For this reason, the early generations would learn the signs of currency verification out of regard for their religion, not their worldly affairs. Third: If he receives it and the other party to the transaction knows it is counterfeit, he is not free from sin, because he only takes it to circulate it to someone else and does not inform him. Even if he did not resolve to do so, he would not desire to take it in the first place. He is only absolved from the sin of the harm that specifically affects his transaction partner. Fourth: That he takes the counterfeit to act upon the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): "May God have mercy on a man who is easy in selling, easy in buying, easy in settling debts, and easy in claiming debts." (Narrated by Al-Bukhari from the hadith of Jabir). He enters into the blessing of this supplication if he resolves to cast it into a well. But if he intends to circulate it in a transaction, this is an evil that Satan has presented to him in the guise of goodness, so he does not fall under the category of those who are lenient in claiming debts. Fifth: By counterfeit, we mean that which has no silver content at all, but is merely plated, or that which has no gold content—I mean in dinars. As for that which has some silver content, if it is mixed with copper and it is the currency of the land, the scholars have differed regarding transactions with it, and the preponderant view in our opinion is its permissibility if it is the currency of the land, whether the amount of silver is known or not. If it is not the currency of the land, it is not permissible except if the amount of silver is known. If there is in his possession a coin whose silver content is deficient compared to the currency of the land, he must inform his transaction partner of it and not transact with it except with one who does not consider it permissible to circulate it among the general currency through deception. As for one who considers that permissible, handing it over to him is enabling him to corruption; it is like selling grapes to one whom he knows will make wine from them, and that is forbidden, an assistance to evil, and a participation in it. Treading the path of truth in matters like this in commerce is more severe than persistence in supererogatory acts of worship and devoting oneself to them. For this reason, some have said: "The truthful merchant is more virtuous with God than the devout worshiper." The early generations were cautious in such matters. It is narrated from some of those who fought in the path of God that he said: "I charged on my horse to kill an infidel, but my horse fell short and I returned. Then the infidel drew near to me, so I charged a second time, but my horse fell short and I returned. Then I charged a third time, but my horse shied away from me, and I was not accustomed to that from him. I returned sorrowful and sat with bowed head and broken heart over what I had missed of the infidel and what had appeared to me of the horse's character. I placed my head on the tent pole with the horse standing, and I saw in a dream as if the horse was addressing me, saying to me: 'By God, you intended to take me against the infidel three times, and yesterday you bought fodder for me and paid for its price with a counterfeit dirham. This will never be.'" He said: "I awoke in alarm, went to the fodder merchant, and exchanged that dirham." This is an example of harm that is general. Let him measure other examples by it.

The second category is that whose harm is specific to the transaction partner. Everything by which the transaction partner is harmed is oppression. Indeed, justice does not harm his Muslim brother. The comprehensive principle in this is that he should not wish for his brother except what he wishes for himself. Thus, everything that if he were dealt with it would be difficult for him and weigh heavily on his heart, he should not deal with others by it. Rather, his own dirham and the dirham of another should be equal in his sight. Some have said: "Whoever sells his brother something for a dirham, while it would not be suitable for him if he bought it for himself except for five daniqs, then he has neglected the sincere counsel commanded in transactions and has not wished for his brother what he wishes for himself." This is its summary. As for its details, they are in four matters: that he does not praise the merchandise with what is not in it; that he does not conceal any of its defects and hidden qualities at all; that he does not conceal anything in its weight and measure; and that he does not conceal anything of its price such that if the transaction partner knew it, he would refrain from it. As for the first...

It is abandoning praise, for if one describes a commodity with what is not in it, that is falsehood. If the buyer accepts it, it is deception and injustice along with being falsehood; and if he does not accept it, it is falsehood and a loss of chivalry, for falsehood that does not succeed may not tarnish the outward appearance of chivalry. If he praises the commodity with what is in it, it is idle talk and speaking words that do not concern him, and he is accountable for every word he utters that he did not speak. Allah the Exalted said: "Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher by him, ready." Except if he praises the commodity with what is in it that the buyer does not know, provided he does not mention it as he would describe hidden traits of slaves, servant girls, and beasts; then there is no harm in mentioning the existing amount without exaggeration and prolixity. His intention should be to inform his Muslim brother so he may desire it and his need be fulfilled thereby. He should not swear upon it at all, for if he is lying, he has brought the perjurious oath, which is among the major sins that leave dwellings desolate. And if he is truthful, he has made Allah the Exalted a target for his oaths and has done wrong in it, for this world is too base to intend promoting it by mentioning the name of Allah without necessity. In the report: "Woe to the merchant from 'Yes, by Allah' and 'No, by Allah'! And woe to the craftsman from 'Tomorrow' and 'After tomorrow'." The report "Woe to the merchant from 'Yes, by Allah' and 'No, by Allah'! And woe to the craftsman from 'Tomorrow' and 'After tomorrow'"—I have not found a source for it. The author of *Musnad al-Firdaws* mentioned from a narration of Anas without chain something similar. And in the report: "The false oath promotes the commodity but erases the blessing." The hadith "The false oath promotes the commodity but erases the blessing" is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayra with the wording "al-half" (oath), and it is in al-Bayhaqi with the wording of the author. Abu Hurayra, may Allah be pleased with him, reported from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Three people Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection: a harsh person who is arrogant, one who gives charity and reminds of it, and one who sells his commodity by his oath." The hadith of Abu Hurayra: "Three people Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection: a harsh person who is arrogant, one who gives charity and reminds of it, and one who sells his commodity by his oath"—Muslim reported it from his narration, except he only mentioned "a harsh person who is arrogant." And in the two Sahihs: "Three people Allah will not speak to nor look at: a man who swears about a commodity that he was given more for it than he was given, and he is lying." The hadith—and in Muslim from the narration of Abu Dharr: "The one who reminds of his gift, the one who lets his garment drag, and the one who sells his commodity by false oath." So if praising the commodity with truth is disliked because it is superfluous and does not increase provision, then the severity regarding the matter of oath is evident. It is reported from Yunus ibn 'Ubayd, who was a silk merchant, that silk was requested from him for purchase. His servant brought out remnants of silk, spread it, looked at it, and said: "O Allah, provide us with Paradise." He said to his servant: "Return it to its place," and did not sell it, fearing that might be an allusion to praising the commodity. Such are those who traded in this world and did not waste their religion in their trades; rather, they knew that the profit of the Hereafter is more worthy of pursuit than the profit of this world. The second is to disclose all defects of the sold item, hidden and apparent, and not conceal anything from them. That is obligatory, for if he hides it, he is unjust and deceitful, and deceit is forbidden, and he is abandoning sincerity in transaction, and sincerity is obligatory. Whenever he shows the better side of the garment and hides the other, he is deceitful. Likewise, if he displays garments in dark places, and likewise if he displays the better one of a pair of shoes or sandals and the like. What indicates the prohibition of deceit is what is reported: He, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by a man selling food, and it pleased him, so he put his hand into it and felt dampness. He said: "What is this?" He said: "Rain affected it." He said: "Why did you not put it on top of the food so people could see it? Whoever deceives us is not of us." The hadith—Muslim reported it from the narration of Abu Hurayra. What indicates the obligation of sincerity by disclosing defects is what is reported: When the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, took the pledge of Islam from Jarir, he went to leave, but he pulled his garment and stipulated upon him sincerity to every Muslim. The hadith of Jarir ibn 'Abdullah: "We pledged to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, to be sincere to every Muslim"—agreed upon. So Jarir, when he stood to sell a commodity, would point out its defects, then give the choice, saying: "If you wish, take it; if you wish, leave it." It was said to him: "If you do this, your sale will not succeed." He said: "We pledged to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, to be sincere to every Muslim." And Wathilah ibn al-Asqa' was standing when a man sold his she-camel for three hundred dirhams. Wathilah was heedless, and the man had gone with the she-camel, so he ran after him and called out to him: "O you, did you buy it for meat or for riding?" He said: "For riding." He said: "There is a crack in its hoof that I saw, and it cannot keep up with the pace." So he returned and gave it back, and the seller reduced it by one hundred dirhams and said to Wathilah: "May Allah have mercy on you."

You have spoiled my sale for me. He said: We pledged to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, upon sincere counsel for every Muslim. And he said: I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: It is not lawful for anyone to sell a thing except that he discloses its defect, and it is not lawful for one who knows of it except to disclose it. A narration from Wathilah: It is not lawful for anyone to sell a thing except that he makes clear what is in it, and it is not lawful for one who knows of it except to make it clear. Al-Hakim reported it and said its chain is sound, and Al-Bayhaqi.

Thus they understood from 'sincere counsel' that one should not be pleased for his brother except with what pleases him for himself. They did not consider this to be among the virtues and higher spiritual stations, but rather they believed it to be from the conditions of Islam included within their pledge. This is a matter burdensome to most of creation, and therefore they choose to withdraw for worship and seclude themselves from people, for fulfilling the rights of God while mixing and transacting with others is a struggle which none can undertake except the truthful ones. This will not be made easy for a servant except by believing two matters.

The first is that concealing defects and promoting goods does not increase his provision; rather, it obliterates it and removes its blessing. What he gathers from the scattered acts of deception, God destroys all at once. It has been narrated that a man had a cow he would milk, mix the milk with water, and sell it. A flood came and drowned the cow. One of his sons said, "Those separate waters we poured into the milk have gathered all at once and taken the cow." How could it be otherwise when the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The two parties to a transaction are blessed in their transaction if they are truthful and give sincere counsel; but if they conceal and lie, the blessing of their transaction is removed." The hadith: "The two parties to a transaction are blessed in their transaction if they are truthful and give sincere counsel" is agreed upon from the narration of Hakim ibn Hizam. And in a hadith: "God's hand is over the two partners as long as they do not betray one another. If they betray one another, He lifts His hand from them." The hadith: "God's hand is over the two partners as long as they do not betray one another. If they betray one another, He lifts His hand from them" is reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, who said its chain is sound.

Therefore, wealth does not increase through betrayal, just as it does not decrease through charity. One who does not recognize increase and decrease except by the scale will not believe this hadith. But one who knows that a single dirham may be blessed so as to be a cause for a person's happiness in this world and religion, and that multiplied thousands may have their blessing removed by God so as to be a cause for the destruction of their owner—to the point he wishes for bankruptcy from them and sees it as better for him in some of his states—understands the meaning of our saying that betrayal does not increase wealth and charity does not decrease it.

The second meaning, which must be believed for sincere counsel to be perfected and made easy for him, is to know that the profit and sufficiency of the Hereafter are better than the profit of this world, and that the benefits of worldly wealth expire with the expiration of one's lifespan, while its injustices and burdens remain. How then can a rational person permit himself to exchange that which is lower for that which is better? All good lies in the soundness of one's religion. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The declaration 'There is no god but God' continually wards off God's displeasure from creation, as long as they do not prefer the bargain of their world over their Hereafter." The hadith: "The declaration 'There is no god but God' continually wards off God's displeasure from creation, as long as they do not prefer the bargain of their world over their Hereafter" is reported by Abu Ya'la and Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Anas with a weak chain. In a narration of Al-Tirmidhi Al-Hakim in Al-Nawadir: "...until, when they settle at a station where they do not care what is diminished from their religion so long as their world is safe for them..." The hadith. And Al-Tabarani in Al-Awsat has something similar from the narration of 'A'ishah, and it is also weak. In another wording: "...as long as they do not care what is diminished from their world for the safety of their religion. But when they do that and say 'There is no god but God,' God Almighty says: 'You have lied; you are not truthful in it.'" In another hadith: "Whoever says 'There is no god but God' sincerely enters Paradise." It was said, "And what is its sincerity?" He said, "That it restrains him from what God has forbidden." The hadith: "Whoever says 'There is no god but God' sincerely enters Paradise. It was said, 'And what is its sincerity?' He said, 'It restrains him from what God has forbidden.'" Reported by Al-Tabarani from the narration of Zayd ibn Arqam in his Al-Mu'jam al-Kabir and Al-Awsat with a sound chain. And he also said: "He has not believed in the Qur'an who makes lawful what it has made unlawful."

Whoever knows that these matters are detrimental to his faith, and that his faith is his capital for the Hereafter, will not squander his capital prepared for a life that has no end for the sake of a profit from which he benefits for numbered days. One of the Followers said: "If I entered the mosque while it was crowded with its people and was asked, 'Who is the best of these?' I would say, 'The one who gives the most sincere counsel to them.' If they said, 'This one,' I would say he is their best. And if it was said to me, 'Who is the worst of them?' I would say, 'The one who is most deceitful toward them.' If they said, 'This one,' I would say he is their worst."

Deception is forbidden in all sales and crafts. A craftsman should not be negligent in his work in a way that, if another dealt with him similarly, he would not accept it for himself. Rather, he should perfect the craft and execute it well, then disclose its defect if it has one.

In it lies a flaw, and thereby one is delivered. A man asked Hudaifah ibn Salim, saying, "How may I be safe in selling sandals?" He replied, "Make the two sides equal, and do not favor the right over the left. Ensure the stuffing is of good quality and let it be one complete thing. Bring the beads close together and do not press one sandal upon the other." From this category is what was asked of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God have mercy on him, concerning stitching such that it is not apparent. He said, "It is not permissible for one who sells it to conceal it; it is only lawful for the stitcher if he knows it will show or that he does not intend it for sale."

If you say, "Then the transaction is never complete, since a person is obliged to mention the defects of the sold item," I say it is not so, for the condition of the merchant is that he should not buy for resale except what is good, which he would approve for himself if he kept it. Then he should be content in selling it with a small profit, so that God blesses him in it, and he has no need for deception. This has become difficult only because they are not content with a small profit, and much cannot be attained except through deceit. Whoever is accustomed to this does not buy the defective. If a defective item rarely falls into his hand, let him mention it and be content with its value. Ibn Sirin sold a sheep and said to the buyer, "I absolve myself to you from any defect in it; it turns over its fodder with its foot." Al-Hasan ibn Salih sold a slave-girl and said to the buyer, "She once coughed up blood in our presence." Thus was the conduct of the people of religion. Whoever is incapable of this, let him abandon the transaction or prepare himself for the punishment of the Hereafter.

Thirdly, that he conceals nothing in the measure, and that is by balancing the scale and being cautious in it and in measuring. He should measure as he would wish to be measured. God Almighty said, "Woe to the defrauders, who, when they take by measure from others, take it in full, but when they measure to them or weigh to them, they give less." One is not delivered from this except by giving more when he gives and taking less when he takes, for true justice is scarcely conceivable. Let him seek clarity by the appearance of increase and decrease, for whoever exacts his right in full is likely to transgress it. Some of them would say, "I do not buy the 'woe' from God for a grain." So when he took, he would decrease half a grain, and when he gave, he would add a grain. And he would say, "Woe to him who sells for a grain a Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth. How great is the loss of him who sells bliss for woe!" They were extreme in guarding against this and its like because they are injustices from which repentance is not possible, since the owners of the grains are not known until He gathers them and their rights are rendered. For this reason, when the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, bought something, he said to the weigher as he was weighing its price, "Weigh and give more." The hadith says, "He said to the weigher, 'Weigh and give more.'" It is narrated by the compilers of the Sunan and al-Hakim from the hadith of Suwayd ibn Qays. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan sahih, and al-Hakim said it is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim. Fudayl looked at his son as he was washing a dinar, intending to exchange it and remove its blackening and purify it so that its weight would not increase because of that, and he said, "O my son, your doing this is better than two pilgrimages and twenty lesser pilgrimages." Some of the predecessors said, "I am amazed at the merchant and the seller—how can he be saved? He weighs and swears by day, and sleeps by night." Solomon, peace be upon him, said to his son, "O my son, just as a grain enters between two stones, so does sin enter between the two parties in a sale." A righteous man prayed over an effeminate man, and it was said to him, "He was immoral." He remained silent, and it was repeated to him. He said, "It is as if you said to me, 'He had two scales: he gave with one and took with the other.'" He indicated by this that his immorality was an injustice between him and God Almighty, and this is from the injustices against creatures. Being lax and forgiving in it is more remote, and the severity in the matter of the scale is great. Deliverance from it is attained by a grain and half a grain. In the recitation of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, "Do not transgress in the measure, and establish weight with justice, and do not diminish the measure"—meaning the tongue of the scale, for decrease and increase appear by its inclination. In summary, everyone who exacts his due from others, even in a word, and is not given justice as he exacts it, falls under the saying of God Almighty, "Woe to the defrauders, who, when they take by measure from others, take it in full..." The prohibition of that in what is measured is not because it is measured, but because it is an intended matter in which justice and fairness are abandoned. Thus it applies to all actions. The owner of the scale is in danger of "woe," and every accountable person is an owner of scales in his actions, words, and thoughts. So "woe" to him if he deviates from justice and inclines from uprightness. Were this not difficult and nearly impossible, His saying would not have come, "And there is none of you but will come to it. This is a fixed decree of your Lord." So no servant, unless infallible, is free from inclining from uprightness, except that the degrees of inclination vary greatly. Therefore, the duration of their stay in the Fire varies until the time of deliverance, so that some remain only for the duration of fulfilling an oath, and some remain for a thousand and thousands of years. We ask God Almighty to bring us near to uprightness and justice, for holding fast to the straight path without deviation from it is not...

If one covets what is unlawful, it is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. Were it not for this, the one steadfast upon it would be unable to cross the Sirat (the Bridge) stretched over the back of the Fire, described as being finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. According to the degree of steadfastness on this straight path, the servant's crossing on the Day of Resurrection will be lightened. Whoever mixes food with dust or anything else and then measures it out is among those who give short measure. Every butcher who weighs bone with meat, contrary to customary practice, is among those who give short weight. Apply this analogy to all other measurements, even in the cubit measurement used by cloth merchants. For when he buys, he slackens the cloth at the time of measuring and does not stretch it out, but when he sells, he stretches it in the measurement to show an apparent increase in length. All of that is from short-changing, exposing its perpetrator to the fourth Wail (a severe punishment in Hell). He must be truthful about the current price and not conceal anything from it.

Indeed, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited intercepting caravan traders. The hadith prohibiting intercepting caravan traders is agreed upon, narrated from Ibn Abbas and Abu Hurairah. And he prohibited Najsh (fraudulent bidding). The hadith prohibiting Najsh is agreed upon, narrated from Ibn Umar and Abu Hurairah. As for intercepting caravan traders, it is to go out to meet a caravan, intercept the goods, and lie about the market price in the town. He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Do not intercept caravan traders. Whoever intercepts them, the owner of the goods has the option (to cancel the sale) after he reaches the market." This sale is concluded, but if his lie is exposed, the seller retains the option. If he was truthful, there is a difference of opinion regarding the option due to the conflict between the general implication of the report and the removal of deception.

He also prohibited a townsman from selling on behalf of a desert-dweller. The hadith prohibiting a townsman from selling for a desert-dweller is agreed upon, narrated from Ibn Abbas, Abu Hurairah, and Anas. It is when a desert-dweller comes to town with provisions he wishes to sell quickly, so a townsman says to him: "Leave it with me until I get a higher price for it and wait for its price to rise." This is prohibited regarding foodstuffs; for other goods, there is a difference of opinion, and the more apparent view is its prohibition due to the general prohibition and because it is a delay causing general hardship to people without benefit for the intrusive one who causes the hardship.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, prohibited Najsh, which is when someone approaches the seller ahead of an interested buyer and asks for the goods at an increased price, not desiring them but only intending to stir the buyer's desire for them. If this is done without prior agreement with the seller, it is a forbidden action by its doer, and the sale is concluded. If there was prior agreement, there is a difference of opinion regarding the establishment of the option (for the buyer). The preferable view is to establish the option because it is deception by an action resembling the deception in Misrah (hiding defects in milk) and intercepting caravans.

These prohibitions indicate that it is not permissible to deceive the seller or the buyer regarding the current price and to conceal from them something which, had they known, they would not have proceeded with the contract. Doing this is from the forbidden deceit, opposed to the obligatory sincere counsel.

It is narrated from a man among the Followers (Tabi'un) that he was in Basra and had an agent in Susa who supplied him with sugar. His agent wrote to him: "The sugar cane has been afflicted by a blight this year, so buy sugar." So he bought a great amount of sugar. When its time came, he made a profit of thirty thousand. He returned to his home and pondered throughout the night, saying: "I gained thirty thousand but lost the sincere counsel due to a Muslim man." When morning came, he went to the sugar seller and gave him the thirty thousand, saying: "May God bless it for you." The seller said: "How did it become mine?" He replied: "I concealed from you the true situation, for the sugar had become expensive at that time." The seller said: "May God have mercy on you, you have informed me now, and I have made it pure for you." He returned with it to his home, pondered, and spent the night awake, saying: "I did not counsel him sincerely; perhaps he felt shy of me and left it for me." He went to him early the next day and said: "May God grant you well-being, take your wealth back, for it is purer for my heart." So he took the thirty thousand from him.

These reports of prohibitions and narratives indicate that one must not seize an opportunity and take advantage of the inattention of the goods' owner, concealing from the seller a price increase or from the buyer a drop in prices. If one does that, he is unjust, abandoning justice and sincere counsel for the Muslims.

Whenever one sells by Murabaha (cost-plus profit), saying: "I sell for what it cost me or for what I bought it," he must be truthful. Then it becomes obligatory upon him to inform of any defect or decrease that occurs after the contract. If he bought on credit, he must mention it. If he bought leniently from a friend or his child, he must mention it, because the transacting party relies on his customary thoroughness that he does not neglect looking out for himself. If he neglects it due to some reason, then informing him is obligatory, for reliance in it is on his trustworthiness.

**The Fourth Chapter: On Excellence in Transactions**

God Almighty has commanded both justice and excellence (Ihsan). Justice is the cause of salvation alone, and in trade, it runs like the capital. Excellence is the cause of triumph and attaining happiness, and in trade, it runs like the profit. He who is content is not counted among the heedless.

In worldly transactions, one deals with his capital; likewise, in transactions for the Hereafter. Thus, it is not fitting for the religious person to confine himself to justice and avoiding oppression, while abandoning the gates of benevolence. For God has said, “And do good as God has done good to you,” and the Almighty has said, “Indeed, God commands justice and benevolence,” and the Glorified has said, “Indeed, the mercy of God is near to the benevolent.” By benevolence we mean doing that from which the other party benefits, though it is not obligatory upon one; rather, it is an act of grace from him. For what is obligatory falls under the category of justice and avoiding oppression, which we have already mentioned.

The rank of benevolence is attained through one of six matters. The first is in bargaining: one ought not to outbargain his companion in a manner not customary in bargaining. As for the essence of bargaining, it is permitted because selling is for profit, and that is not possible except by some outbargaining. However, moderation should be observed therein. If the buyer offers an increase over the customary profit, either due to intense desire or pressing immediate need, then one ought to refrain from accepting it; that is from benevolence. Whenever there is no deception, taking the increase is not oppression. Some scholars have held that outbargaining by more than one-third necessitates the option [to rescind], but we do not hold that view. Yet, it is from benevolence to reduce that outbargaining.

It is related that Yunus ibn ‘Ubayd had garments of varying prices: some valued at four hundred and some at two hundred. He went to prayer, leaving his nephew in the shop. A Bedouin came and asked for a garment for four hundred. He showed him one from the two-hundred garments; the Bedouin admired it and was pleased, so he bought it and left with it in his hands. Yunus met him, recognized his garment, and said to the Bedouin, “For how much did you buy it?” He said, “For four hundred.” Yunus said, “It is not worth more than two hundred. Return so you may give it back.” The Bedouin said, “This is worth five hundred in our land, and I am pleased with it.” Yunus said to him, “Go back, for sincerity in religion is better than the world and all it contains.” Then he returned him to the shop, gave him back two hundred dirhams, and reproached his nephew for that, saying, “Are you not ashamed? Do you not fear God? You seek profit equal to the price and abandon sincerity toward Muslims?” The nephew said, “By God, he took it only while pleased with it.” Yunus said, “Why did you not deem acceptable for him what you would accept for yourself?” If this involves concealing the price and deception, it is from the category of oppression, as previously mentioned.

In the hadith, “Outbargaining the unsuspecting is forbidden.” The hadith “Outbargaining the unsuspecting is forbidden” was reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Abu Umamah with a weak chain, and by al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of Jabir with a sound chain, saying “usury” instead of “forbidden.” Al-Zubayr ibn ‘Adi used to say, “I met eighteen Companions, not one of them was skilled at buying meat for a dirham.” Outbargaining such unsuspecting people is oppression if done without deception; if without deception, it is from abandoning benevolence. Rarely is this accomplished without some form of deception and concealing the current price.

Pure benevolence is what is narrated from al-Sari al-Saqati: he bought a load of almonds for sixty dinars and wrote in his ledger three dinars as his profit, as if he saw to profit half a dinar on ten, making the almonds worth ninety. The broker came to him seeking the almonds. He said, “Take them.” The broker said, “For how much?” He said, “For sixty-three.” The broker, who was among the righteous, said, “The almonds have become worth ninety.” Al-Sari said, “I have concluded a contract I will not dissolve; I will not sell it except for sixty-three.” The broker said, “And I have made a covenant between myself and God not to cheat a Muslim; I will not take it from you except for ninety.” So neither did the broker buy from him, nor did al-Sari sell it. This is pure benevolence from both sides, for it was with knowledge of the true situation.

It is related from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir that he had garments, some worth five and some worth ten. His servant sold in his absence a garment from the five-worth ones for ten. When he learned of it, he searched for that Bedouin buyer the entire day until he found him and said, “The servant made a mistake and sold you what is worth five for ten.” The Bedouin said, “O this one, I am pleased.” He said, “Even if you are pleased, we are not pleased for you except with what we would be pleased for ourselves. So choose one of three options: either take a garment from the ten-worth ones for your money, or we return five to you, or return our garment and take your money.” The Bedouin said, “Give me five,” so he returned five to him, and the Bedouin left asking, “Who is this shaykh?” It was said to him, “This is Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir.” He said, “There is no god but God, this is the one by whom we seek rain in the deserts when drought befalls us.” This is benevolence in not profiting on ten except half or one, according to what is customary for such goods in that place.

Whoever is content with little profit, his transactions multiply, and he gains much profit from their repetition, and thereby blessing becomes manifest. ‘Ali, may God be pleased with him, used to walk in the market of Kufa with a whip, saying, “O assembly of merchants, take what is right and you will be safe; do not reject little profit lest you be deprived of much.” It was said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, may God be pleased with him, “What is the cause

Yasarak said three things: I have never rejected a profit, nor when an animal was requested from me did I delay its sale, nor have I sold on credit. It is said that he sold a thousand camels and profited only from their halters—selling each halter for a dirham, thus gaining a thousand, and from his daily expenses on them he gained another thousand. The second aspect is bearing loss in a purchase. If one buys food from a needy person or something from a poor person, it is permissible to bear a loss and be lenient, thereby doing good and falling under the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him: "May Allah have mercy on a person who is easy in selling, easy in buying." However, if one buys from a wealthy merchant seeking profit beyond his need, bearing loss from him is not praiseworthy but rather a waste of wealth without reward or commendation. Indeed, it has been reported in a hadith from the People of the House: "The one who incurs loss in a purchase is neither praised nor rewarded." The hadith "The one who incurs loss in a purchase is neither praised nor rewarded" was transmitted by al-Tirmidhi al-Hakim in al-Nawadir from the narration of 'Ubayd Allah ibn al-Hasan from his father from his grandfather, and Abu Ya'la narrated it from the hadith of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali, raising it to the Prophet. Al-Dhahabi said it is anomalous. Iyas ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Qurrah, the judge of Basra and among the wise Followers, would say: "I am not cunning, and the cunning cannot deceive me, nor can they deceive Ibn Sirin, but they deceive al-Hasan and deceive my father," meaning Mu'awiyah ibn Qurrah. Perfection lies in neither deceiving nor being deceived, as some described 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: "He was too noble to be deceived and too wise to be deceived." Al-Hasan, al-Husayn, and others among the righteous predecessors would be meticulous in purchasing, yet they would also give away abundant wealth. One of them was asked: "You are meticulous in buying for a small amount, yet you give away much without concern?" He replied: "The giver bestows from his surplus, while the one who incurs loss loses his intellect." Another said: "I only lose my intellect and insight, so I do not allow the deceiver to take from me; and when I give, I give for Allah's sake and do not consider it too much." The third aspect is collecting the price and all debts, and doing good in this sometimes by being forgiving and reducing part, sometimes by granting respite and delay, and sometimes by being lenient in demanding quality currency. All of this is recommended and encouraged. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "May Allah have mercy on a person who is easy in selling, easy in buying, easy in claiming." The hadith "May Allah have mercy on a person who is easy in selling, easy in buying" was mentioned in the previous chapter, so let one seize the supplication of the Messenger, peace be upon him. And he said, peace be upon him: "Be lenient, and you will be shown leniency." The hadith "Be lenient, and you will be shown leniency" was transmitted by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, and its narrators are trustworthy. And he said, peace be upon him: "Whoever grants respite to one in difficulty or forgives him, Allah will account him with an easy account." In another wording: "Allah will shade him under His shade on a day when there is no shade except His." The hadith "Whoever grants respite to one in difficulty or forgives him, Allah will account him with an easy account" and in another wording "Allah will shade him under His shade on a day when there is no shade except His" was narrated by Muslim with the second wording from the hadith of Abu al-Yusr Ka'b ibn 'Amr. And the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, mentioned a man who was wasteful upon himself, was called to account, and no good deed was found for him. It was said to him: "Did you ever do any good?" He said: "No, except that I was a man who would lend to people and say to my agents: 'Forgive the affluent and grant respite to the one in difficulty.'" The hadith mentioning a man who was wasteful upon himself, was called to account, and no good deed was found for him—it was said to him: "Did you ever do any good?" He said: "No, except that I was a man who would lend to people and say to my agents: 'Forgive the affluent'"—the hadith was narrated by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari, and it is agreed upon similarly from the hadith of Hudhayfah. In another wording: "And overlook for the one in difficulty." So Allah said: "We are more deserving of that than him," and Allah overlooked him and forgave him. And he said, peace be upon him: "Whoever lends a dinar for a term, for him is charity every day until its term. And when the term comes due, if he grants respite thereafter, for him every day is charity equal to that debt." The hadith "Whoever lends a dinar for a term, for him is charity every day until its term. And when the term comes due, if he grants respite thereafter, for him every day is charity equal to that debt" was transmitted by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Buraydah: "Whoever grants respite to one in difficulty, for him is charity every day, and whoever grants respite after its term, for him is the like in every day as charity," but its chain is weak. Ahmad and al-Hakim narrated it, and he said it is sound according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs. Some of the predecessors disliked collecting a debt from their debtor because of this report, so that it would be as if they were giving charity with all of it every day. And he said, peace be upon him: "I saw written on the gate of Paradise: 'Charity is multiplied tenfold, and the loan eighteenfold.'" The hadith "I saw written on the gate of Paradise: 'Charity is multiplied tenfold, and the loan eighteenfold'" was transmitted by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain. It was said regarding its meaning that charity falls into the hand of the needy and non-needy, while none bears the humiliation of borrowing except the needy, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, considered...

To a man who was persistently following another due to a debt, he gestured to the creditor with his hand, indicating: "Waive half." So he did. Then he said to the debtor: "Arise and give it to him." This hadith, concerning the gesture to the creditor to waive half, is agreed upon from the narration of Ka'b ibn Malik. And whoever sells something and leaves its price for the time being, without pressing urgently for its demand, is in the meaning of a lender. It is narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri sold his mule for four hundred dirhams. When the payment became due, the buyer said to him: "Be lenient, O Abu Sa'id." He said: "I have deducted one hundred from you." The buyer said: "Be generous, O Abu Sa'id." So he said: "I have gifted you another hundred." Thus, he received two hundred dirhams of his right. It was said to him: "O Abu Sa'id, this is half the price!" He said: "Thus is benevolence; otherwise, it is not." And in the report: "Take your right with sufficiency and chastity, whether sufficient or not, Allah will account you with an easy account." The hadith "Take your right in chastity" was reported by Ibn Majah from the narration of Abu Hurayrah with a good chain, excluding the phrase "Allah will account you with an easy account." A similar version was reported by him, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the narrations of Ibn 'Umar and 'A'ishah.

The fourth aspect concerning the fulfillment of debt, and from benevolence therein, is good repayment. That is by walking to the holder of the right and not burdening him to walk to you to demand it. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The best of you are those best in repaying." This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Whenever one is capable of repaying the debt, let him hasten to it, even before its time, and let him give better than what was stipulated upon him, and be more generous. If he is unable, then let him intend its repayment whenever he is capable. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever incurs a debt intending to repay it, Allah will appoint angels to protect him and supplicate for him until he repays it." This hadith was reported by Ahmad from the narration of 'A'ishah. There is no servant who has an intention to repay his debt except that he has with him assistance and a protector from Allah. In another narration of his: "He will continuously have from Allah a guardian." In a narration by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat: "Except that he has assistance from Allah upon him until He repays it from him." A group of the predecessors would borrow without need because of this report.

Whenever the holder of the right speaks to him with harsh words, let him bear it and meet it with gentleness, following the example of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when a creditor came to him at the due time and its repayment had not been arranged. The man began to speak harshly to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, so his companions became angry with him. He said: "Leave him, for the holder of a right has something to say." This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Whenever discourse occurs between the borrower and the lender, benevolence is that the greater inclination of the mediators be toward the one upon whom is the debt, for the lender lends from sufficiency, and the borrower borrows from need. Likewise, assistance should be more for the buyer, for the seller is eager to be rid of the commodity, seeking its sale, while the buyer is in need of it. This is the best, unless the one upon whom is the debt transgresses his limit; at that point, supporting him is in preventing him from transgression and assisting his companion. For the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or oppressed." It was said: "How do we help him as an oppressor?" He said: "By preventing him from oppression; that is helping him." This hadith is agreed upon from the narration of Anas.

The fifth is to accept the cancellation from one who seeks to cancel, for he only seeks cancellation due to regret and harm from the sale. One should not be pleased for himself to be a cause of harm to his brother. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever cancels the transaction of a regretful person, Allah will cancel his misstep on the Day of Resurrection." This hadith was reported by Abu Dawud and al-Hakim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and he said it is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim, or as he said.

The sixth is to intend in his transactions a group of the poor with deferred payment, while being resolved at the time not to demand from them if ease does not become apparent for them. Indeed, among the righteous predecessors were those who had two ledgers for accounts: one of them titled "Unknown," containing the names of the weak and poor whom he did not know. That is because a poor person would see food or fruit and desire it, so he would say: "I need five pounds, for example, of this, and I do not have its price." He would say: "Take it and pay its price when ease comes." He did not consider this from the choice transactions; rather, he considered from the choice one who did not record his name in the ledger at all, nor made it a debt, but would say: "Take what you want; if ease comes to you, then pay, otherwise you are free from it and in spaciousness." These are the ways of the predecessors' trade, and they have become effaced. The one who upholds it revives this Sunnah. In summary, trade is the crucible of men, and by it a man's religion and piety are tested. Therefore, it is said: "Let not the patched shirt of a man deceive you, nor a garment raised above his ankle, nor a forehead showing the mark of prostration; for at the moment of truth, his true nature is revealed."

The dirham, so observe its excess or its piety. Thus it is said: If a man's neighbors praise him in his residence, his companions on journeys, and those who deal with him in the markets, then have no doubt about his righteousness. A witness once testified before 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, so he said, "Bring me someone who knows you." He brought a man who praised him well. 'Umar said, "Are you his nearest neighbor who knows his comings and goings?" He said, "No." He said, "Were you his companion on a journey, by which noble character is discerned?" He said, "No." He said, "Did you deal with him in dinars and dirhams, by which a man's piety becomes evident?" He said, "No." He said, "I suppose you saw him standing in the mosque, murmuring the Qur'an, lowering his head at times and raising it at others?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Go, for you do not know him." And he said to the man, "Go and bring me someone who knows you."

Chapter Five: On the merchant's concern for his religion in what pertains specifically and generally to his Hereafter. It is not fitting for a merchant to let his livelihood distract him from his ultimate return, lest his life be wasted and his transaction a loss. What he misses of profit in the Hereafter cannot be compensated by what he attains in this world, for he would have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Rather, the wise person ought to have concern for himself, and his concern for himself preserves his capital. His capital is his religion, and his trade is within it. Some of the predecessors said: The thing most worthy of the wise person's attention is what he most needs in the immediate, and what he most needs in the immediate is what has the most praiseworthy outcome in the ultimate. And Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may God be pleased with him, said in his counsel: "You must have your portion in this world, yet you are in greater need of your portion from the Hereafter. So begin with your portion from the Hereafter and take it, for you will pass by your portion from this world and gather it." God Almighty said: "And do not forget your portion of this world"—meaning, do not forget in this world your portion from it for the Hereafter, for it is the planting ground of the Hereafter, and in it good deeds are earned.

The merchant's concern for his religion is perfected by observing seven matters:

The first: Good intention and belief at the outset of trade. Let him intend by it self-sufficiency from begging, restraining greed from people by being content with the lawful apart from them, and using what he earns to aid his religion and provide for his dependents, so that he may be among those who strive with it. Let him intend sincere advice for the Muslims and that he love for all creation what he loves for himself. Let him intend to follow the path of justice and benevolence in his dealings, as we have mentioned. Let him intend enjoining good and forbidding evil in all he sees in the market. If he harbors these beliefs and intentions, he is working on the path of the Hereafter. If he gains wealth, it is an increase; if he loses in this world, he profits in the Hereafter.

The second: That he aim, in his craft or trade, to fulfill one of the collective obligations. For if crafts and trades were abandoned, livelihoods would be ruined and most of creation would perish. The order of the whole is maintained by the cooperation of all, with each group undertaking a task. If all turned to a single craft, the others would be neglected and they would perish. On this basis, some people interpret his saying, peace be upon him: "The difference of opinion within my community is a mercy"—the hadith "The difference of my community is a mercy" was mentioned earlier under knowledge—meaning the difference in their focus on crafts and professions. Among crafts, some are essential and some are dispensable, as they revert to seeking pleasures and adornment in this world. So let him occupy himself with an essential craft, so that by performing it he suffices the Muslims in a matter of religion. Let him avoid the craft of engraving, goldsmithing, erecting buildings with plaster, and all that adorns the world, for all of that is disliked by the people of religion. As for making instruments of amusement and tools whose use is forbidden, avoiding that is from the category of abandoning wrongdoing. Among these is the tailor sewing a *qaba'* from silk for men, and the goldsmith making gold mounts or gold rings for men, for all of that is from sins, and the wage taken for it is unlawful. For that reason we made zakah obligatory on it, even though we do not make zakah obligatory on jewelry, because if intended for men it is forbidden, and its being prepared for women does not affiliate it with permissible jewelry unless that is intended for it, so its ruling is derived from the intention. We have mentioned that selling food and selling shrouds is disliked because it causes waiting for people's death and their need with price inflation. It is disliked to be a butcher due to the hardness of heart it involves, and to be a cupper or a cleaner due to association with impurity, and likewise tanning and similar trades. Ibn Sirin disliked brokerage, and Qatadah disliked the broker's fee, perhaps because the broker can scarcely do without lying and excessive praise of the commodity to promote it, and because the work in it is not fixed—it may be little or much—and the fee is not considered according to his work but according to the value of the garment; this is the custom and it is unjust. Rather, one should consider the amount of effort. They disliked buying animals for trade because the buyer dislikes God's decree concerning it, which is death, for which purpose it is not...

It is inevitable and its occurrence is said to be like selling living animals and buying dead ones, and they disliked currency exchange because avoiding subtle forms of usury in it is difficult, and because it involves seeking subtle qualities in things whose specific identities are not intended, only their marketability is intended. Rarely does a money-changer achieve profit except by relying on the ignorance of his counterpart regarding the subtleties of currency, so a money-changer seldom remains safe even if he is cautious. It is disliked for a money-changer and others to break sound dirhams and dinars except when doubting their quality or out of necessity. Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God have mercy on him, mentioned a prohibition from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him—the hadith prohibiting breaking the dinar and dirham—narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim from the narration of 'Alqamah ibn 'Abd Allah from his father, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade breaking the currency of the Muslims that is valid among them except due to defect. Al-Hakim added: breaking the dirham to make it silver and breaking the dinar to make it gold, but Ibn Hibban weakened it. And from his companions regarding goldsmithing from the sound narrations: I dislike breaking. And he said: One buys dirhams with dinars, then buys gold with the dirham and fashions it. They preferred the trade of cloth. Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab said: No trade is more beloved to me than cloth, provided there are no oaths involved. And it has been narrated: The best of your trade is cloth, and the best of your crafts is beadwork. The hadith "The best of your trade is cloth, and the best of your crafts is beadwork"—I have not found a chain for it. The author of al-Firdaws mentioned it from the hadith of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. And in another hadith: If the people of Paradise were to trade, they would trade in cloth, and if the people of Hell were to trade, they would trade in currency exchange. The hadith "If the people of Paradise were to trade, they would trade in cloth, and if the people of Hell were to trade, they would trade in currency exchange"—narrated by Abu Mansur al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with a weak chain. And Abu Ya'la and al-'Uqayli in al-Du'afa' narrated the first part from the hadith of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq. The predominant occupations of the righteous predecessors were ten crafts: beadwork, trade, transport, tailoring, cobbling, plastering, making shoes, ironwork, making spindles, treating game from land and sea, and bookbinding. 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Warraq said: Ahmad ibn Hanbal said to me: What is your craft? I said: Bookbinding. He said: A good earning. If I were to work with my hands, I would do your craft. Then he said to me: Do not write except in the middle, and leave the margins and the backs of pages. Four types of craftsmen are marked among people with weak judgment: weavers, cotton carders, spindle makers, and teachers. Perhaps that is because most of their interaction is with women and children, and interacting with those of weak intellect weakens the intellect, just as interacting with the intelligent increases intellect. And from Mujahid: Maryam, peace be upon her, passed by weavers in her search for 'Isa, peace be upon him, and asked for the way, but they directed her to the wrong path. She said: O God, remove blessing from their earnings and make them die poor and belittle them in the eyes of people. Her supplication was answered. The predecessors disliked taking wages for everything that is of the category of acts of worship and collective obligations, such as washing the dead and burying them, and likewise the call to prayer and Tarawih prayers, even if the ruling permits hiring for it, and likewise teaching the Qur'an and teaching religious knowledge. For these are works whose right is to be performed for the Hereafter, and taking wages for them is exchanging the worldly for the Hereafter, and that is not recommended. The third is that the market of this world should not prevent one from the market of the Hereafter. The markets of the Hereafter are the mosques. God Almighty says: "Men whom neither trade nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God and the performance of prayer and the giving of zakah." And God Almighty says regarding houses which God has permitted to be raised and wherein His name is remembered. Thus, one should make the beginning of the day until the time of entering the market for his Hereafter, so he adheres to the mosque and is diligent in regular devotions. 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, used to say to merchants: Make the beginning of your day for your Hereafter and what follows for your worldly life. The righteous predecessors would make the beginning and end of the day for the Hereafter and the middle for trade. None would sell porridge and heads early in the morning except boys and non-Muslims, because they were in the mosques afterward. And in the report: When the angels ascend with the record of a servant, and in it at the beginning of the day and its end is the remembrance of God and good, God covers for him the evil deeds between them. The hadith: When the angels ascend with the record of a servant, and at the beginning of the day and its end is remembrance and good, God covers what is between them of evil deeds—narrated by Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain in meaning. And in the report: The angels of the night and the angels of the day meet at the break of dawn and at the 'Asr prayer, and God says—and He knows best about them—How did you leave My servants? They say: We left them while they were praying, and we came to them while they were praying. Then God, glorified and exalted, says: I call you to witness that I have forgiven them. The hadith: The angels of the night and the angels of the day meet...

At the break of dawn and during the Asr prayer, Allah—and He knows best—says, "How have you left My servants?" This hadith, agreed upon and narrated by Abu Hurairah, states: "Angels take turns among you by night and by day, and they gather at the Fajr and Asr prayers." Then, whenever one hears the call to prayer in the middle of the day for Zuhr or for Asr, one should not linger over any task but should stir from one's place and abandon all that one was engaged in. For the merit of the first takbir with the imam at the beginning of the prayer time is such that the entire world and all it contains cannot equal it. Whoever fails to attend the congregation has, according to some scholars, committed a sin. The early generations would hasten at the call to prayer, leaving the markets to children and non-Muslims, and they would hire people for small wages to guard the shops during prayer times—this was their livelihood. In the interpretation of Allah's words, "whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah," it is said they were blacksmiths and cobblers; when one of them raised his hammer or inserted his awl and heard the call to prayer, he would not withdraw the awl from its place nor bring down the hammer, but would cast it aside and rise to pray. Fourthly, one should not limit oneself to this but should persist in remembering Allah Almighty in the market and occupy oneself with declaring His oneness and glorifying Him. Remembering Allah in the market among the heedless is superior. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The one who remembers Allah among the heedless is like a fighter behind those who flee, and like the living among the dead." In another wording: "Like a green tree amidst dry brush." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever enters the market and says, 'There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner; to Him belongs dominion and praise; He gives life and causes death; He is Ever-Living and does not die; in His hand is all good, and He is over all things competent,' Allah will write for him a million good deeds." This hadith has preceded in the section on remembrances. Ibn 'Umar, Salim ibn 'Abdullah, Muhammad ibn Wasil, and others would enter the market intending to attain the merit of this remembrance. Al-Hasan said: "The one who remembers Allah in the market will come on the Day of Resurrection with a light like the light of the moon and a proof like the proof of the sun." And whoever seeks Allah's forgiveness in the market, Allah will forgive him according to the number of its people. 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, when entering the market, would say: "O Allah, I seek refuge in You from disbelief and disobedience, and from the evil that the market encompasses. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from a false oath and a losing transaction." Abu Ja'far al-Farghani said: "We were once with al-Junayd, and mention was made of people who sit in mosques, imitating the Sufis, falling short of what is required of them in the right of sitting there, and criticizing those who enter the market. Al-Junayd said: 'How many are there in the market whose rightful place is to enter the mosque, take some of those inside by the ear, bring them out, and sit in their place? Indeed, I know a man who enters the market and his daily routine is three hundred rak'ahs and thirty thousand glorifications.'" It occurred to me that he meant himself. Thus was the trade of those who trade to seek sufficiency, not for indulgence in this world. For whoever seeks the world to aid him in the Hereafter, how could he abandon the profit of the Hereafter? The market, the mosque, and the home are of one ruling for him; salvation lies only in piety. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Fear Allah wherever you are." This hadith was reported by al-Tirmidhi from Abu Dharr and he authenticated it. The duty of piety does not cease for those devoted to religion, however their circumstances may change; through it is their life and their living, for in it they see their trade and profit. It has been said: "Whoever loves the Hereafter lives, and whoever loves this world is bewildered. The fool goes to and fro in nothingness, and the wise one is concerned with his own faults." Fifthly, one should not be intensely greedy for the market and trade, such as being the first to enter and the last to leave, or by sailing the sea for trade—both are disliked. It is said that whoever sails the sea has gone to extremes in seeking provision. In a report: "None should sail the sea except for Hajj, 'Umrah, or jihad." This was reported by Abu Dawud from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr, and it is said to be interrupted. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "Do not be the first to enter the market nor the last to leave it, for therein Satan lays his eggs and hatches them." It is narrated from Mu'adh ibn Jabal and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar that Iblis says to his offspring, "Zalnibur, go with your troops to the people of the markets; adorn for them falsehood, swearing, deceit, cunning, and treachery, and be with the first to enter and the last to leave them." In a report: "The worst of places are the markets, and the worst of their people are the first to enter and the last to leave." The beginning of this hadith has preceded in the sixth chapter of the Book of Knowledge. Abu Nu'aym reported in the book "The Sanctity of Mosques," from Ibn 'Abbas: "The most hated places to Allah are the markets."

And the most detested of its people to God are the first to enter and the last to leave. The completion of this precaution is to monitor the time of one's sufficiency, so when the sufficiency for his time is attained, he departs and busies himself with the trade of the Hereafter. Thus were the righteous predecessors: among them was he who, if he profited a single daniq, would depart content with it. Hammad ibn Salamah used to sell silk from a basket before him, and if he profited two grains, he would lift his basket and depart. Ibrahim ibn Bishar said: I said to Ibrahim ibn Adham, may God have mercy on him, "Shall I work in clay today?" He replied, "O son of Bishar, you are a seeker and are sought. He who seeks you does not miss, and you seek what you have already been provided for. Have you not seen the eager one deprived and the weak one sustained?" I said, "I have a daniq with the grocer." He said, "It is grievous upon you that you possess a daniq and yet seek work." Among them were those who would depart after noon, and among them after the afternoon, and among them were those who would not work in the week except for one or two days, and they would suffice with that. The sixth is not to restrict oneself to avoiding the unlawful, but to be wary of the places of suspicions and the grounds of doubt, and not to look to legal verdicts, but to consult his heart. If he finds in it any unease, he avoids it. And if a commodity is brought to him whose matter troubles him, he inquires about it until he knows, otherwise he consumes the doubtful. There was brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, some milk, and he said, "From where do you have this?" They said, "From the sheep." He said, "And from where do you have this sheep?" It was said, "From such-and-such a place." So he drank from it, then said, "We, the company of prophets, have been commanded not to eat except what is good and not to act except righteously." The narration of his asking about the milk and the sheep and his saying, "We, the company of prophets, have been commanded not to eat except what is good and not to act except righteously," was narrated by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Umm 'Abdillah, the sister of Shaddad ibn Aws, with a weak chain. And he said, "Indeed God Almighty commanded the believers with what He commanded the messengers, saying, 'O you who believe, eat from the good things We have provided you.'" The hadith, "Indeed God commanded the believers with what He commanded the messengers," was reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, asked about the origin of the thing and the origin of its origin, and did not go beyond that because what lies beyond that is difficult. We will clarify in the Book of the Lawful and the Unlawful the place of the obligation of this inquiry, for he, peace and blessings be upon him, would not ask about everything brought to him. The hadith, "He would not ask about everything brought to him," was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Jabir that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and his companions passed by a woman, and she slaughtered a sheep for them... the hadith... so the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, took a morsel but could not swallow it, and said, "This is a sheep slaughtered without the permission of its owners"... the hadith. And he has from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, "When food was brought to him from other than his household, he would ask about it"... the hadith, and their chains are good. In this is that he would not ask about what was brought from his own household, and God knows best. Rather, it is obligatory for the merchant to look at whom he deals with. Everyone attributed to oppression, treachery, theft, or usury, he does not deal with them. Likewise, the soldiers and the oppressors, he does not deal with them at all, nor does he deal with their companions and helpers, because he is thereby an aider in oppression. It is related from a man that he undertook the construction of a wall for a frontier post. He said, "Something occurred to my heart about that, even though that work is among good deeds, indeed among the obligations of Islam, but the commander who was in charge in his locality was from the oppressors." He said, "So I asked Sufyan, may God be pleased with him, and he said, 'Do not be an aider for them in little or much.' I said, 'This is a wall in the path of God for the Muslims.' He said, 'Yes, but the least that befalls you is that you love their continuation so they may pay you your wage, and thus you have loved the continuation of one who disobeys God.'" And it has come in the report, "Whoever supplicates for an oppressor to remain has loved that God be disobeyed in His earth." The hadith, "Whoever supplicates for an oppressor to remain has loved that God be disobeyed in His earth," I have not found it raised to the Prophet; rather, Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it in the Book of Silence from the saying of al-Hasan. The author mentioned it thus correctly in the Afflictions of the Tongue. And in the hadith, "Indeed God becomes angry when the corrupt is praised." The hadith, "Indeed God becomes angry when the corrupt is praised," was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in al-Samt, Ibn 'Adi in al-Kamil, Abu Ya'la, and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Anas with a weak chain. And in another hadith, "Whoever honors a corrupt person has aided in demolishing Islam." The hadith, "Whoever honors a corrupt person has aided in demolishing Islam," is rare with this wording, and the well-known is, "Whoever honors an innovator..." The hadith was narrated by Ibn 'Adi from the hadith of 'A'ishah, and al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, and Abu Nu'aym in al-Hilyah from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Yasar with weak chains. Ibn al-Jawzi said, "All of them are fabricated." Sufyan entered upon al-Mahdi while he had a white scroll in his hand. He said, "O Sufyan, give me the inkwell so I may write." He said, "Tell me what you are writing, for if it is truth, I will give it to you." And some ruler requested from some of the scholars imprisoned with him...

He asked to be handed clay to seal the book, but he said, "Hand me the book first so I may see what is in it." Thus were they cautious against aiding the oppressors and dealing with them, which is the most severe form of assistance, so people of faith should avoid it whenever they find a way. In summary, people should be divided in his view into those with whom one deals and those with whom one does not, and let those with whom he deals be fewer than those with whom he does not in this time.

Some of them said: There came upon people a time when a man would enter the market and say, "Whom do you see fit for me to deal with among the people?" and it would be said to him, "Deal with whomever you wish." Then came another time when they would say, "Deal with whomever you wish except so-and-so and so-and-so." Then came another time when it would be said, "Do not deal with anyone except so-and-so and so-and-so." And I fear that a time will come when even this will vanish, and it is as if what he feared has come to pass. Indeed, to God we belong and to Him we return.

Seventhly, he should monitor all the channels of his dealings with any one of those he deals with, for he is observed and will be held accountable. So let him prepare an answer for the Day of Reckoning and Punishment for every deed and word: Why did I undertake it and for what purpose? For it is said that the merchant will be made to stand on the Day of Resurrection with every man to whom he sold something, standing him up and being questioned about each one, so he is accountable for the number of those he dealt with. Some of them said: I saw some merchants in a dream and said, "What has God done with you?" He said, "Spread before me were fifty thousand scrolls." I said, "Are all these sins?" He said, "These are the dealings with people, according to the number of every person I dealt with in the world. For each person there is a separate scroll detailing what transpired between me and him from the beginning of our dealings to their end."

This is what is incumbent upon the earner in his work: justice, benevolence, and compassion for the faith. If he confines himself to justice, he is among the righteous; if he adds to it benevolence, he is among the drawn near; and if he observes along with that the duties of religion as mentioned in the fifth chapter, he is among the truthful. God knows best what is correct. The Book of Earning and Livelihood is completed, by the praise of God and His grace.
