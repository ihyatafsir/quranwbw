The Book of Fear and Hope
This is the Third Book of the Quarter of Deliverances from The Revival of the Religious Sciences.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to God, whose kindness and reward are hoped for, and whose severity and punishment are feared; who has filled the hearts of His close friends with the spirit of hope for Him, so that He guided them by the subtleties of His blessings to alight in His nearness and turn away from the abode of His tribulation, which is the dwelling place of His enemies; and who has driven the faces of those who turn away from His presence with the lashes of intimidation and His stern rebuke towards the abode of His reward and honor, preventing them from confronting His leaders and exposing themselves to His wrath and vengeance; guiding the various kinds of creation with the chains of overpowering force and severity, and with the reins of gentleness and kindness, to His Paradise. And prayers and peace be upon Muhammad, the master of His prophets and the best of His creation, and upon his family, his companions, and his progeny.
To proceed: Hope and fear are two wings with which those drawn near fly to every praiseworthy station, and two mounts with which one traverses from the paths of the Hereafter every formidable obstacle. One cannot be led to the nearness of the Most Merciful and the spirit of the Gardens, despite being of vast aspirations, burdened with heavy loads, and parched by the heart's aversions and the limbs' hardships, except by the reins of hope. Nor can one be turned away from the fire of Hell and the painful punishment, despite being surrounded by the subtleties of desires and the wonders of pleasures, except by the lashes of intimidation and the blows of severity. It is therefore necessary to clarify their true nature, their virtue, and the way to achieve a combination of them despite their opposition and mutual contradiction. We will combine their mention in one book comprising two parts: the first part concerning hope, and the second part concerning fear. As for the first part, it contains an explanation of the true nature of hope, an explanation of the virtue of hope, and an explanation of the remedy for hope and the ways by which hope is attained.

(Explanation of the True Nature of Hope)
Know that hope is among the stations of the wayfarers and the states of the seekers. A quality is called a 'station' when it is established and abiding, and it is called a 'state' when it is transient and quick to vanish. Just as yellowness is divided into that which is permanent, like the yellowness of gold; that which is quick to vanish, like the pallor of fear; and that which is between them, like the pallor of the sick; similarly, the qualities of the heart are divided into these categories. That which is not established is called a 'state' because it changes in proximity. This applies to every quality among the qualities of the heart. Our focus now is the true nature of hope. Hope, too, is completed by a state, knowledge, and action. Knowledge is a cause that yields the state, and the state necessitates action. Hope is a name encompassing all three. Its explanation is that everything you encounter, whether disliked or beloved, is divided into that which is present now, that which existed in the past, and that which is awaited in the future. If something that existed in the past occurs to your mind, it is called remembrance and recollection. If something present now occurs to your heart, it is called feeling, tasting, and perception. It is called 'feeling' because it is a state you find within yourself. If the existence of something in the future occurs to your mind and dominates your heart, it is called anticipation and expectation. If what is anticipated is disliked, resulting in pain in the heart, it is called fear and dread. If it is beloved, then from its anticipation, the heart's attachment to it, and the occurrence of its existence to the mind, a pleasure and comfort arise in the heart. That comfort is called hope. Thus, hope is the heart's comfort in anticipating what is beloved to it. However, that beloved, anticipated thing must have a cause. If the anticipation is due to the attainment of most of its causes, then hope for it is true. If that anticipation is while its causes are lacking and disturbed, then the name of delusion and folly is more fitting for it than the name of hope. If the causes are not known to exist nor known to be absent, then the name of wishful thinking is more fitting for its anticipation, because it is anticipation without a cause. In any case, the names of hope and fear are only applied to that which is uncertain. As for that which is certain, no, for one does not say, "I hope for the sun to rise at the time of its rising," or "I fear its setting at the time of its setting," because that is certain. Indeed, one says, "I hope for rain to fall," and "I fear its cessation." The possessors of hearts know that this world is the cultivation field for the Hereafter. The heart is like the earth, faith is like the seed within it, and acts of obedience function like tilling and purifying the land, and like digging canals and channeling water to it. The heart that is heedless in this world, completely absorbed by it, is like saline land in which seed does not grow. The Day of Resurrection is the day of harvest, and no one reaps except what he has sown, and no crop grows except from a seed. Faith does not grow with the corruption of the heart and the evil of its character, just as seed does not grow in saline land. Therefore, the servant's hope for forgiveness should be measured against the hope of the cultivator. For whoever seeks fertile land, casts into it good seed that is not rotten nor worm-eaten, then supplies it with what it needs...

He who channels water to his field at its proper times, then clears the thorns from the earth, the weeds, and everything that prevents the growth of the seed or corrupts it, then sits awaiting from the bounty of God—the repelling of destructive lightning blights and calamities—until the crop is complete and reaches its goal: his awaiting is named 'hope.' But if he scatters the seed in hard, barren, elevated ground where water does not flow, and does not occupy himself at all with tending to the seed, then expects a harvest from it: his awaiting is named folly and delusion, not hope. And if he scatters the seed in good earth, but it has no water, and he begins awaiting rainwater where rains are neither predominant nor entirely withheld: his awaiting is named wishful thinking, not hope. Therefore, the name 'hope' is only truthful for awaiting a beloved outcome when all its causes that fall within the servant's choice have been prepared, and nothing remains except what does not fall within his choice—which is the bounty of God in averting obstacles and corruptions. Thus, when the servant sows the seed of faith, waters it with the water of obedience, purifies the heart from the thorns of vile character traits, and awaits from the bounty of God his steadfastness in that until death and a good ending leading to forgiveness: his awaiting is true, praiseworthy hope in itself, spurring him to persevere in fulfilling the requirements of faith's causes to complete the causes of forgiveness until death. But if he cuts off his tending to the seed of faith with the water of obedience and leaves the heart laden with base character traits, immersing himself in pursuing worldly pleasures, then expects forgiveness: his awaiting is folly and delusion. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said: "The fool is he who follows his soul's desires and expects Paradise from God." And God Almighty said: "But there succeeded after them a generation who neglected prayer and pursued lusts; so they will meet perdition." And He said: "Then there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Book, taking the fleeting gains of this lower world and saying, 'It will be forgiven us.'" And God Almighty censured the owner of the garden when he entered it and said: "I do not think this will ever perish, nor do I think the Hour will come. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find a better resort than this." Therefore, the servant who strives in obedience and abstains from sins is truly deserving to await from God's bounty the completion of favor—and the completion of favor is nothing but entry into Paradise. As for the sinner, if he repents and makes up for all the shortcomings he has neglected, he is truly deserving to hope for the acceptance of repentance. But before repentance, if he is averse to sin—the evil deed displeases him and the good deed pleases him, he censures and blames himself, and he desires and yearns for repentance—he is truly deserving to hope from God for success in repentance, because his aversion to sin and his eagerness for repentance function as a cause that may lead to repentance. As for hope after the causes are firmly established, for that reason God Almighty said: "Indeed, those who have believed and emigrated and striven in the cause of God—those hope for the mercy of God." Its meaning is: those deserve to hope for God's mercy. He did not intend to specify the existence of hope, for others may also hope, but He specified them as deserving hope. As for one who immerses himself in what God Almighty dislikes, does not censure himself for it, and does not resolve to repent and return: his hope for forgiveness is folly, like the hope of one who scatters seed in barren ground and resolves not to tend it with watering or clearing. Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "The greatest delusion in my view is persisting in sins while hoping for pardon without remorse, expecting nearness to God Almighty without obedience, awaiting the planting of Paradise with the seed of Hell, seeking the abode of the obedient through disobedience, expecting reward without action, and making wishes upon God, the Mighty and Majestic, with excess:

    You hope for salvation but do not tread its paths;
    Indeed, the ship does not sail upon dry land."

So when you know the reality of hope and its proper place, you have learned that it is a state produced by knowledge that most causes are in motion. This state produces the effort to undertake the remaining causes to the extent possible. For whoever sows good seed, whose earth is fertile and whose water is abundant, his hope is true. Thus, his true hope continually drives him to inspect the earth, tend to it, and remove every weed that grows therein, never ceasing to tend it at all until the time of harvest. This is because hope is opposed by despair, and despair prevents tending. For whoever knows that the earth is barren, that water is scarce, and that the seed will not grow, will inevitably abandon inspecting the earth and toiling in its care. Hope is praiseworthy because it is a motivator; despair is blameworthy, being its opposite, because it diverts from work. Fear is not the opposite of hope; rather, it is its companion, as will be explained later. Indeed, it is another motivator by way of dread, just as hope is a motivator by way of desire. Therefore, the state of hope begets prolonged striving through deeds and perseverance in obedience, however circumstances may change. Among its effects is finding delight in the continuity of worship.

Turning to God Almighty, delighting in intimate communion with Him, and being gentle in seeking His favor—these states inevitably manifest in anyone who hopes for a king among kings or a person among people. How then could this not appear in relation to God Almighty? If it does not appear, let it be taken as evidence of deprivation from the station of hope and a descent into the abyss of delusion and wishful thinking. This is the explanation of the state of hope, the knowledge it yields, and the works cultivated from it. Its bearing fruit in these actions is indicated by the hadith of Zayd al-Khayl, who said to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him): "I have come to ask you about God’s sign in one who is not intended [for good] and His sign in one who is intended." He said: "How have you become?" He replied: "I have become loving good and its people, and when I am able to do something of it, I hasten to it, certain of its reward; and when something of it escapes me, I grieve for it and yearn for it." He said: "This is God’s sign in one who is intended. Had He intended you for the other, He would have prepared you for it, then He would not care in which valley you perished." He (peace be upon him) mentioned the sign of one intended for good. So whoever hopes to be intended for good without these signs is deluded.

(Explanation of the Virtue of Hope and Encouragement in It)

Know that acting upon hope is higher than acting upon fear, for the closest of servants to God Almighty are the most loving of Him, and love overcomes hope. Consider this with two servants of a king: one serves out of fear of his punishment, the other out of hope for his reward. For this reason, incentives regarding hope and good expectation have been conveyed, especially at the time of death. God Almighty says: "Do not despair of God’s mercy" (Qur’an 39:53), thus prohibiting the root of despair. In the accounts of Jacob (peace be upon him), God Almighty revealed to him: "Do you know why I separated you from Joseph? Because you said, ‘I fear the wolf may eat him while you are heedless of him.’ Why did you fear the wolf and not hope in Me? Why did you look to the heedlessness of his brothers and not to My preservation of him?" And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Let none of you die except while having a good expectation of God Almighty." And he (peace be upon him) said: "God Almighty says: ‘I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think of Me what he will.’" And he (peace be upon him) entered upon a man in his death throes and said: "How do you find yourself?" He said: "I find myself fearing my sins and hoping for my Lord’s mercy." He said: "These two do not gather in a servant’s heart at this moment except that God gives him what he hopes and secures him from what he fears." And Ali (may God be pleased with him) said to a man whom fear had driven to despair due to his many sins: "O you, your despair of God’s mercy is greater than your sins." And Sufyan said: "Whoever commits a sin but knows that God Almighty decreed it for him and hopes for His forgiveness, God will forgive his sin." He said: "Because God Almighty reproached a people, saying: ‘That was your assumption which you assumed about your Lord; it has ruined you’ (Qur’an 41:23)." And He Almighty said: "And you assumed an evil assumption and became a ruined people" (Qur’an 48:12). And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "God Almighty will say to a servant on the Day of Resurrection: ‘What prevented you, when you saw evil, from denouncing it?’ If God prompts him with an excuse, he will say: ‘O Lord, I hoped in You and feared the people.’ Then God will say: ‘I have forgiven you.’" In the authentic report: "A man used to lend to people, being lenient with the well-off and overlooking the hardship of the insolvent. He met God without having done any good deed. God Almighty said: ‘Who is more deserving of that than Us?’" So He pardoned him due to his good expectation and hope that He would forgive him, despite his bankruptcy in good deeds. And God Almighty says: "Indeed, those who recite the Book of God and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided them, secretly and openly, hope for a trade that will never perish" (Qur’an 35:29). And when the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, and you would go out to the high places beating your chests and fleeing to your Lord," Gabriel (peace be upon him) descended and said: "Your Lord says to you: ‘Why do you cause My servants to despair?’" So he went out to them, giving them hope and longing. In the report: "God Almighty revealed to David (peace be upon him): ‘Love Me and love those who love Me, and make Me beloved to My creation.’ He said: ‘O Lord, how do I make You beloved to Your creation?’ He said: ‘Remind them of the beautiful good, and remind them of My blessings and My favor, for they know nothing from Me except beauty.’" And Aban ibn Abi ‘Ayyash was seen in a dream—he used to frequently mention the doors of hope—and he said: "God Almighty stood me before Him and said: ‘What compelled you to that?’ I said: ‘I wanted to make You beloved to Your creation.’ He said: ‘I have forgiven you.’" And Yahya ibn Aktham was seen after his death in a dream, and it was said to him: "What did God do with you?" He said: "God stood me before Him and said: ‘O evil old man, you did such and such.’ Terror seized me as only God knows, then I said: ‘O Lord, this is not how I was told about You.’ He said: ‘And what were you told about Me?’ I said: ‘Abd al-Razzaq narrated to me from Ma‘mar from al-Zuhri from Anas from Your Prophet (peace be upon him) from Gabriel (peace be upon him) that You said: "I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think of Me what he will." And I used to think of You that You would not punish me.’ God Almighty said: ‘Gabriel spoke truthfully, and My Prophet spoke truthfully, and Anas spoke truthfully, and al-Zuhri spoke truthfully, and Ma‘mar spoke truthfully, and ‘Abd al-Razzaq spoke truthfully, and you have thought well. I have forgiven you.’"

Ma'mar spoke truthfully, and 'Abd al-Razzaq spoke truthfully. He said: Then I was clothed and walked, with youths preceding me, to Paradise. So I exclaimed, "O what joy is this!" And in the report: "A man from the Children of Israel used to make people despair and impose severity upon them. So Allah, exalted is He, will say to him on the Day of Resurrection: 'Today I shall withhold you from My mercy, just as you used to make My servants despair of it.'" And He, peace be upon him, said: "A man will enter the Fire and remain therein for a thousand years, calling out, 'O Most Compassionate, O Bestower of Favors!' Then Allah, exalted is He, will say to Gabriel: 'Go and bring My servant to Me.' So he will come with him and present him before his Lord. Allah, exalted is He, will say: 'How did you find your place?' He will say: 'The worst of places.' He will say: 'Return him to his place.' So he will walk, turning to look behind him. Allah, mighty and majestic, will say: 'To what are you turning your gaze?' He will say: 'I had hoped You would not return me to it after You had brought me out from it.' Allah, exalted is He, will say: 'Take him to Paradise.'" This indicates that his hope was the cause of his salvation. We ask Allah for good success through His gentleness and generosity.

(Clarifying the Remedy of Hope and the Path by Which the State of Hope is Attained and Predominates)

Know that this remedy is needed by one of two types of men: either a man upon whom despair has predominated, so he has abandoned worship; or a man upon whom fear has predominated, so he has overdone persistence in worship until he has harmed himself and his family. These are two men who have deviated from moderation to the two extremes of excess and neglect, so they need a treatment that returns them to moderation. As for the disobedient, deluded one who entertains hopes from Allah while turning away from worship and plunging into sins, the remedies of hope become deadly poisons in his case and take the place of honey, which is a cure for one overcome by cold, but is a deadly poison for one overcome by heat. Indeed, for the deluded one, nothing should be applied in his case except the remedies of fear and the means that incite it. Therefore, the admonisher of creation must be gentle, looking to the sites of ailments, treating each ailment with what counteracts it, not with what increases it. For what is sought is justice and moderation in all attributes and character traits, and the best of matters are their middle courses. If one exceeds the middle course to one of the two extremes, he is treated with what returns him to the middle, not with what increases his deviation from it. This era is an era in which the means of hope should not be employed with people; rather, even exaggeration in frightening them scarcely returns them to the path of truth and the way of correctness. As for mentioning the means of hope, it would destroy them and ruin them completely. But since it is lighter upon hearts and more pleasing to souls, and since the aim of admonishers is only to win over hearts and elicit praise from people however they may be, they have inclined toward hope until corruption has increased in corruption and those immersed in their rebellion have increased in persistence. 'Ali, may Allah honor his countenance, said: "The true scholar is he who does not make people despair of Allah's mercy, nor make them feel secure from Allah's plan." And we mention the means of hope to be used for the one in despair or for the one upon whom fear has predominated, following the Book of Allah, exalted is He, and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace be upon him, for they both encompass fear and hope together, because they comprise the means of healing for the various types of patients, so that the scholars—who are the heirs of the prophets—may use them according to need, like the usage of the skilled physician, not the usage of the incompetent one who thinks every one of the remedies is suitable for every patient however he may be. And the state of hope is made to predominate by two things: one is reflection, and the other is the inductive study of verses, reports, and traditions. As for reflection, it is to contemplate all that we have mentioned concerning the varieties of blessings in the Book of Gratitude, so that when he knows the subtleties of Allah's blessings upon His servants in this world and the wonders of His wisdom which He observed in the nature of man—to the extent that He prepared for him in this world everything that is essential for his continued existence, like the instruments for nourishment; and what he is in need of, like fingers and nails; and what is an adornment for him, like the arching of the eyebrows, the differing colors of the eyes, the redness of the lips, and other such things, the loss of which would not impair a purposeful aim but would only cause the loss of an advantage of beauty—then if the divine care has not been lacking toward His servants in such minute details, to the point that He was not pleased for His servants to lose the enhancements and advantages in adornment and need, how could He be pleased to lead them to eternal destruction? Rather, if a person looks with a penetrating gaze, he knows that for most of creation the means of happiness in this world have been prepared, to the extent that he dislikes transfer from this world by death, even if informed that he will not be punished after death at all, for example, or that he will not be resurrected at all. Their dislike of non-existence is only because the means of blessings are overwhelmingly predominant, without doubt. Indeed, he who wishes for death is rare, and even then he only wishes it in a rare circumstance and a sudden, strange occurrence. So if the state of most of creation in this world is predominantly...

Goodness and safety are the established way of God; you will find no alteration for it. Thus, it is most likely that the matter of the Hereafter will be so, because the Manager of this world and the next is One, and He is Forgiving, Merciful, Kind to His servants, and Compassionate toward them. When this is contemplated with true reflection, it strengthens the causes for hope. Another point for consideration is looking into the wisdom of the Sacred Law and its established way concerning the benefits of this world and the aspect of mercy for the servants within it, to the extent that some of the knowers of God considered the verse on debt in Surah al-Baqarah as one of the strongest causes for hope. When asked, "What in it is a cause for hope?" he replied, "This entire world is little, and a person's provision from it is little, and a debt is a small portion of his provision. So consider how God, exalted is He, revealed therein the longest verse, to guide His servant to the path of precaution in safeguarding his debt. How then would He not safeguard his religion, for which there is no substitute?"

The Second Category: Surveying the Qur'anic verses and reports. What has been conveyed concerning hope is beyond enumeration. As for the verses, God, exalted is He, has said: "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'" And in the recitation of God's Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him: "and He does not mind; indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful." And God, exalted is He, said: "And the angels exalt with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth." And God, exalted is He, informed that the Fire He prepared for His enemies, and He only frightens His allies with it, saying: "For them will be layers of Fire above them and layers beneath them. By that God warns His servants." And God, exalted is He, said: "And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers." And God, exalted is He, said: "So I have warned you of a Fire which blazes fiercely. None will burn in it except the most wretched, who denied and turned away." And God, the Almighty, said: "And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing." And it is said: "The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not cease asking for his community until it was said to him, 'Are you not satisfied when this verse has been revealed to you: "And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing"?'" And in the interpretation of His saying, exalted is He: "And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied," it was said: "Muhammad will not be satisfied, nor will any one of his community be in the Fire." And Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Ali used to say: "You, the people of Iraq, say the most hopeful verse in the Book of God, the Almighty, is His saying: 'Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God."' As for us, the People of the Household, we say the most hopeful verse in the Book of God, exalted is He, is His saying: 'And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.'"

As for the reports: Abu Musa reported from him, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "My community is a community shown mercy; there is no punishment for it in the Hereafter. God hastened its punishment in this world through earthquakes and tribulations. So when the Day of Resurrection comes, a man from the People of the Book will be handed over to every man of my community, and it will be said: 'This is your ransom from the Fire.'" In another wording: "Every man from this community will come with a Jew or a Christian to Hellfire and say, 'This is my ransom from the Fire,' and he will be cast into it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Fever is from the breath of Hellfire, and it is the believer's share of the Fire." And it is reported in the interpretation of His saying, exalted is He: "The Day when God will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him," that God, exalted is He, revealed to His Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "I am making the reckoning of your community your responsibility." He said, "No, my Lord, You are more merciful to them than I." So He said, "Then We will not disgrace you concerning them." And it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, asked his Lord concerning the sins of his community, saying: "O Lord, make their reckoning fall to me, so that none other than I may see their faults." So God, exalted is He, revealed to him: "They are your community, and they are My servants, and I am more merciful to them than you. I will not make their reckoning fall to anyone other than Me, so that neither you nor anyone else may look upon their faults." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "My life is a good for you, and my death is a good for you. As for my life, I establish for you the practices and legislate for you the laws. As for my death, your deeds will be presented to me, so whatever I see of them as good, I praise God for it, and whatever I see of them as bad, I seek forgiveness from God, exalted is He, for you." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "One day he said, 'O Most Generous in pardoning,' so Gabriel, peace be upon him, said, 'Do you know the interpretation of "O Most Generous in pardoning"? It is that if He pardons bad deeds by His mercy, He replaces them with good deeds by His generosity.'" And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, heard a man saying, "O God, I ask You for the perfection of blessing." He said, "Do you know what the perfection of blessing is?" The man said, "No." He said, "It is entry into Paradise." The scholars said: God has perfected His blessing upon us by His being pleased with Islam as our religion, as He, exalted is He, said: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion." And in the report: "When a servant commits a sin and then seeks forgiveness from God, God, the Almighty, says to His angels, 'Look at My servant; he committed a sin but knew that he has a Lord who forgives sins and seizes for sin. I call you to witness that I have forgiven him.'" And in the report: "If a servant were to sin until his sins reached the clouds of the sky, I would forgive them for him, provided he seeks My forgiveness and hopes in Me." And in the report: "If a servant were to meet Me with sins filling the earth..."

[24] And in the Hadith: "Indeed, the angel lifts the pen from the servant when he commits a sin for six hours. If he repents and seeks forgiveness, it is not written against him; otherwise, it is written as a single sin." [25] In another wording: "So when it is written against him and he performs a good deed, the angel on the right says to the angel on the left—who is his superior—'Discard this sin until I discard from his good deeds one multiplied by ten,' and I raise for him nine good deeds, so the sin is cast away from him."

And Anas narrated in a Hadith that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When a servant commits a sin, it is written against him." A Bedouin said, "Even if he repents from it?" He said, "It is erased from him." He said, "Then if he returns to it?" The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "It is written against him." The Bedouin said, "Then if he repents?" He said, "It is erased from his record." He said, "Until when?" He said, "Until he seeks forgiveness and repents to God, Mighty and Majestic is He. Indeed, God does not tire of forgiving until the servant tires of seeking forgiveness. When a servant intends a good deed, the angel on the right writes it before he performs it. If he performs it, it is written as ten good deeds, then God, Glorified and Exalted is He, multiplies it up to seven hundredfold. And when he intends a sin, it is not written against him. If he performs it, it is written as a single sin, and beyond it is the goodness of God's pardon, Mighty and Majestic is He." [26]

A man came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, I only fast the month (of Ramadan) and do not increase upon it, and I only pray the five (obligatory prayers) and do not increase upon them, and there is no charity from my wealth for God, nor Hajj, nor voluntary acts. Where will I be when I die?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, smiled and said, "Yes, with me, if you guard your heart from two things: malice and envy, and your tongue from two things: backbiting and lying, and your eyes from two things: looking at what God has forbidden and looking down with them upon a Muslim, you will enter Paradise with me upon these two hands of mine." [27]

And in the lengthy Hadith of Anas: "The Bedouin said, 'O Messenger of God, who will oversee the reckoning of creation?' He said, 'God, Blessed and Exalted is He.' He said, 'Himself?' He said, 'Yes.' So the Bedouin smiled. He, peace be upon him, said, 'Why do you smile, O Bedouin?' He said, 'Indeed, the Noble One, when He has power, pardons, and when He reckons, He forgives.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'The Bedouin has spoken the truth. Is there not a Noble One more noble than God, Exalted is He? He is the Most Noble of the noble.' Then he said, 'Understand, O Bedouin.'" [28] And in it also: "Indeed, God, Exalted is He, honored and magnified the Kaaba. Yet if a servant were to demolish it stone by stone and then burn it, it would not reach the enormity of one who belittles a saint from among the saints of God, Exalted is He." The Bedouin said, "And who are the saints of God, Exalted is He?" He said, "The believers, all of them are the saints of God, Exalted is He. Have you not heard the saying of God, Mighty and Majestic is He: 'God is the Protector of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light'?" In some reports: "The believer is superior to the Kaaba." [29] "And the believer is pure and clean." [30] "And the believer is more honored with God, Exalted is He, than the angels." [31] And in the report: "God, Exalted is He, created Hell from the surplus of His mercy as a whip with which He drives His servants to Paradise." [32] And in another report: "God, Mighty and Majestic is He, says, 'I only created creation so that they might profit from Me, and I did not create them so that I might profit from them.'" [33] And in the Hadith of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri from the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "God, Exalted is He, did not create anything except that He made for it something that overcomes it, and He made His mercy overcome His wrath." [34] And in the famous report: "Indeed, God, Exalted is He, prescribed mercy for Himself before He created creation: 'My mercy overcomes My wrath.'" [35] And from Mu'adh ibn Jabal and Anas ibn Malik that he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever says 'There is no god but God' enters Paradise." [36] "And whoever's last words are 'There is no god but God,' the Fire will not touch him." [37] "And whoever meets God not associating anything with Him, the Fire is forbidden for him." [38] "And none shall enter it in whose heart is an atom's weight of faith." [39] And in another report: "If the disbeliever knew the vastness of God's mercy, none would despair of His Paradise." [40]

And when the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, recited His saying, Exalted is He: "Indeed, the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing," he said, "Do you know what day this is? This is a day when it will be said to Adam, upon him be peace, 'Arise and send forth the contingent of the Fire from your progeny.' He will say, 'How many?' It will be said, 'From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine to the Fire and one to Paradise.'" He said, "So the people were stricken with despair and began to weep, and they were idle that day from occupation and work. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, came out to them and said, 'What is the matter with you? Why do you not work?' They said, 'And who would occupy themselves with work after what you have told us?' He said, 'How many are you among the nations? Where are Thamud and 'Ad and the peoples of the scriptures? And Gog and Magog are nations none can enumerate except God, Exalted is He. You are among all the nations but like a white hair on the hide of a black bull, or like a mark on the foreleg of a beast.'" [41]

So observe how He drives creation with the whips of fear and leads them with the reins of hope to God, Exalted is He. For He drove them first with the whips of fear, and when that took them beyond the limit of moderation to an excess of despair, He treated them with the remedy of hope and returned them to moderation and the middle way. The latter was not...

Contradicting the first, yet in the first he mentioned what he saw as a cause for healing and confined himself to it. Then, when they needed treatment through hope, he mentioned the complete matter. Therefore, the preacher must follow the example of the Master of Preachers, and be gentle in employing reports of fear and hope according to the need, after observing the hidden ailments. If he does not observe this, what his preaching corrupts will be more than what it rectifies. In the report: "If you did not sin, Allah would create a creation who would sin so that He may forgive them." And in another wording: "He would take you away and bring a creation who would sin so that He may forgive them; indeed, He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." And in the report: "If you did not sin, I would fear for you something worse than sin." It was asked: "What is it?" He said: "Pride." And He (peace be upon him) said: "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, Allah is more merciful to His believing servant than a compassionate mother to her child." And in the report: "Allah the Exalted will indeed grant a forgiveness on the Day of Resurrection that has not crossed anyone's heart, so much so that Iblis will stretch forth in hope that it may reach him." And in the report: "Allah the Exalted has one hundred mercies; He kept ninety-nine with Him and manifested one mercy in the world. Through it, creation shows mercy to one another, so the mother shows tenderness to her child and the beast shows affection to its young. When the Day of Resurrection comes, He will join this mercy to the ninety-nine and then spread them over all His creation, and each of those mercies is like the layers of the heavens and the earth." He said: "So none will perish on that day except the one destined to perish." And in the report: "None of you will enter Paradise by his deeds, nor will he be saved from the Fire." They said: "Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Not even I, unless Allah envelops me in His mercy." And the best of prayers and peace be upon him said: "Work and give glad tidings, and know that no one will be saved by his deeds." And He (peace be upon him) said: "I have reserved my intercession for the people of major sins from my nation. Do you think it is for the obedient, the God-fearing? Rather, it is for the defiled, the mixed." And He (peace be upon him) said: "I was sent with the easy, lenient, upright religion." And He (peace be upon him) said, and upon every chosen servant: "I love that the people of the two scriptures know that in our religion there is leniency." Indicative of its meaning is Allah the Exalted's response to the believers in their saying: "And do not lay upon us a burden," and Allah the Exalted said: "And He will remove from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them." And Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah narrated from Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both) that he said: "When the verse was revealed: 'So pardon with gracious forgiveness,' he said: 'O Jibril, what is gracious forgiveness?' He (peace be upon him) said: 'When you pardon one who wronged you, do not reproach him.' He said: 'O Jibril, then Allah the Exalted is more generous than to reproach one whom He has pardoned.' So Jibril wept, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) wept. Then Allah the Exalted sent Mikail (peace be upon him) to them and said: 'Your Lord sends you greetings of peace and says: How could I reproach one whom I have pardoned? This does not befit My generosity.'" The reports concerning the causes of hope are too numerous to count. As for the narrations: Ali (may Allah honor his face) said: "Whoever commits a sin and Allah conceals it for him in this world, Allah is more generous than to expose his cover in the Hereafter. And whoever commits a sin and is punished for it in this world, Allah the Exalted is more just than to repeat the punishment upon His servant in the Hereafter." And al-Thawri said: "I would not like my account to be given to my parents, for I know that Allah the Exalted is more merciful to me than they are." And some of the predecessors said: "When a believer disobeys Allah the Exalted, He conceals him from the sight of the angels so they do not see him and testify against him." And Muhammad ibn Sa'b wrote to Aswad ibn Salim in his handwriting: "When a servant is excessive against himself and raises his hands supplicating and says: 'O my Lord,' the angels veil his voice, and likewise the second and third time, until when he says the fourth time: 'O my Lord,' Allah the Exalted says: 'How long will you veil from Me the voice of My servant? My servant knows that he has no Lord who forgives sins other than Me. I call you to witness that I have forgiven him.'" And Ibrahim ibn Adham (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "I had the Tawaf area to myself one night, and it was a rainy, dark night. I stood at the Multazam by the door and said: 'O Lord, protect me so that I never disobey You.' A caller from the House called out to me: 'O Ibrahim, you ask Me for protection, and all My believing servants ask Me for that. If I protected them, then upon whom would I bestow favor, and to whom would I forgive?'" And al-Hasan used to say: "If the believer did not sin, he would fly in the dominion of the heavens, but Allah the Exalted restrains him with sins." And al-Junayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "If an eye of generosity appears, it joins the wrongdoers with the doers of good." And Malik ibn Dinar met Abana and said to him: "How long will you speak to people with concessions?" He said: "O Abu Yahya, I indeed hope that you will see from Allah's pardon on the Day of Resurrection something that will tear this cloak of yours from joy." And in the narration of Ruba'i ibn Harrash from his brother, and he was among the best of the Followers,

He is among those who spoke after death. It is said that when my brother died, he was covered with his garment and we placed him upon his bier. Then he uncovered the garment from his face, sat upright, and said: "Indeed I have met my Lord, Mighty and Majestic, and He greeted me with spirit and fragrance, and my Lord is not angry. And I have seen the matter to be easier than you suppose, so do not despair. Verily, Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions are awaiting me until I return to them." Then he cast himself down, and it was as if it were a pebble falling into a basin. So we carried him and buried him.

In the Hadith: "Two men from the Children of Israel became brothers for the sake of God Almighty. One of them was excessive against himself, while the other was devout and would admonish and rebuke him. The former would say, 'Leave me and my Lord; were you sent as a watcher over me?' until one day he saw him committing a major sin and became angry, saying, 'May God not forgive you!' God Almighty will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Is anyone able to withhold My mercy from My servants? Go, for I have forgiven you.' Then He will say to the devout one: 'And you, I have decreed the Fire for you.' By the One in whose hand is my soul, he indeed spoke a word that ruined his worldly life and his Hereafter."

It is also narrated that a thief who had been waylaying travelers among the Children of Israel for forty years passed by Jesus, peace be upon him, who was followed by a devout worshipper from among the disciples of the Children of Israel. The thief thought to himself, "This is the Prophet of God passing by, and beside him are his disciples. If I were to descend and be with them as a third..." So he descended and sought to draw near to the disciple, but he belittled himself out of reverence for the disciple, saying to himself, "One like me should not walk beside this devout worshipper." The disciple sensed him and thought, "This one is walking beside me," so he drew himself together and walked closer to Jesus, peace be upon him, walking at his side, leaving the thief behind him. Then God Almighty revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him: "Tell them both to begin their works anew, for I have nullified what preceded of their deeds. As for the disciple, I have nullified his good deeds due to his pride in himself; and as for the other, I have nullified his evil deeds due to his self-abasement." So he informed them of that, and the thief joined him in his journeying, and he made him one of his disciples.

It is narrated from Masruq that a prophet among the prophets was prostrating when some transgressor stepped on his neck until he pressed his forehead into the pebbles. The prophet, peace be upon him, raised his head angrily and said, "Go, for God will never forgive you!" Then God Almighty revealed to him: "Do you swear by Me concerning My servants? I have forgiven him." Similar to this is what is narrated from Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both: "The Messenger of God ﷺ used to invoke against the polytheists and curse them in his prayer, until the verse was revealed to him: 'Not for you is the decision...' [Quran 3:128], so he ceased supplicating against them, and God Almighty guided most of those to Islam."

It is narrated in tradition that two men were among the devout worshippers, equal in worship. When they were admitted into Paradise, one of them was raised to the highest levels above his companion. He said, "O Lord, in the world he was not more worshipful than I, yet You have raised him above me in the highest ranks." God, Glorified is He, said: "He used to ask Me in the world for the highest levels, while you used to ask Me for salvation from the Fire. I have given each servant what he asked for." This indicates that worship based on hope is superior, because love is more dominant in the hopeful than in the fearful. Consider the difference among kings between one who serves out of fear of his punishment and one who serves hoping for his favor and honor. For this reason, God Almighty commanded good expectations, and for this reason He ﷺ said: "Ask God for the highest levels, for indeed you are asking the Most Generous," and said: "When you ask God, magnify your desire and ask for the highest Paradise, for nothing is too great for God Almighty."

Bakr ibn Salim al-Sawwaf said: "We entered upon Malik ibn Anas on the evening before he passed away and said, 'O Abu Abdullah, how do you find yourself?' He said, 'I do not know what to say to you except that you will witness from God's pardon what you had not reckoned.' We had not left before we closed his eyes."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said in his intimate prayer: "My hope in You for [forgiveness of] sins almost overcomes my hope in You through [my] deeds, for in deeds I rely upon sincerity—and how can I secure it when I am known for fault?—while in sins I find myself relying upon Your pardon—and how could You not forgive them when You are described by generosity?"

It is said that a Magian sought hospitality from Abraham, the intimate friend, peace be upon him. He said, "If you embrace Islam, I will host you." The Magian passed on. Then God Almighty revealed to him: "O Abraham, you would not feed him except by changing his religion, while We have been feeding him for seventy years upon his disbelief. Had you hosted him for one night, what would have been upon you?" So Abraham hurried after the Magian, brought him back, and hosted him. The Magian said to him, "What is the reason for this change in you?" He mentioned it to him. The Magian said, "Is this how he treats me?" Then he said, "Present Islam to me," and he embraced Islam.

The teacher Abu Sahl al-Sa'luki saw Abu Sahl al-Zajjaji in a dream, and he was...

He spoke of eternal punishment, and was asked, "How are you?" He replied, "We found the matter easier than we had imagined." Someone saw Abu Sahl al-Sa'luki in a dream, in an indescribably beautiful state, and asked him, "O master, how did you attain this?" He answered, "Through my good opinion of my Lord." It is related that Abu al-'Abbas ibn Surayj, may God have mercy on him, saw in a dream during his final illness as if the Resurrection had come to pass, and the Almighty, glorified is He, was saying, "Where are the scholars?" They came, and He said, "What have you done with what you knew?" We said, "O Lord, we fell short and did wrong." He repeated the question, as if He was not pleased with the answer and desired a different one. I said, "As for me, there is no polytheism in my record, and You have promised to forgive what is less than that." He said, "Take him away, for I have forgiven you." He died three nights later.

It is said a man who drank wine gathered some of his companions and gave his servant four dirhams, ordering him to buy some fruit for the gathering. The servant passed by the door of Mansur ibn 'Ammar's gathering, where he was asking for something for a poor man, saying, "Whoever gives me four dirhams, I will pray four prayers for him." The servant gave him the dirhams. Mansur said, "What do you want me to pray for?" He said, "For my master, I wish to be freed from him." Mansur prayed. He said, "The next?" He said, "That God replace my dirhams." Mansur prayed. He said, "The next?" He said, "That God grant my master repentance." Mansur prayed. He said, "The next?" He said, "That God forgive me, my master, you, and the gathering." Mansur prayed. The servant returned, and his master said, "Why are you late?" He told him the story. He said, "And what did he pray for?" He said, "I asked for my own freedom." He said to him, "Go, you are free." He said, "And the second?" He said, "That God replace the dirhams." He said, "You have four thousand dirhams." He said, "And the third?" He said, "That God grant you repentance." He said, "I have repented to God Almighty." He said, "And the fourth?" He said, "That God forgive me, you, and the gathering." He said, "This one is not up to me." When he slept that night, he saw in a dream as if a speaker said to him, "You did what was yours to do. Do you think I will not do what is Mine? I have forgiven you, the servant, Mansur ibn 'Ammar, and all the people present."

It is narrated from 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Thaqafi who said: I saw three men and a woman carrying a bier. I took the woman's place, and we went to the cemetery, prayed over it, and buried the deceased. I said to the woman, "Who was this deceased to you?" She said, "My son." I said, "Did you not have neighbors?" She said, "Yes, but they belittled his affair." I said, "And what was this?" She said, "An effeminate man." I pitied her and took her to my home and gave her dirhams, wheat, and clothes. He said: I saw that night as if someone came to me like the moon on the night of the full moon, wearing white clothes, and he began to thank me. I said, "Who are you?" He said, "The effeminate man you buried today. My Lord had mercy on me because people despised me."

Ibrahim al-Atroush said: We were sitting in Baghdad with Ma'ruf al-Karkhi on the Tigris when some youths passed in a boat, beating the drum, drinking, and playing. They said to Ma'ruf, "Do you not see them disobeying God openly? Pray to God against them." He raised his hands and said, "My God, as You have given them joy in this world, give them joy in the Hereafter." The people said, "We only asked you to pray against them." He said, "If He gives them joy in the Hereafter, He will have accepted their repentance."

Some of the pious predecessors would say in their supplication: "O Lord, and which people of any age have not disobeyed You? Yet Your favor upon them is abundant, and Your provision for them is continuous. Glory be to You, how forbearing You are! By Your might, You are disobeyed, then You bestow favor and provide provision, until it is as if, O our Lord, You do not become angry." These are the means by which the spirit of hope is brought to the hearts of the fearful and the despairing.

As for the deluded fools, they should not hear any of this. Rather, they should hear what we will present concerning the causes of fear, for most people are not set right except through fear, like the wicked servant and the unruly child who is not straightened except by the whip and the stick and the display of harshness in speech. As for the opposite of that, it blocks for them the door of rectitude in religion and this world.

(The Second Half of the Book on Fear)
In it is an explanation of the reality of fear, an explanation of its degrees, an explanation of the categories of fears, an explanation of the virtue of fear, an explanation of which is preferable—fear or hope—an explanation of the remedy for fear, an explanation of the meaning of a bad ending, and an explanation of the states of the fearful among the prophets, prayers of God be upon them, and the righteous, mercy of God be upon them. And we ask God for success.

(Explanation of the Reality of Fear)
Know that fear is an expression for the pain and burning of the heart due to the anticipation of a disliked thing in the future. This has become clear in the explanation of the reality of hope. Whoever finds intimacy with God, and the Truth possesses his heart, and he becomes a child of the moment, witnessing the beauty of the Truth perpetually, no longer has any regard for the future, so he has no fear.

There is no hope, rather his state has become higher than fear and hope, for both are two states that prevent the soul from venturing into its follies. To this, al-Wasiti alluded when he said: "Fear is a veil between God, exalted is He, and the servant." He also said: "When the Truth manifests upon the innermost secrets, there remains no room within them for hope or fear." In summary, when the lover's heart is preoccupied in witnessing the Beloved with the fear of separation, that is a deficiency in witnessing. For the permanence of witnessing is the ultimate of spiritual stations. However, we are now speaking of the beginnings of the stations, so we say: The state of fear is also comprised of knowledge, state, and action.

As for knowledge, it is the knowledge of the cause leading to the dreaded thing. This is like one who commits a crime against a king and then falls into his hands; he fears execution, for example, though pardon and release are possible. Yet, the pain in his heart from fear is according to the strength of the causes leading to his execution: the enormity of his crime, the king being in himself vengeful, wrathful, and retributive, being surrounded by those who urge him to revenge and lacking anyone to intercede on his behalf, and this fearful one being devoid of any means or good deed that would erase the trace of his crime before the king. Knowledge of the convergence of these causes is a reason for the strength of fear and the intensity of the heart's pain; and according to the weakness of these causes, fear weakens.

Fear may also arise not from a cause of a crime the fearful one has committed, but from an attribute of the one feared. Like one who falls into the claws of a lion; he fears the lion due to the attribute inherent to the lion, which is its greed and its overpowering tendency to prey, even if its predation is by choice. Or it may be from a natural attribute of what is feared, like the fear of one who falls into the path of a flood or near a fire. For water is feared because it is by nature disposed to flowing and drowning, and likewise fire to burning. Thus, knowledge of the causes of the dreaded thing is the motivating, stirring cause for the burning and pain of the heart, and that burning is fear.

Similarly, fear of God, exalted is He, is sometimes due to knowing God, exalted is He, and knowing His attributes—that if He destroyed all worlds, He would not care and nothing could prevent Him. Sometimes it is due to the abundance of the servant's crimes from committing sins. Sometimes it is due to both. And according to his knowledge of his own faults and his knowledge of the majesty of God, exalted is He, and His self-sufficiency—that He is not questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned—so the strength of his fear increases. The most fearful of people towards his Lord is the one who knows himself and his Lord best. For this reason, he (the Prophet) said: "I am the most God-fearing among you." And likewise, God, exalted is He, said: "Only those fear God among His servants who have knowledge." Then, when knowledge is perfected, it begets the majesty of fear and the burning of the heart. Then the effect of the burning overflows from the heart onto the body, the limbs, and the attributes.

As for the body: through emaciation, pallor, fainting, screaming, and weeping. The gallbladder may rupture from it, leading to death, or it may ascend to the brain and corrupt the intellect, or it may become strong and beget despair and hopelessness.

As for the limbs: by restraining them from sins and binding them to acts of obedience, to make up for what was neglected and to prepare for the future. For this reason, it is said: "The fearful one is not he who weeps and wipes his eyes, but he who abandons what he fears he will be punished for." And Abu al-Qasim al-Hakim said: "Whoever fears something flees from it, but whoever fears God flees to Him." And it was said to Dhu al-Nun: "When is a servant fearful?" He said: "When he places himself in the position of a sick person who takes precautions, fearing a prolonged illness."

As for the attributes: by suppressing the appetites and clouding the pleasures, so that sins beloved to him become detested, just as honey becomes detested to one who desires it when he knows it contains poison. Thus, the appetites are burned by fear, the limbs are disciplined, and there occurs in the heart withering, humility, abasement, and submission. Arrogance, malice, and envy depart from it. Rather, he becomes wholly absorbed in his concern with his fear and in contemplating the peril of his outcome, having no leisure for anything else. He has no occupation except vigilance, self-reckoning, striving, and being miserly with his breaths and glances, holding his soul accountable for its passing thoughts, its steps, and its words. His state becomes like the state of one who has fallen into the claws of a predatory lion, not knowing whether it will become heedless of him so he escapes, or whether it will pounce on him so he perishes. Thus, his outward and inward become preoccupied with what he fears, with no room in him for anything else. This is the state of one whom fear overcomes and dominates. And such was the state of a group of the Companions and the Followers. The strength of vigilance, self-reckoning, and striving is according to the strength of the fear, which is the pain and burning of the heart. And the strength of the fear is according to the strength of the knowledge of the majesty of God, His attributes and His actions, and of the faults of the soul and what lies before it of perils and terrors.

The lowest degree of fear from which its effect appears in actions is that which prevents from the forbidden things. The restraint resulting from the forbidden things is called *wara'* (scrupulous piety). If its strength increases, it restrains from that to which the possibility of prohibition may extend, so he also refrains from that which he is not certain is forbidden.

This is called piety, for piety is to abandon what causes doubt for what does not cause doubt. It may even compel one to abandon what is permissible, fearing what is harmful. This is sincerity in piety. When coupled with detachment for service, so that one does not build what one will not inhabit, nor gather what one will not eat, nor turn to a worldly life one knows will depart from him, nor direct a single breath of his soul to other than God Almighty, then that is sincerity, and its possessor is worthy of being called a truthful friend (*siddiq*). Sincerity encompasses piety, piety encompasses scrupulousness (*wara'*), and scrupulousness encompasses chastity (*'iffah*), for it denotes specifically abstaining from the demands of base desires. Thus, fear affects the limbs through restraint and action. Due to this restraint, it acquires the name 'chastity,' which is restraint from the demands of desire. Higher than it is scrupulousness, for it is more general as it is restraint from every prohibition. Higher than that is piety, for it is the name for restraint from both the prohibited and the doubtful. Beyond it lie the names of the truthful friend (*siddiq*) and the one brought near (*muqarrab*). The subsequent rank runs from the preceding one as the specific runs from the general. If you mention the specific, you have mentioned the whole, just as you say: a human is either Arab or non-Arab; an Arab is either Qurayshi or other; a Qurayshi is either Hashimi or other; a Hashimi is either 'Alawi or other; an 'Alawi is either Hasani or Husayni. If you mention, for example, that he is Hasani, you have described him with all [the preceding attributes]. And if you describe him as 'Alawi, you have described him with what is above it, which is more general than it. Similarly, if you say 'truthful friend' (*siddiq*), you have said he is pious, scrupulous, and chaste. Therefore, you should not think that the multitude of these names indicates many distinct meanings, lest you become confused, as became confused he who sought meanings from words without following the words to the meanings. This is an indication of the collective meanings of fear and what encompasses it from the side of elevation, such as the knowledge that necessitates it, and from the side of baseness, such as the actions emanating from it through restraint and action.

(Explanation of the Degrees of Fear and its Variation in Strength and Weakness)

Know that fear is praiseworthy. One might think that all that is fear is praiseworthy, and that the stronger and more abundant it is, the more praiseworthy. This is an error. Rather, fear is the whip of God with which He drives His servants to persevere in knowledge and action so that they may attain by them the station of nearness to God Almighty. It is most fitting for a beast not to be without a whip, and likewise for a child. But that does not indicate that exaggeration in beating is praiseworthy. Similarly, fear has deficiency, excess, and moderation. The praiseworthy is the moderate, the middle course. As for the deficient, it is that which runs the course of the tenderness of women: a thought occurs upon hearing a verse of the Quran, inducing weeping and flowing tears, and likewise upon witnessing an awesome cause. But when that cause disappears from perception and the heart returns to heedlessness, this is deficient fear, of little benefit and weak utility. It is like a weak stick with which a strong beast is struck—it does not pain it with severe pain, so it does not drive it to the goal nor is it suitable for its training. Such is the fear of all people except the knowers (*'arifun*) and the scholars. I do not mean by 'scholars' those who are merely marked with the marks of scholars and bear their names, for they are the farthest of people from fear. Rather, I mean those with knowledge of God, His days, and His actions—something whose existence has become rare now. Therefore, Fudayl ibn 'Iyad said: "If you are asked, 'Do you fear God?' be silent, for if you say 'no,' you have disbelieved, and if you say 'yes,' you have lied." He indicated by this that fear is that which restrains the limbs from sins and binds them to obedience. Whatever does not affect the limbs is merely an inner discourse and a fleeting thought, not deserving to be called fear.

As for the excessive, it is that which strengthens and exceeds the limit of moderation until it leads to despair and hopelessness. It is also blameworthy, for it prevents action. Fear may also lead to sickness and weakness, to distraction and bewilderment, and to the loss of reason. The purpose of fear is what is the purpose of the whip: to compel to action. Without that, fear would be as nothing, for in reality it is a deficiency, as its origin is ignorance and incapacity. As for ignorance, it is that one does not know the outcome of his affair; if he knew, he would not be afraid, for what is feared is that in which there is uncertainty. As for incapacity, it is that one is exposed to a danger he cannot repel. Therefore, it is praiseworthy relative to human deficiency. What is praiseworthy in itself and its essence is knowledge and power—everything with which God Almighty may be described. Whatever God Almighty may not be described with is not perfection in itself; it only becomes praiseworthy relative to a deficiency greater than it, just as enduring the pain of medicine is praiseworthy because it is lighter than the pain of illness and death. Whatever leads to hopelessness is blameworthy. Fear may also lead to sickness and weakness, to distraction and bewilderment, and to the loss of reason. It may even lead to death, and all of that is blameworthy. It is like a beating that kills.

The child and the whip that destroys the beast, or makes it ill, or breaks one of its limbs—yet the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) mentioned the causes of hope and multiplied them to treat with it the shock of excessive fear that leads to despair or one of these matters. For everything intended for a purpose, the praiseworthy part of it is what leads to the intended objective; whatever falls short of it or exceeds it is blameworthy. The benefit of fear is caution, scrupulousness, piety, striving, worship, reflection, remembrance, and all the means that lead to God Almighty. All of this necessitates life with bodily health and soundness of intellect. Therefore, anything that impairs these means is blameworthy.

If you say: "He who fears and dies from his fear is a martyr"—so how can his state be blameworthy? Know that the meaning of him being a martyr is that he has a rank due to his death from fear, which he would not have attained had he died at that time not due to fear. So relative to that, it is a virtue. But relative to the estimation of his remaining and long life in obedience to God and traversing His paths, it is not a virtue. Rather, for the wayfarer to God Almighty on the path of reflection, striving, and ascension in the degrees of knowledge, in every moment there is the rank of a martyr and martyrs. Were it not for this, the rank of a child who is killed or a madman devoured by a beast would be higher than the rank of a prophet or saint who dies a natural death, and that is impossible. So one should not think this; rather, the greatest felicity is a long life in obedience to God Almighty. Therefore, anything that nullifies lifespan, intellect, or the health by the nullification of which lifespan is nullified, is loss and deficiency relative to certain matters, even if some of its categories are a virtue relative to other matters—just as martyrdom is a virtue relative to what is below it, not relative to the degree of the God-fearing and the truthful. Therefore, if fear does not affect action, its existence is like its non-existence, like a whip that does not increase the movement of the beast. If it does have an effect, then it has degrees according to the manifestation of its effect. If it only leads to chastity, which is refraining from the demands of desires, then it has one degree. When it yields scrupulousness, that is higher. The utmost of its degrees is that it yields the degrees of the truthful, which is to strip the outward and inward from all besides God Almighty, until no room remains for other than God Almighty within it. This is the utmost of what is praiseworthy in it, and that is with the preservation of health and intellect. If it exceeds this to the removal of intellect and health, then it is an illness that must be treated if one is able, even if it were praiseworthy, it would not necessitate treatment by the causes of hope and other means until it is removed. For this reason, Sahl (may God have mercy on him) used to say to the disciples who persisted in hunger for many days: "Preserve your intellects, for God Almighty has no saint with a deficient intellect."

(Explanation of the Categories of Fear Relative to What is Feared)
Know that fear is only realized by the anticipation of something disliked. The disliked is either disliked in itself, like fire, or disliked because it leads to the disliked, just as sins are disliked for leading to a disliked state in the Hereafter, and just as a sick person dislikes harmful fruits for leading to death. Every fearful person must imagine in himself something disliked from one of the two categories and strengthen its anticipation in his heart until it burns his heart due to his sensing that disliked thing. The station of the fearful differs in what dominates their hearts from the dreaded disliked things. Those upon whose hearts dominates what is not disliked in itself but for something else—such as those dominated by the fear of death before repentance, or fear of breaking repentance and violating the covenant, or fear of weakness in fulfilling the complete rights of God Almighty, or fear of the removal of the heart's tenderness and its replacement with hardness, or fear of deviating from uprightness, or fear of the domination of habit in following familiar desires, or fear that God Almighty will leave him to his good deeds upon which he relied and took pride in before God's servants, or fear of arrogance due to the abundance of God's blessings upon him, or fear of being occupied with other than God instead of God, or fear of being lured gradually by the succession of blessings, or fear of the exposure of the hidden faults in his acts of obedience when there appears to him from God what he did not reckon, or fear of the consequences of people's rights regarding him in backbiting, betrayal, deceit, and harboring evil, or fear of what he does not know will occur in the remainder of his life, or fear of the hastening of punishment in this world and exposure before death, or fear of being deceived by the adornments of the world, or fear of God's disclosure of his secret thoughts in a state of heedlessness of Him, or fear of being sealed at death with an evil seal, or fear of the preordainment that was decreed for him in eternity—all these are fears, and each has a specific benefit, which is to tread the path of caution from what leads to the feared thing. Thus, he who fears the domination of habit over him persists in weaning himself from habit, and he who fears God's disclosure...

He ascends in his innermost being, occupying himself with purifying his heart from whisperings, and so on through the remaining categories. The most prevalent of these fears for the one of certainty is the fear of the ending, for the matter therein is perilous. The highest of the categories and the most indicative of the perfection of knowledge is the fear of the primordial decree, for the ending follows the primordial decree and is a branch stemming from it after the interposition of many causes. Thus, the ending reveals what was decreed by destiny in the Mother of the Book. The one who fears the ending, compared to the one who fears the primordial decree, is like two men concerning whom the king has issued a decree that may contain an order for beheading or may contain the conferral of the vizierate upon him, and the decree has not yet reached them. The heart of one of them is preoccupied with the state of the decree's arrival and its unveiling, and with what it will reveal. The heart of the other is preoccupied with the state of the king's decreeing and its modality—what occurred to the king at the moment of decreeing, whether mercy or wrath. This attention to the cause is higher than attention to what is a branch. Similarly, attention to the eternal decree, which was executed by the pen's inscription, is higher than attention to what appears in eternity. To this the Prophet (peace be upon him) alluded when he was upon the pulpit; he clenched his right hand and said: "This is the Book of God, in which the people of Paradise are written with their names and the names of their fathers; none are added to them and none are diminished." Then he clenched his left hand and said: "This is the Book of God, in which the people of the Fire are written with their names and the names of their fathers; none are added to them and none are diminished. The people of happiness will certainly perform the deeds of the people of wretchedness until it is said they are almost of them—nay, they are them. Then God will deliver them before death, even by the interval between two milkings of a she-camel. And the people of wretchedness will certainly perform the deeds of the people of happiness until it is said they are almost of them—nay, they are them. Then God will extract them before death, even by the interval between two milkings of a she-camel. The fortunate is he who is fortunate by the decree of God, and the wretched is he who is wretched by the decree of God, and deeds are judged by their endings." This is like the division of those who fear into one who fears his own sin and transgression, and one who fears God Almighty Himself for His attribute, His majesty, and His descriptions which inevitably demand awe. This is the higher rank, and therefore his fear remains even if he is in the obedience of the truthful. As for the other, he is exposed to delusion and false security if he persists in acts of obedience. Thus, the fear of sin is the fear of the righteous, and the fear of God is the fear of the monotheists and the truthful; it is the fruit of knowledge of God Almighty. Whoever knows Him and knows His attributes learns from His attributes what is worthy of being feared without any prior transgression. Indeed, if the sinner knew God with true knowledge, he would fear God and not fear his sin. Were He not fearsome in His essence, He would not have subjugated him to sin and facilitated its path and paved its causes for him. For the facilitation of sin's causes is a distancing, and no sin preceded from him before the sin that merited his being subjugated to sin and having its causes run upon him. Nor did any means precede before obedience by which he strove, for which acts of obedience were facilitated for him and the path of nearness was paved. Thus, the sinner has been decreed for sin, whether he wills it or not, and likewise the obedient. He who elevates Muhammad (peace be upon him) to the highest heights without any means that preceded from him before his existence, and places Abu Jahl in the lowest depths without any transgression that preceded from him before his existence, is worthy of being feared for His attribute of majesty. For whoever obeys God obeys because He empowered him with the will to obey and granted him the capability. After the creation of a decisive will and complete capability, the action becomes necessary. And whoever disobeys disobeys because He empowered him with a strong, decisive will and granted him the causes and capability, so the action after the will and capability becomes necessary. I wonder, what necessitated honoring this one and singling him out by empowering him with the will for obedience? And what necessitated dishonoring the other and distancing him by empowering him with the incitements to sin? How can this be attributed to the servant? If the attribution returns to the eternal decree without any prior transgression or means, then fear of Him who decrees as He wills and judges as He desires is prudent for every rational person. Beyond this meaning lies the secret of divine decree, which it is not permissible to divulge, nor can one understand the fear of Him in His attributes (glory be to His majesty) except by an example which, were it not for the permission of the Sacred Law, no person of insight would dare mention. It has come in a report: "God Almighty revealed to David (peace be upon him): 'O David, fear Me as you fear a ravenous lion.'" This example makes you understand the essence of the meaning, even if it does not acquaint you with its cause, for acquaintance with its cause is acquaintance with the secret of divine decree, and that is not unveiled except to its people. The essence is that the lion is feared not because of any prior transgression from you toward it, but because of its attribute, its ferocity, its sudden attack, its greatness, and its awe, and because it does what it does without concern. If it kills you, its heart feels no pity, nor does it grieve at your killing. If it leaves you, it does not leave you out of compassion for you or to preserve your spirit; rather, you are in its sight too insignificant for it to heed you, whether you are alive or dead.

Or a dead person? Nay, the destruction of a thousand like you and the destruction of an ant are, in His sight, on a single plane, for that does not detract from the world of His lordship and what He is described with of His power and His overwhelming might. To God belongs the highest similitude. But whoever knows Him knows, through the inward witnessing which is stronger, more certain, and clearer than outward witnessing, that He is truthful in His saying: "These to Paradise, and I care not; and these to the Fire, and I care not." Sufficient for you, as a cause of awe and fear, is the knowledge of His self-sufficiency and His not caring. The second class of those who fear: that what is hateful becomes represented to their souls. This is like the agonies of death and its severity, or the questioning by Munkar and Nakir, or the punishment of the grave, or the terror of the encounter, or the awe of the standing before God, exalted is He, and the shame at the uncovering of the veil and the questioning about the speck and the date-stone, or the fear of the Bridge and its sharpness and the manner of crossing it, or the fear of the Fire and its shackles and its terrors, or the fear of deprivation from Paradise, the abode of bliss and the everlasting kingdom, and from the diminution of degrees, or the fear of the veil from God, exalted is He. All these causes are hateful in themselves, so they are inevitably fearful. The states of those who fear differ regarding them, and the highest of them in rank is the fear of separation and the veil from God, exalted is He. This is the fear of the knowers. What is before that is the fear of the workers, the righteous, the ascetics, and all the common believers. Whoever's knowledge is not complete and whose insight has not opened does not feel the delight of union nor the pain of distance and separation. If it is mentioned to him that the knower does not fear the Fire but rather fears the veil, he finds that in his inward self to be strange and wonders at it within himself. He might even deny the delight of gazing upon the countenance of God, the Generous, were it not for the prohibition of the Sacred Law preventing him from denying it. Thus, his affirmation of it with the tongue is out of the necessity of imitation; otherwise, his inward self does not believe in it, for he knows only the delight of the belly, the private parts, and the eye in gazing upon colors and beautiful faces—in sum, every delight which the beasts share with him. As for the delight of the knowers, none but them comprehend it. To detail and explain that is forbidden with one who is not worthy of it. Whoever is worthy of it gains insight by himself and has no need for another to explain it to him. To these categories returns the fear of those who fear. We ask God, exalted is He, for good success through His grace.

(Explanation of the Virtue of Fear and Encouragement Toward It)

Know that the merit of fear is sometimes known through reflection and consideration, and sometimes through verses and reports. As for consideration, its way is that the virtue of a thing is according to its usefulness in leading to the happiness of meeting God, exalted is He, in the Hereafter, for there is no objective except happiness, and there is no happiness for the servant except in meeting his Lord and proximity to Him. Thus, everything that assists in that has virtue, and its virtue is according to its ultimate end. It has become clear that there is no arrival at the happiness of meeting God in the Hereafter except by attaining His love and intimacy with Him in this world. Love is not attained except through knowledge, and knowledge is not attained except through constant reflection, and intimacy is not attained except through love and constant remembrance. Perseverance in remembrance and reflection is not made easy except by severing the love of the world from the heart, and that is not severed except by abandoning the pleasures and desires of the world. Abandoning what is desired is not possible except by suppressing the desires, and nothing suppresses desire as it is suppressed by the fire of fear. Thus, fear is the fire that burns the desires. Its virtue, then, is according to what it burns of desires and according to what it restrains from sins and urges toward acts of obedience. That differs according to the differing degrees of fear, as preceded. How could fear not possess virtue, when through it are attained chastity, scrupulousness, God-consciousness, and striving—these are the virtuous, praiseworthy works which draw one near to God. As for by way of citation from verses and reports, what has come regarding the virtue of fear is beyond enumeration. Sufficient for you as an indication of its virtue is that God, exalted is He, gathered for those who fear guidance, mercy, knowledge, and good pleasure—these are the comprehensive stations of the people of Paradise. God, exalted is He, said: "And a guidance and a mercy for those who fear their Lord." And He said: "Only those fear God among His servants who have knowledge." He described them with knowledge because of their fear. And He, mighty and majestic, said: "God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is for whoever fears his Lord." Everything that indicates the virtue of knowledge indicates the virtue of fear, for fear is the fruit of knowledge. Therefore, it came in the report concerning Moses, upon him be the best prayers and peace: "As for those who fear, for them is the Highest Companion, in which they have no partners." See how He singled them out for companionship with the Highest Companion. That is because they are the learned, and the learned have the rank of companionship with the prophets, for they are the heirs of the prophets, and companionship with the Highest Companion is for the prophets and those who are joined to them. Therefore, when the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was given the choice during his final illness between remaining in the world and coming to God, exalted is He...

He would say, "I ask You for the Highest Companion." Thus, if one looks to its tree, it is knowledge; and if one looks to its fruit, it is piety and God-consciousness. The merits of these two are not hidden, to the point that the ultimate outcome has become marked by God-consciousness and specifically attributed to it, just as praise is specifically attributed to God Almighty and blessings to the Messenger of God ﷺ, so that it is said, "Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, and the best outcome is for the God-conscious," and "Blessings upon our master Muhammad ﷺ and all his family." God Almighty has specifically attributed God-consciousness to Himself by association, saying, "Their flesh and their blood do not reach God, but it is your God-consciousness that reaches Him." God-consciousness is but an expression of restraint in accordance with fear, as preceded. Therefore, God said, "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of God is the most God-conscious of you." For this reason, God enjoined God-consciousness upon the former and the latter peoples, saying, "And We had already enjoined upon those who were given the Scripture before you and upon you to fear God," and He, the Mighty and Majestic, said, "And fear Me, if you are believers." He commanded fear, made it obligatory, and stipulated it in faith. Therefore, it is inconceivable that a believer be devoid of fear, even if weak, and the weakness of his fear is according to the weakness of his knowledge and faith.

The Messenger of God ﷺ said regarding the virtue of God-consciousness: "When God gathers the former and the latter peoples for the appointment of a known Day, they will hear a voice that the farthest among them hears just as the nearest hears. He will say: 'O people, I have listened to you from the time I created you until this day of yours, so listen to Me today. It is only your deeds that are returned to you. O people, I established a lineage and you established lineages, so you lowered My lineage and raised your lineages. I said, "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of God is the most God-conscious of you," but you refused except to say, "So-and-so, son of so-and-so," and "So-and-so is richer than so-and-so." So today I lower your lineages and raise My lineage. Where are the God-conscious?' Then a banner will be raised for a people, and the people will follow their banner to their dwellings and enter Paradise without account."

And he ﷺ said: "The pinnacle of wisdom is the fear of God." And he ﷺ said to Ibn Mas'ud: "If you wish to meet me, then increase in fear after me." Al-Fudayl said: "Whoever fears God, fear guides him to every good." Al-Shibli, may God have mercy on him, said: "I never feared God for a day except that I saw for it a door of wisdom and admonition I had never seen before." Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "There is no believer who commits an evil deed except that two good deeds follow it: fear of punishment and hope for pardon, like a fox between two lions." And in the report of Moses, peace be upon him: "As for the pious, no one remains except that I call him to account and investigate what is in his hands, except the pious, for I am ashamed before them and revere them to hold them for account." Piety and God-consciousness are names derived from meanings whose condition is fear; if devoid of fear, they are not called by these names.

Likewise, what has come regarding the merits of remembrance is not hidden, and God has specifically attributed it to those who fear, saying, "He who fears will be reminded," and "But for him who fears the standing before his Lord are two gardens." And he ﷺ said: "God, Mighty and Majestic, said: 'By My might, I will not combine for My servant two fears, nor will I combine for him two securities. If he feels secure from Me in the world, I will frighten him on the Day of Resurrection; and if he fears Me in the world, I will secure him on the Day of Resurrection.'" And he ﷺ said: "Whoever fears God, God will make everything fear him; and whoever fears other than God, God will make him fear everything." And he ﷺ said: "The most complete among you in intellect are the most intense in fear of God Almighty and the best among you in considering what God has commanded and forbidden."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh, mercy of God upon him, said: "Wretched is the son of Adam; if he feared the Fire as he fears poverty, he would enter Paradise." Dhu al-Nun, mercy of God upon him, said: "Whoever fears God Almighty, his heart melts, his love intensifies, and his intellect becomes sound." Dhu al-Nun also said: "Fear should be more profound than hope, for if hope overcomes, the heart becomes disturbed." Abu al-Husayn al-Darir used to say: "The sign of felicity is fear of wretchedness, because fear is a rein between God Almighty and His servant; if its rein is severed, he perishes with the perishing." It was said to Yahya ibn Mu'adh: "Who among the creation will be secure tomorrow?" He said: "The most intense in fear today." Sahl, mercy of God upon him, said: "You will not find fear until you eat what is lawful." It was said to al-Hasan: "O Abu Sa'id, what should we do? We sit with people who frighten us until our hearts almost fly." He said: "By God, if you keep company with people who frighten you until security reaches you, it is better for you than accompanying people who make you feel secure until fear reaches you." Abu Sulayman al-Darani, mercy of God upon him, said: "Fear never left a heart except that it lay in ruins." And 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "I said: 'O Messenger of God, "Those who give what they give while their hearts are fearful" — is that the man who steals and commits adultery?' He said: 'No, rather it is the man who fasts, prays, and gives charity, yet fears it will not be accepted from him.'" The severe warnings regarding feeling secure from God's scheme and His punishment are innumerable, and all of that is praise for...

Fear is commendable because censuring something is praise for its opposite which negates it. The opposite of fear is security, just as the opposite of hope is despair. And just as censuring despair indicates the virtue of hope, so too does censuring security indicate the virtue of the fear that opposes it. Rather, we say: everything that has been reported concerning the merit of hope is evidence for the merit of fear, because they are inseparable. For everyone who hopes for a beloved object must necessarily fear missing it. If he does not fear missing it, then he does not love it, and thus his anticipation is not one of hope. Therefore, fear and hope are inseparable; it is impossible for one to be disjoined from the other. Yes, it is possible for one to prevail over the other while they are both present, and it is possible for the heart to be occupied with one and not attend to the other at a given moment due to heedlessness of it. This is because a condition of hope is fear; they are both attached to what is uncertain, for what is certain is neither hoped for nor feared. Thus, the beloved object whose existence is possible must also be susceptible to non-existence. Contemplating its existence gladdens the heart, and that is hope; contemplating its absence pains the heart, and that is fear. And these two considerations inevitably confront each other when the awaited matter is uncertain. Yes, one side of the doubt may outweigh the other due to the presence of certain causes, and that is called presumption, which becomes a cause for the dominance of one over the other. So when the presumption of the beloved's existence prevails, hope is strengthened and fear is obscured relative to it, and likewise the reverse. In any case, they are inseparable.

Therefore, the Exalted said: "And they supplicate Us in hope and fear" (Qur'an 21:90). And the Almighty said: "They supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration" (Qur'an 32:16). For this reason, the Arabs expressed fear as hope, as the Exalted said: "What is [the matter] with you that you do not hope for Allah's majesty?" (Qur'an 71:13), meaning you do not fear. And hope is often mentioned in the Qur'an with the meaning of fear, due to their inseparability, for it is the habit of the Arabs to express a thing by what accompanies it.

Indeed, I say: everything that has been reported concerning the merit of weeping from awe of Allah is a manifestation of the virtue of awe, for weeping is the fruit of awe. The Exalted said: "So let them laugh a little and weep much" (Qur'an 9:82). And the Exalted said: "They weep, and it increases them in humility" (Qur'an 17:109). And the Almighty said: "Then at this statement do you wonder? And you laugh and do not weep, while you are proudly sporting?" (Qur'an 53:59-61). And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "There is no believing servant from whose eyes a tear falls—even if it were like the head of a fly—out of awe of Allah the Exalted, and it touches any part of his face, except that Allah will forbid him to the Fire." And he (peace be upon him) said: "When the heart of a believer trembles from awe of Allah, his sins fall away from him as leaves fall from a tree." And he (peace be upon him) said: "No one who weeps from awe of Allah the Exalted will enter the Fire, until milk returns to the udder." And 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said: "What is salvation, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "Restrain your tongue, let your house suffice you, and weep over your sin." And 'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: "I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, will anyone from your community enter Paradise without reckoning?' He said, 'Yes, one who remembers his sins and weeps.'" And he (peace be upon him) said: "There is no drop more beloved to Allah the Exalted than a drop of tears from awe of Allah the Exalted or a drop of blood shed in the path of Allah, glorious and exalted is He." And he (peace be upon him) said: "O Allah, grant me two eyes that pour forth, healing the heart with the flow of tears, in awe of You, before tears turn to blood and molars to embers." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Seven whom Allah will shade on a Day when there is no shade but His shade," and he mentioned among them, "a man who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes overflow."

And Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "Whoever is able to weep, let him weep; and whoever is not able, let him pretend to weep." And Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir (may Allah have mercy on him), when he wept, would wipe his face and beard with his tears and say: "It has reached me that the Fire does not consume a place touched by tears." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: "Weep, and if you cannot weep, then pretend to weep. For by the One in whose hand is my soul, if any one of you knew the knowledge, he would scream until his voice was cut off and pray until his back broke." And Abu Sulayman al-Darani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "No eye has gushed with its water except that its owner's face will not be covered with humiliation or abasement on the Day of Resurrection. If his tears flow, Allah will extinguish with the first drop of them oceans of Fire. And if a man were to weep in a community, that community would not be punished." And Abu Sulayman said: "Weeping is from fear and hope, and delight is from longing." And Ka'b al-Ahbar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "By the One in whose hand is my soul, to weep from awe of Allah until my tears flow upon my cheeks is more beloved to me than to give in charity a mountain of gold." And 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: "To shed a single tear from awe of Allah is more beloved to me than to give a thousand dinars in charity." And it is narrated from Hanzalah, who said: "We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and he admonished us with an admonition that softened the hearts and made the eyes flow, and we recognized ourselves..."

I returned to my family, and my wife drew near to me. We engaged in worldly conversation, and I forgot the state we were in with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. We became occupied with worldly matters. Then I remembered our previous state and said to myself, "I have become a hypocrite, for the fear and tenderness that were within me have departed." I went out and began to cry, "Hanzala has become a hypocrite!" Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, met me and said, "No, Hanzala has not become a hypocrite." I entered the presence of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, while saying, "Hanzala has become a hypocrite." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "No, Hanzala has not become a hypocrite." I said, "O Messenger of God, we were with you, and you admonished us with an admonition that made hearts tremble and eyes shed tears, and we recognized our true state. Then I returned to my family, and we became occupied with worldly conversation, and I forgot the state we were in with you." He, peace be upon him, said, "O Hanzala, if you were to remain perpetually in that state, the angels would shake your hands on the roads and upon your beds. But, O Hanzala, there is a time for this and a time for that."

Therefore, all that has been narrated concerning the merit of hope and weeping, the merit of piety and scrupulousness, the merit of knowledge, and the censure of feeling secure from God's plan is indicative of the merit of fear, for the entirety of this is connected to it, either as a cause or as a consequence.

(Clarification that what is superior is the predominance of fear, the predominance of hope, or their equilibrium)

Know that the narrations concerning the merit of fear and hope are numerous. A person examining them might be afflicted by doubt as to which of the two is superior. The question of whether fear is better or hope is better is a flawed question, resembling the statement, "Is bread better or water?" The answer is to say: bread is better for the hungry, and water is better for the thirsty. If both are present, one looks to which need is predominant. If hunger is predominant, then bread is better. If thirst is predominant, then water is better. If they are equal, then they are equal. This is because anything sought for an objective shows its merit relative to that objective, not in and of itself. Fear and hope are two remedies with which hearts are treated. Their merit is according to the disease present. If the disease predominant in the heart is feeling secure from God's plan, Exalted is He, and being deceived by it, then fear is better. If the predominant disease is despair and hopelessness of God's mercy, then hope is better. Likewise, if disobedience is predominant upon the servant, fear is better. It may also be said absolutely that fear is better, according to the interpretation in which it is said bread is better than oxymel, for bread treats the disease of hunger, and oxymel treats the disease of bile. The disease of hunger is more predominant and widespread, so the need for bread is greater, thus it is better. By this consideration, the predominance of fear is better because disobedience and deception are more predominant among creation.

If one looks to the source of fear and hope, then hope is better, for it is drawn from the ocean of mercy, while the source of fear is drawn from the ocean of wrath. Whoever contemplates from God's attributes what necessitates gentleness and mercy will find love more predominant for him, and there is no station beyond love. As for fear, its basis is turning attention to the attributes that necessitate severity; love does not mix with it as it mixes with hope. In summary, that which is desired for something else should be described with the term "most suitable," not "best." Thus we say: For most people, fear is more suitable for them than hope, due to the predominance of disobedience. As for the pious one who has abandoned sin, both apparent and hidden, subtle and obvious, the most suitable is that his fear and hope be balanced. Therefore, it is said: If the fear of a believer and his hope were weighed, they would be equal. It is related that Ali, may God honor his countenance, said to one of his sons, "O my son, fear God with a fear such that you think if you were to bring Him the good deeds of all the people of the earth, He would not accept them from you. And hope in God with a hope such that you think if you were to bring Him the sins of all the people of the earth, He would forgive you." For this reason, Umar, may God be pleased with him, said, "If a call were made for all people to enter the Fire except one man, I would hope that I am that one man. And if a call were made for all people to enter Paradise except one man, I would fear that I am that one man." This expresses the ultimate degree of fear and hope and their equilibrium, with predominance and mastery, but on the path of mutual counterbalance and equality. Thus, one like Umar, may God be pleased with him, should have his fear and hope equal.

As for the disobedient one, if he thinks he is the man excluded from those commanded to enter the Fire, that is evidence of his deception.

If you say: One like Umar, may God be pleased with him, should not have his fear and hope equal; rather, his hope should predominate, as preceded in the beginning of the Book of Hope, and that its strength should be according to the strength of its causes, as illustrated with the example of cultivation and seed. It is known that whoever sows sound seed in pure soil, is constant in tending it, and fulfills all the conditions of cultivation, the hope of attainment predominates in his heart, and his fear is not equal to his hope. Thus should be the states of the God-fearing. Know that he who takes the spiritual knowledges...

Among expressions and examples, slips frequently occur. Though we present this as an illustration, it does not fully parallel our subject in every respect, for the cause of hope's predominance is knowledge gained through experience—since experience teaches the fertility and purity of the soil, the soundness of the seed, the wholesomeness of the air, and the scarcity of destructive lightning in those regions and others. But the example of our matter is a seed whose kind has not been tested, sown in unfamiliar soil the farmer has not known or examined, in lands where it is unknown whether lightning is frequent or not. Such a farmer, even if he exerts his utmost effort and brings all within his power, cannot have his hope overcome his fear. In our question, the seed is faith and its conditions—its soundness is subtle. The soil is the heart, and its hidden impurities are vile; its purification from hidden polytheism, hypocrisy, and ostentation, and the obscurities of its inner traits are ambiguous. The blights are the passions and worldly adornments, and the heart's inclination toward them in future times, even if safe for the moment. This is something not verified or known through experience, for causes may arise that cannot be resisted, and their like has not been experienced. The lightning bolts are the terrors of death's agonies and the turmoil of belief at that time—something whose like has not been experienced. Then the harvest and attainment occur when departing from the Resurrection to Paradise—that too has not been experienced. So whoever knows the realities of these matters, if weak-hearted and timid by nature, his fear will inevitably overcome his hope, as will be recounted in the states of the fearful among the Companions and Followers. But if strong-hearted, steadfast, and perfect in knowledge, his fear and hope are balanced. As for hope predominating—no, it does not. Indeed, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, would intensely scrutinize his heart, even asking Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, if he recognized any traces of hypocrisy in him, since the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, had specially entrusted him with knowledge of the hypocrites. So who is capable of purifying his heart from the hidden aspects of hypocrisy and concealed polytheism? Even if one believes his heart is pure of that, from where can he feel secure from God Almighty's deception in obscuring his state from him and concealing his faults? And even if he trusts in it, from where can he be confident of remaining so until the completion of a good end? For He, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, a man may perform the deeds of the people of Paradise for fifty years, until there remains between him and Paradise but a span," and in another narration: "but the measure of a camel's stride, then the decree overtakes him and he is sealed with the deeds of the people of Hell." The measure of a camel's stride does not allow for physical deeds; it is merely the measure of a fleeting thought that stirs in the heart at death, leading to a bad ending. So how can one feel secure from that? Therefore, the utmost limit for the believer is that his fear and hope are balanced. The predominance of hope in most people is based on delusion and lack of knowledge. Thus, God Almighty combined them in describing those He praised, saying: "They call upon their Lord in fear and hope," and He, exalted is He, said: "And they call upon Us in longing and fear." And where is the like of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him? The people existing in this time—all of them—are most suited to have fear predominate, provided it does not lead them to despair, abandoning works, and cutting off hope of forgiveness, for that becomes a cause for laziness in deeds and an invitation to indulgence in sins. That is despair, not fear. True fear is what urges to action, taints all desires, disturbs the heart from complacency in the world, and calls it to turn away from the abode of delusion. It is the praiseworthy fear, distinct from the whisperings of the soul that have no effect in restraint and urging, and distinct from despair that leads to hopelessness. Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "Whoever worships God purely with fear drowns in seas of anxieties; whoever worships Him purely with hope wanders in the desert of delusion; and whoever worships Him with fear and hope walks straight on the path of remembrance." Mak-hul al-Dimashqi said: "Whoever worships God with fear is a Kharijite; whoever worships Him with hope is a Murji'ite; whoever worships Him with love is a heretic; and whoever worships Him with fear, hope, and love is a monotheist." Thus, it is necessary to combine these matters, and the predominance of fear is most suitable—but before the approach of death. As for at the time of death, the most suitable is the predominance of hope and good expectation, for fear acts as a whip spurring to action, and the time for action has ended. The one approaching death cannot perform deeds, nor can he endure the causes of fear, for that would sever the tendons of his heart and hasten his death. But the spirit of hope strengthens his heart and endears to him his Lord in whom he hopes. No one should leave this world except loving God Almighty, so that he may love meeting God Almighty, for whoever loves meeting God, God loves meeting him. Hope is accompanied by love; whoever hopes for His generosity is beloved. The aim of all knowledge and deeds is knowing God Almighty, so that it may bear fruit.

Knowledge is love, for the ultimate return is to Him, and arrival through death is to Him. Whoever arrives at their Beloved, their joy is magnified according to their love. And whoever is parted from their Beloved, their tribulation and punishment intensify. Thus, whatever dominates the heart at the moment of death—be it love for family, children, wealth, dwelling, property, companions, or friends—this person’s loves are all in the world. Therefore, the world is their paradise, since paradise is the place that gathers all one’s loves. Their death is an exit from paradise and a barrier between them and what they desire, and the state of one who is barred from what they desire is not hidden. If one has no beloved except God Almighty, and except His remembrance, knowledge of Him, and contemplation of Him, while the world and its attachments distract them from the Beloved, then the world is their prison, for prison is the place that prevents the prisoner from finding solace in their loves. Their death is a standing before their Beloved and a liberation from prison, and the state of one who escapes from prison and is left alone with their Beloved, without hindrance or disturbance, is not hidden. This is the first thing every person who leaves the world encounters immediately after death, in terms of reward and punishment, aside from what God has prepared for His righteous servants—what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has not occurred to the heart of any human—and aside from what God Almighty has prepared for those who preferred the life of this world over the Hereafter, were content with it, and felt secure in it: shackles, chains, fetters, and various kinds of disgrace and punishment. So we ask God Almighty to cause us to die as Muslims and join us with the righteous. There is no hope for this supplication to be answered except by acquiring the love of God Almighty, and there is no path to that except by expelling love for other than Him from the heart and severing attachments to everything besides God Almighty, such as status, wealth, and homeland. It is best to supplicate with what our Prophet, peace be upon him, supplicated when he said: “O God, grant me Your love, and the love of those who love You, and the love of that which brings me closer to Your love, and make Your love more beloved to me than cool water.” The point is that the dominance of hope at the time of death is more beneficial, because it is more conducive to love, and the dominance of fear before death is more beneficial, because it burns the fire of desires and suppresses love of the world from the heart. For this reason, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Let none of you die except while having a good opinion of his Lord,” and God Almighty said: “I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think of Me what he wishes.” When Sulayman al-Taymi’s death approached, he said to his son: “O my son, relate to me the concessions and remind me of hope, so that I may meet God with a good opinion of Him.” Likewise, when Sufyan al-Thawri’s death approached and his anxiety intensified, scholars gathered around him to give him hope. And Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may God be pleased with him, said to his son at the time of death: “Remind me of the reports that contain hope and good opinion.” The purpose of all this is that God Almighty makes Himself beloved to the servant. Therefore, God Almighty revealed to David, peace be upon him: “Make Me beloved to My servants.” He said: “How?” He said: “By reminding them of My blessings and favors.” Thus, the ultimate happiness is to die loving God Almighty, and love is attained through knowledge by expelling love of the world from the heart until the entire world becomes like a prison that prevents one from the Beloved. For this reason, one of the righteous saw Abu Sulayman al-Darani in a dream, flying. He asked him, and he said: “Now I have escaped.” When he awoke, he inquired about his condition and was told that he had died the previous night.

(Explanation of the Remedy by Which the State of Fear is Attained)

Know that what we have mentioned regarding the remedy of patience and explained in the Book of Patience and Gratitude is sufficient for this purpose, because patience is not possible except after the attainment of fear and hope. For the first station of religion is certainty, which is the strength of faith in God Almighty, in the Last Day, Paradise, and Hell. This certainty necessarily stirs fear of Hell and hope for Paradise, and hope and fear strengthen one for patience. For Paradise is surrounded by hardships, and one cannot endure them except through the strength of hope; and Hell is surrounded by desires, and one cannot suppress them except through the strength of fear. Therefore, Ali, may God honor his face, said: “Whoever yearns for Paradise turns away from desires, and whoever fears Hell returns from forbidden things.” Then, the station of patience, derived from fear and hope, leads to the station of striving and devotion to the remembrance of God Almighty and contemplation of Him perpetually. Perpetual remembrance leads to intimacy, and perpetual contemplation leads to perfect knowledge. Perfect knowledge and intimacy lead to love, followed by the station of contentment, reliance, and other stations. This is the order in traversing the stages of religion. After the foundation of certainty, there is no station except fear and hope; and after them, there is no station except patience, and through it, striving and devotion to God outwardly and inwardly. After striving, for one who is opened the path, there is no station except guidance and knowledge; and after knowledge, there is no station except love and intimacy. By necessity...

Love is contentment with the Beloved's decree and trust in His care, which is reliance. Thus, in what we have mentioned regarding the remedy for patience, there is sufficiency. Yet we shall devote a comprehensive discourse to fear, saying: Fear arises through two distinct ways, one higher than the other. Its example is that when a child is in a house and a lion or a serpent enters upon him, perhaps he does not fear, and may even extend his hand to the serpent to take it and play with it. But if his father, who is discerning, is with him and fears the serpent and flees from it, then if the child sees his father trembling in terror and contriving to escape from it, he rises with him and fear overcomes him, and he joins in the flight. So the father's fear is from insight and knowledge of the serpent's attributes, its poison, its peculiarity, and the lion's ferocity, its assault, and its lack of concern. As for the son's fear, it is belief by mere imitation, because he thinks well of his father and knows that he only fears from a cause that is fearful in itself, so he knows that the lion is fearful, yet does not know the reason. When you understand this example, know that fear of God Most High is of two stations: one is fear of His punishment, and the second is fear of Him. As for fear of Him, it is the fear of the scholars and the possessors of hearts, those who know from His attributes what necessitates awe, fear, and caution, those who are aware of the secret of His saying, exalted is He: "And God warns you of Himself" (Qur'an 3:28), and His saying, mighty and majestic: "Fear God as He should be feared" (Qur'an 3:102). As for the first, it is the fear of the generality of creation, and it is attained by the fundamental belief in Paradise and Hell, and that they are two recompenses for obedience and disobedience, and its weakness is due to heedlessness and weakness of faith. Heedlessness is only removed by reminder and admonition, and by persistent reflection on the terrors of the Day of Resurrection and the varieties of punishment in the Hereafter. It is also removed by looking upon those who fear and keeping their company, and witnessing their states; if witnessing is missed, then hearing is not devoid of effect. As for the second, which is the higher, it is that God is the One feared—I mean that the servant fears being veiled from Him and hopes for nearness to Him. Dhu al-Nun, may God have mercy on him, said: "Fear of the Fire compared to fear of separation is like a drop dripped into a vast ocean." This is the awe of the scholars, as He Most High said: "Only those fear God among His servants who have knowledge" (Qur'an 35:28). The generality of believers also have a share of this awe, but it is by mere imitation as well; it is like the child's fear of the serpent in imitation of his father, and that is not based on insight, so it is no wonder that it weakens and vanishes quickly. Indeed, the child may see the charmer approach to take the serpent, and look at him and be deceived by him, and dare to take it in imitation of him, just as he refrained from taking it in imitation of his father. Imitative beliefs are generally weak, unless they are strengthened by witnessing their confirming causes continually, and by adhering to their requirements in multiplying acts of obedience and avoiding sins for a long duration consistently. Therefore, whoever ascends to the pinnacle of knowledge and knows God Most High fears Him necessarily, just as one who knows the lion and sees himself fallen into its claws does not need a remedy to bring fear to his heart; rather, he fears it necessarily, whether he wills or not. Thus, God Most High revealed to David, upon him be peace: "Fear Me as you fear a predatory lion." There is no means to bring fear of a predatory lion except knowing the lion and knowing the occurrence of falling into its claws, so no means is needed. Likewise, whoever knows God Most High knows that He does what He wills and does not care, and decrees what He desires and does not fear. He brings the angels near without any prior means, and banishes Iblis without any past crime. Rather, His attribute is what His saying translates: "These are in Paradise and I do not care, and these are in the Fire and I do not care." And if it occurs to your mind that He does not punish except for disobedience and does not reward except for obedience, then reflect that He did not provide the obedient one with the means of obedience until he obeys, whether he wills or not, and did not provide the disobedient one with the incitements to disobedience until he disobeys, whether he wills or not. For whenever He creates heedlessness, desire, and the ability to fulfill desire, the action occurs by necessity. If He banished him because he disobeyed Him, then why did He compel him to disobedience? Is that for a prior disobedience, so that it regresses to infinity, or does it inevitably stop at a first cause that has no reason from the side of the servant? Rather, it was decreed for him in pre-eternity. And from this meaning, He expressed when He said: "Adam and Moses, upon them be peace, argued before their Lord, and Adam overcame Moses. Moses said: 'You are Adam whom God created with His hand, breathed into you of His spirit, made the angels prostrate to you, and settled you in His Garden; then you caused the people to descend to earth by your error.' Adam said: 'You are Moses whom God chose for His message and His speech, and gave you the tablets wherein is an explanation of everything, and brought you near as a confidant. For how long did you find God had written the Torah before

Adam said, "Did you find it written that I would disobey?" Moses replied, "Yes." Adam then said, "Do you blame me for an act that God had decreed upon me forty years before He created me?" Thus Adam prevailed over Moses in argument. Whoever comprehends the cause behind this matter with a perception arising from the light of guidance is among the select knowers, those granted insight into the secret of divine decree. And whoever hears this and believes, accepting it through mere hearing, is among the general body of believers. Both groups attain fear: if a servant, he finds himself in the grasp of divine power like a weak child in the claws of a lion. The lion may, by coincidence, become heedless and release him, or may pounce and devour him—that depends on what coincides. Such coincidence has causes arranged according to a known measure, but if attributed to one who does not know it, it is called coincidence; if attributed to God's knowledge, it cannot be called coincidence. Were the one in the lion's claws to perfect his knowledge, he would not fear the lion, for the lion is subjugated: if hunger is imposed upon it, it devours; if heedlessness is imposed, it releases and leaves. Thus, one fears only the Creator of the lion and the Creator of its attributes. I do not say that fearing God is like fearing a lion; rather, when the veil is lifted, it is known that fear of the lion is precisely fear of God, for the One who destroys through the lion is God. Know that the beasts of the Hereafter are like the beasts of this world, and God has created causes of punishment and causes of reward, and for each He has created people whom the decree—branching from the eternal, definitive ordainment—drives toward what they were created for. He created Paradise and created for it people subjugated to its causes, willing or not; and He created Hell and created for it people subjugated to its causes, willing or not. Thus, no one sees himself in the crashing waves of divine decree without being overwhelmed by fear necessarily. These are the fears of those who know the secret of divine decree. As for one held back by incapacity from rising to the station of insight, his way is to treat his soul by hearing reports and traditions, studying the states and sayings of the fearful knowers, and comparing their intellects and ranks to the ranks of the deluded hopeful, so that he will not doubt that following them is preferable, for they are the prophets, the saints, and the scholars. As for the secure, they are the Pharaohs, the ignorant, and the wealthy. As for our Messenger, peace be upon him, he is the master of the first and the last, and he was the most fearful of people. It is narrated that he prayed over a child, and in one narration it is said that he was heard in his supplication saying, "O God, protect him from the punishment of the grave and the punishment of the Fire." In a second narration: "He heard someone say, 'Congratulations, a bird from the birds of Paradise,' and he became angry and said, 'What makes you know it is so? By God, I am the Messenger of God and I do not know what will be done with me. Indeed, God created Paradise and created for it people; they are neither increased nor decreased.'" And it is narrated that he, peace be upon him, said the same over the funeral of Uthman ibn Maz'un, one of the first emigrants, when Umm Salamah said, "Congratulations to you for Paradise." After that, Umm Salamah would say, "By God, I will not praise anyone after Uthman." And Muhammad ibn Khawlah al-Hanafiyyah said, "By God, I will not praise anyone except the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and my father who begot me." Then the Shi'a rose against him, and he began recounting the virtues and merits of Ali. In another hadith: "A man from the People of the Suffah was martyred, and his mother said, 'Congratulations, a bird from the birds of Paradise; you emigrated to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and were killed in the way of God.' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'What makes you know? Perhaps he used to speak of what does not benefit him and withhold what does not harm him.'" In another hadith: "He, peace be upon him, visited one of his companions who was ill and heard a woman say, 'Congratulations to you for Paradise.' He said, 'Who is this presuming upon God?' The sick man said, 'She is my mother, O Messenger of God.' He said, 'What makes you know? Perhaps so-and-so used to speak of what does not concern him and be stingy with what does not enrich him.'" How could all believers not fear when he, peace be upon him, says, "Surah Hud and its sisters have aged me"—meaning Surah al-Waqi'ah, "When the sun is wrapped up," and "'Amma yatasa'alun." The scholars said perhaps that is due to what is in Surah Hud of remoteness, such as God's words: "So away with 'Ad, the people of Hud," "And away with Thamud," "And away with Midian as was done away with Thamud"—despite his knowledge, peace be upon him, that had God willed, they would not have associated others with Him, for had He willed, He would have guided every soul. And in Surah al-Waqi'ah: "Its occurrence is not to be denied, lowering, raising"—meaning the Pen has dried with what is to be, and the precedent is completed until al-Waqi'ah descends, either lowering a people who were raised in the world or raising a people who were lowered in the world. And in Surah at-Takwir are the terrors of the Day of Resurrection and the unveiling of the end, as God says: "And when Hellfire is set ablaze, and when Paradise is brought near, a soul will know what it has brought forth."

About what are they asking? "On the Day when a person will behold what his hands have put forth" (Quran 78:40). And His saying, exalted is He: "They will not speak except to whom the Most Merciful has given permission, and he will say what is correct" (Quran 78:38). And the Quran, from its beginning to its end, is filled with warnings for one who recites it with contemplation. Even if there were nothing in it except His saying, exalted is He: "And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteous work and then continues in guidance" (Quran 20:82), it would be sufficient, for He has made forgiveness contingent upon four conditions which the servant is incapable of fulfilling individually. More severe than that is His saying, exalted is He: "But as for one who repents and believes and does righteousness, it may be that he will be among the successful" (Quran 28:67). And His saying, exalted is He: "That He may question the truthful about their truth" (Quran 33:8). And His saying, exalted is He: "We will attend to you, O prominent beings" (Quran 55:31). And His saying, mighty and majestic is He: "Then do they feel secure from the plan of Allah?" (Quran 7:99) the verse. And His saying: "And thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the cities while they are wronging. Indeed, His seizure is painful and severe" (Quran 11:102). And His saying, exalted is He: "The Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as honored guests" (Quran 19:85) the two verses. And His saying, exalted is He: "And there is none of you except he will come to it" (Quran 19:71) the verse. And His saying: "Do whatever you will" (Quran 41:40) the verse. And His saying: "Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest" (Quran 42:20) the verse. His saying: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it" (Quran 99:7) the two verses. And His saying, exalted is He: "And We will proceed to what they have done of deeds" (Quran 46:19) the verse. And likewise His saying, exalted is He: "By time, Indeed, mankind is in loss" (Quran 103:1-2) to the end of the Surah. These are four conditions for salvation from loss. The fear of the Prophets, despite the abundant blessings bestowed upon them, was because they did not feel secure from the plan of Allah, exalted is He: "And none feels secure from the plan of Allah except the losing people" (Quran 7:99). It is even narrated that the Prophet and Gabriel, peace be upon them both, wept out of fear of Allah, exalted is He. So Allah revealed to them, "Why do you weep when I have granted you security?" They said, "And who can feel secure from Your plan?" It is as if, when they knew that Allah is the Knower of the unseen and that they had no grasp of the ultimate ends of matters, they did not feel secure that His saying "I have granted you security" might be a trial and a test for them, and a plan against them, such that if their fear subsided, it would become apparent that they had indeed felt secure from the plan and had not been true to their statement. Just as when Abraham, peace be upon him, was placed in the catapult, he said, "Sufficient for me is Allah," and this was among the greatest supplications. He was tested and confronted by Gabriel in the air until he said, "Do you have any need?" He replied, "As for from you, no." That was being true to the reality of his statement "Sufficient for me is Allah." So Allah, exalted is He, informed about him, saying, "And [mention] Abraham, who fulfilled [his obligations]" (Quran 53:37) – meaning, by fulfilling the requirement of his statement "Sufficient for me is Allah." And with similar meaning, He informed about Moses, peace be upon him, when he said: "Indeed, we fear that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress." [Allah] said, "Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see" (Quran 20:45-46). Yet despite this, when the magicians threw their magic, Moses felt fear within himself, for he did not feel secure from the plan of Allah, and the matter became confused for him until reassurance was renewed for him and it was said to him, "Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior" (Quran 20:68). And when the strength of the Muslims weakened on the day of Badr, he, peace be upon him, said: "O Allah, if You destroy this band, there will remain no one on the face of the earth who worships You." So Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Desist from imploring your Lord, for He will be true to you with what He promised you." Thus, the station of al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, was the station of trust in Allah's promise, while the station of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was the station of fear from the plan of Allah, and it is more complete, for it stems only from perfect knowledge of the secrets of Allah, exalted is He, the hidden aspects of His actions, and the meanings of His attributes, some of which are expressed by the term 'plan'. No human being can grasp the essence of Allah's attributes, exalted is He. Whoever knows the reality of knowledge – the deficiency of his knowledge in encompassing the core of matters – his fear will inevitably be great. For this reason, Jesus, peace be upon him, said when it was said to him: "Did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?'" He said, "Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself" (Quran 5:116). And he said: "If You punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them" (Quran 5:118) the verse. He referred the matter entirely to the Will, removing himself completely from the affair, knowing that he had no part in the command and that matters are connected to the Will in a way that transcends the limits of reason and convention. It is not possible to judge them by analogy, conjecture, or calculation, let alone by certainty and conviction. This is what has severed the hearts of the knowers, for the greatest calamity is the connection of your affair to the will of One who does not care about you. If He destroys you, He has destroyed countless others like you, and He continually torments them in this world with various pains and illnesses, and sickens their hearts with disbelief and hypocrisy, then makes the punishment eternal for them forever. Then He informs about Himself and says: "And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will be fulfilled: 'I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind all together'" (Quran 32:13). And He, exalted is He, said: "And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled: 'I will surely fill Hell'" (Quran 11:119).

How then can one not fear what has been decreed in eternity, nor hope to recover it? For if the matter were otherwise, hopes would extend to devising a means therein. But there is nothing except submission to it, and inferring the hidden decree from the evident causes apparent to the heart and limbs. Thus, for whom the means to evil are facilitated and he is barred from the means to good, and his attachment to the world is firmly established, it is as if the secret of the decree that preceded him with wretchedness has been unveiled to him in truth, for "everyone is facilitated for what he was created for." And if all good deeds are facilitated, and the heart is entirely severed from the world, turning to God with its outward and inward, this would necessitate a lessening of fear—if constancy in that state were assured. But the peril of the end and the difficulty of steadfastness increase the flames of fear and prevent them from being extinguished. How can one feel secure from a change in state when the heart of the believer is between two fingers of the fingers of the Most Merciful, and the heart is more volatile than a boiling pot? And the Turner of hearts, exalted is He, has said: "Indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not to be taken for granted." So the most ignorant of people is he who feels secure from it while it calls out with warning against security. And if God had not been gentle with His knowing servants by reviving their hearts with the spirit of hope, their hearts would have burned from the fire of fear. Thus, the means of hope are a mercy for the elect of God, and the means of heedlessness are a mercy for the common people in a sense, for if the veil were lifted, souls would perish and hearts would be torn from fear of the Turner of hearts. Some of the knowers said: "If there were fifty years between me and one I knew to be a monotheist, and he died, I would not affirm monotheism for him, for I do not know what change appeared to him." And another said: "If martyrdom were at the door of the house and death upon Islam at the door of the room, I would choose death upon Islam, for I do not know what may occur to my heart between the door of the room and the door of the house." And Abu al-Darda' would swear by God: "No one feels secure about his faith that it will not be stripped from him except that it is stripped." And Sahl would say: "The fear of the truthful from a bad ending is with every thought and every movement, and they are those whom God described when He said: 'And their hearts are fearful.'" And when Sufyan was near death, he wept and was distressed. It was said to him: "O Abu 'Abd Allah, rely on hope, for God's forgiveness is greater than your sins." He replied: "Is it over my sins that I weep? If I knew I would die upon monotheism, I would not care if I met God with sins like mountains." And it is related from one of the fearful that he instructed a brother, saying: "When death approaches me, sit at my head. If you see me die upon monotheism, take all that I possess, buy almonds and sugar, and scatter them among the children of the town, and say: 'This is the wedding feast of the escaped one.' But if I die upon other than monotheism, inform the people of that so they are not deceived by attending my funeral, that only those who wish may attend my funeral with insight, lest hypocrisy afflict me after death." He asked: "And how will I know that?" So he mentioned a sign to him, and he saw the sign of monotheism at his death, so he bought sugar and almonds and distributed them. And Sahl would say: "The seeker fears being afflicted with disobedience, while the knower fears being afflicted with disbelief." And Abu Zayd would say: "When I head to the mosque, it is as if there is a girdle around my waist, fearing it may take me to the church and the house of fire, until I enter the mosque and the girdle is removed from me. This happens to me five times a day." And it is related from Jesus, peace be upon him, that he said: "O company of disciples, you fear disobedience, while we, the company of prophets, fear disbelief." And it is related in the stories of the prophets that a prophet complained to God of hunger, lice, and nakedness for years, and his garment was wool. So God revealed to him: "My servant, are you not content that I have protected your heart from disbelieving in Me, that you ask Me for the world?" So he took dust and placed it on his head, saying: "Yes, I am content, O Lord, so protect me from disbelief." If such is the fear of the knowers, with their firm footing and strong faith, from a bad ending, how can the weak not fear it? And a bad ending has causes that precede death, such as innovation, hypocrisy, arrogance, and a host of blameworthy traits. For that reason, the Companions' fear of hypocrisy intensified, to the point that al-Hasan said: "If I knew I were free from hypocrisy, it would be dearer to me than all that the sun rises upon." And they did not mean the hypocrisy that is the opposite of the foundation of faith, but rather what coexists with the foundation of faith, so one is a Muslim hypocrite. It has many signs: He said, peace be upon him: "Four traits, whoever has them is a pure hypocrite, even if he prays, fasts, and claims to be a Muslim. And if there is one trait among them in him, there is a branch of hypocrisy in him until he abandons it: when he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks it; when entrusted, he betrays; and when he disputes, he acts immorally." In another wording: "And when..."

He who breaks his covenant) The Companions and Successors interpreted hypocrisy with explanations that none is free from except the sincere believer. Al-Hasan said: "Indeed, part of hypocrisy is the discrepancy between the private and the public, the discrepancy between the tongue and the heart, and the discrepancy between entry and exit." And who is free from these meanings? Rather, these matters have become familiar and customary among people, and they have forgotten that they are utterly reprehensible. Indeed, this occurred close to the time of prophethood, so what is the assumption regarding our time? Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, said: "A man would speak a word during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and thereby become a hypocrite. Verily, I hear it from one of you ten times a day." The Companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, used to say: "You perform deeds that are finer in your eyes than a hair, yet we used to count them among the major sins during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." Some of them said: "The sign of hypocrisy is that you dislike in people what you do yourself, that you love for the sake of some injustice, and that you hate for the sake of some truth." It is said of hypocrisy: that when he is praised for something not in him, it pleases him. A man said to Ibn 'Umar, may God have mercy on him: "We enter upon these rulers and affirm them in what they say, but when we leave we speak about them." He replied: "We used to count this as hypocrisy during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." It is narrated that he heard a man reviling and disparaging al-Hajjaj, and said: "Tell me, if al-Hajjaj were present, would you speak as you have spoken?" He said: "No." He said: "We used to count this as hypocrisy during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." More severe than that is what is narrated: that a group sat at Hudhayfah's door waiting for him, and they were speaking about some matter concerning him. When he came out to them, they fell silent out of shyness before him. He said: "Speak about what you were saying," but they remained silent. He said: "We used to count this as hypocrisy during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him." This Hudhayfah was uniquely endowed with knowledge of the hypocrites and the causes of hypocrisy. He used to say: "There comes upon the heart a moment when it is filled with faith until hypocrisy has no place for the point of a needle, and there comes upon it a moment when it is filled with hypocrisy until faith has no place for the point of a needle." From this, you have come to know that the fear of the knowers of God is of an evil ending, and its cause is matters that precede it: among them are innovations, among them are sins, and among them is hypocrisy. When is a servant free from something of that totality? Even if he thinks he is free from it, that is hypocrisy, for it is said: "Whoever feels secure from hypocrisy is a hypocrite." One of them said to a certain knower of God: "I fear hypocrisy for myself." He replied: "If you were a hypocrite, you would not fear hypocrisy." Thus, the knower of God remains constantly between reflecting on what has passed and the ending, fearful of both. For this reason, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The believing servant is between two fears: between a term that has passed, and he does not know what God has decreed for him therein, and a term that remains, and he does not know what God will decree for him therein. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, after death there is no chance to make amends, and after this world there is no abode except Paradise or Hell." And God is the One whose help is sought.

(Explanation of the Meaning of an Evil Ending)

If you say: "The fear of most of these people returns to an evil ending. So what is the meaning of 'ending'?" Know that an evil ending is of two levels, one greater than the other. As for the great, dreadful level: it is that the heart is overcome at the time of death's agonies and the appearance of its terrors, either by doubt or by denial. Then the soul is taken while in a state of the dominance of denial or doubt, so what dominated the heart—the knot of denial—becomes a veil between it and God, the Exalted, forever. That necessitates permanent remoteness and everlasting punishment. The second level, which is lesser than it, is that his heart is overcome at death by love for some matter of worldly affairs or a desire from its desires. That is then represented in his heart and consumes him entirely, so that in that state there remains no room for anything else. It then coincides that his soul is taken in that condition, so the total absorption of his heart with it causes him to bow his head toward the world and turn his face to it. Whenever the face is turned away from God, the Exalted, a veil occurs, and whenever a veil occurs, punishment descends, for the kindled Fire of God only seizes those veiled from Him. As for the believer whose heart is sound from love of the world and whose concern is directed to God, the Exalted, the Fire will say to him: "Pass, O believer, for your light has extinguished my flame." Whenever it coincides that the soul is taken in a state dominated by love of the world, the matter is perilous, for a person dies upon what he lived upon, and it is not possible to acquire another quality for the heart after death that opposes the quality dominating it, since hearts are only influenced by the acts of the limbs, and the limbs have been nullified by death, so the acts are nullified. Thus, there is no hope for action, nor hope to return to the world to make up for it. At that point, regret becomes immense. However, if the foundation of faith and love of God, the Exalted, had become firmly rooted in the heart for a long time and was confirmed by deeds...

For the righteous, it removes from the heart this state that befell it at death. If his faith was strong to the measure of a mustard seed, it will bring him out of the Fire in a nearer time. If it was less than that, his stay in the Fire will be prolonged. Even if it were only the weight of a single grain, it will inevitably bring him out of the Fire, even if after thousands of years.

If you say: What you have mentioned implies that the Fire would hasten to him immediately after his death, so why is he delayed until the Day of Resurrection and given respite for this long duration? Then know that anyone who denies the punishment of the grave is an innovator, veiled from the light of God Almighty, from the light of the Qur'an, and from the light of faith. Rather, what is correct in the view of those of insight is what the sound reports have confirmed, which is: "The grave is either a pit from the pits of Hellfire or a garden from the gardens of Paradise." And "that seventy doors from Hellfire may be opened to the grave of the one being punished," as the reports have conveyed. His soul does not depart from him except that tribulation has descended upon him if he was wretched due to a bad ending. The varieties of punishment differ according to the differing times: the questioning by Munkar and Nakir occurs upon placement in the grave, the punishment after that, then the scrutiny in the Reckoning, the exposure before a gathering of witnesses on the Day of Resurrection, then after that the peril of the Bridge and the terror of the Zabaniyah, to the end of what the reports have conveyed. Thus, the wretched one remains, in all his states, tossed between varieties of punishment, and in the totality of states he is punished, unless God envelops him in His mercy.

Do not think that the seat of faith is not consumed by the earth. Rather, the earth consumes all the limbs and scatters them until the appointed term of the Book arrives. Then the scattered parts are gathered and the soul, which is the seat of faith, is restored to it. From the time of death until the restoration, it was either in the crops of green birds suspended beneath the Throne if it was fortunate, or in a state contrary to this if it was—God forbid—wretched.

If you say: What is the cause that leads to a bad ending? Then know that the causes of these matters cannot be enumerated in detail, but their general categories can be indicated. As for sealing upon doubt and denial, its cause is confined to two things. One of them can occur even with complete scrupulousness, asceticism, and complete righteousness in deeds, like the innovating ascetic, for his outcome is very perilous even if his deeds are righteous—and I do not mean a specific school of thought. I say it is innovation. Rather, I mean by innovation that a man believes about the Essence of God, His attributes, and His actions contrary to the truth, believing about Him contrary to what He is, either by his opinion, his intellect, and his reasoning with which he disputes the opponent and upon which he relies and by which he is deceived, or by blindly following one who is in this state. When death approaches and the forelock of the Angel of Death appears to him, and the heart is agitated by what is within it, perhaps the falsehood of what he ignorantly believed is unveiled to him during the agonies of death, for the state of death is a state of the veil being lifted, and the beginnings of its agonies are from it. Thus, some matters may be unveiled by it. Whenever what he believed is invalidated for him—and he had been certain and sure of it within himself—he does not think that he erred in this specific belief, due to his reliance in it on his corrupt opinion and deficient intellect. Rather, he thinks that everything he believed has no foundation, for he made no distinction in his mind between his faith in God and His Messenger and his other sound beliefs, and his corrupt belief. Thus, the unveiling of some of his beliefs due to ignorance becomes a cause for the invalidation of his remaining beliefs or for his doubt in them. If his soul departs in this perilous thought before he is re-established and returns to the foundation of faith, then he is sealed with evil, and his soul departs upon polytheism—God forbid from it. These are the ones intended by His saying, exalted is He: "And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had not taken into account," and by His saying, mighty and majestic: "Say, 'Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds? [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work.'" And just as what will be in the future is unveiled in sleep due to the lightness of worldly preoccupations from the heart, likewise some matters are unveiled in the agonies of death, for the distractions of the world and the desires of the body are what prevent the heart from gazing upon the dominion so that it may read what is on the Preserved Tablet, for matters to be unveiled to him as they truly are. Thus, a state like this becomes a cause for unveiling, and the unveiling becomes a cause for doubt in the remaining beliefs. Whoever believes about God Almighty, His attributes, and His actions something contrary to what He is, whether by blind following or by opinion and intellect, he is in this peril. Asceticism and righteousness are not sufficient to repel this peril. Rather, nothing saves from it except true belief. The simple-minded are safe from this peril—I mean those who believe in God and His Messenger.

And faith in the Last Day as a comprehensive, firmly rooted belief, like that of the Bedouins, the Sawādiyyah, and the rest of the common folk who did not delve into investigation and speculative reasoning, nor did they independently venture into theological discourse, nor did they incline to the various schools of theologians in blindly following their differing assertions. For this reason, the Prophet ﷺ said: "The majority of the inhabitants of Paradise are the simple-minded." And for this reason, the early forbears prohibited investigation, speculative reasoning, delving into theological discourse, and probing into these matters. They commanded the creation to restrict themselves to believing in all that God, the Mighty and Majestic, has revealed, and in everything that came in the apparent texts, while holding the belief in the negation of anthropomorphism. They forbade them from delving into interpretation, because the danger in investigating the attributes is immense, its obstacles are formidable, its paths are rugged, and intellects are incapable of grasping the majesty of God, the Exalted. The guidance of God, the Exalted, with the light of certainty is veiled from hearts due to what they are naturally disposed to—the love of this world. What the investigators mention with the merchandise of their intellects is conflicting and contradictory. Hearts are attached to and cling to what was cast into them at the beginning of creation. The raging fanaticisms among people are firm nails securing inherited beliefs, or those taken with good assumption from teachers at the outset. Then, natural dispositions are infatuated with the love of this world, inclined towards it, and worldly desires seize them by the throat, diverting them from complete reflection. So, if the door of discourse about God and His attributes is opened based on opinion and reason, given the disparity in people's innate abilities and their differences in natures, and the eagerness of every ignorant person among them to claim perfection or to encompass the reality of the Truth, their tongues will utter whatever occurs to each one of them. That will attach to the hearts of those who listen to them and become firmly established through prolonged familiarity among them. Thus, the path of salvation becomes completely blocked for them. The safety of the creation lay in occupying themselves with righteous deeds and not exposing themselves to what is beyond the limit of their capacity. But now, the reins have been slackened, nonsense has become widespread, and every ignorant person has descended upon what agrees with his nature based on conjecture and assumption, while he believes that this is knowledge and certainty, and that it is the pure essence of faith. He thinks that what he has arrived at through guesswork and conjecture is the knowledge of certainty and the essence of certainty. "And you will surely know its tidings after a while." And concerning these people, when the veil is lifted, it should be recited:
      You thought well of the days when they were good, and did not fear the evil that fate might bring.
      And the nights were safe to you, so you were deceived by them, yet at the very clarity of nights, trouble occurs.
And know with certainty that everyone who departs from the simple faith in God, His Messenger, and His Books, and delves into investigation, has indeed exposed himself to this danger. His example is like one whose ship has broken while he is in tumultuous waves, one wave throwing him to another. Perhaps by chance it may cast him to the shore, but that is remote, and destruction is more likely for him. And everyone who settles upon a creed he has snatched from the investigators with the merchandise of their intellects, either with the proofs they formulated in their fanaticisms or without proofs—if he is doubtful in it, his religion is corrupt; and if he is confident, he is secure from the guile of God, deceived by his deficient intellect. Every delver into investigation does not escape these two states except if he transcends the limits of the rational to the light of unveiling, which shines in the realm of sainthood and prophethood. That is the Red Sulfur, and it is rare and difficult. Only the simple-minded among the common folk, or those whose fear of the Fire preoccupied them with obeying God so they did not delve into this superfluity, are safe from this danger. This is one of the dangerous causes leading to a bad ending.

As for the second cause, it is weakness of faith in the first place, then the domination of the love of this world over the heart. Whenever faith weakens, the love of God, the Exalted, weakens, and the love of this world strengthens, until it reaches a point where no place remains in the heart for the love of God, the Exalted, except as a mere passing thought, and no effect of it appears in opposing the lower self and deviating from the path of Satan. This results in immersion in following desires until the heart becomes dark, hardens, blackens, and the darkness of the souls accumulates upon the heart. It continually extinguishes what little light of faith remains within it until it becomes a natural disposition and a covering. When the agonies of death come, that love—meaning the love of God—weakens further due to the feeling of separation from this world, which is the dominant beloved in the heart. The heart suffers from feeling the separation from this world and sees that as coming from God. Thus, his conscience is agitated by rejecting what has been decreed for him—death—and disliking it because it is from God. He fears that hatred of God, the Exalted, may arise in his inner being instead of love. Just as one who loves his child with a weak love, if his child were to take his wealth—which is more beloved to him than his child—and burn it, that weak love would turn to hatred. If his soul happens to depart at that very moment when this dangerous thought occurs, then he is sealed with evil and perishes eternally. The cause that leads to such an ending is the predominance of the love of this world, complacency towards it, and delight in it.

by its causes, along with weak faith that leads to a feeble love for God Almighty. Whoever finds in his heart love for God predominant over love for the world—even if he also loves the world—is farther from this peril. Love of the world is the root of every sin and the incurable malady, and it has become widespread among all classes of creation. All of this is due to scant knowledge of God Almighty, for none loves Him except he who knows Him. Thus, God Almighty has said: "Say, 'If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kinsfolk, wealth you have acquired, commerce you fear may slacken, and dwellings you delight in are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until God brings His command.'" Therefore, whoever parts with his soul in a state of harboring denial against God Almighty in his mind, and manifests hatred for God's decree in his heart due to the separation from his family, wealth, and all his desires, his death becomes an arrival at what he detests and a departure from what he loves. Thus, he comes before God as a fleeing, hateful servant brought forcibly before his Master—what disgrace and punishment he deserves is not hidden.

As for the one who dies upon love, he comes before God Almighty as a devoted, yearning servant who has endured the hardships of deeds and the toil of journeys in hope of meeting his Master. What joy and delight he meets upon merely arriving, let alone what he deserves of subtle honors and wondrous favors, is not hidden.

As for the second ending, which is lesser than the first and does not entail eternal abode in the Fire, it also has two causes: one is abundant sins even if faith is strong, and the other is weak faith even if sins are few. This is because committing sins stems from the dominance of desires and their entrenchment in the heart through frequent familiarity and habit. All that a person becomes accustomed to in his life returns to his remembrance at the time of death. If his greater inclination is toward acts of obedience, then what mostly occupies him is the remembrance of obeying God. If his greater inclination is toward sins, their remembrance dominates his heart at death, so perhaps his soul is taken while a worldly desire or a sin prevails, and thus his heart becomes bound to it and veiled from God Almighty. He who commits sin only occasionally is farther from this peril; he who never commits a sin is very far from this peril; and he in whom sins dominate, exceeding his acts of obedience, and whose heart finds more joy in them than in acts of obedience—this peril is exceedingly great for him.

We recognize this through an example: it is not hidden from you that a person sees in his sleep a host of conditions he has experienced throughout his life, such that he sees only what resembles his waking observations. Even an adolescent who experiences nocturnal emission does not see the image of intercourse if he has not engaged in it while awake; were he to remain thus, he would not see the image of intercourse upon emission. Moreover, it is not hidden that one who spent his life in jurisprudence sees more conditions related to knowledge and scholars than a merchant who spent his life in trade, and the merchant sees more conditions related to commerce and its means than a physician or jurist. For what appears in the state of sleep is what has gained affinity with the heart through prolonged familiarity or another cause. Death resembles sleep but is above it; yet the agonies of death and the swoon that precedes it are close to sleep, so that leads to the recollection of the familiar and its return to the heart. One of the causes that weighs in favor of its recollection in the heart is prolonged familiarity. Thus, prolonged familiarity with sins or acts of obedience also weighs in favor. Likewise, the dreams of the righteous differ from those of the wicked. The dominance of familiarity may cause an obscene image to take form in his heart, and his soul inclines toward it, so perhaps his soul is taken while upon it, and that becomes a cause for his evil ending—even if the root of faith remains such that salvation from it is hoped for.

And just as what occurs to the mind while awake occurs due to a specific cause known to God Almighty, so too individual dreams have causes with God Almighty; we know some and not others. As we know, a thought shifts from one thing to what corresponds to it, whether through similarity, opposition, or association by having been perceived together. Through similarity, as when one looks at something beautiful and recalls another beautiful thing; through opposition, as when one looks at something beautiful and recalls something ugly, contemplating the vast difference between them; through association, as when one looks at a horse he had seen before with a person and recalls that person. A thought may shift from one thing to another without knowing the aspect of their correspondence; that occurs through an intermediary or two intermediaries—such as shifting from one thing to a second, and from it to a third, then forgetting the second, with no direct relation between the third and the first.

Appropriate, and there is a connection between it and the second, and between the second and the first, a connection. Likewise, the transitions of thoughts in dreams have causes of this kind, and similarly during the agonies of death. Based on this—and God knows best—whoever's predominant occupation is sewing, you will see him on that day nodding his head as if taking his needle to sew with it, wetting the finger accustomed to the thimble, taking the garment from above, measuring and spanning it as if undertaking its tailoring, then extending his hand to the scissors. Whoever wishes to restrain his thoughts from shifting to sins and desires has no way except striving throughout his life in weaning his soul from them and in suppressing desires from the heart. This is the extent that falls under choice, and persistent adherence to good and purifying thought from evil become provision and stores for the state of death's agonies. For a person dies upon what he lived and is resurrected upon what he died upon. Therefore, it is related about a grocer that he was being prompted at death with the words of testimony, but he would say, "Five, six, four," for his soul was preoccupied with the accounting he had long been accustomed to before death. Some of the knowledgeable among the predecessors said: The Throne is a jewel gleaming with light, so the servant is not in any state except that its likeness is imprinted upon the Throne in the form he was upon. When he is in the agonies of death, his image from the Throne is unveiled to him, so perhaps he sees himself in the form of a sin. Likewise, it is unveiled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he sees the states of his soul, and he is seized by shame and fear beyond description. What he mentioned is correct, and the cause of truthful visions is close to that, for the sleeper perceives what will be in the future by viewing the Preserved Tablet, and it is a part of prophethood. If an evil ending reverts to the states of the heart and the stirring of thoughts—and the Turner of Hearts is God—the coincidences necessitating evil thoughts are not entirely within choice, though long habituation to them has an effect. By this, the fear of the knowers of God from an evil ending is magnified. For if a person wished to see in sleep only the states of the righteous and the states of obedience and worship, it would be difficult for him, even though abundant righteousness and persistence in it have an effect. The disturbances of imagination do not entirely fall under control, though the predominant connection is between what appears in sleep and what predominates in wakefulness. Until I heard Shaykh Abū ‘Alī al-Fāramadhī, God's mercy upon him, describing to me the necessity of the disciple's good conduct toward his shaykh, and that there should be no denial in his heart for whatever he says, nor argumentation against it on his tongue. He said: I related a dream of mine to my shaykh, Abū al-Qāsim al-Sakramānī, and I said, "I saw that you said to me such and such," so I said, "Why is that?" He said: Then he shunned me for a month and did not speak to me, and said, "Were it not that in your inner being there was a possibility of demanding and denying what I say to you, it would not have occurred on your tongue in the dream." And it is as he said, for a person rarely sees in his dream contrary to what predominates over his heart in wakefulness. This is the extent we permit mentioning in the science of spiritual conduct from the secrets of the matter of the ending, and what is beyond that falls within the science of unveiling. It has become clear to you by this that security from an evil ending is by seeing things as they truly are, without ignorance, and spending one's entire life in obedience to God without disobedience. If you know that this is impossible or difficult, then inevitably fear must overcome you as it overcame the knowers of God, until because of it your weeping and lamentation are prolonged, and your grief and anxiety persist, as we shall relate from the states of the prophets and the righteous predecessors, so that it may be one of the causes igniting the fire of fear from your heart. You have come to know by this that all the works of a lifetime are wasted if the final moment upon which the soul departs is not safe, and its safety amidst the turbulent waves of thoughts is extremely problematic. Therefore, Muṭarrif ibn ‘Abd Allāh used to say, "I do not marvel at how one who perished perished, but I marvel at how one who was saved was saved." Therefore, Ḥāmid al-Laffāf said, "When the angels ascend with the spirit of a believing servant who died upon goodness and Islam, the angels marvel at him and say, 'How was this one saved from a world in which our best were corrupted?'" And Sufyān al-Thawrī was once weeping, so it was said to him, "Why are you weeping?" He said, "We wept over sins for a time, so now we weep over Islam." In sum, whose ship falls into the depths of the sea, and stormy winds assail it, and the waves are turbulent, salvation in his case is farther than perdition. The heart of a believer is more turbulent than a ship, and the waves of thoughts are more towering than the waves of the sea. What is feared at death is merely a single evil thought that occurs, and it is regarding this that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, a man may perform the deeds of the people of Paradise for fifty years, until there remains between him and

Paradise is but the interval between two milkings of a she-camel, and thus one’s end is sealed with what the Book has foreordained. The interval of a she-camel’s milking does not allow for deeds that entail wretchedness; rather, it is the fleeting thoughts that stir and flash like lightning. Sahl said: “I saw in a vision that I entered Paradise and beheld three hundred prophets. I asked them, ‘What was the most fearful thing you dreaded in the world?’ They replied, ‘A bad ending.’” Due to this immense peril, martyrdom is envied, and sudden death is detested. As for sudden death, it is because it may occur when an evil thought prevails and takes hold of the heart—none are free from such except they repel it with aversion or the light of knowledge. As for martyrdom, it signifies the soul being taken while nothing remains in the heart but love for God Most High, and love for the world, family, wealth, children, and all desires has departed from the heart. For none rushes into the ranks of battle, resigning himself to death, save out of love for God, seeking His pleasure, selling his worldly life for the Hereafter, and content with the transaction God has made with him, as He says: “Indeed, God has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth in exchange for Paradise.” The seller inevitably turns away from what is sold, expelling its love from his heart, leaving only love for the desired reward in his heart. Such a state may overcome the heart in certain circumstances, but the soul’s departure rarely coincides with it. Thus, the battlefield is a cause for the soul to depart in such a state. This applies to one who does not seek victory, spoils, or a reputation for bravery; for one in such a condition, even if killed in battle, is far from this rank, as indicated by the reports.

Now that the meaning of a bad ending and what is feared in it has become clear to you, occupy yourself with preparing for it. Persist in remembering God Most High, expel love of the world from your heart, guard your limbs from committing sins and your heart from contemplating them, and strive to avoid witnessing sins and those who commit them, for that also affects your heart and diverts your thoughts and reflections toward it. Beware of procrastination, saying, “I will prepare when the end comes,” for if a single breath were to be your end—since your soul may be snatched in it—then watch over your heart at every moment, and do not neglect it for an instant, for perhaps that instant is your end, as your soul may be snatched in it. This is while you are awake; as for when you sleep, do not sleep except in a state of outward and inward purity, and let sleep overcome you only after remembrance of God has overcome your heart—I do not say on your tongue, for mere movement of the tongue has weak effect. Know with certainty that nothing overcomes your heart at sleep except what was dominant over it before sleep, and that nothing dominates in sleep except what was dominant before sleep, and nothing arises from your sleep except what dominated your heart during sleep. Death and resurrection are similar to sleep and wakefulness: just as a servant does not sleep except upon what dominated him while awake, and does not awaken except upon what was upon him in sleep, so too does a person not die except upon what he lived upon, and is not resurrected except upon what he died upon. Realize with absolute certainty that death and resurrection are two of your states, just as sleep and wakefulness are two of your states. Believe in this with heartfelt conviction if you are not worthy of witnessing it with the eye of certainty and the light of insight. Watch your breaths and moments, and beware of being heedless of God for even the blink of an eye, for if you do all this, you are still in great peril—how much more so if you do not? All people are ruined except the knowledgeable; all the knowledgeable are ruined except those who act; all who act are ruined except the sincere; and the sincere are in great peril. Know that this will not be easy for you unless you content yourself with the world only to the extent of your necessity. Your necessity is food, clothing, and shelter; all else is superfluous. The necessity of food is what sustains your body and satisfies your hunger; thus, your consumption should be like that of one compelled, disliking it, and your desire for it should not exceed your desire to relieve yourself, for there is no difference between putting food into the stomach and expelling it—both are necessities of nature. Just as relieving yourself is not among the concerns that occupy your heart, so too should consuming food not be among your concerns. Know that if your concern is what enters your belly, then your worth is what exits your belly. Since your aim in eating is only to gain strength for worshiping God Most High, like your aim in relieving yourself, the sign of this appears in three aspects of your food: its timing, quantity, and type. As for timing, the minimum is to suffice with once per day and night, and to persist in fasting. As for quantity, it is not to exceed one-third of the stomach. As for type, it is not to seek delicacies but to be content with what is available. If you achieve these three and are relieved from the burden of desires...

And after that, pleasures were measured by abstaining from doubtful matters, and it became possible for you to eat only from what is lawful. For the lawful is scarce and does not satisfy all desires. As for your clothing, let your aim be to repel heat and cold and to cover your nakedness. Whatever repels cold from your head, even a two-dirham cap, your seeking beyond that is superfluous on your part, wasting your time and binding you to constant occupation and enduring toil in acquiring it—once through earning, another through greed from the unlawful and the doubtful. Judge by this what you use to repel heat and cold from your body. Whatever achieves the purpose of clothing, if you are not content with its humble measure and kind, you will have no standing or return thereafter; rather, you will be among those whose bellies are filled only with dust. Likewise, for dwelling, if you suffice with its purpose, the sky suffices as a roof and the earth as a resting place. If heat or cold overcomes you, then resort to the mosques. If you seek a private dwelling, it will prolong for you and divert most of your life to it—and your life is your capital. Then, if it becomes easy for you and you intend from the wall other than it being a barrier between you and gazes, and from the roof other than it repelling rain, and you begin raising walls and adorning roofs, you have plunged into an abyss from which your ascent is distant. Thus are all your necessities: if you limit yourself to them, you free yourself for God and become able to provision for your Hereafter and prepare for your end. But if you exceed the limit of necessity into the valleys of wishes, your concerns will branch out, and God will not care in which valley He destroys you. So accept this advice from one who is more in need of advice than you.

And know that the expanse of planning, provisioning, and precaution is this short life. If you spend it day by day in your procrastination or heedlessness, you will be snatched suddenly at a time not of your choosing, and regret and remorse will not leave you. If you cannot adhere to what I have guided you to due to weakness of your fear—if what we have described concerning the matter of the end is not sufficient to frighten you—then we will present to you from the states of the fearful what we hope will remove some hardness from your heart. For you realize that the intellect, deeds, and station of the prophets, saints, and scholars with God Almighty were not less than your intellect, deeds, and station. So reflect, with the weariness of your insight and the dimness of your heart's eye, upon their states: why fear intensified in them and grief and weeping prolonged in them, until some of them fainted, some were bewildered, some fell unconscious, and some dropped dead to the ground. And no wonder, even if that does not affect your heart, for the hearts of the heedless are like stones or even harder. And indeed, among stones are those from which rivers gush forth, and among them are those that split open and water flows from them, and among them are those that tumble down from fear of God. And God is not unaware of what you do.

(Explanation of the states of the prophets and angels, peace be upon them, in fear)

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, reported: "When the weather changed and a stormy wind blew, the face of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, would change, and he would say and pace in the room, entering and exiting, all out of fear of God's punishment." And he, peace be upon him, recited a verse from Surah Al-Waqi'ah and fainted. And God Almighty said: "And Moses fell down unconscious." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, saw the form of Gabriel, peace be upon him, at Al-Abtah and fainted. And it is reported that he, peace be upon him, when he entered prayer, a sound like the boiling of a cauldron was heard from his chest. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Gabriel never came to me except that he was trembling in awe of the Almighty." And it is said that when what appeared to Iblis appeared, Gabriel and Michael, peace be upon them, began to weep. God revealed to them: "Why do you weep all this weeping?" They said: "O Lord, we are not safe from Your guile." God Almighty said: "Thus be; do not feel safe from My guile." And from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir: "When the Fire was created, the hearts of the angels flew from their places. When the children of Adam were created, they returned." And from Anas: "He, peace be upon him, asked Gabriel: 'Why do I not see Michael laughing?' Gabriel said: 'Michael has not laughed since the Fire was created.'" And it is said that God Almighty has angels, none of whom have laughed since the Fire was created, fearing that God might be angry with them and punish them with it. And Ibn Umar, may God be pleased with them, said: "I went out with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, until he entered some walls of the Ansar, and he began picking dates and eating. He said: 'O Ibn Umar, why do you not eat?' I said: 'O Messenger of God, I do not desire it.' He said: 'But I desire it, and this is the morning of the fourth day I have not tasted food and have not found it. Had I asked my Lord, He would have given me the kingdom of Caesar and Khosrow. How about you, O Ibn Umar, if you remain among a people who hoard their year's provision and certainty weakens in their hearts?' By God, we had not moved or risen until the verse was revealed: 'And how many a creature carries not its own provision? God provides for it and for you. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.'" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God has not commanded you to hoard wealth nor to follow desires."

Whoever hoards dinars seeking a fleeting life—indeed, life is in the hand of God. Verily, I hoard neither dinar nor dirham, nor do I store provision for tomorrow. Abu al-Darda’ reported that the buzzing of the heart of Ibrahim, the intimate friend of the All-Merciful, could be heard from a mile away when he stood in prayer, out of fear of his Lord. Mujahid said: Dawud, peace be upon him, wept for forty days in prostration, not lifting his head until pasture grew from his tears and covered his head. Then he was called: “O Dawud, are you hungry that you may be fed, or thirsty that you may be given drink, or naked that you may be clothed?” He sobbed a sob that stirred the lute, and it burned from the heat of his inward grief. Then God, exalted is He, sent down repentance and forgiveness upon him. He said: “O Lord, place my sin in my palm.” So his sin became written in his palm, and he would not stretch his hand for food, drink, or anything else without seeing it, and it would make him weep. It is said that a cup would be brought to him two-thirds full, and when he took it, he would see his sin, and he would not place it to his lips until the cup overflowed with his tears. It is related of him, peace be upon him, that he never raised his head to the sky until he died, out of shame before God, mighty and glorious. He would say in his intimate prayers: “My God, when I remember my sin, the earth with all its expanse feels constricted upon me; and when I remember Your mercy, my spirit returns to me. Glory be to You, my God! I came to the physicians among Your servants to cure my sin, and every one of them points me to You. Woe to those who despair of Your mercy.” Al-Fudayl said: It reached me that Dawud, peace be upon him, remembered his sin one day and leapt up crying out, placing his hand on his head until he reached the mountains. The wild beasts gathered to him, and he said: “Go back, I do not desire you. I only desire every weeping over his sin. Let none meet me except weeping, and whoever has no sin, what has he to do with Dawud the sinner?” He was reproached for his excessive weeping, and he would say: “Leave me to weep before the coming of the Day of Weeping—before bones are shattered and innards are preoccupied, and before I am commanded by angels, harsh and severe, who disobey not God in what He commands them and do as they are ordered.” ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Umar said: When Dawud committed the sin, his voice diminished. He said: “My God, restore my voice among the clear voices of the truthful.” It is related that when his weeping grew long and did not benefit him, his patience grew short and his grief intensified. He said: “O Lord, do You not have mercy on my weeping?” Then God, exalted is He, revealed to him: “O Dawud, you have forgotten your sin and remembered your weeping.” He said: “My God and my Master, how can I forget my sin when I used to recite the Psalms, and flowing water would cease its flow, the blowing wind would grow calm, birds would shade my head, and wild beasts would draw near to my prayer niche? My God and my Master, what is this estrangement between me and You?” God, exalted is He, revealed to him: “O Dawud, that was the intimacy of obedience, and this is the estrangement of disobedience. O Dawud, Adam was created from My creation; I created him with My hand, breathed into him of My spirit, made My angels prostrate to him, clothed him in the garment of My honor, crowned him with the diadem of My majesty. He complained to Me of loneliness, so I gave him in marriage Eve, My handmaid, and settled him in My Garden. He disobeyed Me, so I expelled him from My proximity, naked and humiliated. O Dawud, hear from Me, and I speak the truth: You obeyed Us, so We obeyed you; you asked of Us, so We gave to you; you disobeyed Us, so We gave you respite. And if you return to Us as you were before, We will accept you.” Yahya ibn Abi Kathir said: It reached us that Dawud, peace be upon him, when he wished to lament, would first remain for seven days without eating food, drinking drink, or approaching women. Then, the day before, his pulpit would be brought out to the wilderness, and he would command Sulayman to call out with a voice that reached the lands and what surrounded them—the thickets, hills, mountains, plains, hermitages, and churches—proclaiming therein: “Let whoever wishes to hear the lament of Dawud over himself come.” So the wild beasts would come from the plains and hills, the predators from the thickets, the creeping creatures from the mountains, the birds from their nests, the maidens from their chambers, and people would gather for that day. Dawud would come and ascend the pulpit, with the Children of Israel encircling him and every kind in its own group surrounding him, and Sulayman, peace be upon him, standing at his head. He would begin praising his Lord, and they would cry out with weeping and wailing. Then he would begin mentioning Paradise and Hellfire, and the creeping creatures and a group of the wild beasts and predators would die. Then he would begin describing the terrors of the Resurrection and lamenting over himself, and from every kind a group would die. When Sulayman saw the multitude of dead, he said: “O my father, you have torn the listeners to pieces, and groups of the Children of Israel, the wild beasts, and the creeping creatures have died.” Then he would begin supplicating. While he was thus, one of the servants of the Children of Israel called out: “O Dawud, you have hastened to demand recompense from your Lord!” Then Dawud would fall down unconscious. When Sulayman saw what had befallen him, a bier was brought and he was placed upon it. Then he commanded a caller to proclaim: “Let whoever has an intimate friend or relative with Dawud come with a bier and carry him, for those who were with him have been slain by the mention of Paradise and Hellfire.” So the woman...

She brings the bed and carries her relative, saying, "O you whom the remembrance of the Fire has slain, O you whom the fear of God has slain." Then, when David regained consciousness, he rose, placed his hand upon his head, entered his place of worship, and closed its door, saying, "O God of David, are You angry with David?" And he would not cease to converse intimately with his Lord. Then Solomon would come, sit at the door, seek permission, and then enter, bringing with him a loaf of barley. He would say, "O my father, strengthen yourself with this for what you intend." He would eat from that loaf what God willed, then go out to the Children of Israel and be among them.

Yazid al-Raqashi said: David went out one day with the people to admonish them and warn them. He went out with forty thousand, and thirty thousand of them died, and only ten thousand returned. He said: He had two maidservants he had kept, so that when fear came upon him and he fell and convulsed, they would sit upon his chest and his legs, fearing that his limbs and joints would separate and he would die.

Ibn 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, said: Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon them, entered Jerusalem when he was eight years old. He saw their worshippers wearing garments of hair and wool, and he saw their ascetics who had pierced their collarbones and threaded chains through them, tying themselves to the corners of Jerusalem. This dismayed him, so he returned to his parents. He passed by some children playing, and they said to him, "O Yahya, come join us to play." He said, "I was not created for play." Then he came to his parents and asked them to clothe him in hair garments, which they did. He returned to Jerusalem, serving it by day and spending the night there until fifteen years had passed over him. Then he went out and clung to the mountain peaks and the ravines. His parents went out searching for him and found him at the Lake of Jordan, having soaked his feet in the water until thirst was nearly slaying him. He was saying, "By Your might and majesty, I will not taste cool drink until I know my standing with You." His parents asked him to break his fast with a loaf of barley they had with them and to drink from that water. He did so and expiated for his oath. He was praised for his piety, and his parents returned him to Jerusalem. When he stood to pray, he would weep until the trees and the clay wept with him, and Zakariya, peace be upon him, would weep at his weeping until he fainted. He did not cease weeping until his tears wore through the flesh of his cheeks and his molars became visible to onlookers. His mother said to him, "O my son, if you would permit me to make something to conceal your molars from the onlookers." He permitted them, so she took two pieces of felt and attached them to his cheeks. When he stood to pray and wept, and his tears soaked the two pieces, his mother would come to him and wring them out. When he saw his tears flowing onto his mother's forearms, he said, "O God, these are my tears, and this is my mother, and I am Your servant, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful." Zakariya said to him one day, "O my son, I only asked my Lord to grant you to me so that my eyes might find comfort in you." Yahya said, "O my father, Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed me that between Paradise and the Fire is a desert that none shall cross save every weeping one." Zakariya, peace be upon him, said, "O my son, then weep."

The Messiah, peace be upon him, said: "O company of disciples, the fear of God and love of Paradise beget patience in hardship and distance one from the world. In truth, I say to you, eating barley and sleeping on rubbish heaps with dogs in pursuit of Paradise is but little." It is said that Abraham, the prayers and peace of God be upon him, when he remembered his sin, would faint, and the agitation of his heart could be heard from afar. Gabriel would come to him and say, "Your Lord sends you greetings of peace and says, 'Have you seen a friend who fears his Friend?'" He would say, "O Gabriel, when I remember my sin, I forget my friendship." These are the states of the Prophets, peace be upon them. So take heed and contemplate them, for they are the creation of God most knowledgeable of God and His attributes. The prayers of God be upon them all and upon all of God's close servants. Sufficient for us is God, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.

(Explanation of the states of the Companions, the Successors, the pious predecessors, and the righteous in the intensity of fear)

It is narrated that Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said to a bird: "Would that I were like you, O bird, and had not been created a human." Abu Dharr, may God be pleased with him, said: "I wish I were a tree that is cut down." And Talha said likewise. 'Uthman, may God be pleased with him, said: "I wish that when I die, I would not be resurrected." 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said: "I wish I were something forgotten, utterly forgotten." It is narrated that 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, would collapse from fear when he heard a verse from the Qur'an, fainting, and he would be visited for days. One day he took a stalk from the ground and said, "Would that I were this stalk. Would that I were not something remembered. Would that I were something forgotten, utterly forgotten. Would that my mother had not borne me." There were two black lines on the face of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, from tears. He, may God be pleased with him, said: "Whoever fears God, his anger is not quenched. Whoever is God-conscious does not do what he desires. Were it not for the Day of Resurrection, things would be other than what you see." When 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, recited "When the sun is wrapped up" and reached the saying of God, the Exalted, "And when the pages are spread open," he fell down fainting. And one day he passed by a house...

A man was praying and reciting Surah At-Tur when he paused to listen. When he reached the words of God Almighty: "Indeed, the punishment of your Lord will surely occur. There is no averter of it," he dismounted from his donkey, leaned against a wall, and remained for a long time before returning home. He fell ill for a month, with people visiting him without knowing the cause of his illness. And 'Ali, may God honor his countenance, having finished the dawn prayer, was overcome with sorrow as he turned his hands, saying, "I have seen the companions of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and today I see nothing resembling them. They would rise in the morning with disheveled hair, pale and dusty, with marks like the knees of goats upon their foreheads from having spent the night in prostration and standing before God, reciting His Book, alternating between their foreheads and feet. When morning came, they would remember God and sway like trees sway on a windy day, their eyes overflowing with tears until their garments were soaked. By God, it is as if those people spent the night heedless." Then he rose, and he was never seen laughing after that until he was struck by Ibn Muljam.

And 'Imran ibn Husayn said, "I wish I were ashes scattered by the winds on a stormy day." And Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, may God be pleased with him, said, "I wish I were a ram, slaughtered by my family so they could eat my flesh and drink my broth." And 'Ali ibn al-Husayn, may God be pleased with him, whenever he performed ablution, his complexion would turn pale. His family would ask him, "What is it that comes over you during ablution?" He would reply, "Do you know before Whom I intend to stand?"

Musa ibn Mas'ud said, "When we sat with al-Thawri, it was as if fire had surrounded us due to the fear and dread we saw in him." And one day Mudar the reciter recited, "This is Our record, speaking about you in truth," and 'Abd al-Wahid ibn Zaid wept until he fainted. When he regained consciousness, he said, "By Your might, I have disobeyed You to the utmost of my ability forever, so help me with Your facilitation to obey You." And al-Miswar ibn Makhramah could not bear to hear anything from the Qur'an due to the intensity of his fear. Indeed, when a verse or an ayah was recited near him, he would let out a cry and remain unconscious for days. Then a man from Khath'am came to him and recited, "The Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation, and drive the criminals to Hell in thirsty herds." He said, "I am among the criminals, not among the righteous. Repeat the saying, O reciter." So he repeated it to him, and he gasped a gasp and departed to the Hereafter.

And it was recited near Yahya al-Bakka': "If you could but see when they are made to stand before their Lord," and he cried out a cry, remaining ill from it for four months, visited from the outskirts of Basra. And Malik ibn Dinar said, "While I was circumambulating the House, I saw Juwayrah, a devout woman, clinging to the curtains of the Ka'bah, saying, 'O Lord, how many desires have passed, their pleasure gone, while their consequences remain. O Lord, did You have no discipline and punishment but the Fire?' And she wept. That remained her station until dawn appeared." Malik said, "When I saw that, I placed my hand on my head, crying out, saying, 'Malik's mother is bereaved.'"

And it is narrated that al-Fudayl was seen on the day of 'Arafah while people were supplicating, and he was weeping the weeping of a bereaved, burning mother until, as the sun was about to set, he grasped his beard, then raised his head to the sky and said, "How wretched I am from You, even if You forgive." Then he returned with the people.

Ibn 'Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, was asked about those who fear, and he said, "Their hearts are joyful with fear, and their eyes are weeping. They say, 'How can we rejoice when death is behind us, the grave before us, the Resurrection our appointment, upon Hell is our path, and before God, our Lord, is our standing?'" And al-Hasan passed by a youth who was engrossed in laughter while sitting with people in a gathering. Al-Hasan said to him, "O young man, have you crossed the Sirat?" He said, "No." He said, "Do you know whether you are destined for Paradise or the Fire?" He said, "No." He said, "Then what is this laughter?" And that youth was never seen laughing thereafter.

And Hammad ibn 'Abd Rabbihi, when he sat, would sit perched on his feet. It was said to him, "Have you settled comfortably?" He would say, "That is the sitting of the secure, and I am not secure, for I have disobeyed God Almighty." And 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz said, "God has placed this heedlessness in the hearts of His servants as a mercy, lest they die from the awe of God Almighty." And Malik ibn Dinar said, "I have resolved that when I die, I will instruct them to bind me and fetter me, then take me to my Lord as a runaway slave is taken to his master." And Hatim al-Asamm said, "Do not be deceived by a righteous place, for no place is more righteous than Paradise, yet Adam, peace be upon him, met therein what he met. And do not be deceived by abundant worship, for Iblis, after long devotion, met what he met. And do not be deceived by abundant knowledge, for Balaam knew the Greatest Name of God—look at what he met. And do not be deceived by seeing the righteous, for no person holds a station greater with God than the Chosen One, peace be upon him, yet his relatives and enemies did not benefit from meeting him."

And al-Sari said, "I look at my nose many times a day, fearing that my face may have turned black." And Abu Hafs said, "For forty years, my belief about myself is that God looks upon me with a look of displeasure, and my actions testify to that." And Ibn al-Mubarak went out to his companions one day and said, "I have been audacious."

Last night I besought God for Paradise. Umm Muhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi said to her son, “O my son, I have known you since childhood as righteous and in adulthood as righteous, yet it seems you have committed some ruinous sin, for I see what you do by night and day.” He replied, “O mother, what assures me that God Most High has not looked upon me while I was in some sin, despised me, and sworn, ‘By My might and majesty, I shall never forgive you’?”  

Fudayl said, “I do not envy a sent prophet, nor a drawn‑nigh angel, nor a righteous servant—do not these behold the Hereafter with their own eyes? I only envy one who has not been created.”  

It is related that a young man of the Helpers was seized by fear of the Fire, weeping until it confined him to his house. The Prophet ﷺ came, entered upon him, embraced him, and he fell down dead. The Prophet ﷺ said, “Prepare your companion for burial, for the terror of the Fire has rent his liver.”  

It is related from Ibn Abi Maysara that when he retired to his bed he would say, “Would that my mother had never borne me.” His mother said to him, “O Maysara, God Most High has been gracious to you, guiding you to Islam.” He replied, “Yes, but God has made clear to us that we shall enter the Fire, yet He has not made clear that we shall depart from it.”  

Farqad al‑Sabbakhi was asked, “Tell us the most astonishing report you have heard concerning the Children of Israel.” He said, “I heard that five hundred maidens entered Jerusalem, clad in wool and sackcloth, and they discoursed on God’s reward and punishment, and all died on a single day.”  

‘Aṭā’ al‑Sulami was among the fearful; he never asked God for Paradise, but only asked God for pardon. When he was asked during his illness, “Do you not desire anything?” he replied, “Fear of Hell has left no room in my heart for desire.” He did not raise his head to the sky nor laugh for forty years. One day he raised his head, was seized with terror, fell, and his belly split open. He would touch his body some nights fearing he had been transformed. When a wind, lightning, or food shortage afflicted people, he would say, “This is because of me; they are afflicted because of me. If ‘Aṭā’ died, people would find relief.”  

‘Aṭā’ said, “We went out with ‘Utbah the youth, among us elders and youths, praying the dawn prayer with the ablution of the evening prayer, their feet swollen from long standing, their eyes sunken in their heads, their skins clinging to their bones, the veins remaining like strings. They awoke as if their skins were melon‑rinds, as if they had just emerged from graves, telling how God honors the obedient and humiliates the disobedient. While they walked, one passed a certain place and fell down unconscious. His companions sat around him weeping on a bitterly cold day while his forehead dripped sweat. They brought water, wiped his face, and he revived. They asked what had befallen him, and he said, ‘I remembered that I had disobeyed God in that place.’”  

Ṣāliḥ al‑Murri said, “I recited to a devout man, ‘On the Day when their faces are turned over in the Fire, they will say, “Would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger!”’ He fainted, then revived and said, ‘Give me more, O Ṣāliḥ, for I feel anguish.’ So I recited, ‘Whenever they desire to go forth from it, they are returned into it.’ Then he fell dead.”  

It is related that Zurārah ibn Abī Awfā led the people in the morning prayer, and when he recited, ‘When the Trumpet is blown,’ he fell unconscious and was carried away dead.  

Yazīd al‑Raqqāshī entered upon ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al‑‘Azīz, who said, “Admonish me, O Yazīd.” He said, “O Commander of the Faithful, know that you are not the first caliph to die.” He wept, then said, “Give me more.” Yazīd said, “O Commander of the Faithful, between you and Adam there is no father but the dead.” He wept, then said, “Give me more, O Yazīd.” Yazīd said, “O Commander of the Faithful, between you and Paradise and the Fire there is no abode.” Then he fell unconscious.  

Maymūn ibn Mihrān said, “When this verse was revealed, ‘And indeed Hell is the promised place for them all,’ Salmān al‑Fārisī cried out, placed his hand on his head, and fled for three days so that they could not catch him.”  

Dāwūd al‑Ṭā’ī saw a woman weeping at the head of her son’s grave, saying, “O my son, would that I knew which of your cheeks the worms began with first.” Dāwūd fainted and fell on the spot.  

It is said that Sufyān al‑Thawrī fell ill, and his guide took him to a non‑Muslim physician, who said, “This is a man whose fear has rent his liver.” Then he felt his pulse and said, “I did not know there was anyone like him in the upright religion.”  

Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, God’s mercy upon him, said, “I asked God, Mighty and Majestic, to open for me a door of fear, and He opened it, and I feared for my sanity. So I said, ‘O Lord, according to what I can bear,’ and my heart grew calm.”  

‘Abd Allāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al‑‘Āṣ said, “Weep, and if you cannot weep, then force yourselves to weep. By Him in whose hand is my soul, if any of you truly knew, he would cry out until his voice failed and pray until his back broke.” He seemed to allude to the meaning of the Prophet’s ﷺ saying, “If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.”  

Al‑‘Anbarī said, “The companions of ḥadīth gathered at the door of al‑Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ. He looked out at them from a window, weeping, his beard trembling, and said, ‘Hold fast to the Qur’ān, hold fast to prayer. Woe to you, this is not a time for ḥadīth; this is a time for weeping.’”

Supplicate with humility, submission, and prayer like the prayer of a drowning man. Verily, this is a time to guard your tongue, conceal your place, treat your heart, take what you recognize, and leave what you disapprove. Al-Fudayl was once seen walking, and he was asked, "Where are you going?" He said, "I do not know," and he was walking, distracted by fear. Dhar ibn 'Umar said to his father, 'Umar ibn Dhar, "Why is it that when the speakers speak, no one weeps, but when you speak, weeping is heard from every direction?" He replied, "O my son, the bereaved mourner is not like the hired mourner." It was narrated that some people stopped by an ascetic while he was weeping and said, "What makes you weep, may God have mercy on you?" He said, "A joy that the fearful find in their hearts." They said, "And what is it?" He said, "The terror of the call to be presented before God, the Mighty and Majestic." The elect would weep and say in his intimate discourse, "I have grown old and my body has weakened in serving You, so emancipate me." Salih al-Murri said: "Ibn al-Sammak once came to us and said, 'Show me something of the wonders of your worshippers.' So I took him to a man in one of the districts, in his palm-leaf hut. We sought permission to enter upon him, and there was a man working with palm leaves. I recited to him: 'When the shackles are around their necks and the chains; they will be dragged into scalding water, then into the Fire they will be burned.' The man gasped a gasp and fell unconscious. We left him and departed, leaving him in his state. We went to another, entered upon him, and I recited this verse. He gasped a gasp and fell unconscious. We went and sought permission from a third, who said, 'Enter, if you will not distract us from our Lord.' I recited: 'That is for whoever fears My standing and fears My threat.' He gasped a gasp, and blood appeared from his nostrils, and he began to writhe in his blood until he dried up. We left him in his state and departed. I took him to six individuals; each time we would leave a man and leave him unconscious. Then I brought him to the seventh. We sought permission, and a woman from inside the hut said, 'Enter.' We entered, and there was an old man sitting in his prayer place. We greeted him, but he was not aware of our greeting. I said in a loud voice, 'Indeed, the creation has a standing place tomorrow!' The elder said, 'Before whom, woe to you?' Then he remained stunned, his mouth agape, his gaze fixed, crying out with a weak voice, 'Oh, oh,' until that voice ceased. His wife said, 'Leave, for you will not benefit from him now.' After that, I inquired about the men. Three had recovered, three had joined God Almighty, and as for the elder, he remained for three days in his state, stunned and bewildered, not performing our obligatory prayer. After three days, he regained his senses." Yazid ibn al-Aswad was considered one of the 'Substitutes,' and he had sworn never to laugh, never to sleep lying down, and never to eat butter. He was never seen laughing, lying down, or eating butter until he died, may God have mercy on him. Al-Hajjaj said to Sa'id ibn Jubayr, "It has reached me that you have never laughed." He said, "How can I laugh when Hellfire has been kindled, the shackles have been set up, and the keepers have been prepared?" A man said, "O Abu Sa'id, how are you this morning?" He said, "In good state." He said, "How is your condition?" Al-Hasan smiled and said, "You ask me about my condition? What do you think of people who boarded a ship until they were in the middle of the sea, then their ship broke, and each person clung to a plank—in what state would they be?" The man said, "In a severe state." Al-Hasan said, "My state is more severe than theirs." A maidservant of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz entered upon him, greeted him, then went to a mosque in his house and prayed two units of prayer. Her eyes overcame her and she slept, then wept in her sleep, then awoke and said, "O Commander of the Faithful, by God, I saw something amazing." He said, "What is it?" She said, "I saw the Fire, and it was roaring at its inhabitants. Then the Bridge was brought and placed over its back." He said, "Go on." She said, "Then 'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was brought and placed upon it. He had not gone far when the Bridge overturned with him, and he plummeted into Hell." 'Umar said, "Go on." She said, "Then al-Walid ibn 'Abd al-Malik was brought and placed upon it. He had not gone far when the Bridge overturned with him, and he plummeted into Hell." 'Umar said, "Go on." She said, "Then Sulayman ibn 'Abd al-Malik was brought, and he had not gone far when the Bridge overturned with him, and he plummeted likewise." 'Umar said, "Go on." She said, "Then you were brought, by God, O Commander of the Faithful." 'Umar, may God have mercy on him, cried out a cry and fell unconscious. She rose to him and began calling in his ear, "O Commander of the Faithful, by God, I saw you saved! By God, I saw you saved!" She called out while he was crying out and thrashing with his legs. It is narrated that Uways al-Qarani, may God have mercy on him, would attend the storyteller and weep from his words. When Hell was mentioned, Uways would scream, then get up and leave. People would follow him saying, "Madman, madman." Mu'adh ibn Jabal, may God be pleased with him, said, "The believer's heart finds no rest until he leaves the bridge of Hell behind him." Tawus would have bedding spread for him, then he would lie down and toss as a seed tosses in a frying pan. Then he would jump up, roll up his bedding, and face the direction of prayer until morning, saying, "The remembrance of Hell has scared away the sleep of the fearful."

Hasan al-Basri, may God have mercy on him, said: "A man will emerge from the Fire after a thousand years. Would that I were that man!" He said this only out of fear of eternal abode and a bad ending. It is related that he did not laugh for forty years. He said: "Whenever I saw him sitting, it was as if he were a captive brought forth to have his neck struck. When he spoke, it was as if he were witnessing the Hereafter and reporting what he saw. When he fell silent, it was as if the Fire were being stoked between his eyes." He was reproached for the intensity of his grief and fear, and he replied: "What assures me that God, Exalted is He, has not looked upon some aspect of me that He dislikes, and thus despised me, saying: 'Go, for you are not forgiven'? So I toil in a field that yields no harvest."

From Ibn al-Sammak: He said: "I once gave an admonition in a gathering, and a young man from the people stood up and said: 'O Abu al-'Abbas, you have admonished us today with a word such that we would not care if we heard nothing else.' I said: 'And what is it, may God have mercy on you?' He said: 'Your saying: "Indeed, the hearts of the fearful have been severed by the length of the abode, either in Paradise or in the Fire."' Then he disappeared from me. I missed him at the next gathering and did not see him. I inquired about him and was informed he was ill and being visited. I went to visit him and said: 'O my brother, what is this I see with you?' He said: 'O Abu al-'Abbas, that is from your saying: "Indeed, the hearts of the fearful have been severed by the length of the abode, either in Paradise or in the Fire."' He said: Then he died, may God have mercy on him. I saw him in a dream and said: 'O my brother, what has God done with you?' He said: 'He forgave me, had mercy on me, and admitted me to Paradise.' I said: 'By what?' He said: 'By that word.'"

These are the fears of the prophets, the saints, the scholars, and the righteous. We are more deserving of fear than them, yet fear is not due to the multitude of sins, but to the purity of hearts and the perfection of knowledge. Otherwise, our security is not due to the paucity of our sins and the abundance of our obedience. Rather, our desires have led us, our wretchedness has overcome us, and our heedlessness and hardness of heart have barred us from observing our states. Thus, neither the proximity of departure alerts us, nor the multitude of sins moves us, nor witnessing the states of the fearful frightens us, nor does the thought of the final outcome disturb us. So we ask God, Exalted is He, to remedy our states with His bounty and generosity, and to set us right—if merely moving the tongue in asking, without preparation, can benefit us.

Among the wonders is that when we desire wealth in this world, we sow, plant, trade, traverse seas and deserts, and take risks. And if we desire to attain the rank of knowledge, we strive, toil in memorizing and repeating it, and exert ourselves. We strive in seeking our provisions and do not trust in God's guarantee for us, nor do we sit in our houses saying: "O God, provide for us." Then, when the eyes of our souls yearn for the everlasting, eternal Kingdom, we content ourselves with merely saying with our tongues: "O God, forgive us and have mercy on us." Yet He, in Whom is our hope and by Whom we are honored, calls out to us, saying: "And that man shall have nothing but what he has striven for." "And let not the deceiver deceive you concerning God." "O man! What has deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?" Yet all of this does not alert us, nor does it bring us out from the valleys of our delusion and wishes. This is nothing but a tremendous calamity, unless God graces us with a sincere repentance by which He remedies us and grants us refuge. So we ask God, Exalted is He, to grant us repentance. Nay, we ask Him to make the secret cores of our hearts yearn for repentance, and not to make the mere movement of the tongue in asking for repentance the ultimate portion of our share, lest we be among those who speak but do not act, who hear but do not accept—when we hear the admonition, we weep, but when the time comes to act upon what we have heard, we disobey. Is there a greater sign of abandonment than this? So we ask God, Exalted is He, to bestow upon us success and right guidance through His grace and bounty.

We shall limit ourselves in recounting the states of the fearful to what we have mentioned, for a little of this, if it meets a receptive heart, suffices; and much of it, even if poured upon a heedless heart, avails nothing. Truly spoke the monk about whom 'Isa ibn Malik al-Khawlani narrated—and he was among the best of worshippers—that he saw him standing at the gate of Jerusalem like one grief-stricken from intense anguish, his tears scarcely ceasing from much weeping. 'Isa said: "When I saw him, his appearance dismayed me, and I said: 'O monk, counsel me with an admonition I may preserve from you.' He said: 'O my brother, with what shall I counsel you? If you are able, be like a man surrounded by predatory beasts and venomous creatures: fearful, cautious, afraid that if he is heedless, the beasts will tear him apart, or if he is negligent, the venomous creatures will bite him. His heart is terrified and fearful, so he spends his night in contravention while the heedless feel secure, and his day in grief while the people of falsehood rejoice.' Then he turned away and left me. I said: 'If only you would give me more, perhaps it would benefit me.' He said: 'The thirsty one is satisfied with the slightest water.' And he spoke truly, for the pure heart is moved by the slightest fear, and the hardened heart is repelled by every admonition."

What he mentioned—his estimation that one is surrounded by predatory beasts and venomous creatures—should not be thought a mere estimation; rather, it is a reality. For if you were to witness your inner self with the light of insight, you would see it teeming with all kinds of predatory beasts and types of venomous creatures, such as anger, lust, malice, envy, arrogance, conceit, and ostentation.

And others, which are those that will not cease to devour you and gnaw at you if you are heedless of them for even a moment, except that you are veiled in sight from witnessing them. But when the covering is lifted and you are placed in your grave, you will see them plainly, and they will have manifested to you in their forms and shapes corresponding to their inner realities. You will see with your own eyes scorpions and serpents that have encircled you in your grave. Yet these are but your own present attributes whose forms have now been unveiled to you. If you wish to slay them and subdue them while you are still capable of doing so before death, then do so. Otherwise, prepare yourself for their stinging and gnawing at the very core of your heart, let alone the surface of your skin. And peace.

[1] The hadith: "The foolish one is he who follows his soul's desires" has preceded multiple times.
[2] The hadith: Zayd al-Khayl said, "I have come to ask you about God's sign in one who desires and His sign in one who does not desire..." Al-Tabarani recorded it in *al-Kabir* from the narration of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain. In it, it is said he was called Zayd al-Khayr, and similarly Ibn Abi Hatim mentioned that the Prophet ﷺ named him Zayd al-Khayr. A hadith is narrated from him, and he is mentioned in a narration where he said, "O Zayd al-Khayr..." and he said, "O Messenger of God..." I heard my father say that.
[3] The hadith: "Let none of you die except while having a good opinion of God," recorded by Muslim from the narration of Jabir.
[4] The hadith: "I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think of Me what he will," recorded by Ibn Hibban from the narration of Wa'ilah ibn al-Asqa', and it is in the two *Sahih* collections from the narration of Abu Hurayrah without the phrase "so let him think of Me what he will."
[5] The hadith: "He ﷺ entered upon a man who was in the throes of death and said, 'How do you find yourself?'" Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and said it is *gharib*; al-Nasa'i in *al-Kubra* and Ibn Majah narrated it from the narration of Anas, and al-Nawawi said its chain is good.
[6] The hadith: "Indeed God will say to a servant on the Day of Resurrection, 'What prevented you, when you saw evil, from denouncing it?'" Ibn Majah recorded it from the narration of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri with a good chain, and it has preceded in the chapter on commanding good.
[7] The hadith: "A man used to lend to people, and he would be lenient with the wealthy and overlook the hardship of the insolvent..." Muslim recorded it from the narration of Abu Mas'ud: "A man from among those before you was brought to account, and no good was found for him except that he mingled with people and was wealthy, and he would order his servants to overlook the hardship of the insolvent. God, the Mighty and Majestic, said, 'We are more worthy of that. Overlook him.'" Both agreed upon it from the narration of Hudhayfah and Abu Hurayrah in a similar manner.
[8] The hadith: "If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much..." In it is: "Then Gabriel descended..." Ibn Hibban recorded it in his *Sahih* from the narration of Abu Hurayrah. Its beginning is agreed upon from the narration of Anas, and it was narrated with the addition: "and you would go out to the high places..." Ahmad and al-Hakim recorded it, and it has preceded.
[9] The hadith: "Indeed God, the Exalted, revealed to His servant David, peace be upon him, 'Love Me and love those who love Me...'" I did not find a basis for it, and it seems to be from the Isra'iliyyat like the one before it.
[10] The hadith: "A man from the Children of Israel used to cause people to despair and be severe upon them..." Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in *al-Shu'ab* from Zayd ibn Aslam, and he mentioned it as *mawquf*.
[11] The hadith: "Indeed a man will enter the Fire and will be tossed in it for a thousand years, calling out, 'O Most Compassionate, O Bestower of Favors!'" Ibn Abi al-Dunya recorded it in *The Book of Good Opinion of God* and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab*, and he weakened it from the narration of Anas.
[12] The hadith: "He recited: 'Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins, and He does not mind."'" Al-Tirmidhi recorded it from the narration of Asma' bint Yazid and said it is *hasan gharib*.
[13] The hadith: "Indeed the Prophet ﷺ did not cease asking for his community until it was said to him, 'Are you not satisfied? Has it not been revealed to you: "And indeed your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing"?'" I did not find it with this wording. Ibn Abi Hatim and al-Tha'labi recorded in their *tafsirs* from the narration of 'Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad'an from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib, who said: When this verse was revealed, the Messenger of God ﷺ said, "Were it not for God's pardon and His overlooking, no one would find life pleasant..."
[14] The hadith of Abu Musa: "My community is a community shown mercy; there is no punishment for them. God hastens their punishment in this world through earthquakes and tribulations..." Abu Dawud recorded it without the phrase "So when the Day of Resurrection comes..."

Ibn Majah narrated it through a weak chain from Anas, and in his Sahih from Abu Musa as will come later, mentioned in the following hadith.

[15] The hadith: "There will come to every man of this Ummah a Jew or a Christian to Hellfire." Muslim narrated it from Abu Musa: "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: 'This is your ransom from the Fire.'" In another narration of his: "No Muslim man dies but that Allah puts in his place in the Fire a Jew or a Christian."

[16] The hadith: "Fever is from the breath of Hellfire, and it is the believer's share of the Fire." Ahmad narrated it from the report of Abu Salih al-Ash'ari from Abu Umamah, and Abu Salih is unknown and his name is unknown.

[17] The hadith: "Allah revealed to His Prophet, peace be upon him: 'I am making the reckoning of your Ummah to you.' He said: 'No, O Lord, You are better for them than I.'" The hadith is in the interpretation of His saying, the Exalted: "The Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet..." Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it in the book "Good Expectations of Allah."

[18] The hadith of Anas that he, peace be upon him, asked his Lord regarding the destruction of his Ummah, saying: "O Lord, make their reckoning to me..." I have not found a source for it.

[19] The hadith: "My life is good for you and my death is good for you." Al-Bazzar narrated it from 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, and its narrators are narrators of the Sahih except that 'Abd al-Majid ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Abi Dawud, even though Muslim narrated from him and Ibn Ma'in and al-Nasa'i declared him trustworthy, many weakened him. Al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah narrated it in his Musnad from Anas similarly with a weak chain.

[20] The hadith: "He, peace be upon him, said one day: 'O Most Generous in Pardon.' So Jibril said: 'Do you know the interpretation of "O Most Generous in Pardon"?'" I have not found this from the Prophet, peace be upon him. What exists is that this was between Ibrahim, the Intimate Friend, and Jibril. Abu al-Shaykh narrated it thus in the book "Al-'Azamah" from the saying of 'Utbah ibn al-Walid, and al-Bayhaqi narrated it in "Al-Shu'ab" from the report of 'Utbah ibn al-Walid who said: "Some of the ascetics narrated to me..." and he mentioned it.

[21] The hadith: "He heard a man saying: 'O Allah, I ask You for the completion of blessing...'" This has preceded.

[22] The hadith: "When a servant sins and then seeks forgiveness, Allah, the Exalted, says to His angels: 'Look at My servant; he committed a sin but knew that he has a Lord who forgives sin.'" It is agreed upon from Abu Hurayrah with the wording: "A servant committed a sin and said: 'O Lord, I have committed a sin, so forgive me.'" In another narration: "A servant committed a sin and said..." the hadith.

[23] The hadith: "If the servant were to sin until his sins reach the clouds of the sky..." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from Anas: "O son of Adam, if your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would forgive you." And he said it is hasan.

[24] The hadith: "If My servant were to meet Me with sins filling the earth, I would meet him with forgiveness filling it." Muslim narrated it from Abu Dharr: "Whoever meets Me with sins filling the earth, not associating anything with Me, I will meet him with forgiveness like it." And al-Tirmidhi has from the preceding hadith of Anas: "O son of Adam, if you were to meet Me..." the hadith.

[25] The hadith: "The angel lifts the pen from the servant when he sins for six hours. If he repents and seeks forgiveness, it is not written against him." He said: "In another wording: 'If it is written against him and he does a good deed, the companion on the right says to the companion on the left—and he is his commander—"Discard this sin until I discard one from his good deeds."'" Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in "Al-Shu'ab" from Abu Umamah with a chain containing weakness in the first wording. He also narrated it longer than that, and in it: "The companion on the right is the commander over the companion on the left," but it does not contain that he orders the companion on the left to discard the sin until he discards one from his good deeds. I have not found any source for that.

[26] The hadith of Anas: "When a servant commits a sin, it is written against him." A Bedouin said: "What if he repents from it?" He said: "It is erased from him." He said: "What if he returns?" The hadith, and in it: "Allah does not tire of forgiveness until the servant tires of seeking forgiveness." Al-Bayhaqi narrated it in "Al-Shu'ab" with the wording: "A man came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have committed a sin.' He said: 'Seek forgiveness from your Lord.' He said: 'Then I seek forgiveness and return?' He said: 'If you return, then seek forgiveness from your Lord.' Three or four times. He said: 'Seek forgiveness from your Lord until Satan becomes the frustrated and defeated one.'" In it is Abu Badr Yasar ibn al-Hakam al-Misri, a narrator of rejected hadith. He also narrated it from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn...

One of us commits a sin. It is recorded against him, he said. Then he seeks forgiveness and repents, he said. He is forgiven and his repentance is accepted, he said. Then the conversation returns, and in it is: "Allah does not tire until you tire." And in the two narrations is not the statement at its end: "So when a servant intends a good deed..." while it is in the two Sahihs similarly from the hadith of Ibn Abbas from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in what he narrates from his Lord: "Whoever intends a good deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Him as a complete good deed. If he intends it and does it, Allah records it with Him as ten good deeds up to seven hundredfold, to many multiples. And whoever intends an evil deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Him as a complete good deed. If he intends it and does it, Allah records it as a single evil deed." Muslim added in his narration: "Or Allah erases it. And none is destroyed by Allah except the doomed." And both have a similar version from the hadith of Abu Huraira.

[27] A hadith: A man came and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I only fast the month (of Ramadan), I do not increase upon it, and I only pray the five (obligatory prayers), I do not increase upon them, and there is no charity from my wealth for Allah, nor Hajj, nor voluntary acts." The hadith has preceded.

[28] The lengthy hadith of Anas: A Bedouin said: "O Messenger of Allah, who will oversee the reckoning of creation?" He said: "Allah, Blessed and Exalted." He said: "Himself?" He said: "Yes." So the Bedouin smiled. The hadith: I did not find a basis for it.

[29] The hadith: "The believer is more excellent than the Ka'bah." Ibn Majah transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn Umar with the wording: "How great you are and how great your sanctity! By the One in whose hand is my soul, the sanctity of a believer is greater than your sanctity: his wealth, his blood, and that he be thought of only good." Its shaykh, Nasr ibn Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Himsi, was weakened by Abu Hatim and declared trustworthy by Ibn Hibban. It has preceded.

[30] The hadith: "The believer is pure, clean." I did not find it with this wording. And in the two Sahihs from the hadith of Hudhayfah: "The believer does not become impure."

[31] The hadith: "The believer is more honored by Allah than the angels." Ibn Majah transmitted it from the narration of Abu al-Muhazzim Yazid ibn Sufyan from Abu Huraira with the wording: "The believer is more honored by Allah than some of the angels." Abu al-Muhazzim was abandoned by Shu'bah and weakened by Ibn Ma'in. Ibn Hibban narrated it in "al-Du'afa'" and al-Bayhaqi in "al-Shu'ab" from this chain with the wording of the author.

[32] The hadith: "Allah created from the surplus of His mercy a whip with which He drives His servants to Paradise." I did not find it thus. It is compensated for by what al-Bukhari narrated from the hadith of Abu Huraira: "Our Lord is amazed at a people who are brought to Paradise in chains."

[33] The hadith: Allah said: "I only created creation that they might profit from Me, and I did not create them that I might profit from them." I did not come across a basis for it.

[34] The hadith of Abu Sa'id: "Allah did not create anything except that He made for it something that overcomes it, and He made His mercy overcome His wrath." Abu al-Shaykh and Ibn Hibban transmitted it in "al-Thawab." In it is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Kurdam; Abu Hatim declared him unknown, and the author of "al-Mizan" said he is not weak nor unknown.

[35] The hadith: "Indeed, Allah wrote upon Himself by Himself before He created creation: 'My mercy overcomes My wrath.'" Agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Huraira, and it has preceded.

[36] The hadith of Mu'adh and Anas: "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' enters Paradise." Al-Tabarani transmitted it in "al-Du'a'" with the wording: "Whoever dies testifying..." and it has preceded from the hadith of Mu'adh. And it is in "al-Yawm wa al-Laylah" of al-Nasa'i with the wording: "Whoever dies testifying..." and it has preceded from the hadith of Mu'adh and also from the hadith of Anas, and it has preceded in "al-Adhkar."

[37] The hadith: "Whoever's last words are 'There is no god but Allah,' the Fire will not touch him." Abu Dawud and al-Hakim transmitted it and declared it sound from the hadith of Mu'adh with the wording: "He enters Paradise."

[38] The hadith: "Whoever meets Allah not associating anything with Him, the Fire is forbidden for him." The two Shaykhs transmitted it from the hadith of Anas that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to Mu'adh: "There is no servant who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, except that Allah forbids him from the Fire." Al-Bukhari added: "Sincerely from his heart." And in a narration of his: "Whoever meets Allah not associating anything with Him enters Paradise." Ahmad narrated it from the hadith of Mu'adh with the wording: "Allah places him in Paradise." And al-Nasa'i has it from the hadith of Abu 'Amrah al-Ansari within a hadith, so he said: "I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that I am the Messenger of Allah. No servant meets Allah believing in them both except that he is veiled from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection."

[39] The hadith "None shall enter it who has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of faith" was reported by Ahmad from the hadith of Sahl ibn Biḍāʾ: "Whoever testifies that there is no god but Allah, Allah makes the Fire forbidden for him." Its chain is interrupted. And from the hadith of ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān: "I know a word which, if a servant says it truthfully from his heart, he will be made forbidden to the Fire." ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said: "It is the word of sincerity." Its chain is sound, but this and its like are anomalous, contradicting what is firmly established in the sound hadiths about a group of monotheists entering the Fire and then being brought out by intercession. Indeed, none shall remain in the Fire who has in his heart a mustard seed of faith, as is agreed upon from the hadith of Abū Saʿīd, wherein it states: "So whoever you find in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of faith, bring him out." And Muslim reported: "from good" instead of "from faith."

[40] The hadith "If the disbeliever knew the vastness of Allah's mercy, none would despair of His Paradise" is agreed upon from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah.

[41] The hadith "When he recited - 'Indeed, the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing' - he said: 'Do you know what day this is?'" was reported by al-Tirmidhī from the hadith of ʿImrān ibn Ḥuṣayn, and he said it is ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ. I say: It is from the narration of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī from ʿImrān, and he did not hear it from him. In the two Ṣaḥīḥs there is a similar narration from the hadith of Abū Saʿīd.

[42] The hadith "If you did not sin, Allah would create a creation who would sin so that He could forgive them." And in another wording: "He would take you away..." The hadith was reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abū Ayyūb, and the second wording is from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah, similar to it.

[43] The hadith "If you did not sin, I would fear for you something worse than sin." It was asked: "What is it?" He said: "Pride." It was reported by al-Bazzār and Ibn Ḥibbān in al-Ḍuʿafāʾ and al-Bayhaqī in al-Shuʿab from the hadith of Anas. It has preceded in the condemnation of arrogance and pride.

[44] The hadith "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, Allah is more merciful to His believing servant than a compassionate mother is to her child" is agreed upon from a hadith of ʿUmar, similar in meaning.

[45] The hadith "Allah the Exalted will forgive on the Day of Resurrection a forgiveness that has never crossed anyone's mind" was reported by Ibn Abī al-Dunyā in the book "Ḥusn al-Ẓann bi-Allāh" from the hadith of Ibn Masʿūd with a weak chain.

[46] The hadith "Indeed, Allah the Exalted has one hundred mercies..." is agreed upon from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah.

[47] The hadith "Not one of you will be entered into Paradise by his deeds..." is agreed upon from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah, and it has preceded.

[48] The hadith "Act, and receive glad tidings, and know that no one will be saved by his deeds" has also preceded.

[49] The hadith "I have reserved my intercession for the people of major sins from my nation" was reported by the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: "Every prophet has a supplication, and I have reserved my supplication as an intercession for my nation." Muslim reported it from the hadith of Anas, and al-Tirmidhī from his hadith and declared it ṣaḥīḥ, and Ibn Mājah from the hadith of Jābir: "My intercession is for the people of major sins from my nation." And Ibn Mājah from the hadith of Abū Mūsā, and Aḥmad from the hadith of Ibn ʿUmar: "I was given the choice between intercession and that half of my nation enter Paradise, so I chose intercession because it is more comprehensive and sufficient. Do you think it is only for the pious?" The hadith, and in its chain is one who is not named.

[50] The hadith "I was sent with the easy, tolerant, straightforward monotheism" was reported by Aḥmad from the hadith of Abū Umāmah with a weak chain, without the phrase "the straightforward." And he and al-Ṭabarānī reported from the hadith of Ibn ʿAbbās: "The religion most beloved to Allah is the tolerant, straightforward monotheism." In its chain is Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq, who narrated it with 'an'anah.

[51] The hadith "I love for the People of the Book to know that there is tolerance in our religion" was reported by Abū ʿUbayd in "Gharīb al-Ḥadīth" and Aḥmad.

[52] The hadith of Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafiyyah from ʿAlī: When the verse "So pardon with gracious pardon" was revealed, he said: "O Jibrīl, what is gracious pardon?" He said: "When you forgive one who wronged you, do not reproach him." It was reported by Ibn Mardawayh in his Tafsīr as a statement (mawqūf) attributed to ʿAlī, abbreviated: "He said: 'To be pleased without reproach,'" and he did not mention the rest of the hadith. There is a weakness in its chain.

[53] The hadith "Indeed, two men from the Children of Israel became brothers for the sake of Allah the Mighty and Majestic. One of them was excessive against himself, and the other was a devout worshipper..." was reported by Abū Dāwūd from the hadith of Abū Hurayrah with a chain...

[54] The hadith of Ibn Abbas: He used to supplicate against the polytheists and curse them in his prayer, then the verse was revealed: "You have no part in the matter" (Quran 3:128), so he stopped praying against them. Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Ibn Umar: When he raised his head from bowing in the final unit of the Fajr prayer, he would say, "O Allah, curse so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so," after saying, "Allah hears those who praise Him; Our Lord, to You is all praise." Then Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, revealed: "You have no part in the matter" up to His saying: "For they are wrongdoers." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it and named them: Abu Sufyan, Al-Harith ibn Hisham, and Safwan ibn Umayyah, and added: "Then He turned to them in forgiveness, and they embraced Islam, and their Islam became good." He said: "Hasan gharib." In another narration of his, he mentioned four men without naming them and said: "Then Allah guided them to Islam," and said: "Hasan gharib sahih."

[55] The hadith: "Ask Allah for the highest degrees, for you are only asking the Most Generous." I did not find it with this wording. Al-Tirmidhi has from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud: "Ask Allah of His bounty, for Allah loves to be asked." He said: "This is how Hammad ibn Waqid narrated it, and he is not a strong memorizer."

[56] The hadith: "When you ask Allah, magnify your desire and ask for the highest Firdaws, for nothing is too great for Allah." Muslim narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "When one of you supplicates, let him not say, 'O Allah, forgive me if You will,' but let him be resolute and magnify his desire, for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, is not too great to grant anything." Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah within a longer hadith: "When you ask Allah, ask Him for Firdaws, for it is the middle of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadiths of Mu'adh and 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit.

[57] The hadith: "I am the most God-fearing among you." Al-Bukhari narrated it from the hadith of Anas: "By Allah, I am the most God-fearing among you and the most pious towards Him." And the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) narrated it from the hadith of 'A'ishah: "By Allah, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah among you and the most intense in awe of Him."

[58] The hadith: "This is a book from Allah in which the people of Paradise are written with their names and their fathers' names..." Al-Tirmidhi narrated it from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As and said: "Hasan sahih gharib."

[59] The hadith: "Allah, the Exalted, revealed to Dawud: 'O Dawud, fear Me as the ravenous lion is feared.'" I did not find a source for it. Perhaps the author intended by citing it that it is from the Isra'iliyyat (Israelite narratives), for he expressed it with the phrase "it is reported in a narration," and he often uses that expression for Isra'iliyyat that are not raised (to the Prophet).

[60] The hadith: "When he was given the choice during his final illness, he would say, 'I ask You for the Highest Companion.'" Agreed upon from the hadith of 'A'ishah. She said: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say while healthy, 'No prophet is taken until he sees his place in Paradise, then he is given the choice.' When it (death) came upon him and his head was in my lap, he lost consciousness, then he regained it, fixed his gaze towards the ceiling of the room, and said, 'O Allah, the Highest Companion.' Then I knew he would not choose us, and I recognized it as the hadith he used to tell us while healthy."

[61] The hadith: "When Allah gathers the former and the latter for an appointed Day, He will call them with a voice heard by the farthest among them just as it is heard by the nearest, and He will say: 'O people, I have been listening to you since I created you until this your day, so listen to Me today. It is only your deeds being returned to you. O people, I have made kinship...'" Al-Tabarani narrated it in *Al-Awsat* and Al-Hakim in *Al-Mustadrak* with a weak chain. Al-Tha'labi narrated it in his *Tafsir*, limiting it to its end: "I have made kinship..." from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[62] The hadith: "The pinnacle of wisdom is the fear of Allah." Abu Bakr ibn Lal al-Faqih narrated it in *Makārim al-Akhlaq* and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* and weakened it from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud. He also narrated it in *Dala'il al-Nubuwwah* from the hadith of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, and it is also not authentic.

[63] The hadith: "If you wish to meet Me, then increase in fear of Me after me." He said it to Ibn Mas'ud. I have not found a source for it.

[64] The hadith: "I do not combine two fears for My servant, nor do I combine two securities for him." Ibn Hibban narrated it in his *Sahih* and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it in *Al-Zuhd* and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in *Kitab al-Khā'ifīn* from the narration of Al-Hasan as a *mursal* report.

[65] The hadith: "Whoever fears Allah, everything fears him..." Abu al-Shaykh Ibn Hibban narrated it in *Kitab al-Thawab* from the hadith of Abu Umamah with a very weak chain. Ibn Abi al-Dunya narrated it in *Kitab al-Khā'ifīn* with a weak, interrupted chain. It has been mentioned previously.

[66] The hadith, "The most perfect among you in intellect are those with the greatest fear of God," I have not found a source for, and nothing authentic has been established regarding the virtue of intellect.

[67] The hadith of 'A'ishah: I said, "O Messenger of God, 'those who give what they give while their hearts are fearful'—is that the man who steals and commits adultery?" He said, "No..." This is narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and al-Hakim, who said its chain is sound. I say: Rather, it is interrupted between 'A'ishah and 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'd ibn Wahb. Al-Tirmidhi said it is also narrated from al-Rahman ibn Hazim from Abu Hurayrah.

[68] The hadith, "No believer sheds a tear from his eye, even if it were like the head of a fly..." is reported by al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi in *al-Shu'ab* from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a weak chain.

[69] The hadith, "When the skin of a believer bristles from fear of God Almighty, his sins fall away from him..." is reported by al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi therein from the hadith of al-'Abbas with a weak chain.

[70] The hadith, "A servant who weeps from fear of God will not enter the Fire," is reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is *hasan sahih*, and by al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[71] The hadith: 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said, "What is salvation, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Restrain your tongue..." This has preceded.

[72] The hadith of 'A'ishah: I said, "Will anyone from your community enter Paradise without reckoning?" He said, "Yes, the one who remembers his sins and weeps." I have not found a source for this.

[73] The hadith, "No drop is more beloved to God than a drop of a tear from fear of God..." is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Abu Umamah, who said it is *hasan gharib*, and it has preceded.

[74] The hadith, "O God, grant me two eyes that flow freely, healing the heart with the shedding of tears..." is reported by al-Tabarani in *al-Kabir* on supplication and Abu Nu'aym in *al-Hilyah* from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a sound chain. Al-Husayn al-Marwazi also narrated it in his additions to *al-Zuhd wa al-Raqa'iq* of Ibn al-Mubarak from the narration of Salim ibn 'Abdillah as a *mursal* report, without mention of God. Al-Daraqutni mentioned in *al-'Ilal* that whoever said it was from his father was mistaken; rather, it is from Salim ibn 'Abdillah as a *mursal*. He said, "This Salim is likely Salim ibn 'Abdillah al-Muharibi, not the son of 'Umar." What he mentioned—that it is Salim al-Muharibi—is indicated by the statements of al-Bukhari in *al-Tarikh*, Muslim in *al-Kuna*, Ibn Abi Hatim from his father, and Abu Ahmad al-Hakim. For the narrator from Salim is 'Abdullah Abu Salamah, and they only mentioned him narrating from Salim al-Muharibi. And God knows best. Indeed, Ibn 'Asakir narrated in his history the disagreement over whether the narrator was from Salim al-Muharibi or Salim ibn 'Abdillah ibn 'Umar.

[1] His statement, "healing the heart with the shedding of tears"—that which is in *al-Jami' al-Saghir* is: "healing the heart with the shedding of tears from fear of You."

[75] The hadith, "Seven whom God will shade in His shade..." is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah and has preceded.

[76] The hadith of Hanzalah: "We were with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he admonished us..." and in it is "Hanzalah has become a hypocrite..." and in it is, "But, O Hanzalah, (there is) an hour and an hour..." Muslim reported it in abbreviated form.

[77] The hadith that Hudhayfah was singled out by the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, with knowledge of the hypocrites is reported by Muslim from the hadith of Hudhayfah: "Among my companions are twelve hypocrites..." Its conclusion: "They will not enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle."

[78] The hadith, "Indeed, a man may perform the deeds of the people of Paradise for fifty years, until there remains between him and Paradise but a span..." and in a narration, "but the measure of a camel's bellow..." is reported by Muslim from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: "Indeed, a man may perform for a long time the deeds of the people of Paradise, then his end is sealed with the deeds of the people of the Fire." Al-Bazzar and al-Tabarani in *al-Awsat* have "seventy years," and its chain is sound. The two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] have in the course of a hadith from Ibn Mas'ud: "Indeed, one of you may perform the deeds of the people of Paradise until there is between him and it but a cubit..." The hadith does not contain an estimation of the deed's duration as fifty years, nor mention of a span or a camel's bellow.

[79] The hadith, "O God, grant me Your love and the love of those who love You..." is reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Mu'adh and has preceded in the section on Remembrances and Supplications.

[81] Adam and Moses debated before their Lord, and Adam overcame Moses in the debate. The hadith is reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah, and it is agreed upon with other wordings.

[82] He was the master of the first and the last. Reported by Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurayrah: "I am the master of the children of Adam, and I say this without boastfulness."

[83] He was the most fearful of people. Preceding this by twenty-five narrations are his statements: "By Allah, I am the most God-fearing among you," and "By Allah, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah among you and the most fearful of Him."

[84] He prayed over a child, and it was heard in his supplication that he said: "O Allah, protect him from the punishment of the grave and the punishment of the Fire." Reported by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the narration of Anas: The Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed over a young boy or girl and said, "If anyone were to be saved from the constriction of the grave, this child would have been saved." There is disagreement regarding its chain. It is also narrated in al-Kabir from the narration of Abu Ayyub: A child was buried, and the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, "If anyone were to escape the constriction of the grave, this child would have escaped."

[85] He heard a woman saying to a child who had died, "Congratulations to you, a bird from the birds of Paradise," and he became angry and said, "What makes you know?" Reported by Muslim from the narration of Aisha, who said: A child died and I said, "Blessed is he, a bird from the birds of Paradise." The hadith does not contain "and he became angry," and it has preceded.

[86] When Uthman ibn Maz'un died, Umm Salamah said, "Congratulations to you for Paradise." The hadith is reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Umm al-'Ala' al-Ansariyyah, who is the one who said, "May Allah have mercy on you, O Abu al-Sa'ib, I testify for you that Allah has honored you." He said, "What makes you know?" It is also reported that the one who said that was Umm Kharijah bint Zayd, and I did not find in it any mention of Umm Salamah.

[87] A man from the People of the Suffah was martyred, and his mother said, "Congratulations to you, my son, for Paradise." Reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab, except he said: "His mother said, 'Congratulations to you for martyrdom.'" It is also in al-Tirmidhi, except he said: "A man said to him, 'Receive glad tidings of Paradise.'" It has preceded in the chapter dispraising wealth and stinginess, with some differences.

[88] He entered upon one of his companions who was ill and heard a woman saying, "Congratulations to him for Paradise." The hadith has also preceded.

[89] "Surah Hud and its sisters have turned my hair gray." Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who graded it as good (hasan), and by al-Hakim, who authenticated it, from the narration of Ibn Abbas. It is also in al-Shama'il from the narration of Abu Juhaifah, and it has preceded in the Book of Hearing.

[90] He and Gabriel, peace be upon them both, wept out of fear of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, so Allah revealed to them, "Why are you weeping?" Reported by Ibn Shahin in Sharh al-Sunnah from the narration of Umar. We also narrated it in a gathering from the hopes of Abu Sa'id al-Naqqash with a weak chain.

[91] He said on the day of Badr: "O Allah, if You destroy this band, there will remain no one on the face of the earth who worships You." Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Ibn Abbas with the wording: "O Allah, if You will, You will not be worshipped after this day."

Reported by al-Bukhari from the narration of Anas; and by Ahmad and al-Bazzar from the narration of Abu Sa'id; and by Ahmad and al-Hakim from the narration of Ubadah ibn al-Samit, who authenticated its chain. It has preceded in the Book of Repentance.

[95] A man said to Ibn Umar, "We enter upon these rulers and affirm to them what they say." The hadith is reported by Ahmad and al-Tabarani, and it has preceded in the Foundations of Beliefs.

[96] Ibn Umar heard a man reviling al-Hajjaj and speaking ill of him, so he said, "What do you think if al-Hajjaj were present?" It has preceded there, and I did not find in it any mention of al-Hajjaj.

[97] A group of people sat at the door of Hudhayfah waiting for him, and they were speaking about something...

[98] The hadith: "The believing servant is between two fears: an appointed term that has passed..." Al-Bayhaqi transmitted it in Al-Shu'ab from the narration of Al-Hasan from a man among the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). It was previously mentioned in the chapter on the censure of the worldly life. Ibn al-Mubarak mentioned it as a *balagh* report in the book *Al-Zuhd*, and the author of *Al-Firdaws* mentioned it from the hadith of Jabir, but his son did not include it in *Musnad al-Firdaws*.

[99] The hadith: "The grave is either a pit from the pits of the Fire or a garden from the gardens of Paradise." Al-Tirmidhi transmitted it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id and said it is *gharib*. It was previously mentioned in the book of *Adhkar*.

[100] The hadith: "Verily, seventy doors from Hellfire are opened towards the grave of the one being punished." I did not find a basis for it.

[102] The hadith on the punishment of the grave was previously mentioned there.

[103] The hadith on the detailed scrutiny during the Reckoning was previously mentioned there.

[104] The hadith on public disgrace before the witnesses on the Day of Resurrection: Ahmad and Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with a good chain: "Whoever selects from his offspring to disgrace him in this world, Allah will disgrace him before all witnesses." In the two *Sahih* collections from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar: "As for the disbeliever and the hypocrite, they will be called out before all creation: 'These are the ones who lied against their Lord.'" Al-Tabarani and Al-'Uqayli in *Al-Du'afa'* transmitted from the hadith of Al-Fudayl ibn 'Iyad: "The disgrace of this world is lighter than the disgrace of the Hereafter." It is a long, rejected (*munkar*) hadith.

[105] The hadith on the peril of the Bridge (*al-Sirat*) was previously mentioned in the *Foundations of Belief*.

[106] The hadith on the terror of the *Zabaniyah* (angels of Hell): Al-Tabarani transmitted it from the hadith of Anas: "The *Zabaniyah* on the Day of Resurrection will seize the sinful bearers of the Quran faster than they seize the idol and fire worshippers." The author of *Al-Mizan* said it is a *munkar* hadith. Ibn Wahb narrated from 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam in a disconnected (*mu'dal*) chain regarding the guardians of Hellfire: "The distance between the shoulders of one of them is like the distance between the east and the west."

[109] The hadith: "The one killed in battle, if his intention was victory, spoils, and a good reputation, is far from the rank of martyrdom." It is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from the hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: A man said, "O Messenger of Allah, a man fights for spoils, a man fights for fame, and a man fights to show his position. Who is in the cause of Allah?" He said, "Whoever fights so that the word of Allah may be supreme is in the cause of Allah." In another narration: "A man fights courageously, a man fights out of zeal, and a man fights for show." In another narration: "He fights out of anger."

[110] The hadith of 'A'ishah: "When the weather changed and a violent wind blew, his face would change..." It is agreed upon (*muttafaq 'alayh*) from the hadith of 'A'ishah.

[111] The hadith: "He recited in Surah al-Haqqah and fainted." It is well-known in what is narrated from this story that it was recited in his presence: "Indeed, with Us are fetters and Hellfire, and food that chokes, and a painful punishment" (Quran 69:30-37), so he fainted, as narrated by Ibn 'Adi and Al-Bayhaqi in *Al-Shu'ab* as a *mursal* report. The author mentioned it correctly in the book *Adab al-Sama'* as previously mentioned.

[112] The hadith: "He saw the form of Gabriel at al-Abtah and fainted." Al-Bazzar transmitted it from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas with a good chain: The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked Gabriel to see him in his true form. He said, "Ask your Lord." So he asked his Lord, and he (Gabriel) appeared to him from the direction of the east, rising and moving. When he saw him, he fainted. Ibn al-Mubarak narrated it from the narration of Al-Hasan as a *mursal* report with the wording: "He lost consciousness." In the two *Sahih* collections from 'A'ishah: "He saw Gabriel in his true form twice." And in both from Ibn Mas'ud: "He saw Gabriel having six hundred wings."

[114] The hadith: "Gabriel never came to me except that his limbs trembled from (the awe of) the Compeller." I did not find this exact wording. Abu al-Shaykh narrated in the book *Al-'Azamah* from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: "Gabriel (peace be upon him) came on the Day of Resurrection, standing before the Compeller, Blessed and Exalted, his limbs trembling in fear of the punishment..."

Hadith of Anas that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Gabriel, "Why is it that I do not see Michael laughing?" He replied, "Michael has not laughed since the Fire was created." Narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Book of the Fearful" through the narration of Thabit from Anas with a sound chain. Ibn Shahin narrated it in "The Sunnah" from the hadith of Thabit as mursal. This is also reported concerning Israfil, narrated by al-Bayhaqi in "The Branches," and concerning Gabriel, narrated by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Book of the Fearful."

Al-Bayhaqi said, "This chain is unknown, and al-Jarrah ibn Minhal is weak."

The hadith was reported by Ibn Abi al-Dunya in "The Fearful" from the hadith of Hudhayfah, and al-Bayhaqi in "The Branches" from the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa'd with two chains that require scrutiny.
