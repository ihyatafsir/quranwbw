The Book of Condemning Stinginess and Condemning the Love of Wealth

This is the seventh book of the quarter on the soul's destroyers from the work The Revival of the Religious Sciences.

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, the Deserver of praise through His expansive provision, the Remover of distress after despair, Who created creation, expanded sustenance, and lavished upon all beings various kinds of wealth, testing them therein with the vicissitudes of conditions, and turning them therein between hardship and ease, wealth and poverty, greed and hopelessness, affluence and bankruptcy, incapacity and ability, avarice and contentment, stinginess and generosity, joy over what is present, and regret over what is lost, altruism and expenditure, expansion and destitution, wastefulness and miserliness, satisfaction with little and disdain for much—all of this to test them as to which of them is best in deed, and to see which of them prefers the worldly life over the Hereafter as a substitute, seeks a deviation and turning away from the Hereafter, and takes the world as a provision and retinue. And blessings upon Muhammad, who abrogated with his religion other religions, and folded up with his law other creeds and sects, and upon his family and companions who tread the path of their Lord in humility, and abundant peace.

Now then: the trials of the world are numerous in branches and extremities, vast in regions and corners, but wealth is the greatest of its trials and the most perilous of its calamities. The greatest trial therein is that no one can do without it, yet when it is found, there is no safety from it. For if wealth is lost, poverty results from it, which almost amounts to disbelief; and if it is found, heedlessness results from it, the outcome of which is nothing but loss. In sum, it is not devoid of benefits and harms: its benefits are among the means of salvation, and its harms are among the causes of ruin. Distinguishing its good from its evil is among the intricate matters that none can manage except those of insight in religion from the firmly grounded scholars, not the superficial and deluded. Elucidating this is important to address separately, for what we mentioned in the book "The Condemnation of the World" was not an examination of wealth specifically, but of the world in general; since the world encompasses every immediate share, and wealth is some part of the world, status is some part of it, following the desires of the belly and private parts is some part of it, satisfying rage through the rule of anger and envy is some part of it, arrogance and seeking elevation is some part of it. It has many portions, and all that in which a person has an immediate share encompasses them. Our focus now in this book is on wealth alone, for in it are harms and perils. From its loss, a person acquires the attribute of poverty, and from its possession, the description of wealth. These are two states through which testing and trial occur.

Then the one lacking has two states: contentment and greed, one blameworthy and the other praiseworthy. And the greedy has two states: coveting what is in the hands of people, and striving for trades and crafts while despairing of creation, and coveting is the worse of the two states.

For the possessor, there are two states: withholding, which stems from the judgment of miserliness and avarice, and spending. One of these is blameworthy and the other is praiseworthy. For the spender, there are two states: wastefulness and moderation, and the praiseworthy is moderation.

These matters are ambiguous, and lifting the veil from their obscurity is essential. We shall, God Almighty willing, explain this in fourteen chapters: the censure of wealth, then its praise, then a detailed account of the benefits and harms of wealth, then the censure of greed and avarice, then the remedy for greed and avarice, then the virtue of generosity, then tales of the generous, then the censure of miserliness, then tales of the miserly, then self-preferential giving and its merit, then the definition of generosity and miserliness, then the remedy for miserliness, then the sum of duties regarding wealth, then the censure of riches and praise of poverty—God Almighty willing.

An Exposition on the Censure of Wealth and the Disapproval of Loving It

O you who have believed, let not your wealth nor your children divert you from the remembrance of God. And whoever does that—it is they who are the losers. And He said, exalted is He: "Your wealth and your children are but a trial, and with God is a great reward." So whoever chooses his wealth and his children over what is with God has indeed lost and been deprived, a tremendous loss. And He, mighty and majestic, said: "Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornment..." And He said: "Indeed, man becomes insolent when he sees himself self-sufficient." So there is no power nor strength save by God, the Most High, the Magnificent. And He said: "Competition in worldly increase has distracted you."

The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Love of wealth and status plants hypocrisy in the heart just as water plants vegetation." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Two ravenous wolves let loose among a flock of sheep do not cause more corruption in it than love of status, wealth, and rank cause in the religion of a Muslim man." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The wealthy are ruined, except for those who say with their wealth thus and thus for the servants of God, and few are they." It was said: O Messenger of God, who are the worst of your community? He said: "The rich." And he, peace be upon him, said: "There will come after you a people who eat the choicest foods of the world and its varieties, ride the finest horses and their breeds, marry the most beautiful women and their kinds, and wear the finest garments and their types. Their bellies are not satisfied with little, and their souls are not content with much. They are devoted to the world, going to it in the morning and returning to it in the evening. They have taken it as a god besides their God and a lord besides their Lord. To its command they yield and to its desires they follow. So, a firm resolve from Muhammad, son of Abdullah, for whoever from your descendants and successors reaches that time: do not greet them, do not visit their sick, do not follow their funeral processions, and do not honor their elders. For whoever does that has aided in the demolition of Islam." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Leave the world for its people. Whoever takes from the world more than what suffices him takes his own destruction while he is unaware." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The son of Adam says, 'My wealth, my wealth!' But do you have from your wealth except what you ate and consumed, or wore and wore out, or gave in charity and sent forth?" A man said: O Messenger of God, why do I not love death? He said: "Do you have wealth?" The man said: Yes, O Messenger of God. He said: "Send your wealth ahead, for the heart of the believer is with his wealth. If he sends it ahead, he loves to join it; and if he leaves it behind, he loves to remain with it." And he, peace be upon him, said: "The companions of the son of Adam are three: one follows him until his soul is taken, the second follows him to his grave, and the third follows him to the gathering place. The one who follows him until his soul is taken is his wealth; the one who follows him to his grave is his family; and the one who follows him to the gathering place is his deeds."

The disciples asked Jesus, peace be upon him, “Why can you walk upon the water, while we are incapable of it?” He replied to them, “What is the standing of the dinar and dirham to you?” They said, “Good.” He said, “But to me, they and clay are equal.” And Salman al-Farsi wrote to Abu al-Darda, may God be pleased with them both: “O my brother, beware of amassing worldly wealth for which you must give thanks, for I heard the Messenger of God, blessings and peace be upon him, say: ‘The possessor of the world who obeyed God in it will be brought forward, his wealth before him. Whenever he is about to topple from the Bridge, his wealth will say to him, “Pass on, for you have fulfilled God’s right in me.” Then the possessor of the world who did not obey God in it will be brought forward, his wealth upon his shoulders. Whenever he is about to topple from the Bridge, his wealth will say to him, “Woe to you! Did you not fulfill God’s right in me?” And it will not cease doing so until he cries out in ruin and destruction.’”

All that we have presented in the Book of Asceticism and Poverty concerning the censure of wealth and the praise of poverty ultimately returns entirely to the censure of property. Therefore, we shall not prolong by repeating it. Likewise, all that we have mentioned in censuring the world encompasses the censure of property by virtue of generality, because property is the greatest pillar of the world. We shall now mention only what has been transmitted specifically concerning property.

He said, peace be upon him, "When a servant dies, the angels say, 'What has he sent forth?' and the people say, 'What has he left behind?'" And he said, peace be upon him, "Do not take up farming, lest you come to love the world."

Narrations: It is reported that a man spoke ill of Abu al-Dardā’ and showed him harm, so he said: "O Allah, whoever does me harm, make his body healthy, prolong his life, and increase his wealth." See how he considered abundant wealth the ultimate tribulation alongside bodily health and long life? For it inevitably leads to transgression. And ‘Alī, may Allah honor his face, placed a dirham on his palm and said: "Indeed, as long as you do not depart from me, you will not benefit me." It is reported that ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, sent to Zaynab bint Jaḥsh her stipend, and she said: "What is this?" They said: "‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb has sent it to you." She said: "May Allah forgive him." Then she drew aside a curtain she had, cut it, made it into bundles, and distributed it among her household, relatives, and orphans. Then she raised her hands and said: "O Allah, do not let ‘Umar’s stipend reach me after this year of mine." And she was the first of the wives of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to join him. Al-Ḥasan said: "By Allah, whoever honors the dirham, Allah will humiliate him." It is said: "When the dīnār and dirham were first minted, Iblīs lifted them, placed them on his forehead, kissed them, and said: 'Whoever loves you is truly my slave.'" Samīṭ ibn ‘Ajlān said: "Dirhams and dīnārs are the reins of the hypocrites, by which they are led to the Fire." Yaḥyā ibn Mu‘ādh said: "The dirham is a scorpion; if you do not know its proper incantation, do not take it, for if it stings you, its poison will kill you." It was asked: "What is its incantation?" He said: "Taking it from its lawful source and placing it in its rightful place." Al-‘Alā’ ibn Ziyād said: "The world appeared to me adorned with every ornament, so I said: 'I seek refuge in Allah from your evil.' It replied: 'If you wish Allah to protect you from me, then despise the dirham and the dīnār.'" This is because the dirham and dīnār constitute the entire world, since through them access is gained to all its varieties. Thus, whoever abstains from them abstains from the world. Concerning this, it is said:

I have found that abstinence from this dirham, which you imagine to be other than it is, is the true piety. So when you are able to attain it, yet you leave it, then know that your piety is the piety of a true Muslim.

And concerning this it was also said:

Let not the patched garment deceive you, nor the coarse cloak,
Nor the raised hem of a garment above its proper measure,
Nor a forehead bearing the mark of prostration,
Nor the love of a dirham that has worn it thin,
Nor the recognition of his piety.

It is narrated that Maslamah ibn ‘Abd al-Malik entered upon ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, may God have mercy on him, at the time of his death and said, “O Commander of the Faithful, you have done something no one before you has done: you have left your children without a single dirham or dinar”—and he had thirteen children. ‘Umar said, “Sit me up!” So they sat him up, and he said, “As for your saying I have left them no dinar or dirham, I have not withheld from them what is rightfully theirs, nor have I given them what rightfully belongs to others. My children are one of two men: either obedient to God—and God suffices him, and God takes charge of the righteous—or disobedient to God—and I care not what befalls him.” And it is narrated that Muhammad ibn Ka‘b al-Qurazi came into much wealth, and it was said to him, “If only you would save it for your children after you.” He said, “No, rather I save it for myself with my Lord, and I save my Lord for my children.” And it is narrated that a man said to Abu ‘Abd Rabbih, “O my brother, do not depart in evil and leave your children in good!” So Abu ‘Abd Rabbih took out from his wealth one hundred thousand dirhams. And Yahya ibn Mu‘adh said, “Two calamities have befallen the servant regarding his wealth at the time of his death, the like of which the former and the latter have never heard.” It was said, “And what are they?” He said, “All of it is taken from him, and he is questioned about all of it.”

An Exposition on the Praise of Wealth and the Reconciliation Between Its Praise and Its Censure

Know that God Almighty has termed wealth as "good" in several places within His Noble Book. He, Glorified and Exalted, says: "If he leaves behind good" [the verse continues]. And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "How excellent is righteous wealth for a righteous man." Every mention of the reward for charity and pilgrimage is praise for wealth, as these cannot be attained except through it. God says: "And they bring forth its treasure as a mercy from your Lord," and He says, bestowing favor upon His servants: "And He supplies you with wealth and children, and makes for you gardens, and makes for you rivers." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Poverty almost becomes disbelief," which is also praise for wealth. You will not grasp the manner of reconciling blame and praise except by understanding the wisdom, purpose, harms, and perils of wealth, until it becomes clear to you that it is good from one aspect and evil from another, that it is praiseworthy insofar as it is good and blameworthy insofar as it is evil. For it is not pure good nor pure evil; rather, it is a cause for both. That which is described as such is inevitably praised at times and blamed at others. However, the discerning, insightful person realizes that the praiseworthy aspect of it is distinct from the blameworthy. Its clarification is derived from what we mentioned in the Book of Gratitude regarding the explanation of blessings and the detailing of the degrees of favors. The sufficient understanding in this matter is that the aim of the wise and possessors of insight is the happiness of the Hereafter, which is everlasting bliss and eternal sovereignty. Striving for this is the constant practice of the noble and the wise, for it was said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him: "Who are the most honorable and wisest of people?" He replied: "Those who remember death most and are most prepared for it." This happiness is only attained through three means in this world: spiritual virtues, such as knowledge and good character; bodily virtues, such as health and well-being; and external virtues beyond the body, such as wealth and other means. The highest are the spiritual, then the bodily, then the external.

The external matters are the basest, and wealth is among the externalities, the lowest of which are dirhams and dinars, for they are servants that have no servant of their own, and are intended for other than themselves. They are not desired for their own essence, since the soul is the precious substance whose happiness is sought, and it serves knowledge, gnosis, and noble character traits to acquire them as attributes within its own essence. The body serves the soul through the senses and limbs, while food and clothing serve the body. It has preceded that the purpose of food is to preserve the body, and of marriage to preserve progeny, and of the body to perfect the soul, purify it, and adorn it with knowledge and character. Whoever knows this hierarchy has known the value of wealth and the aspect of its nobility: that it is, inasmuch as it is a necessity for food and clothing—which are necessities for the survival of the body, which is a necessity for the perfection of the soul, which is the ultimate good—and whoever knows the benefit, end, and aim of a thing and uses it for that purpose, mindful of it and not heedless thereof, has done well and benefited, and what he attains of his objective is praiseworthy in his regard. Thus wealth is an instrument and means to a sound aim, and it can be taken as an instrument and means to corrupt aims—those that block the happiness of the Hereafter and obstruct the path of knowledge and righteous action. It is therefore both praiseworthy and blameworthy: praiseworthy in relation to a praiseworthy aim, and blameworthy in relation to a blameworthy aim. So whoever takes from this world more than suffices him has taken his own destruction without realizing it, as has been conveyed in the report.

Since human nature inclines toward pursuing base desires that obstruct the path to God, and since wealth facilitates and serves as a means to these desires, the peril in possessing more than what suffices is immense. Thus, the prophets sought refuge from its evil, to the extent that our Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—said, "O God, make the provision of Muhammad’s family just sufficient." He did not ask of this world except what is purely good, and he said, "O God, cause me to live as a poor man, cause me to die as a poor man, and resurrect me among the company of the poor." And Abraham—peace be upon him—sought refuge, saying, "And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols," meaning by them these two stones: gold and silver. For the rank of prophethood is too exalted to fear that one holding it would believe in the divinity of any such stones, as he was safeguarded from that even before prophethood, in his youth. Rather, the meaning of worshipping them is loving them, being deceived by them, and relying upon them. Our Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him—said, "Wretched is the slave of the dinar, wretched is the slave of the dirham, wretched and never relieved; if pierced by a thorn, may he not find relief." Thus, he made clear that whoever loves them is a worshipper of them, and whoever worships a stone is a worshipper of an idol. Indeed, anyone who is a slave to other than God is a worshipper of an idol—meaning, whatever cuts him off from God Almighty and from fulfilling His right is like an idol-worshipper, and this is polytheism. However, polytheism is of two kinds: hidden polytheism, which does not necessitate eternal punishment in the Fire and from which believers are seldom free, for it is more subtle than the crawling of an ant; and manifest polytheism, which does necessitate eternal punishment in the Fire. We seek refuge in God from all of it.

Detailed Exposition of the Harms and Benefits of Wealth

Know that wealth is like a serpent containing both poison and antidote; its benefits are its antidote, and its harms are its poison. Thus, whoever recognizes its harms and benefits can guard against its greed and draw from its goodness.

As for the benefits, they are divided into worldly and religious. As for the worldly, there is no need to mention them, for knowledge of them is well-known and common among all classes of creation; were it not so, they would not be so avid in seeking them.

As for the religious, they are all confined to three types.

The first type is that one spends it on oneself, either for worship or for assistance in worship. As for in worship: it is like using it for Hajj and Jihad, for one cannot attain them except with wealth, and they are among the greatest acts of nearness to God, from which the poor person is deprived. As for in what strengthens one for worship: that is food, clothing, shelter, marriage, and the necessities of living. For if these needs are not made easy, the heart becomes preoccupied with managing them and does not become free for religion. And that without which worship cannot be attained is itself worship. Therefore, taking sufficiency from the world for the sake of assistance in religion is among the religious benefits. This does not include indulgence and excess beyond need, for that is purely from the shares of the world.

The second type pertains to what is directed towards people, and it comprises four categories: charity, magnanimity, safeguarding honor, and compensation for service.

As for charity, its reward is evident, and indeed it extinguishes the wrath of the Lord, the Exalted. We have previously mentioned its merits.

Regarding magnanimity, we mean by it the expenditure of wealth upon the affluent and the noble through hospitality, gifts, and assistance of similar nature. For this is not termed charity; rather, charity is what is given to the needy. However, this [magnanimity] is among the religious benefits, for through it the servant gains brothers and friends, and through it he acquires the attribute of generosity and joins the ranks of the generous. None is described as truly liberal except he who practices benevolence and follows the path of magnanimity and chivalry. This also is among that wherein the reward is immense, for numerous reports have come concerning gifts, hospitality, and feeding food without stipulating poverty and need in their recipients.

As for the protection of honor, we mean by it the spending of wealth to repel the invective of poets and the slander of fools, and to silence their tongues and ward off their harm. This, while securing its immediate benefit, also counts among the religious merits. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "And whatever a person uses to protect his honor is recorded for him as charity." How could it not be so, when it involves preventing the backbiter from the sin of gossip and guarding against the enmity stirred by his words—an enmity that may lead, in requital and retaliation, to transgressing the limits of the Sacred Law.

As for employment, it is that the tasks which a person requires to arrange his means of livelihood are numerous. If he were to undertake them himself, his time would be wasted and it would become difficult for him to tread the path of the Hereafter through reflection and remembrance, which is the highest station of the wayfarers. And he who has no wealth is compelled to personally attend to his own service—from purchasing food, grinding it, and sweeping the house, to copying the book he needs—and everything you can imagine that another can perform to achieve your purpose, you are burdened if you occupy yourself with it. For upon you are matters of knowledge, action, remembrance, and reflection that cannot be conceived as being performed by another; thus, wasting time on other matters is a loss.

The third type is that which is not directed to a specific individual but results in general good, such as building mosques, bridges, hospices, houses for the sick, and setting up water wells along the road, and other such endowments dedicated to charitable causes. These are among the perpetual good deeds that continue after death, attracting the blessings of the prayers of the righteous for extended periods; and what excellent good it is! These are the collective benefits of wealth in religion, apart from what pertains to immediate worldly shares: deliverance from the humiliation of begging and the degradation of poverty, attainment of honor and glory among people, abundance of brothers, helpers, and friends, and reverence and dignity in hearts—all of that is among the worldly shares that wealth necessitates.

As for afflictions, they are of two kinds: religious and worldly. The religious ones are three.

The first is that it may lead to sins, for desires are of varying degrees, and incapacity may stand between a person and sinning; part of divine protection is not to find the means. Whenever a person despairs of a certain type of sin, its prompting does not stir. But when he feels capable of it, its prompting is aroused, and wealth is a kind of capability that stirs the prompting to sins and the commission of depravity. If he plunges into what he desires, he perishes; and if he exercises patience, he falls into hardship, for patience while having the ability is more severe, and the trial of ease is greater than the trial of hardship.

The second is that it leads to indulgence in permissible matters, and this is the beginning of the stages. For whenever a possessor of wealth is able to consume barley bread, wear coarse garments, and forsake the pleasures of foods—as Solomon, son of David, peace be upon them both, was capable of in his kingdom—then the best of his conditions is that he not indulge in worldly comforts and accustom himself to them, lest indulgence become familiar and beloved to him, such that he cannot bear its absence, and one part of it drags him to another. If his attachment to it intensifies, he may become unable to attain it through lawful earning, and thus plunge into doubtful matters and wade into ostentation, flattery, falsehood, hypocrisy, and all other vile traits, so that his worldly affairs may be arranged and his indulgence facilitated. For whoever increases his wealth increases his need for people, and whoever needs people must inevitably flatter them and disobey God in seeking their pleasure. If a person is saved from the first affliction, which is the direct pursuit of base desires, he will by no means be saved from this one. From need for creation arise enmity and friendship, and from it spring envy, malice, ostentation, arrogance, lying, tale-bearing, backbiting, and all other sins pertaining to the heart and tongue, not to mention transgression extending to the other limbs. All of this follows from the ill-omen of wealth and the need to preserve and manage it.

The third, from which none is exempt, is that the rectification of one's wealth distracts from the remembrance of God, Exalted is He. Everything that preoccupies a servant away from God is a loss. For this reason, Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "In wealth are three afflictions: that it be taken from an unlawful source." It was asked: "If it is taken from a lawful source?" He said: "That it be placed in an improper place." It was asked: "If it is placed in a proper place?" He said: "That its rectification preoccupies one from God, Exalted is He." And this is the chronic disease. For the foundation, essence, and secret of acts of worship is the remembrance of God and contemplation of His majesty, and that requires a heart that is free. The owner of an estate spends his evenings and mornings pondering disputes with the farmer and settling accounts with him, disputes with partners and their contention over water and boundaries, disputes with the agents of the ruler over the land tax, disputes with laborers over negligence in maintenance, and disputes with the farmers over their dishonesty and theft. The merchant is preoccupied with thoughts of his partner's treachery, his taking the profit alone, his negligence in work, and his squandering of wealth. Likewise is the owner of livestock. And so it is with all other types of wealth. The furthest from excessive preoccupation is coined wealth hoarded under the earth, yet thought still fluctuates over what to spend it on, how to preserve it, the fear of it being discovered, and warding off people's greed for it. The valleys of worldly thoughts have no end, while he who has his day's sustenance is safe from all of that. This is the sum of worldly afflictions, apart from what the possessors of wealth suffer in this world from fear, grief, sorrow, anxiety, and toil in repelling the envious, and enduring hardships in preserving and acquiring wealth. Therefore, the antidote for wealth is to take from it one's sustenance and to direct the remainder to good works; all else is poison and affliction. We ask God, Exalted is He, for safety and goodly aid through His grace and generosity, for He is over all things competent.

An Exposition on the Censure of Greed and Covetousness

Praise of contentment and renouncing desire for what is in the hands of others.

Know that poverty is praiseworthy—as we have presented in the Book of Poverty—but the poor person ought to be content, free from coveting what others possess, not turning his attention to what is in their hands, nor eager to acquire wealth by any means. This is only possible if he is satisfied with the bare necessity of food, clothing, and shelter, limiting himself to the smallest quantity and the humblest kind, and confining his hope to his day or his month, without burdening his heart with what lies beyond the month. For if he yearns for more or extends his hope, he loses the honor of contentment and inevitably becomes soiled by covetousness and the humiliation of greed. Greed and covetousness drag him into moral failings and the commission of disgraceful acts that breach chivalry. Indeed, man is created with an innate disposition toward greed, covetousness, and lack of contentment. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "If the son of Adam had two valleys of gold, he would seek a third, and nothing fills the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and God accepts the repentance of those who repent." And from Abu Waqid al-Laythi, who said: Whenever revelation came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, we would come to him with our knowledge of what was revealed. One day I came to him and he said, "Indeed, God Almighty says: 'We have sent down wealth for the establishment of prayer and the giving of alms, and if the son of Adam had a valley of gold, he would wish for a second, and if he had the second, he would wish for a third, and nothing fills the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and God accepts the repentance of those who repent.'" And Abu Musa al-Ash'ari said: "A chapter similar to Bara'ah was revealed, then it was lifted, but this was preserved from it: 'Indeed, God supports this religion with people who have no share (of the Hereafter), and if the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth, he would wish for a third, and nothing fills the belly of the son of Adam except dust, and God accepts the repentance of those who repent.'" And he, peace be upon him, said, "Two insatiable ones are never satisfied: the insatiable seeker of knowledge and the insatiable seeker of wealth." And he, peace be upon him, said, "The son of Adam grows old, but two things remain youthful with him: hope and love of wealth," or as it is said.

Since this is a misleading innate disposition and a destructive instinct in man, God Almighty and His Messenger praised contentment. He, peace be upon him, said, "Blessed is he who is guided to Islam and whose livelihood is sufficient and who is content with it." And he, peace be upon him, said, "There is no one, poor or rich, but will wish on the Day of Resurrection that he had been given only his sustenance in this world." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Wealth is not from abundance of possessions; rather, wealth is the richness of the soul." And he forbade intense greed and excessive pursuit, saying, "O people, be moderate in your seeking, for a servant will only receive what has been decreed for him, and no servant will depart from this world until he receives what has been written for him from it, even if it is reluctant." It is narrated that Moses, peace be upon him, asked his Lord, saying, "Which of Your servants is the richest?" He said, "The most content with what I have given him." He said, "Which of them is the most just?" He said, "He who is just with himself." And Ibn Mas'ud said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Indeed, the Holy Spirit inspired in my heart that a soul will not die until it has received its full provision, so fear God and be moderate in your seeking." And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to me, "O Abu Hurairah, if hunger becomes severe for you, then have a loaf of bread and a jug of water, and upon the world is destruction." And Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Be pious, and you will be the most devout of people; be content, and you will be the most grateful of people; and love for people what you love for yourself, and you will be a believer." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, forbade covetousness, as narrated by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari: A Bedouin came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and said, "O Messenger of God, advise me and be brief." He said, "When you pray, pray as if bidding farewell, and do not say anything for which you will have to apologize tomorrow, and abandon hope for what is in people's hands." And 'Awf ibn Malik al-Ashja'i said: We were with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him—nine or eight or seven—and he said, "Will you not pledge allegiance to the Messenger of God?" We said, "Have we not already pledged allegiance to you, O Messenger of God?" Then he said, "Will you not pledge allegiance to the Messenger of God?" So we extended our hands and pledged allegiance to him. Then one of us said, "We have pledged allegiance to you, but for what do we pledge allegiance?" He said, "That you worship God and associate nothing with Him, and perform the five prayers, and that you listen and obey," and he whispered a hidden word, "and that you do not ask people for anything." He said: Indeed, some of those men would drop his whip and would not ask anyone to hand it to him.

Narrations: 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Covetousness is poverty, and despair (of what others have) is wealth, and whoever despairs of what is in people's hands becomes independent of them." And it was said to one of the wise men: "What is wealth?" He said: "Fewness of desires and satisfaction with what suffices you." Regarding this, it is said:

Life is but hours that pass by, and the affairs of days repeat.
Be content with your life, abandon your whims, and you will live free.
For many a fate, driven by gold and ruby, leads to ruin.

Muhammad ibn Wasil would moisten bread with water and eat it, saying: "Whoever is content with this needs no one." Sufyan said: "The best of your worldly life is what you are not afflicted with, and the best of what afflicts you is what leaves your hands." Ibn Mas'ud said: "There is no day without a caller proclaiming: 'O son of Adam, a little that suffices you is better than much that makes you transgress.'" Samit ibn 'Ajlan said: "O son of Adam, your belly is but a span—what then leads you into the Fire?" A sage was asked: "What is your wealth?" He replied: "Adornment in appearance, moderation in the heart, and despair for what is in people's hands." It is related that God, exalted is He, said: "O son of Adam, if the entire world were yours, you would have from it only your sustenance. When I give you your sustenance from it and place its accounting upon another, then I am gracious to you." Ibn Mas'ud said: "When one of you seeks a need, let him seek it gently, and let not a man come saying: 'You and you!'—thus breaking his back—for only what is apportioned to him of provision, or what he is provided, will come to him." One of the Umayyads wrote to Abu Hazim—insisting that he present his needs to him—so he wrote back: "I have already presented my needs to my Master; what He gives me, I accept, and what He withholds from me, I am content with." A sage was asked: "What is most comforting to the wise, and what is most helpful in repelling grief?" He replied: "Most comforting to him is the good deeds he has sent forth, and most helpful in repelling grief is acceptance of the decreed fate." Another sage said: "I have found the most troubled in grief to be the envious, the most joyful in life the content, the most patient in adversity the greedy when hopeful, the most humble in life the one most detached from the world, and the greatest in regret the scholar who is excessive." Concerning this, it was said:

A youth I know lives with assurance,
For He who apportions provisions provides for him.
His honor is preserved, his face ever fresh,
Unsoiled, not worn by time.
Contentment is a treasure;
Whoever dwells in its courtyard
Has never in his life
Encountered a thing to distress him.

And it has also been said:
How long will I remain in departure and journeying,
In prolonged striving and turning away,
A stranger from home, not ceasing to be an exile,
Now in the east of the earth, then in its west,
While those beloved know not of my state.
If only I were content, provision would come to me in ease,
For contentment is wealth, not abundance of wealth.
Yet death does not cross the mind of one
Whose greed preoccupies his thoughts.

Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Shall I not inform you of what I deem lawful for myself from the wealth of God, the Exalted? Two garments for my winter and summer, a riding beast sufficient for my Hajj and Umrah, and my sustenance thereafter is like the sustenance of a man from Quraysh—I am neither the most elevated nor the lowliest among them. By God, I know not whether this is lawful or not?" It is as if he doubted whether this amount is an excess beyond the sufficiency one must be content with. And a Bedouin reproached his brother for guarding [wealth], saying: "O my brother, you are both a seeker and one sought. You are sought by He who never misses, and you seek what you have already been provided. It is as if what is hidden from you has been unveiled to you, and what you are in has been transferred away from you. It is as if, O my brother, you have never seen one who is greedy yet deprived, nor one who is ascetic yet provided for." Concerning this, it was said:

I see that increasing your greed for the world
makes it as if you will not die.
Do you have an endpoint, if one day you reach it,
where you will say, 'Enough, I am content'?

Al-Sha'bi narrated: It was recounted that a man caught a sparrow, and it said, "What do you intend to do with me?" He replied, "I will slaughter you and eat you." It said, "By God, I will neither satisfy your craving nor fill your hunger, but I will teach you three qualities that are better for you than eating me. The first I will teach you while I am in your hand; the second when I am on the tree; and the third when I am on the mountain." He said, "Give me the first." It said, "Do not grieve over what has passed you by." So he released it. When it reached the tree, he said, "Give me the second." It said, "Do not believe that which cannot be to be." Then it flew and alighted on the mountain and said, "O wretched one, had you slaughtered me, you would have extracted from my crop two pearls, each weighing twenty mithqals." He bit his lip in anguish and said, "Give me the third." It said, "You have already forgotten two, so how shall I inform you of the third? Did I not tell you: do not grieve over what has passed you by, and do not believe that which cannot be to be? My flesh, blood, and feathers do not weigh twenty mithqals, so how could there be in my crop two pearls each weighing twenty mithqals?" Then it flew away and departed. This is an example of the excess of human greed, for it blinds him from grasping the truth, to the point that he deems that which cannot be to be.

Ibn al-Sammak said: Hope is a rope in your heart and a fetter on your leg; remove hope from your heart, and the fetter will be removed from your leg.

Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi said: I entered upon al-Rashid and found him looking at a paper inscribed in gold. When he saw me, he smiled, and I said, "A benefit, may God set right the Commander of the Faithful?" He said, "Yes, I found these two verses in one of the treasuries of the Umayyads and admired them, and I have added a third to them." And he recited to me:

When a door is blocked for you in fulfilling a need, leave it for another whose door will open for you. For the fullness of the stomach suffices you, and avoiding disgraceful matters suffices you. Do not be one who squanders your honor, and refrain from riding into sins—their punishment will then refrain from you.

Abdullah ibn Salam asked Ka'b: "What causes knowledge to depart from the hearts of scholars after they have memorized and comprehended it?" He replied: "Covetousness, the greed of the soul, and the pursuit of needs." A man then asked al-Fudayl: "Explain to me the saying of Ka'b." He said: "A man covets something and seeks it, so his religion slips away from him. As for greed, it is the soul's greed for this world to the point that it does not wish to miss out on anything. You have a need for this and a need for that, and when he fulfills it for you, he pierces your nose, leads you wherever he wishes, gains power over you, and you submit to him. Out of your love for this world, you greet him when he passes by and visit him when he is ill; you do not greet for the sake of God Almighty nor visit for the sake of God. If you had no need of him, it would be better for you." Then he said: "This is better for you than a hundred narrations from so-and-so from so-and-so." Some wise men said: "Among the wonders of man is that if he were called to perpetual abode in the days of this world, his innate capacity for greed in amassing would not exceed what he has already employed, despite the brevity of enjoyment and the expectation of disappearance." Abdul Wahid ibn Zaid said: "I passed by a monk and asked him: 'From where do you eat?' He replied: 'From the threshing floor of the Subtle, the All-Aware, who created the millstone and brings it flour'—and he gestured with his hand to the grinders of his molars—'so glory be to the Omnipotent, the All-Aware.'"

Explanation of the Treatment for Greed and Covetousness

The remedy through which the attribute of contentment is acquired

Know that this remedy is composed of three pillars: patience, knowledge, and action. Their totality encompasses five matters: The first, which is action, is moderation in livelihood and gentleness in expenditure. For whoever desires the honor of contentment, he should close for himself the doors of outgoing expenses as much as he is able and restrain himself except for what is indispensable for him. For whoever increases his outgoing expenses and expands his spending, contentment will not be attainable for him. Rather, if he is alone, he should be content with a single coarse garment and content with whatever food there may be; and he should reduce condiments as much as he can, and accustom himself to that. And if he has dependents, he should restrict each one to this measure; for this measure is facilitated with the least effort. And with it, sufficiency in seeking and moderation in livelihood become possible, which is the foundation of contentment. By this we mean gentleness in expenditure and avoiding wastefulness in it. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, God loves gentleness in all matters." And he, peace be upon him, said: "None becomes destitute who practices moderation." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Three things bring salvation: fear of God in secret and in public, moderation in wealth and poverty, and justice in contentment and anger." And it is related that a man saw Abu al-Darda' picking up a grain from the ground while saying: "Indeed, part of your understanding is your gentleness in your livelihood." And Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, said: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Moderation, good demeanor, and righteous guidance are a part of twenty-some parts of prophethood."

In the tradition, "Prudent management is half of livelihood." And He said, "Whoever practices moderation, God enriches him; and whoever squanders, God impoverishes him; and whoever remembers God, the Almighty, God loves him." And He said, "When you intend a matter, then upon you is deliberation until God makes for you an opening and a way out." And deliberation in expenditure is among the most important matters.

Second: When one has in the present what suffices him, he should not be intensely agitated over the future. What aids in this is curtailing hope and being certain that the provision decreed for him will inevitably come to him, even if he does not strive intensely for it, for intense striving is not the cause for provisions arriving. Rather, one should be confident in the promise of God Almighty, as He, Mighty and Glorious, has said, "There is no creature on earth but that its provision is upon God." This is because Satan threatens him with poverty and commands him to indecency, saying: "If you do not strive to gather and save, perhaps you will fall ill, or perhaps become incapacitated and need to endure the humiliation of begging." Thus, he spends his entire life wearying himself in pursuit, out of fear of poverty, while Satan laughs at him for bearing this present hardship, heedless of God, due to imagining a hardship in the future that may never come. Concerning such a one it has been said:

Whoever spends his hours in amassing his wealth out of fear of poverty—that very act is poverty itself.

The two sons of Khalid entered upon the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he said to them, "Do not despair of provision as long as your heads are shaking, for indeed a human is born red, with no covering upon him, then God, the Exalted, provides for him." And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed by Ibn Mas'ud while he was sorrowful and said to him, "Do not increase your anxiety; what is decreed will be, and what provision is allotted to you will come to you." And he, peace be upon him, said, "Verily, O people, be moderate in your seeking, for a servant will have nothing except what has been written for him, and no servant will depart from this world until what has been written for him from it comes to him, even if it is reluctant." And a person does not cease from greed except through sound trust in God the Exalted's management in apportioning the provisions of His servants, and that it will inevitably be attained with moderation in seeking. Rather, one should know that God's provision for a servant comes from where he does not expect, more so. God the Exalted said, "And whoever fears God, He will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he does not expect." So when a door is closed to him, he should await provision from it, and his heart should not be agitated because of it. And he, peace be upon him, said, "God refuses to provide for His believing servant except from where he does not expect." And Sufyan said: Fear God, for I have never seen a God-fearing person in need. That is, God-fearing is not left lacking his necessity; rather, God casts into the hearts of Muslims to convey his provision to him. And Al-Mufaddal al-Dabbi said: I said to a Bedouin, "From where is your livelihood?" He said, "The vow of the pilgrim." I said, "And when they depart?" He wept and said, "If we only lived from where we know, we would not live." And Abu Hazim, may God be pleased with him, said: I found the world to be of two things: something of it is for me, which I hasten before its time even if I sought it with the strength of the heavens and the earth. And something of it is for other than me, therefore I did not attain it in what has passed, so I do not hope for it in what remains. What is for other than me is kept from me, just as what is for me is kept from others. So in which of these two shall I spend my life? This is a remedy from the perspective of knowledge, indispensable for repelling Satan's intimidation and his warning of poverty.

Third: To recognize the nobility found in contentment and the humiliation inherent in greed and covetousness. When this becomes firmly established within him, his inclination is stirred toward contentment, for in greed one is never free from toil, and in covetousness never free from degradation. In contentment, there is nothing but the pain of restraining oneself from desires and excesses. This is a pain known to none except God, and within it lies the reward of the Hereafter. As for that which is added to it—the gaze of people—it contains ruin and sin. Moreover, one forfeits the dignity of the soul and the capacity to follow the truth, for whoever increases in covetousness and greed increases his need for people, thus preventing him from calling them to the truth and compelling him to flatter, which destroys his religion. Whoever does not prefer the dignity of his soul over the cravings of the belly is feeble in intellect and deficient in faith. It is said, "The dignity of the believer lies in his independence from people." Thus, in contentment there is freedom and nobility. For this reason it is said: Be independent of whom you wish, and you become his equal; be in need of whom you wish, and you become his captive; be generous to whom you wish, and you become his commander.

The fourth is to frequently contemplate the indulgence of the Jews, the Christians, the base among people, and the foolish from among the crude Kurds and Bedouins, and those who possess neither religion nor intellect. Then let him look to the states of the Prophets and the saints, and to the conduct of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the rest of the Companions and the Successors, and listen to their narrations, and study their conditions. And let him give his intellect the choice between resembling the base among people or following the example of those who are the most honored categories of creation in the sight of God, until thereby patience in hardship and contentment with little are made easy for him. For if he indulges in the belly, the donkey eats more than he; and if he indulges in copulation, the pig is of a higher rank than he; and if he adorns himself in garments and ornaments, among the Jews are those of a higher rank than he. But if he is content with little and satisfied with it, none shares his rank except the Prophets and the saints.

The fifth is to comprehend the peril inherent in amassing wealth—as we have mentioned in the afflictions of wealth—and what it entails of fear of theft, plunder, and loss; and to understand the security and tranquility found in having empty hands. Let him reflect upon what we have mentioned concerning the afflictions of wealth, alongside what one forfeits of defending the gate of Paradise for five hundred years. For if he is not content with what suffices him, he will be joined to the company of the wealthy and removed from the register of the poor. This is perfected by always looking at those beneath him in worldly matters, not at those above him. Indeed, Satan constantly diverts his gaze in worldly affairs to those above him, saying: "Why do you cease from seeking when the possessors of wealth indulge in food and clothing?" And he diverts his gaze in religious matters to those beneath him, saying: "Why do you constrain yourself and fear God, when so-and-so is more knowledgeable than you and does not fear God? All people are preoccupied with indulgence, so why do you wish to distinguish yourself from them?" Abu Dharr said: "My intimate friend—may God's blessings be upon him—enjoined me to look at those below me, not at those above me," meaning in worldly matters. And Abu Hurairah said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "When one of you looks at someone whom God has favored over him in wealth and appearance, let him look at one who is below him, whom he has been favored over." Through these matters, one is able to acquire the character of contentment. The pillar of this affair is patience and curtailing hope, and to know that the limit of his patience in this world is but a few days, for the enjoyment of a long age, so that he may be like the sick person who endures the bitterness of medicine due to its intense taste, in anticipation of healing.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Generosity

Know that if wealth is absent, the servant's state should be contentment and lack of greed. If it is present, his state should be selflessness, generosity, doing good, and distancing oneself from stinginess and miserliness. For generosity is among the traits of the prophets, peace be upon them, and it is a foundation among the foundations of salvation. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, alluded to this when he said, "Generosity is a tree from the trees of Paradise, its branches dangling to the earth. Whoever takes hold of a branch of it, that branch will lead him to Paradise." And Jabir reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Gabriel, upon him be peace, said, 'God Almighty says: Verily, this is a religion I have chosen for Myself, and nothing will rectify it except generosity and good character. So honor it with these two as much as you are able.'" In another narration: "So honor it with these two as long as you accompany it." And from Aisha al-Siddiqah, may God be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "God Almighty does not create a friend for Himself except upon good character and generosity." And from Jabir, who said: It was asked, "O Messenger of God, which deeds are best?" He said, "Patience and magnanimity." And Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "There are two traits God Almighty loves and two traits God Almighty hates. As for the two God Almighty loves, they are good character and generosity. As for the two He hates, they are bad character and miserliness. And when God desires good for a servant, He employs him in fulfilling the needs of the people." And Al-Miqdam ibn Shurayh reported from his father, from his grandfather: I said, "O Messenger of God, guide me to a deed that will enter me into Paradise." He said, "Indeed, the means to forgiveness are giving food, spreading peace, and speaking kindly." And Abu Hurairah reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Generosity is a tree in Paradise. Whoever is generous takes hold of a branch of it, and that branch does not leave him until it enters him into Paradise. And stinginess is a tree in the Fire. Whoever is stingy takes hold of a branch from its branches, and that branch does not leave him until it enters him into the Fire." And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "God Almighty says: 'Seek bounty from the merciful among My servants; live under their protection, for I have placed My mercy in them. And do not seek it from those whose hearts are hardened, for I have placed My wrath in them.'" And from Ibn Abbas, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Overlook the sin of the generous one, for God takes his hand whenever he stumbles." And Ibn Mas'ud reported: He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Provision hastens to the feeder of food faster than a knife to the hump of a camel. And indeed, God Almighty boasts of the feeder of food to the angels, peace be upon them." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, God is Generous and loves generosity, and He loves noble character and despises base character." And Anas reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was never asked for anything in the cause of Islam except that he gave it. A man came to him and asked him, and he ordered for him a great flock of sheep from the charity sheep between two mountains. He returned to his people and said, "O my people, accept Islam, for Muhammad gives like one who fears not poverty." And Ibn Umar reported: He, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, said, "Indeed, God has servants whom He singles out with blessings for the benefit of [His] servants. Whoever fails in those benefits for the servants, God Almighty will transfer it from him and shift it to another." And from Al-Hilali, who said: Prisoners from Banu al-'Anbar were brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he ordered them killed, but singled out one man among them. Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God honor his face, said, "O Messenger of God, the Lord is one, the religion is one, and the sin is one, so what is the case of this one among them?" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Gabriel descended to me and said, 'Kill these and spare this one, for God Almighty has thanked him for the generosity within him.'" And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Everything has a fruit, and the fruit of kindness is swift relief." And from Nafi', from Ibn Umar, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The food of the generous one is medicine, and the food of the miser is disease." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Whoever magnifies the blessing of God upon him, magnified is the obligation of the people upon him." So whoever cannot bear that obligation exposes that blessing to removal. And Jesus, upon him be peace, said, "Amass much of that which the Fire will not consume." It was said, "And what is it?" He said, "Kindness." And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Paradise is the abode of the generous." And Abu Hurairah reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "The generous one is close to God, close to the people, close to Paradise, and far from the Fire. The miser is far from God, far from the people, far from Paradise, and close to the Fire. An ignorant generous person is more beloved to God than a learned miser. The most severe disease is miserliness." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Do good to the one who is worthy of it and to the one who is not worthy of it. If you find the worthy one, then you have indeed found the worthy one. And if you do not find the worthy one, then you yourself are among the worthy." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, the substitutes of my nation did not enter Paradise by prayer or fasting, but they entered it by generosity of soul, soundness of heart, and sincere advice for the Muslims." And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Indeed, God Almighty has made for kindness faces from His creation. He has endeared kindness to them and endeared its performance to them, and He directs the seekers of kindness to them, and He facilitates giving for them just as He facilitates rain for a barren land, reviving it and reviving its people by it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Every kindness is charity. Everything a man spends on himself and his family is written for him as charity. What a man uses to protect his honor is charity for him. Whatever a man spends in expenditure, God will replace it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Every kindness is charity. The guide to good is like its doer, and God loves the relief of the distressed." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Every kindness you do for a rich person or a poor person is charity." And it is reported that God Almighty revealed to Moses, upon him be peace, "Do not kill the Samaritan, for he is generous." And Jabir reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, sent out an expedition with Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah in command. They were in hardship, so Qays slaughtered nine riding camels for them. They related this to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, "Indeed, generosity is an innate trait of the people of that household." Narrations: Ali, may God honor his face, said: "When the world turns to you, spend from it, for it will not perish. When it turns away from you, spend from it, for it will not remain." And he recited:

Do not withhold from this world, for it is not diminished by generosity and extravagance when it approaches. And if it turns away, then more fitting is praise for it when you give freely as it departs behind.

Mu'awiyah asked Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them, about chivalry, valor, and generosity. He replied: As for chivalry, it is a man's safeguarding his religion, his vigilance over his soul, his excellent care for his guest, and his goodly striving and stepping forward in what is disliked. As for valor, it is defending one's neighbor and steadfastness in perilous places. As for generosity, it is volunteering good before being asked, providing food in its proper place, and showing compassion to the petitioner while bestowing the gift.

A man presented a petition to Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them. He said, "Your need is granted." It was said to him, "O son of the Messenger of God, if only you had looked at his petition and then given an answer proportionate to it." He said, "God, Mighty and Majestic, will ask me about the humility of his standing before me until I read his petition."

Ibn al-Sammak said, "I wonder at one who buys slaves with his wealth but does not buy free people with his kindness."

Some Bedouins were asked, "Who is your master?" They replied, "He who bears our insults, gives to our petitioner, and overlooks our ignorant one."

Ali ibn al-Husayn, may God be pleased with them, said, "Whoever is described as giving his wealth to those who ask him is not truly generous. The truly generous is he who initiates with the rights of God, Exalted is He, among the people of His obedience, and his soul does not contend with him for a love of thanks for it, when his certainty in God's reward is complete."

Al-Hasan al-Basri was asked, "What is generosity?" He said, "That you give freely of your wealth for the sake of God, Mighty and Majestic." It was said, "And what is prudence?" He said, "That you withhold your wealth for His sake." It was said, "And what is extravagance?" He said, "Spending out of love for leadership."

Ja'far al-Sadiq, mercy of God upon him, said, "There is no wealth more helpful than intellect, no calamity greater than ignorance, and no support like consultation. Indeed, God, Mighty and Majestic, says: 'Verily, I am Munificent and Generous; no vile person dwells near Me, and vileness is from disbelief, and the people of disbelief are in the Fire; and munificence and generosity are from faith, and the people of faith are in Paradise.'"

Hudhayfah, may God be pleased with him, said, "Many a sinful person in his religion, improvident in his livelihood, enters Paradise by his open-handedness."

It is related that al-Ahnaf ibn Qays saw a man with a dirham in his hand and said, "For whom is this dirham?" He said, "For me." He said, "Indeed, it is not yours until it leaves your hand." And in its meaning it is said:
You belong to the wealth when you hold it,
But when you spend it, then the wealth is for you.

Wasil ibn 'Ata was called "the Gazelle" because he would sit among the spinners; whenever he saw a woman in need, he would give her something. Al-Asma'i reported that al-Hasan ibn 'Ali wrote to al-Husayn ibn 'Ali—may God be pleased with them—reproaching him for giving to poets, and he wrote back: "The best wealth is that which protects one's honor." Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah was asked, "What is generosity?" He replied, "Generosity is kindness to brothers and giving of wealth." He said, "My father inherited fifty thousand dirhams and sent them in parcels to his brothers." And he said, "I used to ask God Almighty for Paradise for my brothers in my prayers—should I then be stingy with them regarding wealth?" Al-Hasan said, "Exerting utmost effort in giving what one possesses is the peak of generosity." A sage was asked, "Who is the most beloved of people to you?" He said, "He whose favors toward me are many." It was said, "And if there is none such?" He said, "He in whose presence my favors are many." 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Marwan said, "When a man allows me access to himself so that I may place a kindness with him, his hand to me is like my hand to him." Al-Mahdi asked Shabib ibn Shabba, "How did you find the people in my court?" He replied, "O Commander of the Faithful, indeed a man enters hopeful and leaves satisfied." And a poet recited in the presence of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far:

A favor is not truly a favor until it is bestowed upon one who is deserving. When you perform a favor, direct it for the sake of God, for near kin, or for a noble cause.

Abdullah ibn Ja'far said: These two lines indeed make people miserly, but shower kindness like rain, for if it falls upon the noble, they are worthy of it, and if it falls upon the base, you are worthy of it.

Tales of the Generous

From Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, from Umm Durrah—who used to serve 'Aishah, may God be pleased with her—who said: Mu'awiyah sent to her money in two bags, one hundred and eighty thousand dirhams. She called for a tray and began distributing it among the people. When evening came, she said, "O young girl, bring us our evening meal." So she brought her bread and olive oil. Umm Durrah said to her, "Were you not able, with all that you distributed today, to buy us a dirham's worth of meat to break our fast upon?" She replied, "If you had reminded me, I would have done so."

From Aban bin Uthman, it is said: A man intended to harm Ubaidullah bin Abbas, so he approached the prominent figures of Quraysh and told them, "Ubaidullah says to you: Come to me for the midday meal today." They went to him until they filled his house. He asked, "What is this?" They informed him of the matter. Ubaidullah then ordered the purchase of fruits and instructed some men to cook and bake bread. The fruits were presented to them, and before they had finished, the dining tables were set, and they ate until they were satisfied. Ubaidullah asked his stewards, "Do we have this available every day?" They replied, "Yes." He said, "Then let these people dine with us every day."

And Mus'ab bin al-Zubair said: Mu'awiyah performed the pilgrimage, and when he departed, he passed through Medina. Al-Husayn bin Ali said to his brother Al-Hasan, "Do not meet him or greet him." When Mu'awiyah left, Al-Hasan said, "We have a debt, so we must go to him." He rode after him, caught up, greeted him, and informed him of his debt. They passed by a camel laden with eighty thousand dinars, which had become exhausted and fallen behind the other camels, with people driving it. Mu'awiyah asked, "What is this?" It was mentioned to him, and he said, "Give it to Abu Muhammad to settle what he owes."

Waqid ibn Muhammad al-Waqidi reported that his father narrated to him: He had sent a petition to al-Ma'mun, mentioning therein the burden of his debts and his inability to endure them. Al-Ma'mun wrote on the back of his petition: "You are a man in whom two qualities have converged: generosity and modesty. As for generosity, it is what has emptied your hands; and as for modesty, it is what prevents you from informing us of your condition. I have ordered for you one hundred thousand dirhams. If I have judged correctly, then increase in open-handedness; and if I have not judged correctly, then the wrongdoing is upon yourself." And you narrated to me—when I was in the service of al-Rashid’s judiciary—from Muhammad ibn Ishaq, from al-Zuhri, from Anas: that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, "O Zubayr, know that the keys to the sustenance of the servants are near the Throne. God, Mighty and Majestic, sends to every servant according to his expenditure: whoever increases, it is increased for him; and whoever decreases, it is decreased for him—and you know best." Al-Waqidi said: "By God, al-Ma'mun’s reminding me of the hadith was more beloved to me than the reward, which was one hundred thousand dirhams."

A man asked Al-Hasan ibn Ali, may God be pleased with them both, for a need. He said to him: "O man, the right of your request to me is great in my sight, and my knowledge of what is due to you is immense to me. Yet my hand is incapable of granting you what you deserve. Much, in the essence of God the Exalted, is little, and what is in my possession falls short of thanking you. If you accept what is feasible and relieve me of the burden of undertaking and the concern for what I must bear of your rightful due, I will do so." The man said: "O son of the Messenger of God, I accept and am grateful for the gift, and I excuse you in withholding." Al-Hasan then called his agent and began settling accounts with him regarding his expenditures until he had reviewed them all. He said: "Bring the surplus from the three hundred thousand dirhams." He produced fifty thousand. He said: "What have you done with the five hundred dinars?" He replied: "They are with me." He said: "Bring them." He brought them, and Al-Hasan handed the dinars and dirhams to the man and said: "Bring someone to carry them for you." The man brought porters, and Al-Hasan gave them his cloak for the porters' fee. His servants said to him: "By God, we have not a dirham left!" He replied: "I hope to have a great reward with God."

The reciters of Basra gathered before Ibn Abbas, who was the governor there, and said: "We have a neighbor who fasts much and prays much. Each of us wishes to be like him. He has married his daughter to his nephew, who is poor, and he has nothing with which to furnish her." Abdullah ibn Abbas stood, took them by the hand, led them into his house, opened a chest, and took out six bags of dirhams. He said: "Carry them." They carried them. Then Ibn Abbas said: "We have not been fair to him; we have given him what will occupy him from his prayers and fasting. Let us return to be his helpers in furnishing her, for the world is not of such importance as to distract a believer from worshipping his Lord, nor are we so proud that we will not serve the allies of God the Exalted." And he did so, and they did so.

It was related that when the people in Egypt suffered drought, and Abd al-Hamid ibn Sa'id was their governor, he said: "By God, I will certainly let Satan know that I am his enemy." He then attended to the needs of their poor until prices became affordable. Later, he was removed from them and departed. The merchants had a claim of one million dirhams against him, so he pledged to them the jewelry of his wives as collateral, its value being five hundred thousand. When he found it impossible to redeem it, he wrote to them to sell it and to give the surplus, beyond settling their rights, to those whom his charity had not reached.

Abu Tahir ibn Kathir was a Shiite. A man said to him: "By the right of Ali ibn Abi Talib, grant me your palm grove in such-and-such a place." He said: "I have done so, and by his right, I will give you what is adjacent to it." And that was multiples of what the man had requested.

Abu Marthad was one of the generous ones. A poet praised him, and he said to the poet: "By God, I have nothing to give you, but take me to the judge and make a claim against me for ten thousand dirhams until I acknowledge it to you. Then have me imprisoned, for my family will not leave me imprisoned." He did that, and before the day ended, ten thousand dirhams were delivered to him, and Abu Marthad was released from prison.

Ma'n ibn Za'ida was the governor over the two Iraqs in Basra. A poet came to his gate and stayed for a period, wanting to gain audience with Ma'n but finding no opportunity. One day he said to one of Ma'n's servants: "When the Amir enters the garden, inform me." When the Amir entered the garden, he informed him. The poet wrote a verse on a piece of wood and threw it into the water that flowed into the garden. Ma'n was at the head of the water channel. When he caught sight of the wood, he took it and read it. Written upon it was:

"O generosity of Ma'n, intercede,
For I have no means to Ma'n
In my need
Save you as an intercessor."

He said, "Who is the owner of this?" The man was summoned, and he asked him, "What did you say?" The man replied to him, so he ordered for him ten dinars. He took them, and the emir placed the note under his carpet. When the second day came, he took it out from under the carpet, read it, and called for the man, handing him one hundred thousand dirhams. When the man took them, he reflected and feared that what he had been given might be taken back, so he departed. When the third day arrived, he read what was in it and called for the man, but he was sought and not found. Then Maʿn said, "It is incumbent upon me to give to him until not a single dinar remains in my treasury."

Abu al-Hasan al-Mada'ini said: Hasan, Husayn, and Abdullah ibn Ja'far set out as pilgrims, but their baggage was delayed, so they became hungry and thirsty. They passed by an old woman in her tent and asked, "Is there any drink?" She said, "Yes." They dismounted near her, though she had nothing but a small goat in the corner of the tent. She said, "Milk it and drink its milk." They did so, then asked her, "Is there any food?" She said, "No, except this sheep. Let one of you slaughter it so I may prepare something for you to eat." One of them rose, slaughtered it, and skinned it. Then she prepared food for them; they ate and stayed until the heat subsided. When they departed, they said to her, "We are a group from Quraysh heading this way. If we return safely, come to us, for we shall do you good." Then they left.

Her husband returned, and she told him of the men and the sheep. The man grew angry and said, "Woe to you! You slaughter my sheep for people you do not know, and then you say they are from Quraysh?" After some time, need compelled the two of them to enter Medina. They entered and began carrying dung into the city, selling it and living on its earnings. The old woman passed through one of Medina's lanes, and there was Hasan ibn Ali sitting at the door of his house. He recognized the old woman, though she did not recognize him. He sent his servant to summon her and said to her, "O servant of God, do you recognize me?" She said, "No." He said, "I am your guest on such-and-such day." The old woman exclaimed, "May my father and mother be your ransom! Is it you?" He said, "Yes." Then Hasan ordered that a thousand sheep from the charity livestock be bought for her, along with a thousand dinars, and sent her with his servant to Husayn. Husayn said to her, "How much did my brother give you?" She said, "A thousand sheep and a thousand dinars." So Husayn also ordered the same for her, then sent her with his servant to Abdullah ibn Ja'far. He asked her, "How much did Hasan and Husayn give you?" She said, "Two thousand sheep and two thousand dinars." So Abdullah ordered two thousand sheep and two thousand dinars for her, and said to her, "Had you come to me first, I would have exhausted them." The old woman returned to her husband with four thousand sheep and four thousand dinars.

Abdullah ibn 'Amir ibn Kurayz left the mosque intending to return to his home, alone. A young man from Thaqif stood up and approached him, walking by his side. Abdullah said to him, "Do you have a need, young man?" He replied, "Your well-being and success. I saw you walking alone and said to myself: I shall guard you with my own self and seek refuge in God should any harm befall your side." Abdullah took him by the hand and walked with him to his home. Then he called for a thousand dinars and gave them to the youth, saying, "Spend these, for how excellent is the upbringing your family has given you."

It is recounted that a group of Arabs came to visit the grave of one of their most generous men. They alighted at his tomb and spent the night there, having come from a distant journey. One of them saw in a dream the occupant of the grave, who said to him, "Would you exchange your camel for my thoroughbred?" The deceased generous man had left behind a renowned thoroughbred, and this man owned a fat camel. In the dream, he replied, "Yes," and sold his camel for the thoroughbred. When the contract was concluded between them, the man deliberately slaughtered his camel in the dream. He awoke from his sleep to find blood gushing from his camel's neck. The man rose, slaughtered it, divided its meat, they cooked it, satisfied their need with it, and then departed and journeyed on.

On the following day, while they were on the road, a caravan met them. A man from it asked, "Is so-and-so, son of so-and-so, among you?"—naming that man. He replied, "I am he." The man said, "Did so-and-so, son of so-and-so, send you anything?"—mentioning the deceased occupant of the grave. He said, "Yes, he sent my camel for his thoroughbred in a dream." The man said, "Take this, his thoroughbred." Then he added, "He is my father, and I saw him in a dream saying, 'If you are my son, deliver my thoroughbred to so-and-so, son of so-and-so,'" naming him.

A man from Quraysh returned from a journey and passed by a Bedouin man on the side of the road whom time had brought low and illness had afflicted. He said, "O you, help us against time." The man said to his servant, "Whatever remains with you of provision, give it to him." So the servant poured into the Bedouin's lap four thousand dirhams. He tried to rise but could not due to weakness, and he wept. The man said to him, "What makes you weep? Perhaps you think little of what we gave you?" He said, "No, but I remembered what the earth consumes of your generosity, and it made me weep."

And Abdullah ibn Amir bought from Khalid ibn Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt his house in the market for ninety thousand dirhams. When night came, he heard the weeping of Khalid's family and said to his household, "What is with these people?" They said, "They weep for their house." He said, "O servant, go to them and inform them that the money and the house are all theirs."

It is said that Harun al-Rashid sent five hundred dinars to Malik ibn Anas, may God have mercy on him. When Layth ibn Sa'd learned of this, he sent him a thousand dinars. Harun became angry and said, "I gave him five hundred, and you give him a thousand, while you are one of my subjects?" He replied, "O Commander of the Faithful, my daily income is a thousand dinars; I was ashamed to give an amount less than a single day's earnings." It is narrated that he was not liable for zakat despite his daily income of a thousand dinars. It is also narrated that a woman asked Layth ibn Sa'd, may God have mercy on him, for some honey. He ordered a large skin of honey to be given to her. He was told, "She would have been content with less than this." He said, "She asked according to her need, but we give according to the blessings bestowed upon us." Layth ibn Sa'd would not speak each day until he had given charity to three hundred and sixty poor people.

Al-A'mash said: "A sheep of mine fell ill, and Khaythamah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman would visit it morning and evening, asking me, 'Has it eaten its fodder? How have the children endured since they lost its milk?' He had a felt mat upon which he would sit, and when he left he would say, 'Take what is beneath the mat,' until he had given me, on account of the sheep's ailment, more than three hundred dinars out of his goodness, so much so that I wished the sheep had not recovered."

'Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan said to Asma' ibn Kharijah: "I have heard of certain qualities about you; tell me of them." He replied, "They are more beautiful coming from others than from me." He said, "I insist that you tell me of them." He said, "O Commander of the Faithful, I have never stretched out my legs before a companion of mine, nor have I prepared a meal and invited people to it without them being more secure from me than I from them, nor has a man ever presented his face to me asking for something and I considered what I gave him to be too much."

Sa'id ibn Khalid entered upon Sulayman ibn 'Abd al-Malik. Sa'id was a generous man, and if he had nothing, he would write a promissory note to the one who asked him, against himself, until his stipend arrived. When Sulayman looked at him, he recited these lines:

"Indeed, I heard at dawn a caller proclaiming,
'O you who aids the youth who seeks aid.'"

Then he asked, "What is your need?" He replied, "My debt." He asked, "And how much is it?" He replied, "Thirty thousand dirhams." He said, "Your debt is forgiven, and the same amount is granted to you."

It is related that Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah fell ill, and his brothers delayed in visiting him. It was said to them, "They are ashamed because of the debt they owe you." He said, "May God disgrace that which prevents brothers from visiting!" Then he ordered a caller to announce, "Whoever owes a debt to Qays ibn Sa'd is free from it." It is said that his doorstep was worn down by evening due to the multitude of those who came to visit and inquire after him.

From Abu Ishaq it is related that he said: I prayed the Asr prayer in the mosque of Al-Ash'ath in Kufa while seeking a debtor of mine. When I had prayed, a garment and a pair of sandals were placed before me. I said, "I am not a regular of this mosque." They said, "Indeed, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays al-Kindi arrived last night from Mecca and ordered that for everyone who prayed in the mosque, a garment and two sandals be given."

And the Shaykh Abu Sa‘d al-Harkushi al-Naysaburi, may God have mercy on him, said: I heard Muhammad ibn Muhammad the Hafiz say: I heard the Shafi‘i resident of Mecca say: In Egypt there was a man known for gathering something for the poor. A child was born to one of them, and he said: I came to him and told him, “A child has been born to me and I have nothing with me.” So he rose with me and entered upon a group of people, but nothing was opened (given). Then he came to the grave of a man and sat by it and said, “May God have mercy on you. You used to act and do good, and today I have gone around to a group and asked them to give something for a newborn, but nothing came about for me.” Then he stood up, took out a dinar, split it in half, and handed me half of it, saying, “This is a debt upon you until God opens something for you.” He said: I took it and departed, and I set right what had befallen me with it. He said: That overseer saw that person in a dream that night and said, “I heard all that you said, but we have no permission to reply. However, go to my house and tell my children to dig in the place of the hearth; they will bring out a jar containing about five hundred dinars. Carry them to this man.” When the next day came, he went to the deceased’s house and related the story to them. They said to him, “Sit down,” and they dug the spot and brought out the dinars and came with them, placing them before him. He said, “This is your wealth; my dream has no authority.” They said, “Shall he be generous in death while we are not generous in life?” When they insisted upon him, he carried the dinars to the man, the father of the newborn, and mentioned the story to him. He said: He took from them a dinar and broke it in half, giving him the half that he had lent him, and carried away the other half, saying, “This is enough for me; give it in charity to the poor.” Then Abu Sa‘id said: I do not know which of these was the most generous.

It is narrated that when Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, fell ill with his final illness in Egypt, he said, "Tell so-and-so to wash me." When he passed away, the news of his death reached that man, and he came and said, "Bring me his promissory note." It was brought to him, and he looked at it, and behold, al-Shafi'i had a debt of seventy thousand dirhams. He wrote it as a debt upon himself and paid it on his behalf, and said, "This is my washing of him"; meaning, he intended this by it. And Abu Sa'id al-Wa'iz al-Harkushi said, "When I arrived in Egypt, I sought the house of that man, and they directed me to it. I saw a group of his descendants and visited them, and I saw in them the marks of goodness and traces of virtue. So I said, 'The effect of his goodness has reached them, and his blessing has become manifest in them,' citing as evidence the saying of the Almighty, 'And their father was a righteous man.'" And Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, said, "I will never cease to love Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman because of something that reached me about him: that one day he was riding his donkey and moved, and his saddle-girth broke. He passed by a tailor and wanted to dismount to him to adjust his girth, but he said, 'By God, by God, I will not dismount.' So the tailor came to him and adjusted his girth. He then took out a purse containing ten dinars and gave it to the tailor, apologizing to him for its small amount." And Imam al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, recited for himself:

O, the regret of a heart over wealth
bestowed upon the impoverished among people of
nobility.
My apology to one who asks of me
what I do not possess is one of the calamities.

From Rabi' ibn Sulayman, who said: A man took hold of the stirrup of al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, so he said, "O Rabi', give him four dinars and apologize to him on my behalf." Rabi' said: I heard al-Humaydi say: Al-Shafi'i came from Sana'a to Mecca with ten thousand dinars. He pitched his tent in a place outside Mecca and spread them out on a garment. Then he turned to everyone who entered upon him, taking a handful for each and giving it to them, until he prayed the noon prayer, shook out the garment, and nothing remained with him. From Abu Thawr, who said: Al-Shafi'i intended to depart for Mecca, and he had wealth with him. He rarely held onto anything due to his generosity. I said to him, "You ought to buy an estate with this wealth for yourself and your children." He said: He departed, then came to us. I asked him about that wealth, and he said, "I did not find in Mecca an estate I could purchase with my knowledge of its origin, for most of them are endowments. But I built a shelter in Mina for our companions who come for pilgrimage, that they may lodge in it." And al-Shafi'i, may God have mercy on him, recited for himself, saying:
I see my soul yearning for things my wealth falls short of attaining.
My soul does not obey me in miserliness, nor does my wealth reach my aspirations.

Muhammad ibn ‘Abbad al-Muhallabi said: My father entered the presence of al-Ma’mun, who gifted him one hundred thousand dirhams. When he rose to leave, he gave it all in charity. Al-Ma’mun was informed of this, and when my father returned to him, al-Ma’mun reproached him for it. He replied, “O Commander of the Faithful, withholding what one possesses betrays poor trust in the Provider.” So al-Ma’mun gifted him another hundred thousand.

A man came to Sa‘id ibn al-‘As and asked him for something, so he ordered that he be given one hundred thousand dirhams. The man wept, and Sa‘id said to him, “What makes you weep?” He said, “I weep that the earth should consume one such as you.” So he ordered for him another hundred thousand.

Abu Tammam entered upon Ibrahim ibn Shaklah with some verses praising him, but found him ill. He accepted the praise and instructed his chamberlain to give him what was suitable, saying, “Perhaps I will recover and then reward him fittingly.” He stayed two months, and the length of his stay grew wearisome, so he wrote to him saying:

“To accept praise and then withhold what is hoped from it is forbidden—just as dirhams and dinars in trade are forbidden unless hand to hand.”

When the two men reached Ibrahim, he asked his chamberlain, "How long has he been at the door?" He replied, "Two months." Ibrahim said, "Give him thirty thousand, and bring me an inkwell." Then he wrote to him:

"You pleased us, so you came to us—a little, but even if you had delayed us, we would not have reduced it. Take the little, and be as if you never asked, while we remain as if we never acted."

It is narrated that Uthman was owed fifty thousand dirhams by Talhah, may God be pleased with them both. One day, Uthman went out to the mosque, and Talhah said to him, "Your money is ready; take it." He replied, "It is for you, O Abu Muhammad, as an aid to your noble character." Sa'dah bint 'Awf said, "I entered upon Talhah and saw him burdened, so I asked him, 'What is the matter with you?' He said, 'Wealth has accumulated with me, and it grieves me.' I said, 'What grieves you? Summon your kinsfolk.' So he said, 'O servant, bring my kinsfolk to me,' and he distributed it among them. I asked the servant, 'How much was it?' He said, 'Four hundred thousand.'" A Bedouin came to Talhah, asked him for help, and appealed to him by kinship. Talhah said, "No one has ever approached me with this bond of kinship before you. I have a piece of land for which Uthman gave me three hundred thousand. If you wish, take it; or if you wish, I will sell it to Uthman and give you the price." The man said, "The price." So he sold it to Uthman and gave him the price.

It is said that Ali, may God honor his countenance, wept one day and was asked: "What makes you weep?" He replied: "No guest has come to me for seven days; I fear that God may have disgraced me."

A man came to a friend of his and knocked on his door. The friend said, "What brings you?" He replied, "I owe four hundred dirhams in debt." So he weighed out four hundred dirhams and gave them to him, then turned away weeping. His wife said, "Did you give it to him even though it was hard for you?" He said, "I weep only because I did not inquire into his condition until he was forced to come to my door." May God have mercy on those who possess such qualities, and may He ignite a fervent love for them all.

An Exposition on the Censure of Miserliness

God Almighty said: "And whoever is saved from the greed of his own soul, it is they who are the successful." And He Almighty said: "And let not those who are stingy with what God has given them of His bounty think it is good for them; rather, it is bad for them. They will be collared with what they were stingy with on the Day of Resurrection." And He Almighty said: "Those who are stingy and enjoin stinginess upon people and conceal what God has given them of His bounty." And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of greed, for it destroyed those before you. It led them to shed their blood and deem lawful what was forbidden to them." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of greed, for it called those before you, so they shed their blood, and it called them, so they deemed lawful what was forbidden to them, and it called them, so they severed their kinship ties." And he (peace be upon him) said: "The stingy, the treacherous, and the betrayer will not enter Paradise, nor one with bad character." In one narration: "nor the tyrant." In another narration: "nor the one who reminds of his favors." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Three things are destructive: obeyed greed, followed desire, and a man's admiration of himself." And he (peace be upon him) said: "God detests three: the old fornicator, the stingy one who reminds of his favors, and the arrogant pauper." And he (peace be upon him) said: "The likeness of the generous and the stingy is that of two men wearing iron shirts from their chests to their collarbones. As for the generous one, whenever he spends, it expands and covers his skin until it conceals his fingertips. As for the stingy one, whenever he intends to spend, it contracts and tightens around his throat until it grips his collarbones; he tries to loosen it, but it does not expand." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Two traits do not combine in a believer: stinginess and bad character." And he (peace be upon him) said: "O God, I seek refuge in You from stinginess, and I seek refuge in You from cowardice, and I seek refuge in You from being returned to the most abject age." And he (peace be upon him) said: "Beware of oppression, for oppression is darkness on the Day of Resurrection. Beware of obscenity, for God does not love the obscene nor the one who acts obscenely. Beware of greed, for greed destroyed those before you. It commanded them to lie, so they lied; it commanded them to oppress, so they oppressed; it commanded them to sever ties, so they severed them." And he (peace be upon him) said: "The worst thing in a man is destructive greed and debilitating cowardice." A martyr was killed during the time of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), and a woman wept for him, saying, "O my martyr!" He (peace be upon him) said, "How do you know he is a martyr? Perhaps he used to speak about what did not concern him or was stingy with what would not diminish him." And Jubayr ibn Mut'im said: While we were traveling with the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and the people were returning from Khaybar, some Bedouins clung to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) asking him, until they pushed him against an acacia tree and snatched his cloak. He (peace be upon him) stopped and said, "Give me my cloak. By the One in whose hand is my soul, if I had as many camels as these twigs, I would distribute them among you, and you would not find me stingy, nor a liar, nor a coward." And 'Umar (may God be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) made a distribution, and I said, "Were others not more deserving of it than these?" He said, "They give me the choice between asking me offensively or considering me stingy, and I am not stingy." And Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: Two men came to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and asked him for the price of a camel, so he gave them two dinars. They left his presence and met 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (may God be pleased with him), and they praised and thanked him for what he had done for them. 'Umar went to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and informed him of what they said. He (peace be upon him) said, "But so-and-so, I gave him between ten and a hundred, and he did not say that. Indeed, one of you asks me and goes away carrying his request, and it is fire." 'Umar said, "Then why did you give them what is fire?" He said, "They refuse but to ask, and God refuses stinginess for me." And from Ibn 'Abbas, he said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "Generosity is from the generosity of God Almighty, so be generous, and God will be generous to you. Indeed, God Almighty created Generosity and placed it in the form of a man, and He rooted its head in the base of the Tuba tree, and He tied its branches to the branches of the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary, and He lowered some of its branches to the world. Whoever clings to a branch of it, He will admit him to Paradise. Indeed, generosity is from faith, and faith is in Paradise. And He created Stinginess from His wrath and rooted its head in the base of the Zaqqum tree and lowered some of its branches to the world. Whoever clings to a branch of it, He will admit him to the Fire. Indeed, stinginess is from disbelief, and disbelief is in the Fire." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Generosity is a tree that grows in Paradise; none will enter Paradise but the generous. Stinginess is a tree that grows in the Fire; none will enter the Fire but the stingy." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said to the delegation of Banu Lahyan, "Who is your chief, O Banu Lahyan?" They said, "Our chief is Jadd ibn Qays, except that he is a man with stinginess." He (peace be upon him) said, "And what disease is more severe than stinginess? But your chief is 'Amr ibn al-Jamuh." In another narration, they said, "Our chief is Jadd ibn Qays." He said, "For what do you make him chief?" They said, "He has the most wealth, and yet we see stinginess in him." He (peace be upon him) said, "And what disease is more severe than stinginess? That is not your chief." They said, "Then who is our chief, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Your chief is Bishr ibn al-Bara'." And 'Ali (may God be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "God detests the stingy person during his life and the generous person at his death." And Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said, "The ignorant generous person is more beloved to God than the worshipping stingy person." And he also said: He (peace be upon him) said, "Greed and faith do not gather in the heart of a servant." And he also said, "Two traits do not gather in a believer: stinginess and bad character." And he (peace be upon him) said, "It is not fitting for a believer to be stingy or cowardly." And he (peace be upon him) said, "Your saying goes: 'The miser is more excusable than the oppressor.' But what oppression is more oppressive to God than greed? God Almighty has sworn by His might, His majesty, and His grandeur: neither the miser nor the stingy will enter Paradise."

It is narrated that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was circumambulating the House when he saw a man clinging to the coverings of the Kaaba, saying, "By the sanctity of this House, forgive me my sin!" He, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "And what is your sin? Describe it to me." The man said, "It is too great for me to describe to you!" He said, "Woe to you! Is your sin greater, or the earths?" He replied, "Rather, my sin is greater, O Messenger of God." He said, "Is your sin greater, or the mountains?" He said, "Rather, my sin is greater, O Messenger of God." He said, "Is your sin greater, or the seas?" He said, "Rather, my sin is greater, O Messenger of God." He said, "Is your sin greater, or the heavens?" He said, "Rather, my sin is greater, O Messenger of God." He said, "Is your sin greater, or the Throne?" He said, "Rather, my sin is greater, O Messenger of God." He said, "Is your sin greater, or God?" He said, "Rather, God is greater and more exalted." He said, "Woe to you! Then describe your sin to me." He said, "O Messenger of God, I am a man of considerable wealth. When a beggar comes to me asking, it is as if he confronts me with a flame of fire." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Away from me! Do not burn me with your fire. For by the One who sent me with guidance and honor, if you were to stand between the Corner and the Station and pray for two thousand thousand years, and weep until rivers flow from your tears and trees are watered by them, and then die while being miserly, God would cast you into the Fire. Woe to you! Do you not know that miserliness is disbelief, and disbelief is in the Fire? Woe to you! Do you not know that God Almighty says, 'And whoever is miserly is only miserly toward himself... And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul—it is they who are the successful'?"

Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, narrated: When God created the Garden of Eden, He said to it, "Adorn yourself." So it adorned itself. Then He said to it, "Reveal your rivers." So it revealed the Spring of Salsabil, the Spring of Kafur, and the Spring of Tansim. From them gushed forth in the Gardens rivers of wine, rivers of honey, and rivers of milk. Then He said to it, "Reveal your treasures, your pavilions, your thrones, your ornaments, your silks, and your wide-eyed maidens." So it revealed them. He looked upon it and said, "Speak." It said, "Blessed is he who enters me." God, Exalted and Majestic is He, said, "By My might, I shall not house a miser within you."

Umm al-Banin, the sister of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, said: "Fie upon the miser! If miserliness were a garment, I would not wear it; and if it were a path, I would not tread it."

Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, may God be pleased with him, said: "We find in our wealth what the miser finds, but we are discerning."

Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: "It used to be said that when God wills evil for a people, He places their worst over them as rulers and puts their provision in the hands of their misers."

Ali, may God honor his countenance, said in a sermon: "There will come upon people a biting time, when the wealthy will cling greedily to what is in his hand, though he was not commanded to do so. God, Exalted is He, said, 'And do not forget graciousness among yourselves.'"

Abdullah ibn Amr said: "Stinginess is more severe than miserliness, for the stingy person is one who is covetous of what is in another's hand until he takes it, and is niggardly with what is in his own hand, withholding it. The miser is one who is miserly with what is in his own hand."

Al-Sha'bi said: "I do not know which of the two delves deeper into the Fire of Hell: miserliness or lying?"

It is related that a sage from India and a philosopher from Rome came before Anushirwan. He said to the Indian, "Speak." He said: "The best of people is one who is found to be generous, dignified when angry, deliberate in speech, humble in high station, and compassionate to every relative." The Roman stood and said: "Whoever is miserly, his enemy will inherit his wealth. Whoever is lacking in gratitude will not attain success. Liars are blameworthy. Slanderers die in poverty. And whoever shows no mercy will have one who shows him no mercy placed in authority over him."

Al-Dahhak, concerning God's saying, 'We have placed shackles upon their necks,' said: "It is miserliness. God, Exalted is He, restrained their hands from spending in His cause, so they do not perceive guidance."

Ka'b said: "There is no morning that dawns but that two angels are entrusted with it, calling out, 'O God, hasten ruin for the withholder and hasten replacement for the spender.'"

Al-Asma'i said: I heard a Bedouin describing a man, and he said, "So-and-so has become small in my sight due to the greatness of the world in his sight. It is as if he sees the beggar as the Angel of Death when he comes to him."

Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, said: "I do not deem it just to appoint a miser as a judge, for miserliness compels him to be exacting, taking more than his due for fear of being cheated. Whoever is like this cannot be trusted with a trust."

Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: "By God, a noble person never exacts his full right." God, Exalted is He, said, "He recognized part of it and disregarded part."

Al-Jahiz said: "Nothing remains of pleasures except three: censuring misers, eating dried meat, and scratching a scab."

Bishr ibn al-Harith said: "The miser has no backbiting." The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Then you are indeed a miser." A woman was praised before the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and they said, "She fasts much, prays much, except that she has some miserliness." He said, "Then what good is she?" And Bishr said: "Looking at a miser hardens the heart, and meeting misers is a distress upon the hearts of the believers."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: "In the heart, there is nothing for the generous except love, even if they are sinners; and for the misers nothing but dislike, even if they are righteous."

Ibn al-Mughtari said: "The most miserly person with his wealth is the most generous with his honor." Yahya ibn Zakariya, peace be upon them both, met Iblis in his form. He said to him, "O Iblis, inform me of the most beloved person to you and the most hated person to you." He said, "The most beloved person to me is the believing miser, and the most hated person to me is the profligate who is generous." He said to him, "Why?" He said, "Because the miser, his miserliness has sufficed me. As for the profligate who is generous, I fear that God will look upon him in his generosity and accept him." Then he turned away, saying, "Were it not that you are Yahya, I would not have informed you."

Tales of the Miserly

It is said there was in Basra a wealthy but miserly man. One of his neighbors invited him and served him a dish of eggs, which he ate in excess. He then drank water until his stomach swelled, and distress and death approached him. As he writhed in agony, and when his condition became severe, he described his state to a physician, who said, "No harm shall come to you; vomit what you have eaten." He exclaimed, "What! Vomit a dish of eggs? Death, but not that!"

It is also said: A Bedouin came seeking a man, before whom there were figs, which the man covered with his cloak. The Bedouin sat, and the man asked him, "Do you know any of the Quran?" He said, "Yes," and recited, "...and the olive and Mount Sinai." The man said, "And where are the figs?" He replied, "They are beneath your cloak."

Another invited his brother but served him nothing, detaining him until afternoon when his hunger intensified and seized him like madness. The host took a lute and said, "By my life, what sound do you desire me to play for you?" He answered, "The sound of frying."

It is recounted that Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Khalid al-Barmaki was miserly, with an ugly stinginess. A relative who knew him well was asked about him, and someone said, "Describe his dining table to me." He replied, "It is delay upon delay, and his plates are hollowed from poppy seeds." It was said, "Who attends it?" He said, "The noble scribes!" It was asked, "Does anyone eat with him?" He said, "Yes, the flies." The relative said, "Your disgrace is apparent, while you are intimate with him and your garment is tattered." He replied, "By God, I cannot afford a needle to mend it with. Even if Muhammad possessed a house from Baghdad to Nubia filled with needles, and Gabriel and Michael came to him with the Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, requesting a needle and asking to borrow it to sew the shirt of Joseph that was torn from behind, he would not give it."

It is said that Marwan ibn Abi Hafsa, out of stinginess, would not eat meat until he craved it intensely. When he craved it, he would send his servant to buy a head (of an animal) and eat it. He was asked, "We see you eat only heads in summer and winter; why do you choose that?" He said, "Yes, the head—I know its price, so I am safe from the servant's deceit, and he cannot cheat me in it. It is not meat that the servant cooks, from which he could eat. If he touches an eye, ear, or cheek, I would notice. And I eat from it various flavors: its eye one flavor, its ear another, its tongue another, its throat another, its brain another, and I am spared the trouble of cooking it; thus, many benefits are combined for me in it."

One day he went out intending to see the Caliph al-Mahdi, and a woman from his household said to him, "What is my due from you if you return with a reward?" He said, "If I am given a hundred thousand, I will give you a dirham!" He was given sixty thousand and gave her four daniqs. Once he bought meat for a dirham, and a friend invited him, so he returned the meat to the butcher with a reduction of a daniq, saying, "I dislike extravagance."

Al-A'mash had a neighbor who would constantly offer him hospitality, saying, "If only you would enter and eat a morsel with salt!" But al-A'mash would refuse. One day he offered, and al-A'mash happened to be hungry, so he said, "Let us go." He entered his house, and he brought him a morsel and salt. A beggar came, and the host said to him, "May you be blessed," and repeated the request to him, saying, "May you be blessed." When he asked a third time, he said to him, "Go, by God, or I will come out to you with a stick!" Al-A'mash called out to him and said, "Go, woe to you! For by God, I have never seen anyone more truthful in his promises than he! For a long time he has been inviting me for a morsel and salt, and by God, he has never added anything to them!"

Explanation of Self-Preferential Giving and Its Merit

Know that generosity and miserliness each have degrees. The highest degree of generosity is altruism (ithar), which is to give generously of one's wealth despite being in need oneself. For generosity is defined as bestowing what one does not need upon someone in need or not in need, but to give while in need is more profound. Just as generosity can reach the point where a person is generous to others despite his own need, miserliness can reach the point where a person is miserly even toward himself in need. How many misers withhold wealth, fall ill yet do not seek treatment, and desire something but are prevented only by miserliness over the price; had they found it for free, they would have taken it. This is miserliness toward oneself in need; while that one gives preference to others over himself even though he is in need of it. So consider the difference between the two men? For character traits are gifts that God places where He wills, and there is no degree in generosity beyond altruism. God praised the Companions, may God be pleased with them, for this, saying, "And they give preference over themselves, even though poverty is their lot." And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Any man who desires something but suppresses his desire and gives preference to others over himself, will be forgiven." And Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, never ate his fill for three consecutive days until he departed this world, and had we wished we could have eaten our fill, but we preferred others over ourselves." A guest came to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and he found nothing in his household. A man from the Ansar entered upon him, took the guest to his own home, placed food before him, and ordered his wife to extinguish the lamp. He kept moving his hand toward the food as if eating, but did not eat, until the guest had eaten. In the morning, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said to him: "God was indeed amazed at your action toward your guest." And the verse was revealed: "And they give preference over themselves, even though poverty is their lot." So generosity is a trait from the attributes of God Almighty; and altruism is the highest degree of generosity. This was from the character of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, such that God Almighty called it great, saying, "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." And Sahl ibn Abd Allah al-Tustari said: Moses, peace be upon him, said, "O Lord, show me some of the degrees of Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his community!" He said, "O Moses, you will not be able to bear that, but I will show you one of his exalted, great stations by which I have favored him over you and over all My creation." He said: Then He unveiled for him the dominion of the heavens, and he saw a station whose lights and nearness to God Almighty almost caused his soul to perish. He said, "O Lord, by what did he attain this honor?" He said, "By a character with which I distinguished him among them, and that is altruism. O Moses, none of them comes to Me having practiced it for a period of his life but that I feel ashamed to call him to account, and I settle him in My Paradise wherever he wishes." It is said that Abdullah ibn Ja'far went to one of his estates and stopped at a palm grove belonging to some people, in which there was a black slave boy working. When the boy's meal was brought to him, a dog entered the garden and approached the boy. The boy threw it a loaf, and it ate it. Then he threw it the second and the third, and it ate them, while Abdullah watched him. He said, "O boy, how much is your daily ration?" He said, "What you saw!" He said, "Then why did you prefer this dog with it?" He said, "This is not a land of dogs; it came from a far distance hungry, and I disliked to be full while it was hungry!" He said, "What will you do today?" He said, "I will fast today." So Abdullah ibn Ja'far said, "Shall I be blamed for generosity? This boy is more generous than I." So he bought the garden, the boy, and the tools in it, freed the boy, and gifted it to him. And Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: A sheep's head was gifted to a man among the companions of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He said, "My brother is more in need of it than I," and sent it to him. It continued to be passed from one to another until it circulated through seven households and returned to the first. And Ali, may God honor his face, spent the night on the bed of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. So God Almighty revealed to Gabriel and Michael, peace be upon them: "I have made brotherhood between you and made the life of one of you longer than the other's. So which of you will give preference to his companion with life?" They both chose life and loved it. So God Almighty revealed to them: "Would you not be like Ali ibn Abi Talib? I made brotherhood between him and My Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and he lay on his bed, sacrificing himself for him and giving him preference with life? Descend to the earth and protect him from his enemy." So Gabriel was at his head and Michael at his feet, and Gabriel, peace be upon him, said: "Well done, well done! Who is like you, O son of Abi Talib? By God, Almighty God boasts of you to the angels!" And God Almighty revealed: "And among the people is he who sells himself seeking the pleasure of God, and God is Kind to [His] servants." And from Abu al-Hasan al-Antaki: About thirty people gathered at his place—they were in a village near Rayy—and they had a counted number of loaves, insufficient to satisfy them all. They broke the loaves, extinguished the lamp, and sat for the meal. When it was lifted, the food was as it was; none of them had eaten anything from it, each preferring his companion over himself. And it is narrated that Shu'bah was approached by a beggar, and he had nothing. So he removed a wooden beam from the roof of his house and gave it to him, then apologized to him. And Hudhayfah al-Adawi said: "I went on the day of Yarmouk seeking my cousin, and I had a little water with me, saying, 'If he has any life, I will give him drink and wipe his face with it.' Then I found him and said, 'Shall I give you drink?' He gestured to me yes. Then a man said, 'Ah...' My cousin gestured for me to go to him. I went to him and found he was Hisham ibn al-As. I said, 'Shall I give you drink?' Another heard him and said, 'Ah...' Hisham gestured for me to go to him. I went to him and found he had died. I returned to Hisham and found he had died. I returned to my cousin and found he had died. May God's mercy be upon them all." And Abbas ibn Dahqan said: "No one left the world as he entered it except Bishr ibn al-Harith, for a man came to him during his illness and complained of need. So he removed his shirt and gave it to him, and borrowed a garment and died in it." And from some of the Sufis, he said: "We were in Tarsus, a group of us gathered and went out to the gate of jihad. A dog from the town followed us. When we reached the outskirts of the gate, we saw a dead animal. We climbed to a high place and sat down. When the dog saw the carcass, it returned to the town, then came back after an hour with about twenty dogs. It went to that carcass and sat aside, and the dogs fell upon the carcass. They kept eating it while that dog sat watching them until they ate the carcass and only bones remained, and the dogs returned to the town. That dog stood up, went to those bones, ate a little of what remained on them, and then departed."

We have already mentioned a collection of reports concerning altruism and the states of the saints in the Book of Poverty and Asceticism, so there is no need for repetition here. Success is by God, and upon Him is reliance in that which pleases Him, the Almighty, the Glorious.

An Exposition on the Definition of Generosity and Stinginess, and Their True Nature

Perhaps you may say: "It is known through religious evidences that miserliness is among the destructive traits, but what defines miserliness? And by what does a person become a miser? There is no person who sees himself as generous while perhaps others see him as miserly. An action may issue from a person, and people differ regarding it: some say this is miserliness, while others say this is not from miserliness. And there is no person except that he finds within himself a love for wealth, and because of it he preserves and withholds wealth. If withholding wealth makes one a miser, then no one would be free from miserliness. And if withholding in an absolute sense does not necessitate miserliness, and miserliness has no meaning except withholding, then what is the miserliness that necessitates perdition? And what defines generosity, by which one truly deserves the attribute of generosity and its reward?"

We say: Some have said the definition of miserliness is withholding what is obligatory. Thus, whoever fulfills what is obligatory upon him is not a miser. Yet this is insufficient; for one who returns meat, for example, to the butcher, or bread to the baker, short by a grain or half a grain, is considered a miser by consensus. Likewise, one who gives his dependents the amount decreed by the judge, then restricts them over an extra morsel they take or a date they eat from his wealth, is considered a miser. And one who has a loaf before him, and someone arrives whom he thinks will eat with him, so he hides it from him, is considered a miser.

Others have said: The miser is one who finds giving difficult. This too is deficient; for if it is meant that he finds every gift difficult, how many misers do not find a small gift—like a grain or close to it—difficult, yet find what is beyond that difficult? And if it is meant that he finds some gifts difficult, then is there any generous person except that he may find some gifts difficult? Namely, that which consumes all his wealth or a great portion of it. This does not necessitate a judgment of miserliness.

Similarly, they have spoken about generosity. It is said: Generosity is giving without obligation and bestowing without hesitation. It is said: Generosity is giving without being asked, while seeing the gift as little. It is said: Generosity is delight in the asker and joy in giving when possible. It is said: Generosity is giving while seeing that wealth belongs to God Almighty and the servant belongs to God, so he gives God's wealth to God's servant without seeing poverty. It is said: Whoever gives some and keeps some is possessor of liberality; whoever gives most and keeps something for himself is possessor of generosity; whoever endures hardship and prefers another with sufficiency is possessor of selflessness; and whoever gives nothing is possessor of miserliness.

The totality of these words does not encompass the true reality of generosity and miserliness. Rather, we say: Wealth is created for a wisdom and a purpose, which is its suitability for the needs of creation. It is possible to withhold it from being spent on that for which it was created to be spent, and it is possible to bestow it by spending it on that which it is not proper to spend it. And it is possible to manage it with justice, which is to preserve it where preservation is obligatory, and to bestow it where bestowal is obligatory. Thus, withholding where bestowal is obligatory is miserliness, and bestowing where withholding is obligatory is wastefulness. Between them is a middle course, which is praiseworthy, and it is fitting that generosity and magnanimity be an expression of it; for the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was not commanded except with generosity. It was said to him, "And do not make your hand chained to your neck, nor stretch it forth to the utmost limit." And the Almighty has said, "And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, and between that is a just moderation." Therefore, generosity is the middle course between extravagance and stinginess, and between open-handedness and tight-fistedness. It is to measure his bestowal and his withholding according to the measure of what is obligatory. And it is not sufficient to do that with his limbs unless his heart is content with it, not contending with him over it. For if he bestows in a place where bestowal is obligatory while his soul contends with him and he endures it, he is one who forces himself and is not generous. Rather, it is necessary that his heart have no attachment to wealth except from the perspective that wealth is intended for him—which is to spend it on that which it is obligatory to spend it.

If you ask: This then hinges on knowing what is obligatory, so what must one give? I say: The obligatory is of two kinds: obligatory by religious law, and obligatory by noble character and custom. The generous person is one who withholds neither what is obligatory by religious law nor what is obligatory by noble character. Whoever withholds one of these is miserly, but he who withholds what is obligatory by religious law is more miserly—like one who refuses to pay zakah or denies his family and dependents their necessary expenses, or who does pay it but with hardship, for he is miserly by nature and only forces himself to be generous. Or like one who selects the inferior portion of his wealth to give and whose heart is not content to give from the best of his wealth, or even from its average portion—all this is miserliness.

As for the obligation of moral integrity, it is to abandon pettiness and exactingness, for that is unbecoming, and what is deemed unbecoming varies according to circumstances and individuals. Thus, from one whose wealth is abundant, what is deemed unbecoming differs from what is deemed so from a servant. In hospitality, pettiness is deemed unbecoming in ways it is not in transactions, and this varies according to the nature of the pettiness—whether in hospitality or in dealings—and according to what the pettiness concerns, be it food or clothing. For in matters of food, what is deemed unbecoming is not so in other matters; and in purchasing, for example, a shroud, or a sacrificial animal, or bread for charity, pettiness is deemed unbecoming in ways it is not in other forms of exactingness. Likewise, it varies according to whom the pettiness is directed: a friend, a brother, a relative, a spouse, a child, or a stranger. And it varies according to who exhibits the pettiness: a child, a woman, an elder, a youth, a scholar, an ignorant person, a wealthy one, or a poor one.

The miser is one who withholds when he ought not to withhold, whether by the dictate of the Sacred Law or by the dictate of noble character, and the precise measure of this cannot be definitively stipulated. Perhaps the definition of miserliness is withholding wealth from an objective, when that objective is more important than preserving wealth. For safeguarding the religion is more important than preserving wealth; thus, one who withholds obligatory alms and necessary expenditure is a miser. And safeguarding noble character is more important than preserving wealth; one who haggles over minutiae with someone with whom such haggling is unbecoming, thereby tearing the veil of noble character out of love for wealth, is a miser.

Then there remains another degree: a man may be one who fulfills his obligations and preserves his noble character, yet possesses abundant wealth he has amassed and does not spend in charity or to those in need. Here, the objective of preserving wealth as a provision against life's vicissitudes contends with the objective of seeking reward to elevate his degrees in the Hereafter. Withholding wealth from this latter objective is considered miserliness by the discerning, though not by the common folk. This is because the perspective of the common folk is confined to worldly interests; they see withholding to ward off life's calamities as paramount. Yet, even among the common folk, a mark of miserliness may appear upon him if a needy person is in his vicinity and he withholds, saying, "I have paid the obligatory alms, and nothing beyond that is incumbent upon me." The degree to which this is deemed reprehensible varies according to the extent of his wealth, the severity of the needy person's need, the soundness of his faith, and his deservingness.

Whoever fulfills the obligation of the Sacred Law and the obligation of noble character befitting him has absolved himself of miserliness. Indeed, he is not described with the quality of generosity and magnanimity unless he gives beyond that in pursuit of virtue and attaining higher degrees. When his soul expands to give wealth where the Sacred Law does not oblige it and where customary blame does not befall him, he is generous to the extent his soul expands, be it with little or much. The degrees of this are innumerable, and some people are more generous than others. Performing acts of kindness beyond what custom and noble character oblige is generosity, but on the condition that it is done with a willing heart, and not out of hope or expectation for service, recompense, gratitude, or praise. For whoever hopes for gratitude and praise is a seller, not a generous person; he buys praise with his wealth, and praise is sweet and inherently desirable. True generosity is giving something without compensation. This is the reality, and it is inconceivable except from God, Exalted is He. As for a human being, the term 'generosity' applied to him is metaphorical, for he does not give something except for an objective. But if his objective is nothing but reward in the Hereafter, or acquiring the virtue of generosity and purifying the soul from the baseness of miserliness, then he is called generous. If, however, the motive is, for example, fear of censure, or fear of people's blame, or some expected benefit from the recipient, then all of that is not from generosity, because he is compelled to it by these motives, which are immediate compensations for it; he is a compensator, not a generous giver.

As narrated from one of the devout women: She stood before Hayyan ibn Hilal while he was sitting with his companions and said, "Is there among you one whom I may ask a question?" They said to her, "Ask whatever you wish," and they gestured to Hayyan ibn Hilal. She said, "What is generosity according to you?" They said, "Giving, bestowing, and preferring others." She said, "This is generosity in worldly matters. So what is generosity in religion?" They said, "That we worship God, Glorified is He, with our souls being generous in it, not coerced." She said, "And do you desire a reward for that?" They said, "Yes." She said, "Why?" They said, "Because God, Exalted is He, has promised us ten times the like for a good deed." She said, "Glory be to God! If you give one and take ten, with what have you been generous to Him?" They said to her, "So what is generosity according to you, may God have mercy on you?" She said, "Generosity according to me is that you worship God in a state of delight, relishing His obedience, without aversion, and you do not desire a reward for it, so that your Master may do with you as He wills! Are you not ashamed before God that He should behold your hearts and know from them that you want something for something? Verily, this in worldly terms is ugly!"

And another devout woman said, "Do you suppose generosity is only in dirhams and dinars?" It was said, "In what then?" She said, "Generosity, in my view, is in [sacrificing] one's very lifeblood."

And al-Muhasibi said: "Generosity in religion is that you are generous with your very self, destroying it for God, Mighty and Majestic, and that your heart is generous in bestowing your cherished life and spilling your blood for God, Exalted is He, with liberality and without compulsion. And you do not desire by that a reward, immediate or deferred—even though you are not independent of reward—but the conviction of the beauty and perfection of generosity by relinquishing choice to God prevails over you, so that your Master is the One who does for you what you do not know how to choose for yourself."

Explanation of the Treatment for Stinginess

Know that miserliness stems from love of wealth. The love of wealth has two causes: one is the love of pleasures that cannot be attained except through wealth, coupled with extended hope—for if a person knew he would die after a day, he would likely not be miserly with what he possesses, since the amount needed for a day, a month, or a year is small, even if his hope is short. But if he has children, the child takes the place of extended hope, for he estimates their survival as his own and withholds for their sake. Thus, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The child makes one miserly, cowardly, and ignorant." When fear of poverty and lack of trust in the arrival of provision are added to this, miserliness inevitably grows strong.

The second cause is love for wealth itself. Among people are those who possess what suffices them for the remainder of their lives if they limit themselves to their customary expenditure, with thousands to spare. Yet he is an old man without children, possessing abundant wealth, and his soul does not permit him to give zakah nor to treat himself when ill. Rather, he has become a lover of dinars, infatuated with them, taking delight in their presence in his hand and in his power over them. He hoards them underground while knowing he will die and they will be lost or taken by his enemies. Despite this, his soul does not permit him to eat or give in charity from it a single grain. This is a disease of the heart, grave and difficult to treat, especially in old age—a chronic illness with little hope of cure.

The example of such a person is like a man who fell in love with a person, then loved his messenger for himself, forgot his beloved, and busied himself with his messenger. For dinars are a messenger that delivers one to needs; thus they become beloved for that reason, because what leads to delight is delightful. Then the needs may be forgotten, and gold becomes to him as if beloved in itself—and that is the utmost misguidance. Indeed, whoever sees a difference between it and a stone is ignorant, except in terms of fulfilling his need by it. What exceeds the measure of his need and the stone are of one status. These are the causes of loving wealth.

The treatment for every ailment is to oppose its cause. Thus, love of desires is treated with contentment with little and with patience. Long hope is treated by frequent remembrance of death and reflecting on the death of peers and their long toil in amassing wealth and its loss after them. The heart's inclination toward children is treated by knowing that their Creator created their provision with them, and how many a child did not inherit wealth from his father, yet his state is better than one who did inherit? And by knowing that he gathers wealth for his child wishing to leave his child in good while he himself returns to evil, and that if his child is pious and righteous, God will suffice him, but if he is corrupt, he will use his wealth to aid in disobedience, and its burden will return to him.

His heart is also treated by frequent contemplation of the reports transmitted condemning miserliness and praising generosity, and what God has threatened for miserliness of severe punishment. Among the beneficial remedies is frequent reflection on the states of misers and the natural aversion to them and their ugliness to others, for there is no miser except that he finds miserliness ugly in others and finds every miser among his companions burdensome. Thus he knows he is burdensome and despised in the hearts of people, like all misers are in his own heart.

His heart is also treated by pondering the purposes of wealth: why was it created? Nothing of wealth is to be kept except according to the measure of his need for it. The remainder he stores for himself in the Hereafter by attaining reward through spending it. These are remedies from the perspective of knowledge and insight. When he knows with the light of inner sight that spending is better for him than withholding, in this world and the next, his desire for spending will stir—if he is rational. If desire stirs, he should respond to the first prompting and not hesitate, for Satan promises him poverty and frightens him and turns him away from it.

It is recounted that Abu al-Hasan al-Bushanji was once in the privy when he called a student of his and said, "Remove my shirt and give it to so-and-so." The student replied, "Could you not wait until you come out?" He said, "I could not trust myself not to change my mind, for I had resolved to give it away!" And the trait of miserliness does not depart except by forcing oneself to give, just as passionate love does not depart except by parting from the beloved through travel from one's abode; until, when one travels and forces separation and endures patience for a time, his heart finds solace from it. Likewise, whoever wishes to treat miserliness must part from wealth by forcing himself to give it away—indeed, even throwing it into the water would be better for him than holding onto it while loving it.

Among the subtle stratagems for this is to deceive oneself with a good name and renown for generosity, so that one gives with the aim of showing off, until his soul becomes accustomed to giving out of desire for the dignity of magnanimity. Thus he removes from himself the foulness of miserliness but acquires with it the foulness of ostentation. However, he may then turn upon the ostentation and remove it by its treatment. Seeking reputation becomes like a consolation for the soul when weaning it from wealth, just as a child is consoled when weaned from the breast by playing with sparrows and the like—not to be left with the plaything, but to detach from the breast to it, then to be transferred from it to something else. Similarly, these vile traits should be set against one another, as desire is set against anger to break its vehemence, and anger is set against desire to break its recklessness—except that this is beneficial for one in whom miserliness is stronger than love of status and ostentation, so that the stronger is removed by the weaker. But if status is as beloved to him as wealth, then there is no benefit, for he would uproot one ailment only to increase another like it. However, a sign of this is that giving for the sake of ostentation does not weigh heavily upon him; thus it becomes clear that ostentation is stronger in him. If giving is difficult for him even with ostentation, then he should still give, for that indicates that the disease of miserliness is more dominant in his heart.

An example of how these traits counteract one another is what is said about the deceased: all his parts transform into worms, then some worms devour others until their number diminishes, then they consume one another until only two strong, large ones remain. These two then continually fight until one overcomes the other, devours it, and grows fat from it. Then it remains alone, hungry, until it dies. Similarly, these vile traits can be set against each other until they are suppressed, making the weaker a source of strength for the stronger until only one remains. Then divine care intervenes to erase and dissolve it through spiritual struggle, which is to deprive it of nourishment. Depriving traits of nourishment means not acting according to their demands, for they inevitably call for certain actions; when opposed, the traits diminish and die. Take miserliness: it demands withholding wealth. If its demand is resisted and wealth is given away with effort, time after time, the trait of miserliness dies, generosity becomes second nature, and the effort vanishes. Treating miserliness involves knowledge and action: knowledge pertains to understanding the harm of miserliness and the benefit of generosity, while action pertains to giving and spending with deliberate effort. However, miserliness can grow so strong that it blinds and deafens, preventing true knowledge from taking root. Without true knowledge, desire is not stirred, action becomes difficult, and the ailment becomes chronic—like an illness that prevents knowing the remedy or using it, leaving no recourse but patience until death.

It was the practice of some Sufi masters in treating the ailment of miserliness in disciples to forbid them from becoming attached to their prayer niches. If a master sensed a disciple’s delight in his niche and its contents, he would move him to another niche and transfer another’s niche to him, stripping him of all he possessed. If he saw him glancing fondly at a new garment he wore or a prayer rug that pleased him, he would order him to hand it over to another and wear a worn garment that his heart did not incline toward.

Thus the heart withdraws from worldly pleasures. Whoever does not tread this path finds intimacy with the world and loves it. If he possesses a thousand delights, he will have a thousand beloved things. Therefore, if each one is stolen from him, a calamity befalls him according to his love for it. And when he dies, a thousand calamities descend upon him all at once, because he loved everything and it has been stripped away from him. Indeed, even in his life, he lives in peril of loss and ruin.

A king was presented with a bejeweled turquoise goblet, unparalleled in beauty, and he rejoiced exceedingly. He asked a sage in his court, "What think you of this?" The sage replied, "I see it as a calamity or poverty." The king asked, "How so?" He answered, "If it breaks, it is an irreparable calamity; if stolen, you become poor for its lack, unable to find its equal. Before it came to you, you were secure from such calamity and poverty." Later, it was either broken or stolen, and the king’s grief was immense. He exclaimed, "The sage spoke truth! Would that it had never come to us!"

Such is the nature of all worldly means. For the world is an enemy to God’s enemies, driving them to the Fire; an enemy to God’s friends, as it tests them with patience in abstaining from it; an enemy to God Himself, for it obstructs His path for His servants; and an enemy to itself, for it consumes itself. Wealth is preserved only by treasuries and guards, yet treasuries and guards are obtained only by wealth—the very coins and dinars spent. Thus wealth devours itself, opposing its own essence until it perishes.

Whoever knows the affliction of wealth finds no comfort or joy in it, taking only what suffices for need. He who is content with sufficiency is not miserly, for withholding for one’s need is not miserly, nor does he require more. He does not weary himself guarding it, but spends freely, like water on the bank of the Tigris, where none hoards it, for people are content with what meets their need.

Explanation of the Total Duties Incumbent Upon the Servant Regarding His Wealth

Know that wealth, as we have described it, is good from one perspective and evil from another. Its likeness is that of a serpent which the skilled healer takes and extracts from it the antidote, while the heedless one takes it and its poison kills him from where he does not realize. And no one is safe from the poison of wealth except by safeguarding five duties.

The first is to recognize the purpose of wealth and why it was created, and that one has no need for it beyond acquiring and preserving only what is necessary, nor should one devote to it more attention than it deserves.

Second: That one should consider the source from which wealth enters, and avoid that which is purely unlawful, as well as that which is predominantly unlawful, such as the wealth of rulers. One should also avoid sources that are reprehensible and damaging to one’s integrity, such as gifts tainted with bribery, or begging that entails humiliation and the degradation of one’s honor, and the like.

The third: concerning the amount one earns, neither hoarding it nor deeming it too little, but rather the obligatory measure, and its standard is need. Need comprises clothing, shelter, and sustenance. Each of these has three levels: the lowest, the middle, and the highest. As long as one inclines toward the side of scantiness and draws near the limit of necessity, one is among the truthful and will be counted among the truthful. But if one exceeds that, one falls into an abyss whose depth has no end. We have detailed these levels in the Book of Renunciation.

Fourth: That one should consider the source of earnings and be moderate in spending, neither wasteful nor miserly, as we have mentioned. He should place what he has lawfully earned in its rightful place and not place it in an improper place, for the sin in taking from an unlawful source and placing in an improper place is the same.

The Fifth: That one rectifies his intention in acquisition and abstention, in spending and withholding, so that he takes what he takes to seek aid through it for worship, and abandons what he abandons out of asceticism towards it and deeming it insignificant. If he does this, the possession of wealth will not harm him. For this reason, 'Ali, may God be pleased with him, said: "If a man were to take all that is on earth and intend by it the Countenance of God, the Exalted, he is an ascetic; and if he were to abandon it all and not intend by it the Countenance of God, the Exalted, he is not an ascetic." Therefore, let all your movements and stillnesses be for God, confined to an act of worship or to what assists in worship. For the actions furthest from worship are eating and relieving oneself, yet both are aids to worship. So if your aim in them is that, then they become worship in your regard. Likewise, your intention should be in everything you preserve, such as a shirt, a waist-wrapper, bedding, and utensils, for all of that is among what is needed for religion. What exceeds the need, one should intend by it that a servant from among the servants of God may benefit from it, and not withhold it from him in his time of need. Whoever does this is he who has taken from the serpent of wealth its essence and its antidote, and guarded against its poison, so the abundance of wealth does not harm him. But this is not attainable except for one whose foot is firmly rooted in religion and whose knowledge therein is great. As for the common person, if he imitates the scholar in amassing much wealth and claims he resembles the wealthy Companions, he resembles the child who sees the skilled snake-charmer take the serpent and handle it, extracting its antidote, and so he imitates him, thinking he has taken it, admiring its form and shape and feeling the softness of its skin, and takes it in imitation of him, so it kills him instantly—except that the one killed by the serpent knows he is killed, while the one killed by wealth may not know. The world has been likened to a serpent, and it is said:

It is a world like a serpent, smooth to the touch, yet it spews forth venom.

Just as it is impossible for the blind to emulate the sighted in traversing mountain passes, the edges of the sea, and thorny paths, so too is it impossible for the common person to emulate the perfected scholar in the acquisition of wealth.

An Exposition on the Censure of Wealth and the Praise of Poverty

Know that people have differed regarding the superiority of the grateful rich over the patient poor—and we have presented that in the Book of Poverty and Asceticism, unveiling the truth therein—but in this book we indicate that poverty is, in general, better and higher than wealth, without delving into the distinctions among the wealthy, where one argues with the wealthy Companions and the abundant wealth of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, likening himself to them. Al-Muhasibi, may God have mercy on him, the luminary of the community in the science of spiritual conduct, who preceded all seekers of the faults of the soul, the defects of deeds, and the depths of worship, and his words are worthy of being related as they are. After his discourse refuting the wicked scholars, he said: It has reached us that Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, said: O wicked scholars, you fast and pray and give charity, yet you do not do what you are commanded; you study what you do not practice—how evil is your judgment! You repent with words and wishes but act according to desires. What avails you that you cleanse your skins while your hearts remain filthy? In truth, I say to you: Do not be like a sieve that lets fine flour pass through while the bran remains within; likewise, you let wisdom issue from your mouths while malice remains in your breasts. O slaves of this world, how can one attain the Hereafter whose appetite for this world does not cease, nor his desire for it cut off? In truth, I say to you: Your hearts weep from your deeds; you have placed the world under your tongues and deeds under your feet. In truth, I say to you: You have ruined your Hereafter, so the rectification of this world is dearer to you than the rectification of the Hereafter. Who among people is more lost than you, if you but knew? Woe unto you! How long will you describe the path to night travelers while you remain in the place of the perplexed? It is as if you call the people of the world to leave it for you. Hold back, hold back! Woe unto you! What avails a dark house if a lamp is placed above it while its interior is a dark, empty void? Likewise, it avails you not that the light of knowledge is on your tongues while your interiors are desolate and idle! O slaves of this world, not like slaves who are pious, nor like free men who are noble; soon this world will uproot you from your foundations, cast you upon your faces, then overturn you upon your noses, then take your sins by your forelocks, then drive you from behind until it delivers you to the Sovereign Judge, naked and alone, where you will be stood before your shameful deeds and recompensed for your evil works. Then al-Harith, may God have mercy on him, said: My brothers, these wicked scholars are the satans of mankind and a trial upon the people; they have desired the fleeting splendor of this world and preferred it over the Hereafter, and they have traded religion for this world. Thus, in this life they are disgrace and blemish, and in the Hereafter they are the losers—unless the Generous One pardons them by His grace.

And after: I have observed that the perishing one, who prefers the fleeting joys of this world, finds his pleasure mixed with vexation, from which gush forth various sorrows and diverse sins, and his end is ruin and destruction. The perishing one rejoices in his hopes, yet his worldly life does not remain for him, nor does his religion remain secure for him. "He has lost this world and the Hereafter; that is the manifest loss." What a calamity, how dreadful it is, and what a great affliction! So, fear God, my brothers, and let not Satan and his allies from among those familiar with arguments that are invalid before God deceive you. For they vie greedily for this world, then seek excuses and arguments for themselves, and claim that the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) possessed wealth, so the deceived adorn themselves with the mention of the Companions to excuse themselves before people for amassing wealth. Indeed, Satan has overwhelmed them, and they are unaware.

Woe to you, O deluded one! Your argument citing the wealth of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf is a snare from Satan that he speaks upon your tongue, leading you to ruin! For if you claim that the righteous Companions desired wealth for multiplication, status, and adornment, then you have backbitten the masters and attributed to them a grave matter. And if you claim that amassing lawful wealth is higher and better than abandoning it, then have you belittled Muhammad and the Messengers? You have attributed to them a lack of desire and asceticism regarding this good that you and your companions desire in amassing wealth, and you have attributed ignorance to them for not amassing wealth as you have. And if you claim that amassing lawful wealth is higher than abandoning it, then you have claimed that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) did not sincerely advise the community when he forbade them from amassing wealth, while knowing that amassing wealth is better for the community? Thus, according to your claim, he deceived them when he forbade them from amassing wealth. You have lied, by the Lord of the heavens, against the Messenger of God (peace be upon him)! For he was a sincere adviser to the community, compassionate and merciful toward them. And if you claim that amassing wealth is better, then you have claimed that God Almighty did not care for His servants when He forbade them from amassing wealth, while knowing that amassing wealth is better for them? Or you claim that God the Exalted did not know that virtue lies in accumulation, and therefore forbade them from it, while you are knowledgeable of the good and virtue in wealth, and therefore desire to amass much, as if you are more aware of the place of good and virtue than your Lord? Exalted is God above your ignorance, O deluded one! Reflect with your intellect upon what Satan has overwhelmed you with when he made arguing with the wealth of the Companions appealing to you! Woe to you, what benefit is your argument with the wealth of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf when 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf will wish on the Day of Resurrection that he had not been given from this world except mere sustenance? And it has reached me that when 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf (may God be pleased with him) passed away, some people among the Companions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) said: "We fear for 'Abd al-Rahman regarding what he left behind!" Ka'b said: "Glory be to God! What do you fear for 'Abd al-Rahman? He earned lawfully, spent lawfully, and left behind lawfully!" This reached Abu Dharr, and he went out angrily seeking Ka'b. He passed by the jawbone of a camel, took it in his hand, then set out seeking Ka'b. Ka'b was told: "Abu Dharr is looking for you," so he fled until he entered upon 'Uthman seeking his protection and informed him of the news. Abu Dharr came following the trail in search of Ka'b until he reached the house of 'Uthman. When he entered, Ka'b stood and sat behind 'Uthman, fleeing from Abu Dharr. Abu Dharr said to him: "Ho there, O son of a Jewish woman! You claim there is no harm in what 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf left behind? The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) went out one day toward Uhud, and I was with him, and he said: 'O Abu Dharr.' I said: 'At your service, O Messenger of God.' He said: 'Those with the most are those with the least on the Day of Resurrection, except for one who says thus and thus to his right, left, front, and back—and few are they.' Then he said: 'O Abu Dharr.' I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of God, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you.' He said: 'It would not please me to have the like of Uhud (in gold) to spend in the cause of God, then die the day I die and leave from it two qirats.' I said: 'Or two qintars, O Messenger of God?' He said: 'Rather, two qirats.' Then he said: 'O Abu Dharr, you desire the most, and I desire the least.' So the Messenger of God desires this, and you say, O son of a Jewish woman, there is no harm in what 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf left behind? You have lied, and lied the one who said it!" And he did not reply to him out of fear until he left.

It has reached us that a caravan from Yemen arrived for 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, and the whole of Medina resounded with a single clamor. 'A'isha, may God be pleased with her, said, "What is this?" It was said, "A caravan has arrived for 'Abd al-Rahman." She said, "God and His Messenger have spoken the truth." This reached 'Abd al-Rahman, so he asked her about it. She said, "I heard the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, say: 'I saw Paradise, and I saw the poor among the Emigrants and the Muslims entering it swiftly, and I did not see any of the wealthy entering it with them except 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, who was entering it with them crawling.'" 'Abd al-Rahman then said, "The caravan and all that is upon it are in the path of God, and I will free its slaves; perhaps I may enter it with them swiftly."

It has reached us that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said to 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, "Indeed, you shall be the first of the wealthy among my community to enter Paradise, and you would scarcely have entered it except by crawling."

Woe unto you, O deluded one! What argument do you have with wealth, when here is ‘Abd al-Rahman—with his virtue, piety, known good deeds, and spending his wealth in the path of God, along with his companionship of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his glad tidings of Paradise—is also made to stand in the gathering places of the Resurrection and its terrors because of wealth he earned lawfully for self-restraint and for acts of goodness, spent from it with purpose, and gave in the path of God willingly, yet was prevented from hastening to Paradise with the poor emigrants and could only crawl after them, crawling? Then what do you suppose about those like them who are drowned in the trials of this world?

And after this: All wonder, all wonder is for you, O deluded one! You wallow in the confusions of doubts and forbidden gains, greedily seize the filth of people, tumble in lusts, adornment, and ostentation, and roll about in the trials of the world—then you argue with ‘Abd al-Rahman and claim that if you amass wealth, the Companions also amassed it, as if you resembled the predecessors and their actions? Woe unto you! This is from the analogy of Iblis and from his legal verdict for his allies! I will describe to you your states and the states of the predecessors so that you may recognize your disgrace and the merit of the Companions.

By my life, indeed some of the Companions had wealth which they intended for self-restraint and spending in the path of God. They earned it lawfully, ate pure things, spent with purpose, offered the surplus, did not withhold from it what was right, and were not miserly with it. But they were generous to God with most of it, and some of them were generous with all of it. In hardship, they preferred God over themselves greatly. So by God, are you like that? By God, you are but a slave of resemblance to those people.

And after this: Indeed, the best of the Companions loved poverty, were secure from the fear of want, trusted in God for their provisions, were pleased with the decrees of God, content in tribulation, thankful in ease, patient in distress, praising in prosperity, humble before God, and restrained from love of elevation and multiplication. They took from this world only what was permissible for them, and they drove the world away, endured its hardships, swallowed its bitterness, and renounced its pleasures and glitter. So by God, are you like that?

And it has reached us that when the world turned toward them, they would grieve and say, “A sin whose punishment God hastened.” And when they saw poverty approaching, they would say, “Welcome to the emblem of the righteous.” And it has reached us that one of them, when he awoke and his family had something, would wake up sorrowful and grieved; and when they had nothing, he would wake up joyful and happy. So it was said to him, “People grieve when they have nothing and rejoice when they have something, but you are not like that!” He said, “When I awake and my family has nothing, I rejoice because I have in the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) an example; and when my family has something, I become distressed because I have no example in the family of Muhammad.” And it has reached us that when the path of ease was taken with them, they would grieve and become apprehensive, saying, “What have we to do with the world, and what is intended by it?” as if they were on the wing of fear. And when the path of tribulation was taken with them, they would rejoice and be glad, saying, “Now our Lord attends to us.” These are the states of the predecessors and their description, and in them is more merit than we have described. So by God, are you like that? You are indeed far from resembling those people.

I shall describe your states, O deluded one, in contrast to theirs. For you become insolent in wealth, grow arrogant in ease, frolic in prosperity, and are heedless of thanking the Bestower of blessings. You despair in hardship, become discontent in tribulation, and are dissatisfied with divine decree. Indeed, you detest poverty and disdain lowliness—yet this is the pride of the Messengers, and you disdain their pride. You hoard and amass wealth out of fear of poverty, and that is from evil suspicion of God, Exalted is He, and lack of certainty in His guarantee—and sufficient is that as a sin. Perhaps you amass wealth for the pleasures of this world, its glitter, its lusts, and its delights. It has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The worst of my nation are those who are nurtured in luxury, so their bodies grow fat upon it." And it has reached us that some of the people of knowledge said: "On the Day of Resurrection, a people will come seeking good deeds for themselves, and it will be said to them: 'You exhausted your good things in your worldly life and took your enjoyment therein.'" And you, in heedlessness, have been deprived of the bliss of the Hereafter because of the bliss of this world—what a regret and calamity! Indeed, perhaps you amass wealth for rivalry, superiority, pride, and adornment in this world. It has reached us that whoever seeks this world for rivalry or boasting will meet God while He is angry with him. And you are unconcerned with what has befallen you of your Lord's anger when you desired rivalry and superiority. Indeed, perhaps remaining in this world is more beloved to you than moving to the proximity of God, so you dislike meeting God, and God is more averse to meeting you. And you are in heedlessness, and perhaps you grieve over what you have missed of this world's fleeting portion. It has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever grieves over a worldly matter that has escaped him draws nearer to the Fire by the distance of a month's journey—or it was said, a year's." And you grieve over what you have missed, unconcerned with your proximity to God's punishment. Indeed, perhaps you sometimes depart from your religion to secure your worldly life, and you rejoice at the world's turning to you and find comfort in that, delighting in it. It has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever loves this world and delights in it, the fear of the Hereafter departs from his heart." And it has reached us that some of the people of knowledge said that you will be called to account for grieving over what you have missed of this world, and you will be called to account for your joy in this world when you attain it—and you are joyful in your world while the fear of God, Exalted is He, has been stripped from you. Perhaps you concern yourself with the affairs of your world many times over what you concern yourself with the affairs of your Hereafter. Perhaps you consider your calamity in your sins lighter than your calamity in the diminishment of your world. Indeed, your fear of losing your wealth is greater than your fear of sins. Perhaps you expend all the filth you have gathered for people for the sake of superiority and high status in this world. Perhaps you please the creatures while angering God, Exalted is He, so that you may be honored and exalted. Woe to you! It is as if God's contempt for you on the Day of Resurrection is lighter upon you than the contempt of people for you. Perhaps you hide from your fellow creatures your faults and are unconcerned with God's awareness of them, as if disgrace before God is lighter upon you than disgrace before people—as if the slaves are of higher standing to you than God. Exalted is God above your ignorance! How then will you speak before those of understanding with these faults in you? Fie upon you! Soiled with impurities and sitting upon the wealth of the righteous? Far, far indeed are you from the righteous predecessors. By God, it has reached me that they, in what was lawful for them, were more abstinent than you are toward major sins. Would that your fasting were like their breaking of fast! Would that your striving in worship were like their laxity and sleep! Would that all your good deeds were like one of their misdeeds. For whoever is not thus is not with them in this world nor with them in the Hereafter. Glory be to God! How great is the disparity between the two groups: a group of the best Companions in exaltation with God, and a group like you in baseness—or may the Generous God pardon by His grace.

Now then: If you claim that you are emulating the Companions by amassing wealth for self-sufficiency and spending in the way of God, then reflect upon your own affair. Woe to you! Do you find from the lawful in your time what they found in their time? Or do you reckon that you are as cautious in seeking the lawful as they were cautious? It has reached me that some of the Companions said: "We would leave seventy doors of the lawful, fearing we might fall into one door of the unlawful." Do you aspire from yourself to such caution as this? No, by the Lord of the Ka'bah, I do not reckon you so! Woe to you! Be certain that amassing wealth for righteous works is a deception from Satan, to cause you—on account of righteousness—to fall into acquiring dubious matters mixed with usury and the unlawful. And it has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever ventures upon dubious matters is on the verge of falling into the unlawful." O deluded one, do you not know that your fear of plunging into dubious matters is higher, better, and greater for your standing with God than acquiring dubious matters and spending them in the way of God and the way of righteousness? It has reached us from some of the people of knowledge who said: "For you to leave a single dirham out of fear that it may not be lawful is better for you than to give a thousand dinars in charity from a dubious source, not knowing whether it is lawful for you or not." If you claim that you are more pious and scrupulous than to be entangled with dubious matters, and that you only amass wealth—by your claim—from the lawful to spend in the way of God, then woe to you! If you are as you claim, reaching the utmost in scrupulousness, then do not expose yourself to the Reckoner, for the best of the Companions feared the questioning. And it has reached us that some of the Companions said: "It would not please me to earn a thousand dinars every day from the lawful and spend them in obedience to God, and for the earning not to distract me from the Friday prayer." They said: "And why is that, may God have mercy on you?" He said: "Because I would be rich, and on the Day of Resurrection I would be made to stand and asked: 'My servant, from where did you earn, and on what did you spend?'" So these God-fearing ones, in the prime of Islam when the lawful was available to them, abandoned wealth and fled from the Reckoning, fearing that the good of the wealth would not outweigh its evil. And you, in the utmost security while the lawful in your time is lost, you scramble after filth and then claim that you amass wealth from the lawful. Woe to you! Where is the lawful that you might amass it?

Now then: if lawful provision were available to you, do you not fear that your heart might change in times of plenty? For we have heard that some Companions would inherit lawful wealth and yet abandon it, fearing it might corrupt their hearts. Do you then aspire that your heart be purer than the hearts of the Companions, so that nothing of creation would ever depart from you in your affairs and states? If you suppose so, you have indeed thought too well of your soul that ever commands evil. Woe to you! I am your sincere adviser; I see it best for you to content yourself with sufficiency, not to amass wealth for charitable works, nor to expose yourself to the Reckoning. For it has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: “Whoever is subjected to detailed reckoning will be punished.” And he, peace be upon him, said: “A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection who gathered wealth from unlawful means and spent it unlawfully, and it will be said: ‘Take him to the Fire.’ Another will be brought who gathered wealth lawfully but spent it unlawfully, and it will be said: ‘Take him to the Fire.’ Another will be brought who gathered wealth unlawfully but spent it lawfully, and it will be said: ‘Take him to the Fire.’ And another will be brought who gathered wealth lawfully and spent it lawfully, and he will be told: ‘Stop, for perhaps you fell short in seeking this wealth by neglecting some of what I obligated upon you—a prayer you did not pray at its time, or you were remiss in some part of its bowing, prostration, or ablution.’ He will say: ‘No, O Lord, I earned lawfully and spent lawfully, and I neglected nothing You obligated upon me.’ Then it will be said: ‘Perhaps you were dishonest in this wealth regarding some mount or garment with which you showed off.’ He will say: ‘No, O Lord, I was neither dishonest nor did I show off with anything.’ Then it will be said: ‘Perhaps you withheld the right of someone I commanded you to give—relatives, orphans, the needy, or the wayfarer.’ He will say: ‘No, O Lord, I earned lawfully and spent lawfully; I neglected nothing You obligated upon me, I was not dishonest, I did not show off, and I did not withhold the right of anyone You commanded me to give.’ Then those [rightful claimants] will come and dispute with him, saying: ‘O Lord, You gave him wealth and enriched him and placed him among us, and You commanded him to give to us.’ If he had given to them and neglected none of those obligations and was not dishonest in anything, it will be said: ‘Stop. Now bring forth gratitude for every blessing I bestowed upon you—every morsel, every drink, every pleasure.’ And he will be questioned without end.” Woe to you! Who then would expose himself to such questioning as befell this man who dealt only in the lawful and fulfilled all rights and performed the obligations within their limits, yet was subjected to this reckoning? How then do you suppose will be the state of those like him who are drowned in the trials of this world, its confusions, its allurements, its passions, and its adornments? Woe to you! It is for such questions that the God‑fearing dread to become entangled with the world, so they content themselves with bare sufficiency and engage in various good works through lawful earning. So woe to you—take these righteous ones as your example. But if you refuse this and claim that you have reached a degree of scrupulousness and piety, and that you gather wealth only from lawful means—as you allege—for self‑sufficiency and spending in the way of God, and that you spend nothing of the lawful except rightfully, and that your heart has not changed because of wealth away from what God loves, and that you have not displeased God in any of your secret or open affairs—woe to you, if it were so, but you are not so—then it behooves you to be content with sufficiency, to withdraw from the wealthy when they stand for questioning, and to march with the foremost company in the ranks of the Chosen One, with no detention for you concerning questioning and reckoning, leading either to safety or to ruin. For it has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: “The destitute emigrants will enter Paradise five hundred years before their rich counterparts.” And he, peace be upon him, said: “The poor believers will enter Paradise before their rich ones, and they will eat and enjoy, while the others remain kneeling on their knees, saying: ‘Before you we were the seekers, you were the rulers and kings of mankind—so show me what you did with what I gave you.’”

It has reached us that some people of knowledge said: "I would not be pleased to possess the choicest camels, if it meant I would not be in the foremost rank with Muhammad, peace be upon him, and his party." O people, then strive to be among the foremost in the race with those who hasten, in the company of the Messengers, peace be upon them, and be fearful of lagging behind and being cut off from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the company of the God-fearing. It has reached me that one of the Companions, Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, was thirsty and asked for a drink. He was brought a drink of water and honey. When he tasted it, a sob choked him, then he wept and made others weep. Then he wiped the tears from his face and was about to speak, but he returned to weeping. When his weeping became prolonged, he was asked: "Is all this because of this drink?" He said: "Yes. I was with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, one day, and there was no one in the house with him but me. He began to push something away from himself, saying, 'Away from me!' I said to him, 'May my father and mother be your ransom! I see no one before you; whom are you addressing?' He said, 'This world presented itself to me with its neck and head outstretched and said to me: "O Muhammad, take me." I said: "Away from me!" It said: "If you escape from me, O Muhammad, none after you will escape from me."' So I fear that this [drink] has caught up with me and will cut me off from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him." O people, these reports show they wept and feared that a drink of what is lawful might cut them off from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him! Woe to you! You are immersed in various kinds of comforts and pleasures from earnings of the unlawful and the dubious, yet you do not fear being cut off? Alas for you! How great is your ignorance! Woe to you! If you lag behind on the Day of Resurrection from the Messenger of God, Muhammad the Chosen, peace and blessings be upon him, you will surely behold terrors from which the angels and the prophets recoiled. If you fall short in the race, the catching up will be prolonged for you. If you seek abundance, you will come to a severe reckoning. If you are not content with little, you will come to a long standing, and wailing and lamentation. If you are satisfied with the states of those who lag behind, you will be cut off from the companions of the right hand and from the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds, and you will be delayed from the bliss of those who enjoy bliss. If you oppose the states of the God-fearing, you will be among those accounted for in the terrors of the Day of Recompense. So consider carefully what you have heard, and beware.

If you claim that you are like the best of the early generations—content with little, abstinent from the lawful, generous with what you have, preferring others over yourself, not fearing poverty nor saving anything for your morrow, despising accumulation and wealth, pleased with poverty and tribulation, joyful in scarcity and lowliness, delighted in humiliation and abasement, detesting elevation and high status, strong in your affair with a heart unwavering from right guidance, having taken your soul to account for God's sake, and having judged all your matters in accordance with what pleases God—then you will not be detained for questioning, and one like you from among the God-fearing will not be called to account. You only gather lawful wealth to spend in the way of God. Woe to you, O deluded one! Ponder the matter and look deeply! Do you not know that abandoning preoccupation with wealth and emptying the heart for remembrance, recollection, reminding, reflection, and taking heed is safer for your religion, easier for the reckoning, lighter for the questioning, more secure from the frights of the Resurrection, greater for reward, and raises your rank with God manifold? It has reached us from one of the Companions that he said: "If a man had gold dinars in his lap to give away, and another was remembering God, the one remembering would be superior." Some people of knowledge were asked about a man who gathers wealth for charitable works. They said: "Leaving it is more pious." It has reached us that one of the best of the Followers was asked about two men: one sought the world lawfully, attained it, used it to uphold family ties, and provided for himself; the other shunned it, neither seeking it nor taking it. Which of them is superior? He said: "By God, the distance between them is great. The one who shunned it is superior, as between the east and the west of the earth." Woe to you! This superiority is yours, for abandoning the world, over one who sought it. And for you in the immediate life, if you abandon preoccupation with wealth, it is more restful for your body, less toilsome, more pleasant for your living, more satisfying for your mind, and lessens your anxieties. So what is your excuse for gathering wealth when, by abandoning wealth, you are superior to one who seeks wealth for charitable works? Yes, and your occupation with the remembrance of God is superior to spending wealth in the way of God. Thus, for you is combined the comfort of the immediate life with safety and superiority in the life to come.

Now then, if amassing wealth held immense virtue, it would be incumbent upon you, in the pursuit of noble character, to emulate your Prophet—since God guided you through him—and to be content with what he chose for himself in shunning this world. Woe unto you! Reflect upon what you have heard and be certain that felicity and triumph lie in turning away from the world. Hasten, then, under the banner of the Chosen One, racing ahead to the Garden of Refuge. For it has reached us that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "The masters of the believers in Paradise are those who, if they eat a midday meal, find no evening meal; and if they seek a loan, find none to lend; who possess no surplus garment except what covers them, and are unable to earn what would enrich them—yet they pass their evening and morning content with their Lord. Those are with the ones upon whom God has bestowed favor: the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions!"

O my brother, if after this clear exposition you still amass this wealth, then you are false in your claim that you gather it for piety and virtue. No! Rather, you gather it out of fear of poverty, and for pleasures, adornment, rivalry, pride, arrogance, ostentation, reputation, honor, and prestige you gather it. Then you pretend that you amass wealth for righteous deeds? Be mindful of God and feel shame for your claim, O deluded one! Woe unto you! If you are infatuated with love of wealth and this world, then at least acknowledge that virtue and goodness lie in being content with sufficiency and avoiding excess. Yes, and hold yourself in contempt for amassing wealth, confessing your wrongdoing and fearing the Reckoning—that is safer for you and nearer to virtue than seeking excuses to hoard wealth.

My brothers, know that in the era of the Companions, lawful provision was available, yet they were the most scrupulous and abstinent of people even in what was permissible for them. As for us, in our era lawful means are scarce—how can we even attain the measure of sustenance and covering for our nakedness? As for amassing wealth in our time, may God protect us and you from it.

And after: Where can we find the likes of the Companions' piety and scrupulousness, or the likes of their asceticism and caution? And where can we find the likes of their pure hearts and good intentions? We have been afflicted, by the Lord of the heavens, with the diseases of the souls and their caprices, and the arrival is near; so, O the bliss of those who come with light burdens on the Day of Resurrection, and long sorrow for the people of rivalry and confusion. And I have advised you if you accept, and for those who accept, this is but little. May God grant us and you success, for all good is by His mercy, Amen. This is the end of his speech, and in it is sufficient demonstration of the virtue of poverty over wealth, with nothing more to add. All the narrations we have cited in the Book of the Condemnation of the World and in the Book of Poverty and Asceticism bear witness to this.

It is also supported by what was narrated from Abu Umamah al-Bahili: That Tha‘labah ibn Hatib said, “O Messenger of God, pray to God that He provide me with wealth.” He said, “O Tha‘labah, a little for which you can give thanks is better than much you cannot bear.” He said, “O Messenger of God, pray to God that He provide me with wealth.” He said, “O Tha‘labah, do you not have in me an example? Are you not content to be like the Prophet of God, exalted is He? By Him in whose hand is my soul, if I wished that the mountains would move with me as gold and silver, they would move.” He said, “By Him who sent you with the truth as a prophet, if you pray to God that He provide me with wealth, I will give every rightful person his right, and I will do such and such.” The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, “O God, provide Tha‘labah with wealth.” So he acquired sheep, and they multiplied like worms multiply, until Medina became too narrow for him, so he withdrew from it and settled in a valley among its valleys. He would pray the noon and afternoon prayers in congregation and leave the others. Then they multiplied and increased, so he withdrew until he left the congregation except for Friday prayer, and they multiplied like worms multiply until he left the Friday prayer. He began to meet travelers on Friday and ask them about the news in Medina. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, asked about him and said, “What has happened to Tha‘labah ibn Hatib?” It was said, “O Messenger of God, he acquired sheep and Medina became too narrow for him,” and they informed him of his whole affair. He said, “Woe to Tha‘labah, woe to Tha‘labah, woe to Tha‘labah.” It is said that God, exalted is He, revealed, “Take from their wealth a charity to purify them and sanctify them thereby, and pray for them; indeed, your prayer is a tranquility for them.” And God, exalted is He, revealed the obligations of charity. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, sent a man from Juhaynah and a man from Banu Sulaym to collect the charity, and he wrote for them a document regarding taking the charity and ordered them to go out and take from the Muslims. He said, “Pass by Tha‘labah ibn Hatib and so-and-so—a man from Banu Sulaym—and take their charities.” They went out until they came to Tha‘labah and asked him for the charity, and they read to him the document of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him. He said, “This is nothing but a tax! This is nothing but a tax! This is nothing but the sister of a tax! Go on until you finish, then return to me.” They went toward the Sulaymi man, and he heard about them, so he went to the best of his camels and selected them for charity, then met them with them. When they saw them, they said, “This is not obligatory upon you, and we do not wish to take this from you.” He said, “Yes, take them.” When they finished with his charity, they returned until they passed by Tha‘labah and asked him for the charity. He said, “Show me your document.” He looked at it and said, “This is the sister of a tax! Go on until I consider my opinion.” They went until they came to the Prophet, peace be upon him. When he saw them, he said, “Woe to Tha‘labah,” before they spoke to him, and he prayed for the Sulaymi man. They informed him of what Tha‘labah had done and what the Sulaymi man had done. Then God, exalted is He, revealed regarding Tha‘labah, “And among them are those who made a covenant with God: ‘If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely give charity and be among the righteous.’ But when He gave them from His bounty, they withheld it and turned away while they were averse. So He caused hypocrisy to follow into their hearts until the Day they will meet Him, because they failed God in what they promised Him and because they used to lie.” There was with the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, a man from the relatives of Tha‘labah, and he heard what God had revealed about him. He went out until he came to Tha‘labah and said, “May your mother be bereft of you, O Tha‘labah! God has revealed such and such about you.” So Tha‘labah went out until he came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and asked him to accept his charity from him. He said, “Indeed, God has prevented me from accepting your charity from you.” So he began to scatter dust upon his head. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, “This is your doing; I commanded you, but you did not obey me.” When he refused to accept anything from him, he returned to his home. When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, passed away, he brought it to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, but he refused to accept anything from him. He returned to his home. When he passed away, he brought it to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, but he refused to accept it from him. He brought it to Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, but he refused to accept it from him. Tha‘labah died later during the caliphate of Uthman. This is the transgression and ill omen of wealth, and I have known it from this narration. And because of the blessing of poverty and the ill omen of wealth, the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, preferred poverty for himself and for his household. It is narrated from Imran ibn Husayn, may God be pleased with him, that he said, “I had a status and esteem with the Messenger of God. He said, ‘O Imran, you have with us status and esteem. Would you like to visit Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him?’ I said, ‘Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of God.’ He stood, and I stood with him until we stood at the door of Fatimah’s dwelling. He knocked on the door and said, ‘Peace be upon you. May I enter?’ She said, ‘Enter, O Messenger of God.’ He said, ‘And the one with me?’ She said, ‘And who is with you, O Messenger of God?’ He said, ‘Imran ibn Husayn.’ She said, ‘By Him who sent you with the truth as a prophet, I have nothing upon me but a cloak!’ He said, ‘Do with it thus and thus,’ and he gestured with his hand. She said, ‘This is my body, and I have covered it, so what about my head?’ He threw to her a worn garment that was upon him and said, ‘Tie it around your head.’ Then she gave him permission, and he entered. He said, ‘Peace be upon you, my daughter. How are you this morning?’ She said, ‘By God, I have become ill, and what increases my illness is that I am unable to eat any food, for hunger has exhausted me.’ The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, wept and said, ‘Do not grieve, my daughter. By God, I have not tasted food for three days, and I am more honored by God than you. If I asked my Lord, He would feed me, but I prefer the Hereafter over this world.’ Then he struck his hand upon her shoulder and said to her, ‘Receive glad tidings, for by God, you are the mistress of the women of Paradise.’ She said, ‘Then what about Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh, and Maryam, the daughter of Imran?’ He said, ‘Asiyah is the mistress of the women of her world, and Maryam is the mistress of the women of her world, and Khadijah is the mistress of the women of her world, and you are the mistress of the women of your world. You are in houses of reeds, wherein there is no harm nor clamor.’ Then he said to her, ‘Be content with your cousin, for by God, I have married you to a master in this world and a master in the Hereafter.’” Consider now the state of Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, who is a part of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, how she preferred poverty and abandoned wealth. Whoever observes the states of the prophets and the saints, their statements, and what has come of their reports and traditions will not doubt that the absence of wealth is better than its presence, even if spent on good deeds, for the least of what is in it—fulfilling rights, guarding against ambiguities, and spending on good deeds—is the preoccupation of concern with its rectification and diversion from the remembrance of God, for there is no remembrance except with leisure, and there is no leisure with the preoccupation of wealth.

It has been narrated from Jarir from Layth who said: A man accompanied Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, and said, "Let me be with you and your companions." So they set out until they came to the bank of a river and sat down to eat their midday meal. They had three loaves of bread. They ate two loaves, and a third loaf remained. Jesus, peace be upon him, went to the river to drink, then returned and did not find the loaf. He said to the man, "Who took the loaf?" The man said, "I do not know." They proceeded, he and his companion, and saw a doe with two fawns. He called one of them, and it came to him. He slaughtered it, roasted some of it, and he and that man ate. Then he said to the fawn, "Live, by the permission of God," and it stood up and went away. He said to the man, "I ask you by Him who showed you this sign, who took the loaf?" The man said, "I do not know." Then they came to a valley of water. Jesus took the man by the hand, and they walked upon the water. When they had crossed, he said to him, "I ask you by Him who showed you this sign, who took the loaf?" The man said, "I do not know." They came to a desert and sat down. Jesus, peace be upon him, began gathering dust and sand, then said, "Be gold, by the permission of God, the Exalted," and it became gold. He divided it into three portions and said, "One third is for me, one third for you, and one third for the one who took the loaf." The man said, "I am the one who took the loaf." Jesus said, "It is all for you," and parted from him, peace be upon him. Two men came upon him in the desert with the wealth, intending to take it from him and kill him. He said, "Let us divide it into three shares. Send one of you to the village to buy us some food to eat." They sent one of them. The one who was sent thought, "Why should I share this wealth with these two? Rather, I will put poison in this food, kill them, and take the wealth for myself alone." And he did so. The other two men said to each other, "Why should we give this man a third of the wealth? When he returns, we will kill him and divide the wealth between us." When he returned to them, they killed him, then ate the food and died. So that wealth remained in the desert with those three dead beside it. Jesus, peace be upon him, passed by them in that state and said to his companions, "This is the worldly life; so beware of it."

It is recounted that Dhul-Qarnayn came upon a nation among nations who possessed nothing of what people enjoy in their worldly life. They had dug graves, and when morning came, they would tend to those graves, sweep them, pray near them, and graze on herbs as beasts graze. Their livelihood in that was provided by the plants of the earth. Dhul-Qarnayn sent to their king, saying, "Answer Dhul-Qarnayn." He replied, "I have no need of him. If he has a need, let him come to me!" Dhul-Qarnayn said, "He speaks truthfully," and he went to him. Dhul-Qarnayn said, "I sent for you to come to me, but you refused. So here I have come." He said, "If I had a need of you, I would have come to you." Dhul-Qarnayn said to him, "Why do I see you in a state I have not seen any other nation upon?" He said, "And what is that?" He said, "You have no worldly life nor anything. Have you not taken gold and silver to enjoy them?" They said, "We only disliked them because no one is given anything of them except that his soul yearns for and calls him to what is better than them." He said, "What is the matter with you that you have taken up graves, and when morning comes you tend to them, sweep them, and pray near them?" They said, "We intended that when we look at them and hope for the world, our graves would prevent us from hope." He said, "And I see you have no food except herbs from the earth. Have you not taken beasts from cattle to milk them, ride them, and enjoy them?" They said, "We disliked making our bellies graves for them, and we saw sufficiency in the plants of the earth. The son of the lowest subsistence is satisfied with food, and whatever food passes beyond the throat, we find no taste for it, whatever the food may be."

Then the king of that land stretched his hand behind Dhul-Qarnayn and took a skull. He said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, do you know who this is?" He said, "No. Who is it?" He said, "A king from the kings of the earth to whom God gave authority over the people of the earth. He oppressed, wronged, and acted arrogantly. When God, glorified and exalted, saw that from him, He embodied him with death, and he became like a discarded stone. God has accounted his deeds until He recompenses him for them in his hereafter." Then he took another worn skull and said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, do you know who this is?" He said, "I do not know. Who is it?" He said, "This is a king whom God made king after him. He used to see what the one before him did to people of oppression, injustice, and tyranny, so he humbled himself, showed reverence to God, mighty and majestic, and commanded justice among the people of his kingdom. He became as you see. God has accounted his deeds until He recompenses him in his hereafter." Then he pointed to the skull of Dhul-Qarnayn and said, "And this skull was like these two. So look, O Dhul-Qarnayn, what will you do?" Dhul-Qarnayn said to him, "Will you accompany me in my morning, that I may take you as a brother, a minister, and a partner in what God has given me of this wealth?" He said, "It is not fitting for you and me to be in one place, nor for us to be together." Dhul-Qarnayn said, "Why?" He said, "Because all people are your enemy and my friend." He said, "Why?" He said, "They are hostile to you because of the kingship, wealth, and worldly life you possess. I find no one hostile to me because I reject that and because of my need and lack of possessions." Dhul-Qarnayn departed from him, amazed by him and taking admonition from him. These narratives point you to the afflictions of wealth, along with what we have presented before. And with God is success.

The Book Condemning Wealth and Stinginess is completed, by the praise of God Almighty and His assistance. Following it is the Book Condemning Status and Ostentation.

[1] The hadith "Love of wealth and status plants hypocrisy in the heart as water plants vegetation" – I have not found it with this wording, and it is mentioned after this with the wording 'status' in place of 'honor'.

[2] The hadith "No two ravenous wolves sent among a flock of sheep are more destructive to it than love of wealth and status for the religion of a Muslim man" – reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasa'i in al-Kubra from the hadith of Ka'b ibn Malik, and they both said 'hungry' in place of 'ravenous' and did not say 'in a pen', and they said 'honor' in place of 'status'. Al-Tirmidhi said: Hasan Sahih. And for al-Tabarani in al-Awsat from the hadith of Abu Sa'id: "No two ravenous wolves in a pen of sheep..." the hadith. And for al-Bazzar from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: 'ravenous and hungry'. The chain of al-Tabarani in both is weak.

[3] The hadith "The majority are ruined, except for those who say such and such among the servants of Allah" – reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza with the wording 'the multitude' and he did not say 'among the servants of Allah'. And Ahmad reported it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with the wording 'the multitude'. And it is agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Dharr with the wording "They are the greatest losers." So Abu Dharr said, "Who are they?" He said, "They are the majority in wealth, except for those who say such and such..." the hadith.

[4] The hadith "It was said, 'O Messenger of Allah, which of your community is worst?' He said, 'The wealthy.'" – Ghareeb, I have not found it with this wording. And for al-Tabarani in al-Awsat and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far: "The worst of my community are those who are born into luxury and nurtured by it, eating various kinds of food..." and in it is Asram ibn Hawshab – weak. And Hannad ibn al-Sari reported it in his book al-Zuhd from the narration of 'Urwah ibn Ruwaym – Mursal. And for al-Bazzar from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah with a weak chain: "Among the worst of my community are those who are nurtured by luxury and their bodies grow upon it."

[5] The hadith "There will come after you a people who eat the choicest things of the world and its varieties, and marry the most beautiful women and their varieties..." the hadith at length – reported by al-Tabarani in al-Kabir and al-Awsat from the hadith of Abu Umamah: "There will be men from my community who eat various foods, drink various drinks, wear various clothes, and are verbose in speech. Those are the worst of my community." Its chain is weak, and I have not found a basis for the remainder.

[6] The hadith "Leave the world for its people. Whoever takes from the world more than what suffices him has taken his destruction without realizing it" – reported by al-Bazzar from the hadith of Anas, and in it is Hani' ibn al-Mutawakkil – Ibn Hibban weakened him.

[7] The hadith "The servant says, 'My wealth, my wealth...'" – reported by Muslim from the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn al-Shakhir and Abu Hurayrah, and it has preceded.

[8] The hadith "A man said, 'O Messenger of Allah, why do I not love death?'" – I have not come across it.

[9] The hadith "The close companions of the son of Adam are three: one follows him until his soul is taken, the second until his grave..." the hadith – reported by Ahmad and al-Tabarani in al-Kabir and al-Awsat from the hadith of al-Nu'man ibn Bashir with a good chain, similar to it. And Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi, Abu al-Shaykh in Kitab al-Thawab, and al-Tabarani in al-Awsat reported it from the hadith of Anas with a good chain as well. And in al-Kabir from the hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub. And for the two Shaykhs from the hadith of Anas: "Three follow the deceased, then two return and one remains..." the hadith.

[10] The hadith "Salman wrote to Abu al-Darda', and in it: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, say: 'The possessor of the world who obeyed Allah in it will be brought, and his wealth will be before him...''" I said: It is not from the hadith of Salman; rather, it is from the hadith of Abu al-Darda' that he wrote to Salman. Thus reported it al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab, and he said 'wealth' in place of 'the world', and it is disconnected.

[11] The hadith "When a servant dies, the angels say, 'What has he sent forth?'" – reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, raising it to the Prophet, and it has preceded in the chapter on the Etiquette of Companionship.

[12] The hadith "Do not acquire an estate, lest you love the world" – reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with the wording "lest you desire it."

[13] The hadith "How good is righteous wealth for a righteous man" – reported by Ahmad and al-Tabarani in al-Kabir and al-Awsat from the hadith of 'Amr ibn al-'As with a sound chain, with the wording "How good" and they both said "for a person."

[14] The hadith "Poverty almost becomes disbelief" – reported by Abu Muslim al-Laythi in his Sunan and al-Bayhaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman from the hadith of Anas, and it has preceded in the Book of the Condemnation of Anger.

[15] The hadith "Who are the most honorable and the most prudent of people?" He said, "Those who remember death most." – reported by Ibn Majah from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar with the wording "Which of the believers is most prudent?" And Ibn Abi al-Dunya reported it in al-Mawt with the wording of the author, and its chain is good.

[16] The hadith "Whoever takes from the world more than what suffices him has indeed taken his destruction without realizing it" – preceded before it by nine hadiths, and it is the remainder of "Beware of the world."

[17] The hadith "O Allah, make the provision of the family of Muhammad just sufficient" – agreed upon from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah.

[18] The hadith "O Allah, give me life in poverty and cause me to die in poverty" – reported by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas, and Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated its chain, from the hadith of Abu Sa'id, and it has preceded.

[19] The hadith "Wretched is the slave of the dinar, wretched is the slave of the dirham..." – reported by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and he did not say "and is puffed up." Rather, he concluded the end with the wording "Wretched and overturned," and Ibn Majah and al-Hakim connected that.

[20] The hadith "That with which a man protects his honor is charity" – reported by Abu Ya'la from the hadith of Jabir, and it has preceded.

[21] The hadith "If the son of Adam had a valley of gold, he would desire a second one..." – agreed upon from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas and Anas.

[22] The hadith of Abu Waqid al-Laythi: "Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'We have sent down wealth for the establishment of prayer and the giving of Zakat...'" – reported by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu'ab with a sound chain.

[23] The hadith of Abu Musa: "A chapter similar to Bara'ah was revealed, then it was abrogated, and from it was preserved: 'Allah supports this religion with people who have no share... If the son of Adam had two valleys of wealth...'" – reported by Muslim with differences, without his saying "Allah supports this religion." And al-Tabarani reported it with this addition, and in it is 'Ali ibn Zayd, who is criticized.

[24] The hadith "Two insatiable ones are never satisfied..." – reported by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ibn Mas'ud with a
