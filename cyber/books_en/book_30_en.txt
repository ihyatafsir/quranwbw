The Book of Condemning Self-Deception

This is the tenth book of the quarter on the destructive matters from the work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, in whose hand lie the reins of all affairs, and by whose power are the keys to all good and evil; who brings forth His allies from darkness into light, and leads His enemies into the pitfalls of delusion. And blessings upon Muhammad, who brings forth creation from the gloom, and upon his family and companions, whom the life of this world did not deceive, nor were they deceived concerning God—blessings that continue through the passage of ages and the turning of hours and months.

Now then: the key to felicity is vigilance and insight, and the source of wretchedness is delusion and heedlessness. There is no greater blessing from God upon His servants than faith and knowledge, and no means to it save the expansion of the breast by the light of inner vision. There is no greater calamity than disbelief and disobedience, and no caller to them save the blindness of the heart by the darkness of ignorance. The wise and possessors of insight—their hearts are "as a niche wherein is a lamp; the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a shining star, kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost shine forth even if no fire touched it: light upon light." But the deluded—their hearts are "as darkness upon an unfathomable sea, covered by a wave, above which is a cloud—darkness upon darkness—so that when he puts forth his hand, he can scarcely see it. And he for whom God has not appointed light, for him there is no light." Thus, the wise are those whom God has willed to guide, and so He has expanded their breasts for Islam and guidance. The deluded are those whom God has willed to lead astray, and so He has made their breasts narrow and constricted, as though they were climbing to heaven. The deluded one is he whose inner vision has not opened, so that he might be responsible for his own guidance; he remains in blindness, taking caprice as his leader and Satan as his guide. "And whoso is blind in this world shall be blind in the Hereafter, and yet further astray from the way." Since it is known that delusion is the mother of wretchedness and the source of ruin, it is necessary to explain its avenues and channels, and to detail the matters in which delusion most often occurs, so that the seeker, after knowing it, may beware and avoid it. Successful among the servants is he who knows the avenues of affliction and corruption, takes caution from them, and builds his affair upon prudence and insight.

We shall elucidate the categories through which delusion flows and the varieties of those deceived among judges, scholars, and the devout—those who have been beguiled by the beginnings of matters, beautiful in outward appearance yet ugly in their hidden realities. We shall point to the manner of their deception by these matters and their heedlessness toward them. For although this is more than can be enumerated, it is possible to alert through examples that suffice for exhaustive treatment. The groups of the deceived are many, yet they are united under four categories: the first category among the scholars, the second among the worshippers, the third among the Sufis, and the fourth among the possessors of wealth. Within each category are numerous sects, and the aspects of their delusion differ. Among them are those who see the reprehensible as commendable, such as one who builds a mosque and adorns it with unlawful wealth. Among them are those who do not distinguish between what they strive for themselves and what they strive for God Almighty, like the preacher whose aim is acceptance and status. Among them are those who neglect the essential and occupy themselves with what is secondary, and those who abandon the obligatory and busy themselves with the supererogatory. Among them are those who forsake the core and engage with the shell, like one whose concern in prayer is confined to perfecting the articulation of letters, among other entrances that do not become clear except by detailing the groups and providing examples. Let us begin first by mentioning the delusion of the scholars, but after clarifying the censure of delusion and explaining its reality and definition.

An Exposition on the Condemnation of Self-Deception, Its True Nature, and Its Examples

Know that the saying of the Almighty, "So let not the worldly life deceive you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you concerning Allah," and His saying, "But you were tempted by yourselves, you hesitated, and you doubted, and you were deluded by false hopes"—these verses suffice in censuring delusion. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "How excellent is the sleep of the intelligent and their breaking of fast! How they surpass the vigil of the foolish and their striving! For a speck's weight of one possessing piety and certainty is better than the earth filled with the deluded." And he said, peace be upon him, "The intelligent is he who holds himself to account and works for what is after death, and the fool is he who follows his soul's caprice and places hopes in Allah." All that has been reported concerning the virtue of knowledge and the censure of ignorance is evidence for the censure of delusion, because delusion is an expression for some types of ignorance. For ignorance is to believe something and perceive it contrary to what it truly is, and delusion is ignorance—except that there is an ignorance that is not delusion, but rather delusion necessitates: something deluded about, which is specific, and something that deludes, which is that which deceives him. Whenever the mistaken belief is something that conforms to caprice, and the cause that brings about the ignorance is a false semblance and illusion that is thought to be evidence but is not evidence, then the ignorance that occurs by it is called delusion. Thus, delusion is the soul's contentment with what conforms to caprice and what the natural disposition inclines to, due to a semblance and deception from Satan. So whoever believes that he is in good, whether in the immediate or the ultimate, based on a false semblance, then he is deluded. Most people think good of themselves while they are mistaken in it; therefore, most people are deluded, though the kinds of their delusion differ and their degrees vary, such that the delusion of some is more apparent and severe than others. The most apparent and severe of them are the delusion of the disbelievers and the delusion of the disobedient and the immoral. So we will present for these two examples of the reality of delusion.

The first example is the delusion of the disbelievers. Among them are those deceived by the worldly life, and among them are those deceived by delusion concerning God. As for those deceived by the worldly life: they are those who said, "Ready cash is better than credit, and this world is ready cash while the Hereafter is credit; therefore, it is better and must be preferred." And they said, "Certainty is better than doubt, and the pleasures of this world are certain while the pleasures of the Hereafter are doubtful; therefore, one does not abandon certainty for doubt." These are corrupt analogies, resembling the analogy of Iblis when he said, "I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay." To these, the allusion is in His Exalted Word: "Those are the ones who have purchased the worldly life [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided." The cure for this delusion is either through affirmation by faith or through rational proof.

As for affirmation by faith alone, it is to believe God the Exalted in His saying, "Whatever you have will end, but what God has is lasting," and in His Mighty and Majestic saying, "But what is with God is better," and His saying, "And the Hereafter is better and more enduring," and His saying, "And the worldly life is not but the enjoyment of delusion," and His saying, "So let not the worldly life delude you." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, informed groups of disbelievers of this, and they followed him, believed him, and had faith in him without demanding proof. Among them were those who said, "I adjure you by God, has God sent you as a messenger?" He would say, "Yes," and they would believe. This is the faith of the common people, and it delivers from delusion. This is akin to a child believing his father that attending school is better than attending the playground, even though he does not know the reason it is better.

As for knowledge through explanation and rational proof, it is to recognize the flaw in this analogy which Satan has composed in his heart. For every deluded person has a cause for his delusion, and that cause is evidence; and every evidence is a type of analogy that occurs in the soul and begets complacency towards it, even if its possessor is not conscious of it nor able to formulate it in the terms of the scholars. The analogy Satan composed has two premises: one, that this world is ready cash and the Hereafter is credit—this is true; the other, his statement that ready cash is better than credit—this is the point of deception, for the matter is not so. Rather, if the ready cash is equal to the credit in amount and objective, then it is better; but if it is less than it, then the credit is better. For the deluded disbeliever spends a dirham in his trade to receive ten on credit and does not say, "Ready cash is better than credit, so I will not forgo it." And if a doctor warns him against fruits and delights of food, he abandons them immediately for fear of the pain of illness in the future; thus, he has abandoned ready cash and accepted credit. All merchants sail the seas and toil in travels, paying a ready price for the sake of comfort and profit on credit. If ten in the future is better than one in the present, then compare the pleasure of this world in terms of its duration to the duration of the Hereafter, for the utmost human lifespan is one hundred years, and it is not a tenth of a tenth of one part out of a million parts of the Hereafter. It is as if he forsook one to gain a million, nay, to gain what has no end or limit. And if one considers from the perspective of kind, he sees the pleasures of this world as turbid, mixed with various spoilers, while the pleasures of the Hereafter are pure and untroubled. Therefore, he was mistaken in saying, "Ready cash is better than credit." This is a delusion originating from accepting a general, popular expression that was uttered and intended for a specific meaning, but the deluded person overlooked the specificity of its meaning. For whoever said, "Ready cash is better than credit," meant it is better than credit that is equal to it, even if he did not explicitly state so.

At this point, Satan resorts to another analogy, which is: certainty is better than doubt; therefore, the Hereafter is doubtful. This analogy is even more corrupt than the first, for both its premises are false. Indeed, certainty is better than doubt only when they are comparable; otherwise, consider the merchant: he is certain of his toil but doubtful of his profit; the seeker of religious knowledge is certain of his striving but doubtful of attaining the rank of knowledge; the hunter is certain of his pursuit but doubtful of capturing the prey. Likewise, prudence is the consistent practice of the wise by consensus, and all these involve abandoning certainty for doubt. Yet the merchant says: "If I do not trade, I will remain hungry and suffer great harm; if I do trade, my toil is little and my profit is great." Similarly, the patient drinks the vile, repulsive medicine—doubtful of being cured but certain of its bitterness—yet he says: "The harm of the medicine's bitterness is minor compared to what I fear from illness and death." So too, for one who doubts the Hereafter, it is obligatory by the rule of prudence to say: "The days of patience are few, being the span of a lifetime, compared to what is said of the Hereafter's affair. If what is said is false, I lose nothing but indulgence during my days of life, and I have been in nonexistence from eternity until now without indulgence, so I reckon I have remained in nonexistence. But if what is said is true, I remain in the Fire forever and ever, and this is unbearable." For this reason, ʿAlī—may God honor his countenance—said to a certain atheist: "If what you say is true, then you have purified yourself and we have been saved; but if what we say is true, then we have been saved and you are ruined." He did not say this out of doubt concerning the Hereafter, but rather addressed the atheist according to his intellect and made clear to him that even if he is not certain, he is deluded.

As for the second foundation of his statement: that the Hereafter is doubtful, this too is an error; rather, it is certainty for the believers, and there are two means of attaining its certainty.

The first is faith and affirmation through emulation of the prophets and scholars, which also removes delusion. This is the certain conviction attained by the common people and most of the elect. Their example is like that of a sick person who does not know the remedy for his ailment, yet all physicians and experts in the craft, from the first to the last, agree that his cure is a specific herb. The patient's soul finds tranquility in affirming their judgment and does not demand from them the verification of medical proofs. Rather, he trusts their statement and knows by it. Even if a foolish or deranged person were to contradict them in this, while knowing through recurrent reports and circumstantial evidence that they are greater than him in number, more abundant in virtue, and more knowledgeable in medicine—indeed, he has no knowledge of medicine at all—he would know his own statement to be false by their word and would not believe their statement to be false by his own, nor would he be deluded regarding their knowledge because of himself. If he were to rely on his own statement and abandon the statement of the physicians, he would be deranged and deluded.

Similarly, whoever considers those who affirm the Hereafter, inform about it, and declare that piety is the beneficial remedy for attaining its felicity, finds them to be the best of God's creation and the highest in rank in insight, knowledge, and intellect. They are the prophets, the saints, the sages, and the scholars. The creation has followed them according to their various kinds, except for isolated individuals among the vain ones, whom passion has overcome and whose souls have inclined toward indulgence. Abandoning passions became grievous for them, and confessing that they are among the people of the Fire became grievous for them, so they denied the Hereafter and called the prophets liars.

Just as the statement of a child or a foolish person does not remove the heart's tranquility regarding what the physicians have unanimously agreed upon, so too the statement of this wealthy person enslaved by passions does not cast doubt on the soundness of the statements of the prophets, the saints, and the scholars. This measure of faith is sufficient for the generality of creation. It is a decisive certainty that inevitably necessitates action, and delusion is removed by it.

As for the second means of apprehending knowledge of the Hereafter, it is revelation for the prophets and inspiration for the saints. Do not suppose that the knowledge of the Prophet, peace be upon him, concerning the affairs of the Hereafter and matters of religion is merely an imitation of Gabriel, peace be upon him, by hearing from him, just as your knowledge is an imitation of the Prophet, peace be upon him, such that your knowledge would be like his knowledge. Only the one being imitated differs—and how far-fetched that is! For imitation is not knowledge; rather, it is sound belief. The prophets are knowers, and the meaning of their knowledge is that the reality of things is unveiled to them as they truly are, so they witness it with the inner insight, just as you witness sensible objects with the outward sight. Thus, they report from witnessing, not from hearing and imitation. This occurs by unveiling to them the reality of the spirit—that it is from the command of God, exalted be He. The intended meaning of its being from God's command is not the command that is contrasted with prohibition, for that command is speech, and the spirit is not speech. Nor is the intended meaning by "command" the affair, such that the meaning would be merely that it is from the creation of God, for that is general to all created beings.

Indeed, the world is two worlds: the world of Command and the world of Creation, and to God belong Creation and Command. Thus, bodies possessing quantity and dimensions belong to the world of Creation—if "creation" is understood as determination in linguistic usage—while every existent free from quantity and measure is from the world of Command. The explanation of this is the mystery of the spirit, and there is no license to mention it, for most of creation are harmed by hearing it, like the breaking of the vessel that was forbidden to be disclosed. So whoever knows the mystery of the spirit knows himself, and when he knows himself, he knows his Lord. And when he knows himself and his Lord, he knows that he is a divine command by his nature and innate disposition, and that in the corporeal world he is a stranger, and that his descent into it was not in accordance with his inherent nature but due to an extraneous, alien command affecting his essence. That extraneous alien element came upon Adam, peace be upon him, and was expressed as disobedience, which lowered him from the Paradise that is more fitting for him according to his essence, for it is in proximity to the Lord, Exalted is He, and he is a divine command, and his yearning for the response of the Lord, Exalted is He, is natural and intrinsic, unless extraneous elements of the alien world divert him from the demand of his nature, causing him to forget himself and his Lord. Whenever he does that, he has wronged himself, as it is said to him: "And be not like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves; those are the defiantly disobedient"—that is, those who depart from the demand of their nature and the place of their deserving. It is said: "The fresh date burst from its sheath," when it emerges from its natural origin. This is an allusion to mysteries at whose fragrances the knowers tremble with longing, while the deficient recoil from hearing their expressions, for they are harmed by them as the scent of roses harms beetles, and their weak eyes are dazzled as the sun dazzles the sight of bats. The opening of this door from the secret of the heart to the world of the dominion is called knowledge and sanctity, and its possessor is called a saint and a knower, and these are the beginnings of the stations of the prophets. The last of the stations of the saints is the first of the stations of the prophets.

Let us return to the intended purpose. The aim is that the deception of Satan—that the Hereafter is doubtful—is repelled either by traditional certainty or by insight and witnessing from the inward aspect. As for the believers with their tongues and beliefs, if they neglect the commands of God, Exalted is He, abandon righteous deeds, and indulge in desires and disobedience, they share with the disbelievers in this deception regarding the Fire, even if after a time. Yet they too are among the deceived, for they acknowledged that the Hereafter is better than this world but inclined to the world and preferred it. Mere faith is insufficient for salvation. God, Exalted is He, said: "And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance." And He said: "Indeed, the mercy of God is near to the doers of good." Then the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Excellence is to worship God as if you see Him." And God, Exalted is He, said: "By time, indeed mankind is in loss, except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience." Thus, the promise of forgiveness in all the Book of God, Exalted is He, is tied to faith and righteous deeds together, not to faith alone. So these too are deceived—I mean those content with this world, rejoicing in it, luxuriating in its comforts, loving it, hating death for fear of losing worldly pleasures, not for fear of what comes after. This is the example of deception by the world among both disbelievers and believers alike.

Let us cite two examples of delusion regarding God from the delusion of the disbelievers and the sinners. As for the delusion of the disbelievers concerning God, its example is the statement some of them make within themselves and with their tongues: "If God has a Hereafter, then we are more deserving of it than others, and we have a greater share in it and a happier state," as God the Exalted has informed about them from the saying of the two neighboring men when one said, "And I do not think the Hour will occur. But if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return." The summary of their affair, as related in the interpretation, is that the disbeliever among them built a palace for a thousand dinars, bought an orchard for a thousand dinars, servants for a thousand dinars, and married a woman for a thousand dinars. In all of this, the believer admonishes him, saying: "You bought a palace that perishes and falls into ruin—why did you not buy a palace in Paradise that does not perish? You bought an orchard that falls into ruin and perishes—why did you not buy an orchard in Paradise that does not perish, and servants who do not perish or die, and a wife from the wide-eyed maidens who does not die?" To all of this, the disbeliever replies, saying: "There is nothing there, and what is said of that is falsehoods! And if it exists, then surely I will have something better than this in Paradise." Similarly, God the Exalted described the saying of the sinner, Ibn Wā’il, when he says, "I will surely be given wealth and children." So God the Exalted said in response to him, "Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise? No!" It is narrated from Khabbāb ibn al-Arat that he said: "I had a debt due from al-‘Āṣ ibn Wā’il, so I came to demand it, but he did not settle it for me. I said: 'I will take it in the Hereafter.' He said to me: 'When you reach the Hereafter, I will have wealth and children there, and I will pay you from it.'" Then God the Exalted revealed His saying, "Then have you considered he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, 'I will surely be given wealth and children'?" And God the Exalted said, "And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after adversity has touched him, he will surely say, 'This is mine, and I do not think the Hour will occur. But if I am returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best.'" All of this is from delusion regarding God.

Its cause is an analogy from the analogies of Satan—we seek refuge in God from him—which is that they look sometimes at God's favors upon them in this world and analogize from them the favor of the Hereafter, and they look sometimes at the postponement of punishment from them and analogize from it the punishment of the Hereafter, as the Exalted said, "And they say within themselves, 'Why does God not punish us for what we say?'" So the Exalted said in answer to their saying, "Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the destination." And sometimes they look at the believers—who are poor, disheveled, and dusty—and scorn them and belittle them, saying, "Are these the ones whom God has favored among us?" and saying, "If it were good, they would not have preceded us to it." The structure of the analogy that He has arranged in their hearts is that they say: "God has been good to us with the pleasures of this world, and every one who is good is loving, and every loving one will also be good in the future," as the poet said:

|God has been good    | |Thus He will be good in what|
|in what has passed    | |remains.                 |

One only extrapolates the future from the past through the means of honor and love, saying: "Were I not honorable before God and beloved, He would not have shown me goodness." The deception lies in his assumption that every benefactor is a lover; nay, it lies in his assumption that His bestowal upon him in this world is a true benefaction. Thus he is deluded concerning God, thinking he is honored in His sight by an evidence that does not indicate honor—rather, in the sight of the insightful, it indicates degradation. Its example is that of a man who has two young slaves: he detests one and loves the other. The one he loves, he restrains from play, obliges him to the study room, and confines him there to teach him discipline; he withholds from him fruits and delights of food that would harm him, and administers to him medicines that benefit him. The one he detests, he neglects, leaving him to live as he wishes—so he plays, does not enter the study room, and eats whatever he desires. This neglected slave then imagines that he is beloved and honored in his master's sight because he has been enabled in his appetites and pleasures and assisted in all his aims, with nothing withheld or restricted from him. Yet that is pure delusion. Similarly, the bliss and pleasures of this world are ruinous and distancing from God, "for God protects His servant from the world when He loves him," just as one of you protects his sick one from food and drink while loving him. Thus has the report come from the Master of Mankind.

The possessors of spiritual insight, when worldly provisions came to them, would grieve and say: "A sin whose punishment has been hastened." They saw this as a sign of divine displeasure and neglect. And when poverty came upon them, they would say: "Welcome, O emblem of the righteous!"

The deluded one, when worldly provisions come to him, imagines it to be an honor from God; and when they are withheld from him, he imagines it to be a humiliation—just as God the Exalted informed about him when He said: "As for man, when his Lord tests him by honoring him and bestowing favors upon him, he says, 'My Lord has honored me.' But when He tests him and restricts his provision, he says, 'My Lord has humiliated me.'" God responded to that by saying: "No!"—meaning, it is not as he said; rather, it is a trial. We seek refuge in God from the evil of trials and we ask God for steadfastness. Thus, He made clear that this is delusion.

Al-Hasan said: He refuted them both with His saying "No!"—meaning, this is not My honoring, nor is this My humiliation. Rather, the honored one is whom I have honored through his obedience to Me, whether he be rich or poor; and the humiliated one is whom I have humiliated through his disobedience to Me, whether he be rich or poor.

The remedy for this delusion lies in recognizing the signs of honor and disgrace, whether through inner insight or through emulation. As for inner insight, it is to know how turning toward worldly desires distances one from God, and how turning away from them draws one near to God. This is grasped through divine inspiration in the stations of the knowers and the saints, and its explanation belongs to the sciences of unveiling, not being suited to the science of spiritual conduct. As for knowing it through the path of emulation and affirmation, it is to believe in the Book of God and affirm His Messenger. God Almighty has said, "Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and children, We are hastening to them with good things? Rather, they are unaware." And He said, "We will lead them on step by step from where they do not know." And He said, "We opened to them the gates of all things until, when they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were in despair." In the interpretation of His saying, "We will lead them on step by step from where they do not know," it is said that whenever they committed a sin, We bestowed a new blessing upon them, so that their delusion would increase. And He said, "We only grant them respite that they may increase in sin." And He said, "And never think that God is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them until a Day when eyes will stare in horror," and other such verses that have come in the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger. Whoever believes in this is freed from this delusion, for the root of this delusion is ignorance of God and His attributes. For whoever knows Him does not feel secure from His plan, nor is he deceived by such false imaginings. Let him look to Pharaoh, Haman, Korah, and the kings of the earth, and what befell them—how God bestowed favors upon them at first, then utterly destroyed them! So God Almighty said, "Do you perceive any one of them?" And God has warned against His plan and His gradual leading astray, saying, "So none feels secure from the plan of God except the people who are losers." And He said, "And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they were not aware." And He, the Mighty and Majestic, said, "And they planned, and God planned. And God is the best of planners." And He said, "Indeed, they are planning a plan, and I am planning a plan. So allow time for the disbelievers. Leave them awhile." Just as it is not permissible for a negligent servant to infer from his master's neglect of him and enabling him with comforts that the master loves him—rather, he should beware that this might be a plot and a scheme from him, even though the master did not warn him of his own scheme—then how much more incumbent is this regarding God Almighty, along with His warning of His gradual leading astray! Therefore, whoever feels secure from the plan of God is deluded. The root of this delusion is that he infers from worldly blessings that he is honored by that Bestower, while it is possible that this is a sign of disgrace. But that possibility does not accord with desire, so Satan, through the medium of desire, inclines the heart toward what agrees with it, which is affirming that it indicates honor. And this is the definition of delusion.

The second example is the delusion of sinful believers who say: "Indeed, Allah is Most Generous, and we hope for His pardon." They rely upon this and neglect good deeds, beautifying their wishful thinking and self-deception by calling it "hope." They imagine that hope is a praiseworthy station in religion, that Allah's bounty is vast, His mercy all-encompassing, and His generosity immense—so where do the sins of servants stand against the oceans of His mercy? And since we affirm His Oneness and believe, we hope in Him through the means of faith. Sometimes the basis of their hope is clinging to the righteousness of their forefathers and their high rank, like the delusion of the descendants of 'Ali—upon him be peace—regarding their lineage, while opposing the conduct of their forefathers in fear, piety, and scrupulousness. They suppose they are more honored by Allah than their forefathers, since their forefathers, despite the utmost scrupulousness and piety, were fearful, while they, despite extreme immorality and transgression, feel secure. That is the ultimate delusion concerning Allah, the Exalted. The devil's analogy for the descendants of 'Ali is: "Whoever loves a person loves his children, and Allah loved your forefathers, so He loves you; thus you have no need for obedience." But the deluded one forgets that Noah—peace be upon him—wished to take his son with him on the ship, yet it was not granted, and he was among the drowned. "He said: 'My Lord, indeed my son is of my family.'" But the Exalted said: "O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is of unrighteous conduct." And Abraham—peace be upon him—sought forgiveness for his father, but it did not benefit him. And a Prophet—peace and blessings be upon him and upon every chosen servant—sought permission from his Lord to visit his mother's grave and seek forgiveness for her. He was permitted to visit but not permitted to seek forgiveness, so he sat weeping at her grave out of tenderness for her due to kinship, until he made those around him weep. This, too, is delusion concerning Allah, the Exalted. This is because Allah, the Exalted, loves the obedient and detests the disobedient. Just as He does not detest an obedient father due to detesting his disobedient child, likewise He does not love a disobedient child due to loving his obedient father. If love were to flow from father to child, then hatred would almost flow as well. Rather, the truth is that no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Whoever thinks he will be saved by the piety of his father is like one who thinks he will be satiated by his father's eating, quenched by his father's drinking, become a scholar by his father's learning, or reach the Ka'bah and see it by his father's walking. Piety is an individual obligation; no parent can fulfill any of it on behalf of their child, nor vice versa. With Allah is the reward for piety: "On the Day a man will flee from his brother, his mother, and his father"—except by way of intercession for one upon whom Allah's wrath is not severe, so He permits intercession for him, as preceded in the Book of Arrogance and Vanity.

If you ask: Where then is the error in the words of the disobedient and the wicked who say, "God is Generous, and we hope for His mercy and forgiveness," when He has said, "I am as My servant thinks of Me, so let him think good of Me"? Is this not sound speech, outwardly acceptable to hearts? Know that Satan misleads man only with speech that is outwardly acceptable but inwardly rejected. Were it not for its fair appearance, hearts would not be deceived by it. But the Prophet ﷺ unveiled this by saying, "The intelligent one is he who holds himself to account and works for what comes after death, and the foolish one is he who follows his own desires and indulges in wishful thinking about God." This is wishful thinking about God Almighty, but Satan named it "hope," thus deceiving the ignorant with it. God has clarified hope, saying, "Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and striven in the cause of God—it is those who hope for the mercy of God." This means that hope is more fitting for them, and that is because He mentioned that the reward of the Hereafter is a recompense and wage for deeds. God Almighty said, "A reward for what they used to do," and He said, "And you will be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection." Do you see that if someone is hired to repair vessels, and the employer, being generous, stipulates a wage for it, fulfilling his promise whenever he promises, never failing but even increasing—then the hired worker comes, breaks the vessels, and ruins them all, then sits waiting for the wage, claiming that the employer is generous—would the wise consider him in his waiting as one indulging in wishful thinking, deluded, or as one truly hoping? This stems from ignorance of the distinction between hope and delusion. It was said to al-Hasan: "A people say, 'We hope in God,' yet they neglect good deeds." He replied: "Far from it, far from it! That is their wishful thinking; they are swayed by it. Whoever hopes for something seeks it, and whoever fears something flees from it." And Muslim ibn Yasar said: "Last night I prostrated so much that my front teeth fell out!" A man said to him: "But we hope in God!" Muslim said: "Far from it, far from it! Whoever hopes for something seeks it, and whoever fears something flees from it." Just as one who hopes for a child in this world, yet has not married, or married but not consummated, or consummated but not emitted—he is foolish; likewise, one who hopes for God's mercy while he has not believed, or believed but not done righteous deeds, or done them but not abandoned sins—he is deluded. And just as when one marries, has intercourse, and emits, he remains in a state of suspense regarding the child, fearing and hoping for God's favor in creating the child and warding off harms from the womb and the mother until it is complete—he is intelligent; likewise, when one believes, does righteous deeds, and abandons evil deeds, and remains suspended between fear and hope—fearing that his deeds may not be accepted, that he may not persist, and that his end may be sealed with evil, and hoping that God Almighty will establish him with the firm word, guard his religion from the thunderbolts of death's agonies until he dies upon monotheism, and protect his heart from inclining toward desires for the rest of his life so that he does not incline toward sins—he is intelligent. All others are those deluded about God. "And they will know, when they see the punishment, who is more astray in way. And you will come to know the news of it after a time." And at that time they will say, as God informed about them: "Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us; we will work righteousness—indeed, we are certain." That is, we have learned that just as a child is not born except through intercourse and marriage, and crops do not grow except through plowing and sowing seeds, likewise, reward and recompense in the Hereafter are not attained except through righteous deeds. So return us, that we may work righteousness, for now we have learned the truth of Your saying: "And that there is not for man except what he has striven for, and that his effort is going to be seen—Whenever a company is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, 'Did there not come to you a warner?' They will say, 'Yes, a warner had come to us.'" That is, did we not hear you regarding God's way with His servants, that "every soul will be fully compensated for what it earned," and that "every soul, for what it has earned, is held in pledge"? So what deluded you about God after you heard and understood? "They will say, 'If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.' So they will confess their sin, and away with the companions of the Blaze!"

If you ask: "Where then is the proper place and praiseworthy occasion for hope?" Know that it is praiseworthy in two situations:

One aspect concerns the sinful person who is immersed in transgression, when the thought of repentance occurs to him, and Satan says to him: "How could your repentance be accepted?" thus causing him to despair of the mercy of God, the Exalted. At this point, it is necessary to suppress despair with hope and to remember that "Indeed, God forgives all sins," that God is Most Generous and accepts repentance from His servants, and that repentance is an act of obedience that expiates sins. God, the Exalted, says: "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.' And turn to your Lord." He commanded them to turn back. And He, the Exalted, says: "And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance." So if one anticipates forgiveness along with repentance, he is hopeful; but if one anticipates forgiveness while persisting in sin, he is deluded. Just as when the time for Friday prayer becomes pressing for someone in the marketplace, and it occurs to him to hasten to the prayer, Satan says to him: "You will not catch the prayer," so he should stay in his place. But he rejects Satan's words and proceeds to run, hoping to catch the prayer—he is hopeful. However, if he continues with his trade and begins to hope that the Imam will delay the prayer for his sake until the middle of its time, or for the sake of another, or for some unknown reason, then he is deluded.

The second is that one's soul becomes lax regarding virtuous deeds and confines itself to obligatory acts, yet still hopes for the bliss of God Almighty and what He has promised the righteous, until from this hope arises a zeal for worship, so one turns toward virtuous deeds and remembers His saying, exalted is He: "Indeed, the believers have succeeded—those who are humble in their prayer..." up to His words: "Those are the inheritors who will inherit Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally." Thus, the first hope suppresses despair, which prevents repentance. The second hope suppresses laxity, which prevents zeal and exertion. Therefore, any expectation that urges toward repentance or toward exertion in worship is hope, and any hope that causes laxity in worship and leaning toward idleness is delusion—as when it occurs to one to abandon sin and engage in good works, but Satan whispers to him: "Why trouble and torment yourself? You have a Lord who is Generous, Forgiving, Merciful." So one becomes lax in repentance and worship—that is delusion. At this point, it is incumbent upon the servant to employ fear, frightening himself with the wrath of God and His severe punishment, saying: "Although He forgives sin and accepts repentance, His punishment is severe; although He is Generous, He has made the disbelievers abide in the Fire for all eternity, even though their disbelief did not harm Him. Rather, He has imposed torment, trials, diseases, ailments, poverty, and hunger upon many of His servants in this world, while He is capable of removing them. Such is His way with His servants, and He has warned me of His punishment—so how can I not fear Him, and how can I be deluded about Him?"

Fear and hope are leaders and drivers that spur people to action; whatever does not spur to action is mere wishful thinking and delusion. The hope of most people is the cause of their laxity, the cause of their turning toward this world, and the cause of their turning away from God Almighty and neglecting to strive for the Hereafter—that is delusion. Indeed, He has informed and mentioned that delusion will overcome the hearts of the latter part of this community. What He promised has come to pass. For in earlier times, people would persist in acts of worship and give what they gave while their hearts were fearful that they would return to their Lord. They feared for themselves, and they were, night and day, in obedience to God, excelling in piety and caution against doubts and desires, weeping for themselves in private. But now you see the people secure, joyful, content, and unafraid, even as they plunge into sins, immerse themselves in the world, and turn away from God Almighty, claiming that they are confident in God’s generosity and bounty, hoping for His pardon and forgiveness—as if they claim to know of His bounty and generosity what the prophets, the companions, and the righteous predecessors did not know. If this matter were attained by mere wishes and obtained with ease, then why was there weeping, fear, and grief from those earlier ones? We have elaborated on these matters in the Book of Fear and Hope.

The Messenger of God said, as narrated by Ma‘qil ibn Yasar: “There will come upon people a time when the Quran will wear out in the hearts of men just as garments wear out on bodies. Their whole affair will be greed, with no fear alongside it. If one of them does good, he says, ‘It will be accepted from me,’ and if he does evil, he says, ‘I will be forgiven.’” He informed that they place greed in the position of fear due to their ignorance of the warnings of the Quran and what it contains. Similar to this is His report about the Christians when God Almighty said: “Then there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture, taking the ephemeral gains of this lower world and saying, ‘It will be forgiven us.’” Its meaning is that they “inherited the Scripture”—that is, they are scholars—“and take the ephemeral gains of this lower world”—that is, their desires from the world, whether lawful or unlawful. And God Almighty has said: “But for him who fears the standing before his Lord will be two gardens—that is for him who fears My standing and fears and worships.” The Quran, from beginning to end, is warning and caution; no one reflects upon it except that his grief lengthens and his fear increases, if he believes in what it contains. Yet you see people reciting it hastily, producing the letters from their proper points of articulation and disputing over their inflection, as if they were reciting poetry from the Arabs’ verses, not caring to turn to its meanings or act upon what is in it. Is there in the world any delusion greater than this?

These are examples of delusion concerning God and an exposition of the difference between hope and delusion. Close to it is the delusion of groups who have both acts of obedience and sins, except that their sins are more numerous, and they expect forgiveness and think that the scale of their good deeds will outweigh, even though what is in the scale of bad deeds is greater. This is the height of ignorance. You see a person giving a few dirhams in charity from lawful and unlawful wealth, while what he consumes from the wealth of Muslims and doubtful matters is many times that amount—and perhaps what he gave in charity was from the wealth of Muslims! Yet he relies on it and thinks that consuming a thousand dirhams unlawfully is counterbalanced by giving ten in charity from unlawful or lawful wealth. He is but like one who placed ten dirhams in one scale of a balance and a thousand in the other and wanted to lift the heavy scale with the light one—that is the height of his ignorance.

Indeed, among them are those who think their acts of obedience are more than their sins because they do not hold themselves to account nor scrutinize their sins. When he performs an act of obedience, he preserves it and counts it, like one who seeks God’s forgiveness with his tongue or glorifies God a hundred times a day, then backbites against Muslims, tears their reputations, and speaks throughout the day without limit or count what does not please God. He looks at the number of his glorifications—that he sought God’s forgiveness a hundred times—and is heedless of his prattle throughout his day, which, if written down, would be like his glorification a hundred or a thousand times. The noble scribes have recorded it, and God has promised him punishment for every word, saying: “Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher, ready.” Yet this person constantly contemplates the merits of glorifications and declarations of God’s oneness, without turning to what has come regarding the punishment for backbiters, liars, slanderers, and hypocrites, who show in speech what they do not conceal—and other afflictions of the tongue. That is pure delusion.

By my life, if the noble scribes demanded from him a wage for copying what they record of his prattle that exceeds his glorification, he would at that point restrain his tongue even from many of his important matters! What he uttered in his lapses he would count, calculate, and balance against his glorifications, so that the wage for copying it would not exceed them! How astonishing is one who holds himself to account and is cautious, fearing to miss a single carat in the wage for copying, yet is not cautious, fearing to miss the highest Paradise and its bliss! This is nothing but a great calamity for whoever reflects upon it.

We have been driven to a matter wherein if we doubt it, we are among the disbelieving deniers, and if we believe it, we are among the foolish, deluded ones! What are these deeds of one who believes in what the Quran brought? We seek refuge in God from being among the people of ingratitude. Glory be to Him who has prevented us from awakening and certainty despite this clear exposition. How deserving is He who has power to impose such heedlessness and delusion upon hearts that one should fear and be wary, and not be deluded by it, relying on the falsehoods of wishes and the excuses of Satan and caprice. And God knows best.

An Exposition of the Categories of the Deluded and the Divisions of Each Category's Sects, Which Are Four in Number

The first category: the people of knowledge, and among the deceived ones are groups. "So a group" mastered the religious sciences, delved deeply into them, and occupied themselves with them, but neglected to watch over the limbs, guard them from sins, and oblige them to acts of obedience. They were deceived by their knowledge and thought that they held a station with God, that they had reached such a level of knowledge that God would not punish the likes of them, but rather would accept their intercession for creation, and that He would not call them to account for their sins and misdeeds due to their nobility with God—and they are deceived. For if they were to look with the eye of insight, they would know that knowledge is of two kinds: knowledge of dealings (with God), and knowledge of unveiling; which is the knowledge of God and His attributes, customarily called the knowledge of gnosis.

As for the knowledge of spiritual practice: such as knowing the lawful and the unlawful, understanding the blameworthy and praiseworthy traits of the soul and the method of treating and fleeing from them—these are sciences sought only for the sake of action. Were there no need for action, these sciences would hold no value. Any knowledge sought for action has no worth without the accompanying deed. An example of this is a sick person afflicted by an ailment that can only be removed by a medicine composed of many ingredients, known only to skilled physicians. He strives in search of a physician after leaving his homeland until he finds a skilled doctor who teaches him the remedy, detailing its ingredients, their types, measures, and sources from which they are obtained, and instructs him in how to grind each one, mix them, and knead them. He learns all this and writes a fine copy in elegant handwriting, then returns to his home, repeating it and teaching it to other sick people, yet never busies himself with drinking and applying it. Do you think that would avail him anything against his illness? Far from it, far from it! Even if he wrote a thousand copies and taught it to a thousand patients until all were cured, and recited it a thousand times each night, it would not benefit him in the least regarding his own sickness—unless he weighs the gold, purchases the ingredients, mixes them as he learned, drinks the medicine, endures its bitterness, takes it at the proper time after observing all precautions and fulfilling all its conditions. Even if he does all that, his recovery remains uncertain—so how about if he never drinks it at all? Whoever imagines that mere knowledge suffices and heals him has clearly fallen into delusion.

Likewise, the jurist who masters the knowledge of obedience yet does not act upon it, masters the knowledge of sins yet does not abstain from them, masters the knowledge of blameworthy traits yet does not purify his soul from them, and masters the knowledge of praiseworthy traits yet does not embody them—he is deluded. For God Almighty said, “He has succeeded who purifies it” (Qur’an 91:9), and He did not say, “He has succeeded who learns how to purify it, writes down that knowledge, and teaches it to people!” At this point, Satan whispers to him: “Do not be deceived by this analogy, for knowledge of the remedy does not remove the sickness. What you seek is nearness to God and His reward, and knowledge brings reward.” Then he recites to him the traditions reported concerning the merit of knowledge. If the wretched one is foolish and deluded, this agrees with his desire and whim, so he becomes content with it and neglects action. But if he is intelligent, he says to Satan: “Do you remind me of the merits of the scholar and make me forget what has been reported about the wicked scholar who does not act upon his knowledge, such as God’s saying, ‘His likeness is that of a dog’ (Qur’an 7:176), and His saying, ‘The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey carrying books’ (Qur’an 62:5)? What disgrace is greater than being likened to a dog and a donkey?” And He said, “Whoever increases in knowledge but does not increase in guidance increases nothing from God except distance.” And He also said, “The scholar will be thrown into the Fire, and his intestines will spill out, and he will circle with them in the Fire as a donkey circles in a mill.” And like His saying, peace and blessings be upon him, “The worst of people are the evil scholars.” And the saying of Abu al-Darda’: “Woe to him who does not know—once—and had God willed, He would have taught him; and woe to him who knows but does not act—seven times.” That is, knowledge becomes a proof against him, for it will be said to him: “What have you done with what you knew, and how have you fulfilled the gratitude due to God?”

And He (peace be upon him) said, "The person most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection is a scholar from whom Allah derived no benefit through his knowledge." This and its like, which we have cited in the Book of Knowledge in the chapter on the 'Signs of the Scholars of the Hereafter,' are too numerous to count. However, this applies to what does not conform to the desire of the corrupt scholar. As for what has been narrated concerning the virtue of knowledge, it conforms to his desire, so Satan inclines his heart toward what he craves, and that is the very essence of delusion. For if he looks with insight, his example is as we have mentioned. But if he looks with the eye of faith, then the One who informed him of the virtue of knowledge is the same One who informed him of the censure of evil scholars and that their state with Allah is more severe than the state of the ignorant. Therefore, his belief thereafter that he is upon good, while Allah's proof against him is certain, is the utmost delusion.

As for the one who claims the sciences of unveiling—such as knowledge of Allah, His attributes, and His names—yet despite that, he performs actions and neglects the command of Allah and His limits, his delusion is more severe. His example is like one who wished to serve a king. He came to know the king, his character, his descriptions, his color, his form, his height, his breadth, his habits, and his court, but he did not acquaint himself with what the king loves and hates, what angers him, and what pleases him. Or, he knew that, yet he intended to serve him while clothed in everything that angers him and devoid of all that he loves in terms of dress, appearance, speech, movement, and stillness. So he presented himself to the king, desiring closeness to him and special favor, yet sullied with all that the king dislikes, devoid of all that he loves, seeking nearness to him merely through his knowledge of the king, his lineage, his name, his country, his image, his form, and his habits in managing his servants and dealing with his subjects. This person is profoundly deluded. For if he had abandoned all that he knew and busied himself solely with knowing Him and knowing what He dislikes and loves, that would have been closer to attaining his desired objective of closeness and special favor. Indeed, his shortcoming in piety and his following of base desires indicate that nothing of the knowledge of Allah has been unveiled to him except the names, without the realities. For if he had known Allah with true knowledge, he would have feared Him and been pious toward Him. It is inconceivable that a rational person knows the lion and then does not guard against it or fear it. Allah the Exalted revealed to David (peace be upon him): "Fear Me as you fear the ravenous beast." Indeed, one who knows of the lion only its color, form, and name may not fear it, as if he did not truly know the lion. So whoever knows Allah the Exalted knows from His attributes that He destroys the worlds and does not care, and knows that he is subjugated within the power of One for whom, if He destroyed thousands upon thousands like him and perpetuated punishment upon them for all eternity, it would not affect Him in the least, nor would compassion seize Him for them, nor would any distress befall Him concerning it. Therefore, He the Exalted said, "Only those fear Allah among His servants who have knowledge." And the opening of the Psalms states, "The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Allah." And Ibn Mas'ud said, "Sufficient is the fear of Allah as knowledge, and sufficient is delusion concerning Allah as ignorance."

Al-Hasan was asked for a legal opinion on a matter, and he answered. It was said to him, "Our jurists do not say that." He replied, "And have you ever seen a jurist? The jurist is the one who stands in prayer at night and fasts by day, the one who is abstinent from the world." And he said on another occasion, "The jurist does not flatter nor dispute; he disseminates the wisdom of Allah. If it is accepted from him, he praises Allah, and if it is rejected from him, he praises Allah." Therefore, the jurist is the one who has understood from Allah His command and prohibition and has learned from His attributes what He loves and what He hates; he is the true scholar. "And whomsoever Allah wills good for, He grants him understanding in the religion." And if he is not of this description, then he is among the deluded.

And another group perfected knowledge and action, so they persisted in outward acts of worship and abandoned sins, except that they did not examine their hearts to erase the blameworthy traits in the sight of God—such as arrogance, envy, ostentation, seeking leadership and high status, desiring harm for peers and equals, and seeking fame in calamities and acts of worship. Perhaps some of them did not even know that these are blameworthy, so they are plunged into them without caution and do not heed His saying, "The slightest ostentation is polytheism," nor His saying, peace be upon him, "He who has an atom's weight of arrogance in his heart will not enter Paradise," nor his saying, prayers and peace be upon him, "Envy consumes good deeds as fire consumes firewood," nor his saying, prayers and peace be upon him, "Love of honor and wealth cause hypocrisy to grow as water causes plants to grow," along with other reports we have cited throughout the quarter on destructive traits among the blameworthy morals. These individuals adorned their outward aspects but neglected their inward states, forgetting His saying, "Indeed, God does not look at your forms nor your wealth, but He looks at your hearts and your deeds." Thus, they attended to the deeds but did not attend to the hearts—and the heart is the foundation—for none shall be saved except he who comes to God with a sound heart. Their likeness is that of a cesspit: its exterior is plastered while its interior is foul; or like the graves of the dead: their exterior is adorned while their interior is a carcass; or like a dark house whose interior is dark, yet a lamp is placed on its roof so its exterior becomes illuminated; or like a man who intended to host the king in his home, so he plastered the door of his house but left refuse at the entrance of his home. It is evident that this is delusion. Rather, the closest analogy for them is that of a man who planted a crop, and it grew, but weeds grew with it, spoiling it. He was ordered to purify the crop from the weeds by uprooting them from their roots, but he began trimming their heads and tips, so their roots kept strengthening and sprouting anew. For the seeds of sins are the blameworthy traits in the heart; thus, whoever does not purify the heart from them will not achieve the outward acts of worship except with many afflictions. Indeed, he is like a sick person afflicted with scabies, who was ordered to apply ointment and drink medicine: the ointment to remove what is on his exterior and the medicine to cut off its source from his interior. Yet he contented himself with the ointment and neglected the medicine, while continuing to consume what increases the malady. Thus, he keeps applying ointment to the exterior while the scabies persists within him, erupting from the source that lies inside.

Another group recognized that these inward traits are blameworthy from the perspective of religious law, yet, marveling at themselves, they suppose they are free from them and that they are too exalted in God’s sight to be tested with such things—that only the common folk are tried with them, not those who have reached their rank in knowledge. They deem themselves too great in God’s eyes to be afflicted thus. Then, when the marks of arrogance and love of leadership appear in them, and they aspire to high status and honor, they say: “This is not arrogance; it is but seeking the might of the faith, displaying the nobility of knowledge, supporting God’s religion, and humiliating the noses of the innovators among the dissenters! If I were to wear lowly garments and sit in lowly gatherings, the enemies of religion would gloat over me and rejoice, and my humiliation would be a humiliation upon Islam.” The deluded one forgets that his true enemy, who opposes him from within, is his master Satan, who rejoices at what he does and mocks him. He forgets by what means the Prophet ﷺ supported the faith and humiliated the disbelievers. He forgets what is related from the Companions concerning humility, simplicity, and contentment with poverty and lowliness—so much so that ʿUmar, may God be pleased with him, was reproached for the shabbiness of his attire when he arrived in Syria, and he said: “We are a people whom God has honored through Islam; we do not seek honor through anything else.” Yet this deluded person seeks the might of the faith through fine garments of linen, brocade, and forbidden silk, through horses and carriages, and claims that he is thereby seeking the honor of knowledge and the nobility of religion!

Likewise, whenever his tongue is loosened in envy toward his peers or toward someone who has rebutted something he said, he does not suspect himself of envy but says: “This is only anger for the truth and a rebuttal of the wrongdoer in his aggression and injustice.” He does not suspect himself of envy until he considers: if another person of knowledge were criticized, or if someone else were prevented from a position of leadership and he were vying for it, would his anger and enmity be the same as his anger now? Would his anger then be for God? Or would he not become angry no matter how much another scholar were criticized or prevented? Rather, he might even rejoice at it. Thus his anger is for himself and his envy for his peers stems from the corruption within him. In this way he deceives himself about his deeds and his knowledge.

And when a thought of ostentation occurs to him, he says: “Far be it! My aim in displaying knowledge and action is only that people may follow my example so they may be guided to the religion of God Almighty and be saved from His punishment.” The deluded one does not reflect that he does not rejoice at people following someone else as he rejoices at them following him. If his aim were truly the reform of people, he would rejoice at their reform at the hands of anyone—just as one who has sick slaves and wishes to treat them does not distinguish between their healing occurring at his own hand or at the hand of another physician. Perhaps this is mentioned to him, but Satan also deludes him, and he says: “That is only because if they are guided through me, the reward is mine and the recompense is mine; thus my joy is in God’s reward, not in people accepting my words!” This is what he imagines about himself, but God knows what is in his heart—that if a prophet informed him that his reward in obscurity and concealing his knowledge would be greater than his reward in displaying it, and he were moreover confined in a prison and bound with chains, he would scheme to demolish the prison and break the chains until he could return to his position where his leadership is displayed, whether in teaching, preaching, or otherwise.

Similarly, he enters into the company of rulers, curries favor with them, praises them, and humbles himself before them. And when it occurs to him that humility before oppressive rulers is forbidden, Satan says to him: “Far be it! That is only when one covets their wealth. As for you, your aim is to intercede for Muslims, to ward off harm from them, and to repel the evil of your enemies from yourself!” But God knows what is within him—that if one of his peers were to find acceptance with that ruler and could intercede for every Muslim, so that harm was averted from all Muslims, this would weigh heavily upon him. And if he could spoil that peer’s standing with the ruler through slander and falsehood, he would do so.

Likewise, the delusion of some of them may reach the point that they take from the rulers’ wealth. And when it occurs to him that this is forbidden, Satan says to him: “This is wealth that has no rightful owner; it is for the welfare of Muslims, and you are the imam of the Muslims, their scholar, and through you the religion is upheld! Is it not permissible for you to take what suffices for your needs?”

He is thus deceived by this confusion in three matters. The first is that it is wealth without an owner, for he knows that he takes the tribute from the Muslims and the people of the Sawad, and those from whom he took are alive, as are their children and heirs. At most, there is a mixing of their wealth. If someone seizes a hundred dinars from ten people and mixes them, there is no disagreement that it is unlawful wealth, and it cannot be said it is wealth without an owner. It must be divided among the ten, and ten returned to each, even if each person's wealth has become mixed with the others.

The second and third matters lie in his claim that you are among the reformers of the Muslims and through you the religion is upheld. Yet perhaps those whose religion has been corrupted, who deem the wealth of rulers permissible, who desire worldly pursuits, seek leadership, and turn away from the Herebecause of him are more numerous than those who renounce the world, reject it, and turn to God. In truth, he is a deceiver of religion and a pillar of the doctrine of devils, not an imam of religion. For an imam is one who is followed in turning away from the world and turning to God, like the prophets, peace be upon them, the Companions, and the scholars of the early generations. A deceiver is one who is followed in turning away from God and turning to the world. Perhaps the death of such a one is more beneficial to the Muslims than his life, while he claims to be the upholder of religion. His likeness is as Jesus, peace be upon him, said of the wicked scholar: He is like a rock that has fallen at the mouth of a valley; it neither drinks the water nor lets the water reach the crops. The types of delusion among the people of knowledge in these later times are beyond enumeration, and in what we have mentioned, a little serves as a reminder of much.

Another group perfected knowledge, purified their limbs and adorned them with righteous deeds, avoided outward sins, and examined the soul's traits and the heart's qualities—such as hypocrisy, envy, malice, arrogance, and seeking superiority—striving against themselves to be free of these and uprooting their strong, visible roots from the hearts. Yet they remain deluded, for hidden in the recesses of the heart lie subtle, obscure snares of Satan and concealed deceptions of the soul, so fine and elusive that they remain unnoticed and neglected. Their likeness is one who wishes to cleanse a field of weeds: he goes around it, searches for every weed he sees and pulls it out, but he does not search for what has not yet emerged from beneath the soil, thinking all have appeared and surfaced. Meanwhile, delicate shoots have sprouted from the weed roots and spread under the earth, which he neglects, believing he has uprooted them. Then, in his heedlessness, they grow strong and corrupt the crop's roots without his knowledge. Similarly, a scholar may do all this yet neglect vigilance over hidden faults and examination of buried flaws. You see him spending night and day gathering knowledge, organizing it, refining its expressions, and compiling works, believing his motive is eagerness to manifest God's religion and spread His law. Yet perhaps his hidden motive is seeking fame, widespread reputation, many traveling to him from afar, tongues praising him, being commended for asceticism, piety, and knowledge, being preferred in important matters, chosen for objectives, people gathering around him to benefit and delight in attentive listening to his eloquent speech, enjoying the nodding of heads at his words, weeping at them, marveling at them, rejoicing in many companions, followers, and beneficiaries, and taking pleasure in being distinguished among peers for combining knowledge, piety, and outward asceticism, thereby enabling him to freely criticize all those engrossed in worldly life—not out of grief for religion's plight but from pride in distinction and self-importance. Perhaps this deluded wretch lives inwardly by the order, authority, honor, obedience, respect, and good praise he has garnered. If hearts turned against him and they believed him lacking in asceticism based on his apparent actions, his heart might become troubled, his spiritual practices and duties confused. He might excuse himself with every pretext, perhaps even lying to cover his fault. He might prefer honor and consideration from those who believe him ascetic and pious—even if they overestimate him—and his heart might turn cold toward one who recognizes the true extent of his virtue and piety, even if accurate. He might favor some companions over others, thinking he does so for their superior virtue and piety, when it is really because they are more obedient, more compliant to his will, praise him more, listen more attentively, and are more eager to serve him. Perhaps they benefit from him and desire knowledge, while he thinks their acceptance is due to his sincerity, truthfulness, and fulfilling the duty of his knowledge, so he praises God for the benefits He facilitates through his tongue, and considers mentioning that an expiation for his sins, without examining his own intention's sincerity. Perhaps if promised similar reward for choosing obscurity, seclusion, and concealing knowledge, he would not desire it due to lacking in isolation the pleasure of acceptance and the honor of leadership. Such a one may be meant by Satan's saying: "Whoever among the children of Adam claims that by his knowledge he is safe from me, I make him ignorant and he falls into my snares." Perhaps he composes works and strives in them, thinking he gathers God's knowledge to benefit others, while he only intends to spread his name through fine composition. If someone claimed his work, erasing his name and attributing it to themselves, that would weigh heavily on him, though he knows the reward for benefiting from the work returns to the author, and God knows he is the author, not the claimant. In his writing, he may not avoid praising himself, either explicitly with lengthy, broad claims, or implicitly by criticizing others. He may relate false speech, increasing its falsity, attributing it to its speaker, while what he finds commendable he does not attribute, so it is thought to be his own words—thus transmitting it verbatim like a thief, or altering it slightly like one who steals a shirt and makes it a cloak so it is not recognized as stolen. He may strive to embellish his expressions, use rhymed prose, and improve its arrangement, lest he be accused of weakness, believing his aim is to promote wisdom, refine it, and adorn it to be more beneficial to people. Perhaps he is heedless of what is narrated: a certain sage produced three hundred volumes on wisdom, and God revealed to the people of his time: "Tell him you have filled the earth with hypocrisy, and I accept nothing from your hypocrisy." Perhaps when a group of this deluded kind gather, each thinks himself safe from the faults and hidden aspects of the heart. If they separate and each is followed by a faction of companions, each looks at the multitude of his followers, that he has more or fewer, and rejoices if his followers are more, even knowing another is more deserving of many followers. Then when they disperse and engage in teaching, they become estranged and envious. Perhaps if someone who attends one of them ceases and goes to another, it weighs on his heart, and he feels aversion toward him; thereafter, his inner self is not moved to honor him, nor does he exert himself to meet his needs as before, nor is he eager to praise him as he did, though knowing he is busy seeking benefit. Perhaps shifting to another group would have been more beneficial for his religion due to some affliction that affected him in this group and safety from it in that group, yet the aversion does not leave his heart. Perhaps if envy stirs in one of them, he cannot show it, so he pretends to criticize his religion and piety to direct his anger thereto, saying, "I am only angry for God's religion, not for myself." Whenever his faults are mentioned in his presence, he may secretly rejoice; if he is praised, it may displease and annoy him. Perhaps he frowns unless his faults are mentioned—appearing to dislike backbiting Muslims—while his heart is pleased and desires it, and God is aware of that. These and similar hidden matters of the heart are only perceived by the discerning and avoided only by the strong; there is no hope therein for the weak like us, except that the lowest degree is for a person to know his own faults, be displeased and hate them, and strive to reform them. If God wills good for a servant, He shows him his soul's faults. Whoever is pleased by his good deed and displeased by his bad deed is hopeful, and his state is closer than the deluded one who praises himself, boasts to God of his deeds and knowledge, thinking he is among the best of creation. We seek refuge in God from heedlessness, delusion, and from knowing hidden faults while neglecting them. This is the delusion of those who acquired important knowledge but fell short in acting upon it.

Now let us mention the delusion of those who content themselves with sciences that do not concern them and abandon what is essential, while they are deceived in it—either because they deem themselves independent of the root of that knowledge, or because they restrict themselves to it alone. Among them is a group who have confined themselves to the knowledge of legal rulings concerning governance, disputes, and the detailed worldly transactions that take place among people for the benefit of servants, and they have restricted the name of jurisprudence to this alone, calling it “jurisprudence” and the “knowledge of schools.” Yet along with this, they may neglect both outward and inward deeds: they do not watch over their limbs, nor silence the tongue from backbiting, nor restrain the belly from the unlawful, nor keep the feet from walking to rulers—and likewise with all the other limbs—nor do they guard their hearts from pride, envy, hypocrisy, and all other destructive traits. These, then, are deluded in two respects: one in terms of action, and the other in terms of knowledge.

As for action: we have already explained the aspect of delusion therein, and their likeness is the likeness of a sick person who learns the prescription of medicine and occupies himself with repeating it and teaching it. Nay, rather their likeness is the likeness of one afflicted with hemorrhoids and pleurisy, who is on the brink of destruction and in need of learning the remedy and applying it, yet he occupies himself with learning the remedy for irregular bleeding and repeating that night and day, while knowing that he is a man who neither menstruates nor experiences irregular bleeding. But he says, "Perhaps I will encounter a case of irregular bleeding concerning a woman, and she will ask me about it." That is the height of delusion.

Similarly, the wretched jurist may be overcome by love of this world, following base desires, envy, arrogance, ostentation, and other destructive inward traits. Perhaps death may snatch him before repentance and rectification, so he meets God while He is angry with him. Yet he abandons all of that and occupies himself with the knowledge of peace treaties, leases, sworn allegations, mutual imprecations, wounds, blood monies, claims, evidence, and the book of menstruation, while he himself has no need for any of that whatsoever in his entire life. If someone else needs it, there is an abundance among the jurisconsults, so he occupies himself with it and is eager for it because of the status, leadership, and wealth it contains. Satan has beguiled him, and he is unaware, for the one deluded about himself thinks he is occupied with a religious obligation, not knowing that occupying oneself with a communal obligation before completing one's personal obligation is an act of disobedience. This is if his intention were sound, as was said, and his aim in jurisprudence was for the sake of God Almighty. But if his aim is for the sake of God, then by occupying himself with it he is neglecting his personal obligation concerning his limbs and his heart. This is his delusion from the aspect of action.

As for his delusion regarding knowledge: it lies in confining himself to the science of legal rulings, imagining it to be the entirety of religious knowledge, while abandoning the Book of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ. He may even disparage the Hadith scholars, saying, “They are mere transmitters of reports and carriers of books, lacking understanding.” He further neglects the knowledge of refining character and abandons the profound understanding of God Almighty—the comprehension of His majesty and greatness, which is the knowledge that begets fear, awe, humility, and leads to piety. Thus, you see him feeling secure from God, deluded by Him, relying on the notion that He must surely show him mercy because he has established his religion, and that if he did not occupy himself with legal rulings, the lawful and the unlawful would fall into neglect. Yet he has forsaken the sciences that are most important, remaining heedless and deceived. The cause of his delusion is what he has heard in the Sacred Law concerning the exaltation of jurisprudence, without realizing that this jurisprudence is the profound understanding of God and the knowledge of His attributes that inspire fear and hope, so that the heart may feel dread and cling to piety. As God Almighty said, “If only a contingent from every group remained behind to gain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious.” The warning achieved is not from this [mere legal] knowledge, for the aim of this knowledge is safeguarding wealth through the conditions of transactions and protecting bodies through wealth and by warding off killing and injuries. Wealth is but a tool in the path of God, and the body a mount. The truly important knowledge is knowing how to traverse the path and remove the heart’s obstacles, which are the blameworthy traits that form a veil between the servant and God Almighty. If one dies stained by those traits, he will be veiled from God. The analogy for limiting oneself to the knowledge of jurisprudence is like one who, in undertaking the pilgrimage journey, confines himself to learning how to stitch a waterskin or repair a sandal. Undoubtedly, if this were not done, the pilgrimage would be hindered, yet limiting oneself to it has nothing to do with the essence of the pilgrimage nor is it on its path—we have elaborated on this in the Book of Knowledge. Among these are those who restrict themselves within jurisprudence to matters of disagreement, caring only to learn the methods of disputation, forcing points, silencing opponents, and repelling truth for the sake of victory and ostentation. Thus, they spend night and day investigating contradictions among the school founders, searching for flaws in peers, and seizing upon various harmful argumentative tactics. These are the predators among mankind, whose nature is to harm and whose concern is folly. They seek knowledge only out of necessity for outshining their peers. Any knowledge they do not need for ostentation—such as the knowledge of the heart and the knowledge of traversing the path to God Almighty by erasing blameworthy traits and replacing them with praiseworthy ones—they belittle and call it embellishment or the talk of preachers. True knowledge, in their view, is knowing the intricacies of the brawls that occur between contenders in debate. These individuals have gathered what their predecessors gathered in the science of legal rulings, but they have added to it by occupying themselves with what is not even among the communal obligations. Indeed, all the minutiae of dialectics in jurisprudence are an innovation unknown to the early generations. As for the proofs of rulings, they are encompassed by the knowledge of the school, which is the Book of God, the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ, and understanding their meanings. As for the tricks of debate—such as breaking, reversing, corrupting premises, composition, and transference—they were innovated merely to demonstrate superiority, silence others, and sustain the market of disputation. Thus, the delusion of these individuals is far more severe and uglier than the delusion of those before them.

Another group occupied themselves with the science of dialectical theology and disputation over whims, refuting opponents, and pursuing their contradictions. They amassed knowledge of diverse doctrines and busied themselves with learning methods to debate and silence those adversaries, splitting into numerous factions therein. They believed that none knew God and His attributes better than they, and that there is no faith for one who does not hold to their school nor learn their knowledge, with each faction calling to itself.

Then they are two factions: the misguided and the rightly guided. The misguided are those who call to other than the Sunnah, while the rightly guided are those who call to the Sunnah, yet delusion encompasses them all. This is due to their heedlessness of their own misguidance and their presumption of their own salvation. They are many sects, each declaring the others unbelievers. Their error stems solely from the fact that they did not doubt their own opinions, nor did they first establish the conditions and methodologies of proofs. Thus, one of them sees doubt as proof and proof as doubt.

As for the rightly guided faction: their delusion arises from their belief that dialectical disputation is the most important matter and the most excellent means of nearness to God in religion. They claim that no one's religion is complete unless he scrutinizes and investigates, and that whoever believes in God and His Messenger without investigation and precise proof is not a believer, or is not complete in faith, nor is he brought near to God.

Due to this corrupt assumption, they spent their lifetimes learning argumentation and investigating the doctrines and delusions of innovators and their contradictions, neglecting their own selves and hearts until their sins and errors—both apparent and hidden—became veiled from them. Each one of them thinks that his engagement in dialectics is more worthy, nearer to God, and superior. Yet, because he delights in victory and silencing opponents, and takes pleasure in leadership and the honor of belonging to the defense of God’s religion, his insight has been blinded, so he does not turn to the first generation. For the Prophet (peace be upon him) testified that they were the best of creation, and that they encountered many people of innovation and caprice, yet they did not make their lives and religion targets for disputes and debates, nor did they occupy themselves with that to the neglect of examining their hearts, limbs, and states. Rather, they only spoke on such matters when they saw a need and discerned signs of acceptance, mentioning only what was necessary to guide the straying to recognize his error. If they saw someone persisting in misguidance, they abandoned him, turned away from him, and hated him for the sake of God, without engaging in prolonged contention with him. Indeed, they said: “Truth is the call to the Sunnah, and part of the Sunnah is abandoning argumentation in calling to the Sunnah.” For Abu Umamah al-Bahili reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: “No people ever stray after being upon guidance except that they are given argumentation.” And one day the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) came out to his companions while they were disputing and arguing, and he became angry with them until it was as if pomegranate seeds had burst upon his face—a redness from anger—and he said: “Is this why you were sent? Were you commanded to strike the Book of God against itself? Look to what you have been commanded and do it, and what you have been forbidden and desist.” Thus, he rebuked them for that, and they were the most deserving of God’s creation to engage in debate and argumentation. Then they observed that the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) was sent to all people of religions, yet he did not sit with them in sessions of debate for the sake of compelling, silencing, establishing proof, repelling questions, or presenting arguments. He only debated them by reciting the Qur’an revealed to him, and he did not add to the debate beyond that, because that confuses hearts and draws out difficulties and doubts, which one then cannot erase from their hearts. He was not incapable of debating them with classifications and subtleties of sophistry, nor of teaching his companions the methods of argument and proof. But the intelligent and people of resolve were not deceived by this, and they said: “If the people of the earth were saved and we perished, their salvation would not benefit us; and if we were saved and they perished, their destruction would not harm us. We are not obligated in debate more than the Companions were with the Jews, Christians, and people of religions, and they did not waste their lives refining their debates. So why should we waste our lives and not devote them to what benefits us on the day of our poverty and need? And why should we delve into that in whose details we cannot secure ourselves from error?” Then we see that the innovator does not abandon his innovation through debate; rather, fanaticism and contention only increase his stubbornness in his innovation. Thus, my occupation with disputing my own soul, arguing with it, and striving against it so that it leaves this world for the Hereafter is more fitting—this if I had not been prohibited from debate and contention, so how much more when I have been prohibited from it? And how can I call to the Sunnah by abandoning the Sunnah? Therefore, it is more appropriate that I examine myself and observe among its traits what God the Exalted hates and what He loves, so that I may abstain from what He hates and hold fast to what He loves.

And another group occupied themselves with preaching and reminding, and the highest among them in rank is he who speaks about the ethics of the soul and the attributes of the heart—such as fear, hope, patience, gratitude, reliance, asceticism, certainty, sincerity, truthfulness, and the like—yet they are deluded, imagining within themselves that when they speak of these attributes and call people to them, they have thereby become described by these attributes, while in the sight of God they are detached from them, except for a small measure that even the common Muslims are not free from. The delusion of these is the most severe delusion, for they admire themselves to the utmost and think that they have not delved into the knowledge of love except that they are lovers of God, nor have they grasped the subtleties of sincerity except that they are sincere, nor have they uncovered the hidden faults of the soul except that they are purified from them: and were it not that he is brought near to God, he would not have known the meaning of nearness and distance, nor the knowledge of the journey to God and how to traverse the stations on the path to God! Thus, the wretched one, with these assumptions, sees himself as among the fearful while he is secure from God Almighty; he sees himself as among the hopeful while he is deluded and lost; he sees himself as among those content with God’s decree while he is among the discontented; he sees himself as among those who rely on God while he relies on honor, status, wealth, and means; and he sees himself as among the sincere while he is among the hypocrites. Nay, he describes sincerity yet abandons sincerity in the description; he describes hypocrisy and mentions it while he hypocritically mentions it so that it may be believed of him that were he not sincere, he would not have been guided to the subtleties of hypocrisy; and he describes asceticism in the world due to his intense greed for the world and his strong desire for it. Thus, he outwardly calls to God while he is distant from Him, and he warns with God Almighty while he is secure from Him. He remembers God Almighty while he is heedless of Him, and he draws near to God while he is far from Him; he urges sincerity while he is not sincere, and he condemns blameworthy traits while he is characterized by them; he diverts people from creation while he is the most eager for creation—if he were prevented from his gathering in which he calls people to God, the earth would feel constricted to him despite its vastness—and he claims that his aim is the reform of creation, yet if one of his peers appeared whom people turned to and were reformed by his hand, he would die of grief and envy; and if one of those who frequent him praised some of his peers, that peer would become the most hated of God’s creation to him. These are the people with the greatest delusion and the farthest from awakening and returning to rectitude, for the one who encourages praiseworthy ethics and deters from blameworthy ones is he who knows their perils and benefits, and this one has known that but it did not benefit him, and his love for calling people distracted him from acting upon it. So after that, with what can he be treated, and how can he be frightened? For the only thing to be feared is what he recites to God’s servants so that they fear, while he himself is not fearful. Indeed, if he assumes himself to be described by these praiseworthy attributes, it is possible to indicate the way of testing and trial: for example, if he claims love for God, what has he abandoned of his own desires for His sake? If he claims fear, what has he refrained from out of fear? If he claims asceticism, what has he forsaken despite having the ability for it, for the sake of God Almighty? If he claims intimacy with God, when has solitude been pleasing to him? And when has he felt lonely at the sight of creation? Nay, rather he sees his heart filled with sweetness when disciples surround him, and you find him feeling lonely except when alone with God Almighty. Have you ever seen a lover who feels lonely from his beloved and seeks relief from him with another? Thus, the wise test themselves with these attributes and demand truth from themselves, not contenting themselves with adornment but with a firm covenant from God; while the deluded think well of themselves with assumptions, and when the veil is lifted from them in the Hereafter, they are exposed—nay, they are cast into the Fire, so that their saddle-girths slip, and one of them revolves with it as a donkey revolves around a millstone, as reported in the tradition, because they enjoin good but do not do it, and they forbid evil but do it. The delusion for these has occurred from the fact that they encounter in their hearts something weak from the foundations of these meanings—which is love for God, fear of Him, and contentment with His action—then along with that they were able to describe the lofty stations in these meanings, so they thought that they were not able to describe that, nor had God granted them knowledge of it, nor did people benefit from their speech about it, except due to their being characterized by it. And it escaped them that acceptance is for speech, speech is for knowledge, the tongue’s flow is for knowledge, and all of that is other than being characterized by the attribute. Thus, he does not differ from ordinary Muslims in being characterized by the attribute of love and fear, but rather in the ability to describe. Indeed, perhaps his security increases and his fear diminishes, and his inclination toward creation becomes apparent while love for God Almighty weakens in his heart. His example is like that of a sick person who describes the illness and its cure with eloquence, and describes health and healing, while other sick people are unable to describe health and healing, its causes, degrees, and types. He does not differ from them in the attribute of illness and being characterized by it, but rather differs in description and knowledge of medicine. His assumption, upon knowing the reality of health, that he is healthy is the height of ignorance. Similarly, knowledge of fear, love, reliance, asceticism, and all these attributes is other than being characterized by their realities. Whoever confuses describing realities with being characterized by realities is deluded. This is the condition of preachers in whose speech there is no defect—indeed, the method of their preaching is the method of the Qur’an’s preaching, the traditions, and the preaching of al-Hasan al-Basri and his like, may God’s mercy be upon them.

Another group among them deviated from the obligatory method in preaching, and these are the preachers of this age in their entirety, except for those whom God has protected—rarely found in some regions, if they exist at all, and we do not know them. They occupied themselves with absurdities, ecstatic utterances, and fabricating words that fall outside the bounds of both religious law and reason, seeking to astonish. Another faction became infatuated with flights of wit, rhyming phrases, and their contrivance, so most of their efforts are devoted to rhymes and gaining fame through poems of union and separation. Their aim is that shouts and emotional displays increase in their gatherings, even if for corrupt purposes. These are the devils among mankind; they have strayed and led others astray from the straight path. For the former, even if they did not reform themselves, they at least reformed others and corrected their speech and admonition. As for these, they turn people away from the path of God and draw creation into delusion about God through words of hope, thereby increasing their audacity in sin and desire for this world—especially when the preacher adorns himself with fine clothes, horses, and conveyances, for his appearance from head to toe testifies to his intense craving for worldly things. Thus, such a deluded person corrupts more than he reforms; indeed, he does not reform at all and misguides many. The reason for his being deluded is not hidden.

Another group among them contented themselves with memorizing the sayings of the ascetics and their discourses condemning the world. They memorize the words verbatim and deliver them without comprehending their meanings. Some do this on pulpits, some in prayer niches, and some in markets among companions. Each of them thinks that by distinguishing himself with this measure above the common folk and soldiers—since he has memorized the speech of ascetics and people of religion while they have not—he has succeeded and attained his goal, becoming forgiven and secure from God’s punishment without guarding his outward and inward from sins. Rather, he believes that memorizing the speech of religious people suffices him. The delusion of these is more evident than that of those before them.

Another group immersed their times in the science of Hadith—I mean in hearing it, collecting numerous narrations, and seeking rare, elevated chains of transmission. The ambition of one of them is to travel through lands and meet scholars so that he may say, “I narrate from so-and-so, and I have seen so-and-so, and I possess chains of transmission that no one else has.” Their delusion arises from several aspects: among them is that they are like bearers of books, for they do not devote care to understanding the meanings of the Sunnah; their knowledge is limited, and they have nothing but transmission, yet they think that suffices them. Another aspect is that they do not understand its meanings nor act upon them—though they may understand some and still not act upon it. Another is that they abandon the knowledge that is an individual obligation—namely, knowing the treatment of the heart—and occupy themselves with multiplying chains and seeking elevated ones, while they have no need for any of that. Another aspect—and this is what the people of the age have plunged into—is that they also do not uphold the condition of hearing, for hearing alone, even if it yields no benefit, is important in itself for establishing the Hadith, since comprehension comes after establishment, and action after comprehension. The first is hearing, then comprehension, then memorization, then action, then dissemination. These have limited themselves to hearing from the whole, then abandoned the reality of hearing. Thus, you see a child present in a scholar’s gathering while the Hadith is being recited, the scholar is asleep, and the child is playing; then the child’s name is written as having heard. When he grows up, he presents himself to be heard from. The adult who attends may be inattentive, not hearing, not listening, and not retaining; perhaps he is occupied with conversation or copying. The scholar from whom he hears, if he mispronounces or alters what is recited to him, is unaware and does not recognize it. All of this is ignorance and delusion. For the foundation in Hadith is to hear it from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), memorize it as he heard it, and narrate it as he memorized it, so that narration is from memory and memory from hearing. If you are unable to hear it from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), you hear it from the Companions or the Followers, and your hearing from the narrator becomes like hearing from one who heard from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him). That is, you listen attentively to hear, then memorize and narrate as you have memorized, and memorize as you have heard, such that you do not change a single letter—even if another changes a letter or errs, you know his error.

There are two methods of preservation. The first is that you preserve with the heart and maintain it through remembrance and repetition, just as you preserve what has reached your hearing through the various circumstances of life. The second is that you write as you hear, correct what is written, and preserve it so that the hand of one who might alter it cannot reach it, and your preservation of the book is with you in your repository. For if the hand of another were to extend to it, it might alter it. If you do not preserve it, you will not be aware of its alteration. Thus, it is preserved either by your heart or by your book, so your book serves as a reminder of what you heard and you are secure within it from change and distortion.

If you do not preserve it, neither by heart nor by book, and a heedless sound merely passes by your ear and you then leave the gathering, and later you see a copy from that shaykh and deem it possible that what is in it has been altered or differs by a single letter from the copy you heard, it is not permissible for you to say, "I heard this book," for you do not know—perhaps you did not hear what is in it, but rather heard something that contradicts what is in it, even if by a single word. If you have no preservation by your heart nor a correct copy upon which you have relied to compare, then from where will you know that you heard that? Allah the Exalted has said, "And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge." The statement of all the shaykhs in this time, "We heard what is in this book," if the condition we mentioned is not found, is an outright falsehood.

The minimum condition for hearing is that the entirety passes by the hearing with a kind of preservation, and one is aware with it of any alteration. If it were permissible to record the hearing of a child, the heedless, the sleeper, and the one who is copying, then it would be permissible to record the hearing of an insane person or an infant in the cradle. Then, when the child reaches maturity and the insane person regains sanity, one would hear from them—and there is no disagreement on the impermissibility of this. If that were permissible, it would be permissible to record the hearing of a fetus in the womb. If the hearing of an infant in the cradle is not recorded because it does not understand nor preserve, then the child who does not play, the heedless, and the one preoccupied with copying to the exclusion of hearing are no different; they do not preserve. If an ignorant person were to dare and say, "Record the hearing of an infant in the cradle," then let him record the hearing of a fetus in the womb. If he distinguishes between them by saying the fetus does not hear the sound while this one does hear the sound, what benefit is this? For what is transmitted is the *hadith*, not the mere sound. Let him then confine himself, when he becomes a shaykh, to saying: "I heard after reaching maturity that in my childhood I attended a gathering in which a *hadith* was narrated; its sound struck my hearing, but I do not know what it was." There is no disagreement that narration in such a manner is not valid, and anything beyond that is an outright falsehood.

If it were permissible to affirm the hearing of a Turk who does not understand Arabic because he heard a sound heedlessly, then it would be permissible to affirm the hearing of an infant in the cradle, and that is the height of ignorance. From where does this [practice] originate? Does hearing have any basis except the saying of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him: "May Allah brighten a man who hears my statement, comprehends it, and conveys it as he heard it"? How can one who does not know what he heard convey it as he heard it? This is the most vile form of delusion. The people of this age have been afflicted with this. If the people of the age were to be scrutinized, they would not find shaykhs except those who heard in childhood in this manner, with heedlessness. However, the *muhaddithun* (scholars of *hadith*) have prestige and acceptance in that. The poor souls feared that if they stipulated that condition, those who would gather for their circles would diminish, their prestige would decrease, and the *ahadith* they had heard under this condition would also diminish—indeed, they might lack it entirely and be exposed. So they agreed upon a convention that nothing is stipulated except that a murmur strikes his hearing, even if he does not know what is occurring.

The validity of hearing is not known from the statement of the *muhaddithun*, for it is not from their specific knowledge, but rather from the knowledge of the scholars of the principles of jurisprudence (*usul al-fiqh*). What we have mentioned is decisively established in the principles of the laws of *usul al-fiqh*. This is the delusion of these people. Had they heard according to the proper condition, they would still be deluded in restricting themselves to transmission and spending their lives collecting narrations and chains of transmission, while neglecting the crucial matters of the religion and the knowledge of the reports. Indeed, the purpose intended from the *hadith* is to tread the path of the Hereafter. One who treads its path might be sufficed by a single *hadith* for his entire lifetime, as is narrated from some of the shaykhs that he attended a hearing gathering. The first *hadith* narrated was his saying, peace be upon him: "From the excellence of a person's Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him." He stood and said, "This suffices me until I have fulfilled it, then I will hear others." Thus is the hearing of the intelligent who are wary of delusion.

Another group occupied themselves with the study of grammar, language, poetry, and linguistic peculiarities, becoming deluded by it and claiming that they were forgiven and counted among the scholars of the community, since religion is upheld by the Book and the Sunnah, and the Book and Sunnah are upheld by knowledge of language and grammar. Thus, they spent their entire lives on the minutiae of grammar, the craft of poetry, and linguistic peculiarities. Their example is like one who spends his whole life learning calligraphy, correcting and beautifying letters, and claims that knowledge cannot be preserved except through writing, so it is essential to learn and perfect it. Had he used his intellect, he would have known that it suffices him to learn the fundamentals of script to the extent that he can read however it may be; the rest is surplus beyond sufficiency. Similarly, the man of letters, had he used his intellect, would have known that the language of the Arabs is like the language of the Turks, and wasting his life in knowing the language of the Arabs is like wasting it in knowing the language of the Turks or the Indians. The distinction of the Arabic language is solely due to the arrival of the Sacred Law through it. Therefore, what suffices from language is knowledge of the uncommon words in the Hadiths and the Book, and from grammar what pertains to the Hadith and the Book. As for delving into it to boundless degrees, that is superfluous and unnecessary. Then, if he restricts himself to it and turns away from knowing the meanings of the Sacred Law and acting upon it, this too is delusion. Rather, his example is like one who wastes his life in perfecting the articulation points of the letters in the Qur’an and confines himself to that—and that is delusion, for the purpose of the letters is the meanings; the letters are merely vessels and tools. Whoever needs to drink oxymel to remove the yellow bile afflicting him, yet wastes his time beautifying the cup from which he drinks the oxymel, is among the ignorant and deluded. Such is the delusion of the people of grammar, literature, recitations, and meticulousness in articulation points, however deeply they delve into them, devote themselves to them, and linger upon them—more than what is needed for learning the sciences that are an individual obligation. The ultimate core is action, and above it is knowledge of the action, which is like the husk to the action and like the core in relation to what is above it. That which is above it is hearing the words and memorizing them through narration, which is a husk in relation to knowledge and a core in relation to what is above it. What is above it is knowledge of language and grammar, and above that—which is the outermost husk—is knowledge of articulation points. Those content with these levels are all deluded, except for one who takes these levels as waystations and does not linger upon them except to the extent of his need, then passes beyond to what lies behind them until he reaches the essence of action, seeking the reality of action with his heart and limbs, and hopes to spend his life in compelling the soul to it, correcting deeds, and purifying them from impurities and defects. This is the intended purpose served by the totality of the sciences of the Sacred Law, while all other sciences are servants to it, means to it, husks for it, and waystations in relation to it. This is the intended purpose served by the totality of the sciences of the Sacred Law, while all other sciences are servants to it, means to it, husks for it, and waystations in relation to it. Whoever does not reach the objective has failed, whether he is at the near waystation or the distant one. Since these sciences are connected to the sciences of the Sacred Law, their practitioners became deluded by them. As for the sciences of medicine, arithmetic, crafts, and what is known not to be from the sciences of the Sacred Law, their adherents do not believe that they attain forgiveness through them on account of their being sciences; thus, the delusion regarding them is less than the delusion regarding the sciences of the Sacred Law. For the Sacred Sciences share in being praiseworthy, just as the husk shares with the core in being praiseworthy, but what is praiseworthy in itself is the ultimate end. The second is praiseworthy for attaining through it the ultimate objective. Whoever takes the husk as the objective and lingers upon it has become deluded by it.

Another group fell into grave self-deception in the field of jurisprudence, imagining that the judgment of a servant between himself and God follows his judgment in the court of law. Thus, they devised legal stratagems to evade rightful dues, misinterpreted crucial terms, were deluded by outward appearances, and erred therein. This falls under the category of error in issuing legal opinions and self-deception therein, and error in legal opinions is something that occurs frequently. However, this type has become widespread among the masses, except for the discerning among them. We shall point to examples: Among these is their legal opinion that if a woman absolves her husband from the dowry, the husband is absolved between himself and God Almighty. This is an error. Rather, the husband may wrong the wife in such a manner that he makes matters difficult for her through bad character, compelling her to seek deliverance, so she absolves the husband to be free of him. This is an absolution not from a contented self. God Almighty has said, "But if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with right good cheer." A contented self is not the same as a contented heart, for a person may desire something with his heart that his self is not content with. He may desire cupping with his heart, but his self dislikes it. Contentment of the self means that one's self willingly consents to the absolution, not due to a necessity confronting it, such that if forced to choose between two harms, one chooses the lesser of them. This is, in truth, a form of seizure through internal coercion. Indeed, the judge in this world has no insight into hearts and intentions, so he looks at the outward absolution and that she was not coerced by an apparent cause, for internal coercion is not something creatures can perceive. However, when the Supreme Judge takes the seat of judgment on the plain of Resurrection, this will not be counted or considered in establishing the absolution. Therefore, it is not permissible to take a person's wealth except with his contented self. If someone were to ask a person for wealth publicly, and the person felt ashamed before people not to give it, wishing the request had been made in private so he would not give, but he feared the pain of people's blame and feared the pain of surrendering the wealth, and he weighed between them and chose the lesser of the two pains—the pain of surrender—and thus surrendered it, there is no difference between this and seizure. For the meaning of seizure is inflicting bodily pain with a whip until it becomes stronger than the heart's pain in parting with wealth, so one chooses the lesser of the two pains. Asking in a situation prone to shame and ostentation is a lash upon the heart. There is no difference between striking the inward and striking the outward before God Almighty, for the inward is outward before God Almighty. It is only the judge of this world who rules by possession based on the outward statement, "I have given it as a gift," because he cannot ascertain what is in the heart. Likewise, if one gives for fear of another's evil tongue or evil tale-bearing, it is forbidden for him. Similarly, any wealth taken in this manner is forbidden. Do you not see what came in the story of David, peace be upon him, when he said—after he was forgiven—"O Lord, how shall I face my adversary?" He was commanded to seek absolution from him, and he was dead, so he was commanded to call him in the rock of the Holy House. He called, "O Uriah!" He answered, "At your service, O Prophet of God! You have taken me out of Paradise; what do you want?" He said, "I wronged you in a matter; forgive it for me." He said, "I have done so, O Prophet of God." He departed, relying on that, but Gabriel, peace be upon him, said to him, "Did you mention to him what you did?" He said, "Did I not forgive it for you?" He said, "Will you not ask me what that sin was?" He said, "What is it, O Prophet of God?" He mentioned the affair of the woman, and the answer was cut off. He said, "O Uriah, will you not answer me?" He said, "O Prophet of God, this is not how prophets act until I stand with you before God." David then turned to weeping and wailing from the head until God promised him that He would seek it from him in the Hereafter. Thus, this alerts you that a gift without a contented heart is of no benefit, and a contented heart is only attained through true awareness. Similarly, a contented heart in absolution, gift-giving, and other matters only occurs when a person is free and choosing, such that motives spring from his own essence, not that his motives are compelled to act through stratagems and compulsion. Among these is a man giving his wife's wealth as a charity at the end of the tax year and taking her wealth as a gift to avoid paying the alms-tax. The jurist says, "The alms-tax obligation has lapsed." If he means by this that the demand of the authority and the tax collector has lapsed for him, then he is truthful, for the scope of their consideration is outward ownership, and it has vanished. But if he thinks he will be safe on the Day of Resurrection and be like one who never owned the wealth, or like one who sold due to his need for the sale price, not with this intention, then how great is his ignorance of the jurisprudence of religion and the secret of the alms-tax! For the secret of the alms-tax is to purify the heart from the vice of miserliness, for miserliness is destructive. He, peace be upon him, said, "Three things are destructive: obeyed greed." His greed only became obeyed by what he did; before that, it was not obeyed. Thus, his destruction is completed by what he thinks contains his salvation, for God is aware of his heart, his love for wealth, and his avarice for it, and that his avarice for wealth reached the point where he devised stratagems to block from himself, out of ignorance and self-deception, the path of deliverance from miserliness. Among these is God's permitting wealth from endowments for the jurist and others according to need. The self-deceived jurists do not distinguish between wishes, superfluities, desires, and needs. Rather, they consider everything without which their arrogance cannot be maintained as a need, and this is pure self-deception. Indeed, the world was created for the servants' need of it in worship and traversing the path of the Hereafter. Thus, whatever a servant takes to aid him in religion and worship is his need, and whatever is beyond that is his superfluity and desire. If we were to describe the self-deception of jurists in examples like these, we would fill volumes with it. The purpose here is to alert through examples that make the categories known, not to be exhaustive, for that would be lengthy.

The second category: devotees of worship and practice, among whom the deluded are many factions. Among them are those deluded in prayer; among them are those deluded in reciting the Qur’an; among them are those in pilgrimage; among them are those in jihad; among them are those in asceticism. Likewise, everyone occupied with a path of practice is not free from delusion except the discerning—and few they are.

Among them is a group who neglected the obligatory acts and busied themselves with virtuous deeds and supererogatory acts, and perhaps they delved so deeply into virtues that they transgressed into aggression and excess. Like one overcome by whisperings in ablution, so he exaggerates in it and is not satisfied with water deemed pure by legal ruling, considering remote possibilities of impurity as near. Yet when it comes to consuming lawful provisions, he regards near possibilities as remote and may even consume what is purely unlawful. If this caution were transferred from water to food, it would be more akin to the conduct of the Companions, for 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, performed ablution with water from a Christian jar despite the apparent possibility of impurity, while he nonetheless avoided certain lawful avenues out of fear of falling into the unlawful. Then among these are those who exceed bounds in pouring water, which is prohibited, and the matter may prolong until the prayer is missed and its time passes. Even if it does not pass its time, he is deluded for missing the virtue of the prayer's earliest time; and if he does not miss that, he is deluded for his wastefulness of water; and if he does not waste, he is deluded for squandering his lifetime, which is the most precious of things, on what he could have avoided. Indeed, Satan turns the creation away from God by a noble-seeming path, and he cannot turn the servants away except by what he makes appear to them as worship, thus distancing them from God by such means.

And another group is overcome by whisperings regarding the intention for prayer, such that Satan does not leave them until they form a sound intention. Rather, he confuses them until the congregational prayer is missed and the prayer falls outside its prescribed time. Even if they complete their opening *takbir*, there remains in their hearts hesitation about the validity of their intention. They may even be whispered to concerning the *takbir* to such an extent that, due to extreme precaution, they alter the very formula of the *takbir*. They do this at the beginning of the prayer, then become heedless throughout the rest of it, failing to bring presence of heart. They are deceived by this and imagine that if they have exhausted themselves in rectifying the intention at the prayer's start and have distinguished themselves from the common people by this effort and precaution, then they are in a state of goodness before their Lord.

Another group is dominated by whisperings concerning the articulation of the letters of the Opening Chapter and other remembrances from their proper points of articulation. Thus, they perpetually take excessive care in emphasizing letters, distinguishing between the *ḍād* and the *ẓā*, and correcting the points of articulation for letters throughout all their prayers. They pay no heed to anything else, nor do they reflect upon the meaning of the Quran, being heedless of its significance and admonition, and diverting understanding from its mysteries. This is among the ugliest forms of delusion, for creation has not been burdened in the recitation of the Quran with perfecting the points of articulation of letters except to the extent customary in their speech.

The example of these people is like one who carries a message to the council of a sultan and is commanded to deliver it properly. He begins to deliver the message, yet he fastidiously articulates the letters, repeats them, and reiterates them time after again, all the while being heedless of the message's purpose and observing the sanctity of the council. How deserving he is that discipline be imposed upon him, that he be returned to the abode of the insane, and that he be judged as lacking intellect.

"And another group" are deluded by the mere recitation of the Qur'an, rushing through it heedlessly, and perhaps they complete it once in a day and a night. The tongue of one of them flows with it while his heart wanders in the valleys of vain desires, for he does not reflect upon the meanings of the Qur'an to be admonished by its warnings, to take heed from its exhortations, to pause at its commands and prohibitions, and to derive lessons from its points of reflection—and other such purposes of recitation which we have mentioned in the Book of the Recitation of the Qur'an. Thus, he is deluded, thinking that the purpose of the Qur'an's revelation is merely to mumble it while being heedless of it.

And its example is that of a servant to whom his master and owner writes a letter, indicating within it commands and prohibitions, yet he does not direct his attention to understanding it and acting upon it, but rather confines himself to memorizing it. He thus persists in opposition to what his master has commanded him, except that he repeats the letter with his voice and melody a hundred times each day. He is deserving of punishment, and whatever he may think that this is what is intended from it, he is deluded. Indeed, its recitation is only desired so that he does not forget it after memorizing it, and its memorization is desired for its meaning, and its meaning is desired for acting upon it and benefiting from its significances. And he may have a pleasant voice, so he recites it and takes delight in it, and is deceived by his delight, thinking that this is the pleasure of intimate discourse with God Almighty and hearing His speech, when it is merely his pleasure in his own voice. Were he to repeat its melodies with poetry or other speech, he would take the same delight in it. Thus, he is deluded, for he has not examined his heart to know whether his pleasure with the speech of God Almighty is due to the beauty of its composition and meanings or due to his own voice.

Another group deluded themselves through fasting, at times fasting perpetually or observing the sacred days, yet within these practices they did not guard their tongues from backbiting, their thoughts from ostentation, their stomachs from the unlawful at the time of breaking fast, nor their tongues from idle chatter through various excesses the entire day. Despite this, he imagines goodness within himself, thus neglecting the obligatory duties and seeking the transmitted reports, yet he does not fulfill their right—and that is the utmost delusion.

Another group is deluded by the pilgrimage, setting out for Hajj without having extricated themselves from injustices, settled their debts, or sought the goodwill of their parents, nor having sought lawful provision. They may even do this after the obligation of Hajj has lapsed, neglecting prayer and obligatory duties along the way, failing to maintain purity of clothing and body, and exposing themselves to the extortion of oppressors until they are taken from. They do not guard against obscenity and quarreling on the journey. Perhaps some gather unlawful wealth and spend it on companions along the way, seeking reputation and ostentation—thus disobeying God Almighty first in acquiring the unlawful, and second in spending it with hypocrisy. They neither take it from its lawful source nor place it in its rightful use. Then they arrive at the Sacred House with a heart stained by vile morals and blameworthy traits, not having purified it before their arrival, yet despite this they imagine they are in a state of favor with their Lord. Truly, they are deceived.

And another group embarked upon the path of enjoining good and forbidding evil, censuring people and commanding them to righteousness while forgetting themselves. When they command them to good, they do so harshly, seeking leadership and prestige. Yet when they themselves commit a wrong and are reproached, they become angry and say, "I am the one who enjoins good—how dare you censure me?" They may gather people to their mosque, and if anyone is late, they speak harshly to them, for their aim is merely ostentation and leadership. If someone else were to take charge of maintaining the mosque, they would resent it. Indeed, among them are those who give the call to prayer, imagining they do so for God’s sake, but if another were to come and give the call in their absence, all hell would break loose, and they would say, "My right has been taken, and my position has been encroached upon." Likewise, one may assume the imamate of a mosque, thinking he is upon good, while his only aim is that it be said, "He is the imam of a mosque." If another were to precede him—even if more devout and knowledgeable—it would weigh heavily upon him.

And another group took up residence near Mecca or Medina, becoming deluded by Mecca, without guarding their hearts or purifying their outer and inner selves. Their hearts remain attached to their homelands, preoccupied with the talk of those who know them, that so-and-so is a resident there. You see him boasting, saying, "I have resided in Mecca for such-and-such years." When he hears that this is unbecoming, he abandons open boasting but still loves for people to know of it. Moreover, he may reside there while stretching the eye of his greed toward the tainted wealth of people. When he gathers something from that, he becomes miserly with it, withholding it—you would not hear of his soul giving a morsel in charity to a poor person. Thus, ostentation, miserliness, greed, and a host of destructive traits become manifest in him, from which he would have been far removed had he forsaken taking up residence. But the love of praise and being counted among the residents compelled him to reside there while being stained with these vices—he too is deluded. The full exposition of this is known only from the collective books of *Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din*, where the avenues of delusion in prayer are known from the Book of Prayer, in pilgrimage from the Book of Pilgrimage, and in charity, recitation, and other acts of devotion from the books we have arranged therein. The present aim is merely to point to the comprehensive themes previously covered in the books.

Another group renounced wealth and contented themselves with the basest of garments and food, and with mosques as their dwellings, imagining they had attained the rank of the ascetics. Yet they remained desirous of leadership and status, whether through knowledge, preaching, or mere asceticism. Thus they abandoned the lighter of two burdens and incurred the graver of two ruinous paths, for status is greater than wealth. Had they forsaken status and taken wealth, they would have been nearer to safety. Such a one is deluded, thinking himself among the world's ascetics while he has not grasped the meaning of the world, nor realized that its ultimate pleasure lies in leadership, and that whoever craves it inevitably becomes a hypocrite, envious, arrogant, ostentatious, and characterized by all vile traits. Indeed, he may even forsake leadership and prefer seclusion and solitude, yet still be deluded, for he thereby exalts himself over the wealthy, speaks harshly to them, looks upon them with contempt, hopes more for himself than for them, admires his own deeds, and is marked by a host of heart's corruptions without knowing it. Perhaps he is offered wealth but does not take it, fearing it be said his asceticism is void; even if told, "It is lawful—take it openly and give it away secretly," his soul would not permit it, dreading people's blame. Thus he yearns for people's praise, which is among the sweetest gates of the world, while seeing himself as an ascetic from the world—deluded indeed. Moreover, he may not be free from honoring the wealthy, preferring them over the poor, leaning toward those devoted to him and praising him, and shunning those inclined to other ascetics. All of this is deception and delusion from Satan—we seek refuge in God from it.

Among the worshippers are those who strain themselves in bodily acts of devotion, praying, for example, a thousand rak'ahs a day and night, and completing the Qur'an, yet throughout all this it never occurs to them to attend to the heart, to examine it, and purify it from ostentation, arrogance, self-admiration, and other ruinous traits. They do not know that this is ruinous; or if they know, they do not suspect it of themselves; or if they suspect it, they imagine they are forgiven for their outward deeds and not held accountable for the heart's states; or if they imagine, they think outward acts of worship tip the scale of their good deeds—far from it! A speck from one who is God-fearing and a single trait of the wise is better than mountains of bodily acts. Then, this deluded one—with his bad character toward people, his harshness, and his polluted inner self—is not free from ostentation and love of praise. If told, "You are among the earth's pegs and the friends and beloved of God," the deluded rejoices, believes it, and is further deluded, thinking people's praise of him is proof of God's pleasure, not knowing it is due to people's ignorance of the corruptions within him.

And another group is zealous for supererogatory acts while not greatly esteeming the obligatory duties. You see one of them rejoicing in the forenoon prayer and the night prayer and similar supererogatory acts, yet he finds no delight in the obligatory prayer, nor does his eagerness intensify to hasten to it at the beginning of its time. He forgets His saying—as He relates from His Lord—"The worshippers draw not near to Me with anything like the performance of what I have made obligatory upon them." And neglecting the proper ordering among good deeds is among the sum of evils. Nay, two obligatory duties may confront a person: one of them may be missed, and the other may not be missed; or two meritorious acts: one whose time is constricted and the other whose time is ample. If he does not observe the proper order in them, he is deluded. Similar examples are too numerous to count, for sin is manifest and obedience is manifest; what is obscure is giving precedence to some acts of obedience over others, such as giving precedence to all obligatory duties over supererogatory acts, giving precedence to individual obligations over communal obligations, giving precedence to a communal obligation that no one is fulfilling over one that others are already fulfilling, giving precedence to the more important of the individual obligations over what is lesser than it, and giving precedence to what may be missed over what may not be missed. This is just as it is obligatory to give precedence to the need of the mother over the need of the father, when the Messenger of God was asked, and it was said to him, "Whom should I honor, O Messenger of God?" He said, "Your mother." He said, "Then whom?" He said, "Your mother." He said, "Then whom?" He said, "Your mother." He said, "Then whom?" He said, "Your father." He said, "Then whom?" He said, "The next nearest, then the next nearest." Thus, one should begin in maintaining ties with the closest relative; if they are equal, then with the needier; if they are equal, then with the more pious and devout. Likewise, one whose wealth does not suffice for the expenses of his parents and the pilgrimage may perform the pilgrimage while being deluded; rather, he should give precedence to their right over the pilgrimage, and this is from giving precedence to a more important obligation over an obligation that is lesser than it. Similarly, if a servant has an appointment and the time for the Friday prayer enters, the Friday prayer takes precedence, and busying oneself with fulfilling the promise is a sin, even though it is in itself an act of obedience. Likewise, impurity may soil his garment, and he then speaks harshly to his parents and his family because of it; the impurity is to be avoided, and harming them is to be avoided, but caution against harm is more important than caution against impurity. Examples of confronting prohibitions and acts of obedience are innumerable. Whoever neglects the proper order in all of that is deluded. This is a delusion of the utmost obscurity, because the deluded one therein is in a state of obedience, except that he is not aware that the act of obedience becomes a sin when he neglects by means of it a necessary obedience that is more important than it. Among its categories is busying oneself with legal schools and juristic disagreement, in the case of one upon whom remains preoccupation with acts of obedience and manifest and hidden sins related to the limbs and related to the heart, because the aim of jurisprudence is to know what others need in their affairs. Knowing what he himself needs for his heart is more incumbent upon him, except that love of leadership, status, the pleasure of boasting, overcoming peers, and surpassing them blinds him until he is deluded concerning himself and thinks he is busied thereby with his religion.

The third category: the Sufis, and how prevalent delusion is among them, and the deluded among them are many groups.

So they diverged, and they are the Sufis of this age, except whom God has protected. They were deceived by the attire and outward form and speech, so they aided the truthful among the Sufis in their dress and their appearance, and in their expressions, and in their manners and their customs and their terminology, and in their outward states during audition and dancing and purification and prayer, and in sitting upon the prayer mats with bowed heads and tucking them into the collar as if in contemplation, and in sighing deeply, and in lowering the voice in speech, and other such traits and postures. When they forced themselves into these matters and imitated them in them, they thought that they too were Sufis, yet they never wearied themselves at all in spiritual struggle and discipline, and in watching over the heart, and in purifying the inner and outer from hidden and manifest sins—all of which are among the first stations of Sufism. Even if they had completed all of that, would it have been permissible for them to count themselves among the Sufis? How could it be, when they never circled around it nor imposed upon themselves anything from it? Rather, they greedily pounce upon the forbidden and the dubious matters and the wealth of rulers, and they compete for a loaf of bread and a coin and a grain, and they envy one another over the smallest trifle, and some of them tear down the honor of others whenever one opposes them in any of their desires. Their deception is evident, and their example is like that of an old woman who heard that the brave and heroic warriors among the fighters have their names recorded in the register, and a province of the kingdom is allotted to each of them. Her soul yearned for a kingdom to be allotted to her, so she put on a coat of mail and placed a helmet on her head, and she learned some verses from the battle-chants of the heroes, and she accustomed herself to reciting those verses with their melodies until it became easy for her, and she learned how they swagger in the arena and how they move their hands, and she imitated all their traits in dress and speech and movements and stillness. Then she headed to the military camp to have her name recorded in the register of the brave. When she reached the camp, she was sent to the review office, and it was ordered that she be stripped of the helmet and coat of mail to see what was beneath them and be tested in single combat with some of the brave to ascertain the extent of her effort in bravery. When she was stripped of the helmet and coat of mail, behold, she was a weak, frail old woman, unable to bear the weight of the coat of mail and helmet! It was said to her: "Have you come to mock the king and to belittle the people of his court and to deceive them? Take her and cast her before the elephant for her foolishness!" So she was thrown to the elephant. Thus will be the state of those who claim Sufism on the Day of Resurrection when the covering is removed from them and they are presented before the Supreme Judge, who does not look at the attire and the patched garment, but at the heart.

Another group surpassed these in delusion, finding it burdensome to emulate them in the simplicity of garments and contentment with the modest. They wished to display Sufism outwardly but saw no alternative except to adorn themselves with their attire. Thus, they abandoned silk and brocade, yet sought precious patched garments, delicate shawls, and dyed carpets, wearing clothes of higher value than silk and brocade. Each among them imagined himself a Sufi merely by the color of the garment and its patched nature, forgetting that they dyed their clothes only to avoid frequent washing to remove filth, and wore patches because their garments were torn, so they mended them rather than wearing new ones. As for tearing delicate shawls piece by piece and sewing patches from them—how does this resemble what they were accustomed to? These exhibit greater folly than all the deluded, for they indulge in precious garments and delicious foods, seek luxurious living, consume the wealth of rulers, and do not avoid apparent sins, let alone hidden ones, all while imagining themselves virtuous. Their harm extends to others, as those who follow them are destroyed, and those who do not follow them have their faith corrupted regarding all Sufis, thinking that all who gather are of their kind, thus speaking ill of the sincere among them. All this stems from the misfortune and evil of the pretenders.

And another faction claimed knowledge of divine gnosis, witnessing the Truth, transcending spiritual stations and states, and abiding in the very essence of witnessing and attaining proximity. Yet they know these matters only by names and expressions, for they have snatched phrases from the utterances of absurdities and repeat them, imagining this to be superior to the knowledge of the ancients and the later ones. Thus they look upon the jurists, exegetes, traditionists, and all categories of scholars with a contemptuous eye, let alone the common folk, to the extent that a farmer abandons his farming and a weaver forsakes his weaving to accompany them for a few days, snatching from them those counterfeit phrases and repeating them as if speaking from revelation and disclosing the secret of secrets. Thereby they belittle all worshippers and scholars, saying of the worshippers that they are toiling hirelings, and saying of the scholars that they are veiled from God by narrations. They claim for themselves that they are those who have reached the Truth and are among the intimate ones, while before God they are among the wicked hypocrites, and in the eyes of the possessors of hearts they are among the foolish ignoramuses, having never mastered any knowledge, refined any character, ordered any practice, nor watched over any heart—except in following caprice, snatching delirium, and memorizing it.

And another faction fell into permissiveness, folded up the carpet of the Sacred Law, rejected its rulings, and equated the lawful with the unlawful. Among them are those who claim, 'God is independent of my deeds, so why should I weary myself?' Others say, 'People have been charged with purifying their hearts from desires and love of this world, and that is impossible, for they have been charged with what cannot be done. Only one who has not tried it is deceived by this, but as for us, we have tried and realized it is impossible.' The fool does not know that people have not been charged with uprooting desire and anger from their very roots, but rather with uprooting their substance such that each of them submits to the rule of intellect and the Sacred Law. Others say, 'Deeds of the limbs carry no weight; the only consideration is for the hearts, and our hearts are devoted in love of God and connected to the knowledge of God. We merely navigate the world with our bodies, while our hearts are steadfast in the presence of the Divine Lordship. Thus, we are with desires in appearance, not in our hearts.' They claim they have ascended beyond the rank of the common people and have no need for disciplining the soul through bodily deeds, and that desires do not divert them from the path of God due to their strength within them. They even raise the rank of their own souls above the rank of the Prophets—upon them be prayers and peace—for a single sin would divert the Prophets from the path of God, causing them to weep over it and lament for years on end. The varieties of delusion among the people of permissiveness who imitate the Sufis are countless, and all of this is built upon fallacies and whisperings with which Satan deceives them, due to their engaging in spiritual struggle before firmly establishing knowledge and without following a proficient, righteous master in religion and knowledge, fit to be emulated. To enumerate all their types would be lengthy.

Another group exceeded the bounds of these people, shunned works, divorced the lawful, and busied themselves with scrutinizing the heart. One among them would claim stations such as asceticism, reliance, contentment, and love without grasping the realities, conditions, signs, and pitfalls of these stations. Among them are those who claim ecstasy and love for God Almighty, asserting they are infatuated with God, while perhaps imagining notions about God that are innovation or disbelief. They profess love for God before knowing Him, yet they are not free from committing what God dislikes, preferring their own desires over God's command, and abandoning certain matters out of shame before creation—whereas if alone, they would not abandon them out of shame before God Almighty. They do not realize that all this contradicts love. Some may incline toward contentment and reliance, venturing into deserts without provisions to validate their claim of reliance, unaware that this is an innovation not transmitted from the predecessors and Companions, who were more knowledgeable about reliance than they. They did not understand reliance as risking the soul and abandoning provisions; rather, they took provisions while relying on God Almighty, not on the provisions. This person may abandon provisions while relying on some cause, trusting in it. There is no station among the salvific stations without its delusion, and a people have been deluded by it. We have mentioned the entrances of pitfalls in the Quarter of Salvations in the book, so it is not possible to repeat them here.

Another group constrained themselves excessively regarding sustenance, seeking only that which is purely lawful, while neglecting the vigilance of the heart and limbs in all other matters. Among them are those who disregard the lawful in their food, clothing, and dwelling, yet delve deeply into other aspects. The poor soul does not know that God, exalted is He, is not pleased with a servant merely for seeking the lawful, nor is He pleased with other works if the lawful is not sought. Rather, He is only pleased by vigilance over all acts of obedience and sins. Whoever thinks that some of these matters suffice and save him is deluded.

Another group claimed to possess good character, humility, and forbearance, so they presented themselves to serve the Sufis. They gathered people and strained themselves to serve them, adopting this for leadership and amassing wealth. Yet their true aim was arrogance. They display service and humility while their intent is elevation; they manifest that their purpose is benevolence while their goal is to gain followers; they show that their aim is service and subservience, yet they collect from the unlawful and dubious sources and spend on them to multiply their followers and spread their name through service. Some of them take money from rulers to spend on them, and some take it to spend on the Sufis along the pilgrimage route, claiming their purpose is righteousness and charity, while the motive of all of them is ostentation and reputation. The sign of this is their neglect of all the commands of God Almighty, outwardly and inwardly, and their contentment with taking the unlawful and spending from it. An example of one who spends unlawful wealth on the pilgrimage route intending good is like one who builds mosques for God and plasters them with filth, while claiming his intention is construction.

Another group devoted themselves to spiritual struggle, refining character, and purifying the soul from its flaws. They delved deeply into this, making the investigation of the soul's defects and the recognition of its deceptions a science and a craft. In all their states, they remain occupied with scrutinizing the soul's faults and extracting subtle discourse concerning its maladies. They say: "This in the soul is a flaw, and heedlessness of it being a flaw is a flaw, and the very attention to it being a flaw is a flaw." They become engrossed in a chain of such statements, wasting time in their contrivance. Whoever spends his entire life investigating the soul's defects while prohibiting the knowledge of their remedy is like one who busies himself with investigating the obstacles and perils of the pilgrimage but never sets out on the path to Hajj; that will avail him nothing.

Another group transcended this stage and began traversing the path, where the gates of spiritual knowledge opened to them. Whenever they caught a scent from the beginnings of this knowledge, they marveled at it, rejoiced in it, and were captivated by its strangeness. Thus, their hearts became bound to turning toward it and contemplating it, and pondering how its door had opened to them while remaining closed to others. Yet all of this is a delusion, for the wonders of God’s path have no end. If one were to halt at every marvel and become bound by it, his steps would fall short and he would be deprived of reaching the intended goal. His likeness is that of one who set out to meet a king and saw at the entrance to his courtyard a garden containing flowers and lights the like of which he had never seen before. He stopped to gaze upon it and marvel until the time in which he could have met the king had passed.

And another group surpassed these and did not turn their attention to the lights that overflow upon them on the path, nor to the abundant gifts made easy for them, nor did they tarry in rejoicing over them or turning toward them, striving earnestly in their journey until they drew near and reached the boundary of proximity to God Almighty. They thought they had reached God, so they stopped and erred, for God Almighty has seventy veils of light; the wayfarer does not reach a veil from those veils on the path without thinking that he has arrived. This is alluded to in the saying of Abraham, peace be upon him, when God Almighty reported about him: "When night covered him, he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord.'" The meaning is not these luminous bodies, for he used to see them in his youth and knew they were not gods, as they are many and not one, and even the ignorant know a star is not a god. One like Abraham, peace be upon him, would not be deceived by a star that does not deceive the common folk. Rather, what is intended is that it is a light from the lights that are among the veils of God, Glorious and Exalted, and they lie upon the path of the wayfarers. One cannot conceive of reaching God Almighty except by reaching these veils, which are veils of light, some greater than others. The smallest of these luminaries is the star, so its term is borrowed for it, and the greatest is the sun, and between them is the rank of the moon. Abraham, peace be upon him, when he saw the dominion of the heavens—as God Almighty said, "Thus did We show Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth"—kept reaching light after light, and it would appear to him at first that he had arrived. Then it would be unveiled to him that beyond it was something else, so he would ascend to it and say, "I have reached," until it was unveiled to him what lay beyond, until he reached the nearest veil beyond which there is no arrival. He said, "This is greater." When it became clear to him that despite its greatness, it was not free from setting, in the lowliness of deficiency and decline from the peak of perfection, he said, "I do not love those that set"—until he said—"I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth." The wayfarer on this path may be deceived into stopping at some of these veils, and he may be deceived by the first veil. The first veil between God and the servant is his own self, for it too is a divine matter and a light from the lights of God Almighty—I mean the secret of the heart in which the reality of the Truth in its entirety is manifested, such that it expands to encompass the whole world and surrounds it, and the form of everything is manifested within it. At that point, its light shines with a great radiance, for all of existence appears within it as it truly is. Yet, at first, it is veiled by a niche that acts as a screen for it. When its light is manifested and the beauty of the heart is unveiled after the light of God shines upon it, perhaps the possessor of the heart will turn to the heart and see from its surpassing beauty what bewilders him. In this bewilderment, his tongue may slip, and he says, "I am the Truth." If what lies beyond that is not made clear to him, he is deceived by it, stops at it, and perishes. He would have been deceived by a small star from the lights of the Divine Presence and had not yet reached the moon, let alone the sun. Thus, he is deluded, and this is the place of confusion, for the manifested becomes confused with that in which it is manifested, just as the color of what appears in a mirror is confused and thought to be the color of the mirror, and just as what is in the glass is confused with the glass, as it has been said:

The wine became thin, and the glass became thin, so they resembled one another.
The matter became so that it was as if it were wine and as if it were a cup,
Yet there is no cup and no wine.

And with this eye, the Christians looked upon the Messiah and saw the radiance of God's light shimmering within him, so they erred concerning him. They are like one who sees a star in a mirror or in water and imagines that the star is within the mirror or the water, so he stretches out his hand to take it, being deluded. The types of delusion on the path of spiritual wayfaring to God, exalted is He, cannot be enumerated in volumes nor exhaustively detailed except after explaining all the sciences of spiritual unveiling, and that is something for which there is no license to mention. Perhaps even the amount we have mentioned was also more fitting to be withheld, for the paths of this way do not require one to hear of it from another. He who has not traversed it derives no benefit from hearing of it; indeed, he may even be harmed by it, for it bequeaths to him a bewilderment from hearing what he does not comprehend. Yet there is a benefit in it, which is to extract him from the delusion in which he is immersed. Indeed, it may perhaps lead him to believe that the matter is greater than what he supposes and what his limited mind imagines, his deficient fancy conceives, and his adorned argumentation constructs. He may also believe what is narrated to him of the spiritual unveilings reported by the friends of God. And due to the greatness of his delusion, he may perhaps persist in disbelieving what he hears now, just as he disbelieved what he heard before.

The fourth category: possessors of wealth; among the deluded among them are divisions. One group among them is eager to build mosques, schools, hospices, and bridges—things that appear to all people—and they inscribe their names upon them in brick so that their mention may be immortalized and their trace may remain after death. They imagine that they have thereby deserved forgiveness. Yet they are deluded in this from two aspects:

One category is those who build them from wealth acquired through oppression, plunder, bribes, and illicit sources. They have already incurred God's displeasure in acquiring it and incur His displeasure in spending it. The obligation upon them was to refrain from acquiring it; thus, they have disobeyed God by acquiring it. The duty incumbent upon them is repentance, turning back to God, and restoring it to its rightful owners—either in its original form or, if unable, by returning its equivalent. If they are unable to locate the owners, the obligation is to restore it to the heirs. If the wronged person leaves no heir, the duty is to allocate it to the most essential public interests, and perhaps the most essential is distributing it among the poor. Yet they do not do this, fearing it may become publicly known. Instead, they construct buildings with baked bricks, their aim in building being ostentation and attracting praise, and their desire for its permanence is for the permanence of their names inscribed upon it, not for the permanence of good.

The second aspect is that they imagine themselves to possess sincerity and good intention in spending on buildings. Yet if one of them were asked to spend a dinar without having his name inscribed upon the place on which he spent, it would weigh heavily upon him and his soul would not consent to it—though God is fully aware of him, whether his name is recorded or not. And were it not that he desires the countenance of people rather than the countenance of God, he would have no need for such a thing.

Another group may have acquired wealth lawfully and spent it on mosques, yet they too are deluded in two respects: first, through ostentation and seeking praise, for perhaps there are poor people in their vicinity or locality, and directing wealth to them is more essential, superior, and more fitting than spending on constructing and adorning mosques. They find it easier to spend on mosques only so that it may become conspicuous among people.

The second aspect is that it diverts attention to adorning mosques with embellishments and decorations that are prohibited, which distract the hearts of worshippers and captivate their gazes. The intended purpose of prayer is humility and presence of heart, yet this corrupts the hearts of those praying and nullifies their reward. The burden of all this returns to him, while he is deluded by it, considering it among good deeds and viewing it as a means to draw nearer to God Almighty. Yet, in doing so, he exposes himself to the wrath of God, all the while believing he is obedient and fulfilling His command. He has disturbed the hearts of God's servants with the adornments he added to the mosque, perhaps even enticing them toward worldly embellishments, so they desire similar decorations in their own homes and become preoccupied with seeking them. The burden of all this rests upon his neck, for the mosque is meant for humility and presence of heart with God Almighty. Malik ibn Dinar narrated: Two men came to a mosque, and one stood at the door and said, "One like me does not enter the house of God." The two angels recorded him before God as a truthful believer. Thus should mosques be honored: by viewing the soiling of the mosque through one's own entry as a transgression against it, not by considering the soiling of the mosque with unlawful things or worldly adornments as a favor to God Almighty. The disciples said to Jesus, peace be upon him, "Look at this mosque, how beautiful it is!" He replied, "My people, my people—I swear to you, God will not leave a single stone standing upon another in this mosque but will destroy it due to the sins of its people. For God cares not for gold and silver, nor for these stones that amaze you. Indeed, the most beloved thing to God Almighty is righteous hearts; through them God builds up the earth, and through them He lays waste when they are otherwise." And Abu al-Darda reported that the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "When you adorn your mosques and embellish your Qur'ans, destruction is upon you." And al-Hasan said, "When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, intended to build the mosque of Medina, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to him and said, 'Build it seven cubits in height toward the sky, and do not adorn it or engrave it.'" Thus, the delusion of such a person lies in seeing what is reprehensible and relying upon it.

Another group spends their wealth in charity upon the poor and needy, seeking thereby large gatherings. Among the poor are those accustomed to gratitude and publicizing kindness, and they dislike giving in secret. They consider concealing the recipient of their charity as an offense against them and ingratitude. They may even strive to spend their wealth on pilgrimage, performing Hajj repeatedly, while perhaps leaving their neighbors hungry. For this reason, Ibn Mas'ud said: In the latter days, pilgrims will multiply without cause; travel will become easy for them, provision will be expanded for them, yet they will return deprived and stripped. One of them will be thrown by his camel amidst the sands and deserts while his neighbor is imprisoned beside him, and he does not support him. Abu Nasr al-Tammar said: A man came to bid farewell to Bishr ibn al-Harith and said, "I have resolved to perform Hajj; do you command me with something?" He asked him, "How much have you prepared for expenses?" He replied, "Two thousand dirhams." Bishr said, "What do you seek through your Hajj? Asceticism, longing for the House, or seeking God's pleasure?" He said, "Seeking God's pleasure." Bishr said, "If you were to attain God's pleasure while in your home, spending two thousand dirhams, and be certain of God's pleasure, would you do that?" He said, "Yes." Bishr said, "Go and give it to ten persons: a debtor to settle his debt, a poor person to mend his dishevelment, a provider to enrich his family, an orphan's guardian to gladden him. And if your heart is strong enough to give it to one person, then do so. For bringing joy to a Muslim's heart, relieving the distressed, removing harm, and aiding the weak is better than a hundred pilgrimages after the obligatory Hajj. Rise and distribute it as we have commanded you; otherwise, tell us what is in your heart." He said, "O Abu Nasr, my journey is stronger in my heart." Bishr, may God have mercy on him, smiled, turned to him and said, "Wealth, when accumulated from the filth of transactions and ambiguities, compels the soul to fulfill its desire with it, so it displays righteous deeds. But God has sworn by Himself not to accept except the deeds of the pious."

Another group among the wealthy are preoccupied with preserving and withholding their wealth due to miserliness, then they occupy themselves with bodily acts of worship that require no expenditure, such as fasting the day, praying the night, and completing the Qur'an. They are deluded, for the destructive miserliness has seized their innermost selves, which needs to be suppressed by giving wealth. Thus, they are busy pursuing virtues they can do without. Its example is like one into whose garment a snake has entered and he is on the verge of destruction, yet he is occupied with cooking oxymel to calm his bile. When the snake kills him, what need has he for oxymel? Therefore, it was said to Bishr, "So-and-so the rich man fasts and prays much." He said, "The poor man has abandoned his own state and entered the state of another. This man's proper state is feeding the hungry and spending on the needy. That is better for him than starving himself, than praying for himself, than amassing worldly wealth and withholding from the poor."

Another group is overcome by miserliness, so their souls permit only the payment of zakah. Then they give out from the vile, inferior wealth that they themselves disdain, and they seek from the poor those who will serve them and attend to their needs, or someone they may need in the future for employing in service, or someone in whom they have some general interest. Or they give it to someone supported by one of the notables, relying on his prestige, to gain status with him so that he may fulfill their needs. All of this corrupts the intention and nullifies the deed, and its practitioner is deluded. He thinks he is obeying God Almighty while he is wicked, for he seeks through worship of God a recompense from other than Him. This and its like among the delusions of the wealthy are countless; we have only mentioned this amount to alert to the categories of delusion.

Another group among the common folk, the wealthy, and the poor have been deluded by merely attending gatherings of remembrance. They believe that this suffices and is enough for them, and they have made it a habit. They imagine that for simply listening to admonition—without acting upon it or taking heed—they will receive a reward. Yet they are deceived, for the virtue of a remembrance gathering lies in its spurring one toward good; if it does not stir up longing, there is no good in it. And longing is praiseworthy because it impels one to action; if it is too weak to compel, then there is no good in it. That which is intended for something else, if it falls short of delivering to that other, has no value. Perhaps one is deceived by what he hears from the preacher about the merit of attending the gathering and the merit of weeping, and perhaps a tenderness enters him like the tenderness of women, so he weeps but has no resolve. Perhaps he hears fearful words and does no more than clap his hands and say, “O safety, save us!” or “We seek refuge in God!” or “Glory be to God!” and he thinks he has accomplished all good—yet he is deluded. His likeness is that of a sick person who attends the assemblies of physicians and hears what is said, or a hungry person in whose presence someone describes delicious, appetizing foods and then departs. That does not avail him against his sickness or his hunger in the least. Likewise, hearing descriptions of acts of obedience without performing them avails nothing before God. Thus, any admonition that does not alter in you a quality that changes your deeds—so that you turn to God Almighty with a strong or weak turning and turn away from the world—that admonition becomes an added proof against you. If you regard it as a means for yourself, you are deluded.

If you ask: "What you have mentioned regarding the entrances of self-deception is a matter from which no one can escape, nor is it possible to guard against. This leads to despair, since no human being has the strength to be cautious of the hidden aspects of these calamities?"
I say: When a person's aspiration is divided regarding something, he manifests despair concerning it, considers the matter immense, and perceives the path as rugged. But when his desire is sound, he is guided to stratagems and deduces, through subtle discernment, the hidden ways of attaining the objective. Indeed, if a person wishes to lure down a bird soaring in the sky's expanse, despite its distance, he lures it down. If he wishes to extract a fish from the ocean's depths, he extracts it. If he wishes to extract gold or silver from beneath mountains, he extracts it. If he wishes to hunt wild beasts roaming the plains and deserts, he hunts them. If he wishes to tame predators, elephants, and great animals, he tames them. If he wishes to take snakes and vipers and play with them, he takes them and extracts the antidote from their bellies. If he wishes to produce colored, patterned brocade from mulberry leaves, he produces it. If he wishes to know the measures, lengths, and widths of the stars, he deduces that through subtle geometry while remaining settled on the earth. All of this is through deducing stratagems and preparing instruments. Thus, he subjugated the horse for riding, the dog for hunting, and the falcon for capturing birds; he prepared the net for catching fish, and so on, among the subtle stratagems of mankind. All of this is because his concern is the affair of his worldly life, and that aids him in his worldly life. So if his concern were the affair of his Hereafter, he would have but a single occupation: rectifying his heart. Yet he falters in rectifying his heart and holds back, saying, "This is impossible, and who is capable of it?" But it is not impossible if his aspiration becomes this single concern. Rather, it is as the saying goes: "If your desire were sound, you would be guided to stratagems." This is something the righteous predecessors and those who followed them in goodness did not fail to achieve. So neither will one fail to achieve it if his intention is sincere and his aspiration strong. Indeed, it does not require a tenth of the toil people expend in deducing worldly stratagems and arranging their means.

If you say: You have simplified the matter, yet you have extensively discussed the entrances of delusion—so how does the servant escape from delusion? Know that he escapes it through three things: through action, knowledge, and realization. These three matters are indispensable. As for intellect: I mean by it the innate disposition and the primordial light by which a person perceives the realities of things. Thus, acumen and sharpness are innate, while foolishness and dullness are innate; and the dull-witted is incapable of guarding against delusion. Therefore, clarity of intellect and keenness of understanding are essential in the original disposition. If a person is not created with this, its acquisition is impossible. Indeed, if its foundation is present, it can be strengthened through practice. The foundation of all felicities is intellect and wisdom. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "Blessed is God, who has apportioned intellect among His servants in diverse measures. Verily, two men may be equal in their deeds, their righteousness, their fasting, and their prayer, yet they differ in intellect as a speck compared to a mountain, and God has not apportioned to His creation a portion better than intellect and certainty." And from Abu al-Darda’, it was said: "O Messenger of God, what do you think of a man who fasts the day, prays the night, performs Hajj and Umrah, gives charity, fights in the path of God, visits the sick, follows funeral processions, and assists the weak, yet does not know his station with God on the Day of Resurrection?" The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "He is only rewarded according to the measure of his intellect." And Anas said: "A man was praised in the presence of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and they spoke well of him. The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: 'How is his intellect?' They said: 'O Messenger of God, we speak of his worship, his virtue, and his character.' He said: 'How is his intellect? For the fool, through his foolishness, incurs greater harm than the transgression of the transgressor. Indeed, people will be brought near on the Day of Resurrection according to the measure of their intellects.'" And Abu al-Darda’ said: "When the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, was informed of a man’s intense worship, he would ask about his intellect. If they said it was good, he would say: 'I have hope for him.' And if they said otherwise, he would say: 'He will not attain.'" And when intense worship of a man was mentioned to him, he said: "How is his intellect?" They said: "It is nothing." He said: "Your companion will not reach where you suppose." Thus, intelligence is sound, and the instinct of intellect is a blessing from God, exalted is He, in the original disposition. If it is lost due to dullness and foolishness, there is no remedy for it.

The second is knowledge; by knowledge I mean knowing four matters: knowing oneself, knowing one's Lord, knowing this world, and knowing the Hereafter. He knows himself through servitude and lowliness, and by being a stranger in this world and alien to these bestial desires. What is naturally agreeable to him is solely knowing God Most High and gazing upon His Countenance. Thus, it is inconceivable that one could know this without knowing himself and knowing his Lord. Let him seek assistance in this from what we have mentioned in the Book of Love, the Book Explaining the Marvels of the Heart, the Book of Reflection, and the Book of Gratitude, for within them are indications describing the soul and describing the majesty of God. Through them, one is alerted to the totality and the perfection of knowledge lies beyond it, for this is from the sciences of unveiling, and we have not elaborated in this book except in the sciences of spiritual practice. As for knowing this world and the Hereafter, let him seek assistance from what we have mentioned in the Book of Censure of the World and the Book of Remembrance of Death, so it becomes clear to him that the world bears no relation to the Hereafter. When he knows himself and his Lord, and knows the world and the Hereafter, there arises from his heart, through knowledge of God, love for God; through knowledge of the Hereafter, intense longing for it; and through knowledge of the world, aversion from it. His most important concern becomes that which brings him to God Most High and benefits him in the Hereafter. When this will dominates his heart, his intention becomes sound in all matters. For example, if he eats or attends to a need, his aim in it is to seek assistance for traversing the path of the Hereafter. His intention becomes sound, and every delusion is repelled from him whose origin is the conflict of aims and the inclination toward the world, status, and wealth, for that is what corrupts intention. As long as the world is more beloved to him than the Hereafter and the desire of his self is more beloved to him than the pleasure of God Most High, he cannot be freed from delusion.

When love of God prevails in the heart through knowledge of God and of the self—issuing from the perfection of one’s intellect—then one needs the third meaning, which is knowledge: I mean the knowledge of how to tread the path to God, knowledge of what draws one near to God and what distances one from Him, and knowledge of the perils, obstacles, and pitfalls of the path. All of this we have deposited in the books of the Revival of the Religious Sciences. Thus, from the quarter of devotions one learns their conditions and observes them, and learns their defects and guards against them. From the quarter of customs one learns the secrets of livelihood and what is indispensable therein, taking it up with the decorum of the Sacred Law, and what is superfluous, turning away from it. From the quarter of the destructive traits one learns all the obstacles that block the way to God—for what bars one from God are the blameworthy qualities in character—so one learns what is blameworthy and learns the method of its remedy. And from the quarter of the saving traits one learns the praiseworthy qualities that must necessarily replace the blameworthy ones after their eradication. When one comprehends all of this, it becomes possible to beware of the types of delusion we have mentioned. The root of all this is that love of God prevails over the heart and love of the world falls away from it, so that resolve is strengthened and intention is purified. This is not attained except through the knowledge we have mentioned.

If you ask: When one has done all that, what remains to be feared for him? I say: What is feared for him is that Satan may deceive him and call him to sincere counsel for the creation, or to spreading knowledge and inviting people to what he has come to know of God's religion. For when the sincere seeker has finished refining his self and his character, and has watched over his heart until he purified it from all disturbances and became established upon the Straight Path, and the world became small in his eyes so he abandoned it, and his hope in creation was severed so he paid them no heed, and nothing remained but a single concern—God Almighty—and the delight in His remembrance and intimate discourse, and the longing for meeting Him; and when Satan became incapable of tempting him from the side of the world and the appetites of the self, so he does not obey him, then Satan comes to him from the side of religion and calls him to have mercy upon God's creation, to feel compassion for their religion, to give them sincere counsel, and to call them to God. The servant then looks with his mercy upon the servants and sees them bewildered in their affair, intoxicated in their religion, deaf and blind. The malady has taken hold of them while they are unaware; they have lost the physician and stand on the brink of ruin. Compassion for them overcomes his heart, and he possesses the true knowledge of what would guide them, expose their misguidance, and direct them to their felicity, and he is capable of mentioning it without hardship, cost, or incurring loss. His likeness is that of a man afflicted with a severe, unbearable pain, who because of it would stay awake at night and be restless by day, neither eating, drinking, moving, nor acting due to the intensity of the throbbing pain. Then he found for it a remedy, pure and clear, without price, hardship, or bitterness in taking it. He used it and was cured and recovered. His sleep became pleasant at night after long wakefulness, he found calm by day after severe restlessness, his life became pleasant after extreme distress, and he attained the delight of well-being after prolonged sickness. Then he looked upon a great multitude of Muslims and saw that very same affliction in them. Their wakefulness had been prolonged, their restlessness intensified, and their groaning had risen to the heavens. He remembered that their remedy is what he knows, and he is capable of healing them in the easiest manner and most hopeful time. Mercy and pity seized him, and he found no room within himself to delay from busying himself with their treatment. Likewise, the sincere servant, after he has been guided to the path and healed from the diseases of the hearts, witnesses the creation whose hearts are diseased, whose ailment is severe, whose destruction is near, and whose cure is possible. Their remedy becomes easy for him, so from his very essence a firm resolve surges to busy himself with giving them sincere counsel. And Satan urges him to that, hoping to find an opening for temptation. When he busied himself with that, Satan found an opening for temptation and called him to leadership with a call more hidden than the creeping of an ant, which the seeker does not perceive. That creeping did not cease in his heart until it called him to affectation and adorning himself before the creation by beautifying his words, tones, movements, and affectation in dress and appearance. The people then turned to him, magnifying, honoring, and revering him with a reverence exceeding that given to kings, for they saw him as a healer of their ailments out of pure compassion and mercy, without any covetousness. So he became dearer to them than their fathers, mothers, and relatives. They preferred him with their bodies and wealth, and they became for him like chattel, as slaves and servants. They served him, gave him precedence in gatherings, and made his judgment superior to that of kings and sultans. At that point, the innate disposition spreads, the soul finds comfort, and it tastes a delight—what a delight!—attaining from the world a desire beside which every other desire is deemed trivial. Thus, he who had abandoned the world fell into its greatest pleasures. At that point, Satan found an opportunity and extended his hand to his heart, employing him in all that preserves for him that pleasure. The sign of the spreading of the innate disposition and the soul's inclining to Satan is that if someone opposes him in front of the creation, he becomes angry. If he reproaches himself for the anger he finds, Satan hastens to delude him that this is anger for God's sake, because if the seekers do not hold a good opinion of him, they will be cut off from God's path—thus he falls into delusion. This may lead him to disparaging the one who opposed him, and he falls into the forbidden backbiting after having left the vast expanse of the permissible. And he falls into pride, which is rebellion against accepting the truth and being grateful for it, after having been wary of sudden, dangerous thoughts. Likewise, it may lead to his laughing prematurely or slackening in some of his litanies, and his soul fears that this may become known and his acceptance may fall, so he follows that with seeking forgiveness and sighing. Perhaps he increases in works and litanies for that reason, and Satan deludes him: "You only do this so their opinion of you does not weaken regarding the path of God, lest they abandon the path by abandoning you." But that is deception and delusion; rather, it is the soul's fear of losing leadership. That is why his soul does not fear people becoming aware of such things from his peers; indeed, he may love that and rejoice in it. But if it appeared from one of his peers that hearts inclined to accept him and the effect of his speech in acceptance increased over his own speech, that would grieve him. Were it not that the soul had rejoiced and found pleasure in leadership, he would have welcomed that. His example is that of a man who sees a group of his brothers fallen into a well, its head covered by a large stone, so they are unable to ascend from the well because of it. His heart is moved with pity for his brothers, so he comes to lift the stone from the well's head, but it is difficult for him. Then someone comes who assists him in that until it becomes easy for him, or relieves him of it and removes it himself. His joy at that would undoubtedly be great, for his aim is the deliverance of his brothers from the well. If the aim of the sincere counselor is the deliverance of his Muslim brothers from the Fire, then if someone appears who assists him or relieves him of that, it should not weigh heavily upon him. Do you not see—if they were all guided by themselves, would it be fitting for that to weigh heavily upon him if his aim is their guidance? So if they are guided by other than him, should it weigh heavily upon him? Whenever he finds that in himself, Satan calls him to all the major sins of the hearts and the foul deeds of the limbs, and destroys him. We seek refuge in God from the deviation of hearts after guidance and from the crookedness of the soul after uprightness.

If you ask: When is it proper for him to occupy himself with advising people? I say: When he has no aim except guiding them to God Almighty, and he wishes he could find someone to assist him, or that they might be guided by themselves, and his hope for their praise and their wealth is completely severed. Then their praise and blame become equal in his sight, so he does not care for their blame if God praises him, nor does he rejoice in their praise if it is not accompanied by the praise of God Almighty. And he looks upon them as one looks upon masters and upon livestock. As for looking upon them as masters: it is from the perspective that he does not act arrogantly toward them and sees all of them as better than himself due to his ignorance of their final end. As for looking upon them as livestock: it is from the perspective of severing his hope for seeking status in their hearts, for he does not care how the livestock sees him, so he does not adorn himself for them nor affect manners! Rather, the herdsman's objective is solely tending the livestock and driving the wolf away from them, without regard for the livestock's view of him. So long as he does not see all other people as livestock, to whose view he pays no heed and about whom he does not care, he will not be safe from being occupied with reforming them. Yes, perhaps he reforms them, but he corrupts himself in reforming them, thus being like a lamp that gives light to others while burning itself out.

If you ask: If preachers were to abandon preaching except upon attaining this degree, then the world would be devoid of preaching and hearts would be ruined? I say: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said, "Love of the world is the head of every sin." And if people did not love the world, the world would perish, livelihoods would be nullified, and hearts and bodies would all be destroyed. However, he, peace be upon him, knew that love of the world is destructive and that mentioning its destructive nature does not remove the love from the hearts of the majority—only from the minority, whose abandonment does not ruin the world. So he did not abandon advising and mentioning the danger in the love of the world, nor did he cease mentioning it for fear of leaving himself to the destructive passions that God has empowered over His servants to drive them with to Hell, in confirmation of His saying, exalted is He, "But the word from Me will come true: 'I will fill Hell with jinn and people all together.'" Likewise, the tongues of preachers will not cease to be loosed due to love of leadership, and they will not desist because of someone saying that preaching for the love of leadership is forbidden, just as creation does not abandon drinking, fornication, theft, hypocrisy, oppression, and all other sins because of God Almighty and His Messenger saying that it is forbidden. So look to yourself and be empty-hearted from the talk of people, for God Almighty reforms many a creation through the corruption of a single person and persons. "And were it not that God repels people, some by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted." And God supports this religion by means of people who have no share [in the Hereafter]. What is to be feared is that the path of taking admonition becomes corrupt. As for silencing the tongues of preachers while behind them lies the motive of leadership and love of the world, that will never be.

If you ask: "When the seeker becomes aware of this stratagem of Satan and thus occupies himself with his own self, abandoning sincere counsel, or if he does offer counsel but observes the condition of truthfulness and sincerity in it, then what can be held against him? What dangers and snares of delusion remain before him?" Know then that the greatest danger remains for him, which is that Satan says to him: "You have thwarted me and escaped from me by your intelligence and the perfection of your intellect. I have overpowered a host of saints and great ones, yet I could not overpower you. How patient you are! How great is your rank and station with God, since He has strengthened you to overcome me and enabled you to perceive all the avenues of my deception!" He then inclines to him, believes him, and admires himself for his escape from all delusion. Thus his self-admiration becomes the ultimate delusion, which is the greatest ruin. For self-admiration is greater than every sin. Therefore Satan said: "O son of Adam, if you think that by your knowledge you have escaped from me, then by your ignorance you have fallen into my snares."

If you ask: Why should he not become self-admiring when he knows that this is from God Almighty, not from himself, and that one like him cannot repel Satan except through God's success and assistance? And whoever recognizes the weakness of his own soul and its incapacity for the least of things, yet is enabled to accomplish such a great matter, knows that he did not achieve it by himself but through God Almighty—so what is there to fear for him after eliminating self-admiration? I say: He is to be feared for being deluded by God's grace, relying on His generosity, and feeling secure from His subtle plan, to the point that he assumes he will remain on this course in the future and does not fear interruption or reversal. Thus his state becomes one of dependence solely on God's grace, unaccompanied by fear of His subtle plan. And whoever feels secure from God's subtle plan is indeed a great loser. Rather, his way should be to witness all of that as from God's grace, while fearing for his soul that some trait of his heart may have been blocked—such as love of the world, hypocrisy, bad character, or turning toward status while heedless of it—and fearing that his state may be stripped away in every blink of an eye, neither secure from God's subtle plan nor heedless of the peril of the final end. This is a peril from which there is no escape and a fear from which there is no deliverance except after crossing the Bridge. For this reason, when Satan appeared to one of the saints at the moment of death, when only a breath remained, he said: "Have I escaped from you, O so-and-so?" He replied: "No, not yet." Therefore it is said: All people are perished except the knowledgeable; and all the knowledgeable are perished except the active; and all the active are perished except the sincere; and the sincere are in great peril. Thus the deluded is perished, and the sincere one who flees from delusion is in peril; therefore fear and caution never depart from the hearts of God's saints.

We ask God Almighty for assistance, success, and a good ending, for matters are judged by their conclusions.

The Book of Condemning Self-Deception is completed, and with it concludes the quarter of destructive traits. Following this, at the beginning of the quarter of salvations, will be "The Book of Repentance." All praise is due to God, first and last, and may God's blessings and peace be upon the one after whom there is no prophet. He is sufficient for me, and the best trustee. There is no power nor strength except through God, the Most High, the Magnificent.

The heart is a subtle spiritual substance, a divine secret, a luminous essence. It is the reality of the human being, the seat of knowledge of God, and the locus of witnessing Him. It is to the body what the king is to his kingdom, and all the limbs are its soldiers and servants. When the heart is sound, the entire body is sound; when it is corrupt, the entire body is corrupt.

The third part of the book "The Revival of the Religious Sciences" is completed.

And it is followed by the fourth part, beginning with the Book of Repentance.
