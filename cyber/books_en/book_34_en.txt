The Book of Poverty and Asceticism

This is the fourth book of the quarter on the means of salvation from the work "The Revival of the Religious Sciences."

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Praise be to God, for whom the sands glorify, before whom shadows prostrate, and at whose awe mountains crumble. He created humanity from clinging clay and hardened mud, then adorned their form with the fairest symmetry and most perfect balance. He shielded their hearts with the light of guidance from the pitfalls of error, and permitted them to knock at the door of service in the morning and the evening. Then He anointed the insight of the sincere in His service with the light of reflection, until they perceived with its radiance the presence of Majesty. There became manifest to them such delight, splendor, and perfection that every beauty and comeliness appeared base compared to the beginnings of its dawning, and they deemed most burdensome whatever diverted them from witnessing it and clinging to it. The outward aspect of the world appeared to them in the likeness of a beautiful woman swaying and strutting, while its inward reality was unveiled as a hideous crone, kneaded from the clay of disgrace and cast in the mold of punishment. She is wrapped in her cloak to conceal the foulness of her secrets with subtle sorcery and deceit, and she has set her snares upon the paths of men, capturing them with varieties of cunning and ambush. Yet she is not content with merely breaking her promises of union, but binds them with chains and fetters even after severing connection, and afflicts them with all manner of calamities and torments. When the foulness of her secrets and deeds was unveiled to the knowers, they renounced it with the renunciation of one who loathes it, so they abandoned it and abandoned boasting and competing in wealth. They turned with the essence of their aspirations toward the presence of Majesty, confident in a union beyond which there is no separation, and an eternal witnessing untouched by annihilation or disappearance. And blessings and peace be upon our master Muhammad, the master of the prophets, and upon his family, the best of families.

Now then, the world is an enemy to God, exalted be He, for through its deception those who stray have strayed, and by its guile those who slip have slipped. Love of it is the head of all sins and misdeeds, while hatred of it is the mother of all acts of obedience and the foundation of drawing near. We have exhaustively detailed what pertains to its description and the censure of loving it in the Book of Censure of the World from the Quarter of Destructive Matters. We shall now mention the merit of hating it and of asceticism toward it, for it is the head of all that delivers. There is no hope for salvation except by severing ties with the world and distancing oneself from it. However, this severance may occur either by the world withdrawing from the servant—and this is called poverty—or by the servant withdrawing from the world—and this is called asceticism. Each of these has a degree in attaining felicities and a share in aiding toward triumph and salvation. We shall now mention the true nature of poverty and asceticism, their degrees, their divisions, their conditions, and their rulings. We shall mention poverty in one part of the book and asceticism in another part. We begin by mentioning poverty, and we say:

The First Half of the Book

On Poverty

Poverty is the state of being in need of Allah, the Exalted. It is the essence of servitude and the foundation of worship. The poor person is one whose heart is attached to nothing but Allah, and who finds sufficiency in nothing but Him. His poverty is his wealth, and his need is his fulfillment. He is rich in his poverty, secure in his neediness, and dignified in his humility before his Lord. The station of poverty is a lofty station, for it is the station of the prophets and the truthful ones. Whoever attains it has attained a great fortune.

It elucidates the reality of poverty, expounds upon the virtue of poverty in an absolute sense, and details the particular virtue of the poor. It clarifies the superiority of poverty over wealth, explains the proper conduct of the poor in their state of need, and outlines their proper conduct in accepting gifts. It sets forth the prohibition of begging without necessity, defines the amount of wealth that makes begging unlawful, and describes the conditions of those who ask. And success is from God, through His grace and generosity.

An Exposition on the True Nature of Poverty and the Varied States and Names of the Poor

Know that poverty denotes the lack of what one needs. As for lacking what is not needed, it is not called poverty. Moreover, if what is needed is present and attainable, the one in need is not considered poor. Once you grasp this, you will not doubt that every existent being other than God the Exalted is poor, because it is in need of the continuity of its existence in the next moment, and the continuity of existence is a gift derived from the grace of God the Exalted in granting existence. If there were in existence a being whose existence is not derived from another, that would be the Absolutely Self-Sufficient, and it is inconceivable for such a being to be more than one. Thus, in existence there is only one Self-Sufficient, and all besides Him are in need of Him to sustain their existence perpetually. To this exclusivity points His saying, the Exalted: "And God is the Self-Sufficient, and you are the poor." This is the meaning of poverty in the absolute sense. However, our intention here is not to explain absolute poverty, but poverty in terms of wealth specifically. Otherwise, the poverty of a servant in relation to the varieties of his needs is boundless, for his needs are without limit. Among what is attainable through wealth—and this is what we now intend to clarify—we say: Everyone lacking wealth we call poor in relation to the wealth they lack, provided that what is lacking is needed in their circumstance. Then, it is conceivable that one may have five conditions in poverty, and we distinguish them and designate each condition with a name to facilitate mentioning their rulings through distinction. The first and highest condition is that one is such that if wealth came to him, he would dislike it, be harmed by it, flee from taking it, detesting it and guarding against its evil and distraction—this is asceticism, and its practitioner is called the ascetic.

The second state is that one should be in such a condition that he does not desire it with a desire that brings joy upon its attainment, nor does he dislike it with a dislike that causes him distress and leads him to renounce it if it comes to him. The possessor of this state is called content.

The third type is one who prefers possessing wealth over lacking it due to some desire for it, yet his desire does not rise to the point of striving to seek it. Rather, if it comes to him freely and easily, he takes it and rejoices in it; but if acquiring it requires toil in its pursuit, he does not occupy himself with it. The possessor of this state we call content, for he has satisfied himself with what is present, thereby abandoning the pursuit despite the weak desire that remains within him.

The fourth is that one abandons the pursuit due to incapacity; otherwise, he is desirous of it with a desire such that if he found a way to seek it, even through hardship, he would seek it. Or he is occupied with the pursuit, and the possessor of this state we call the eager one.

The fifth condition: that the wealth he lacks is essential to him, like the hungry person lacking bread or the naked person lacking clothing. One in this state is called "compelled" regardless of whether his desire to seek it is weak or strong, and rarely is this state free from desire.

These are five states: the highest among them is asceticism combined with necessity, for if asceticism is joined to it and that is realized, it becomes the utmost degree of asceticism as will be explained later. Beyond these five states lies a state higher than asceticism, which is when the presence or absence of wealth becomes equal to a person: if he possesses it, he does not rejoice in it nor is he harmed by it; and if he loses it, it is likewise. Indeed, his condition is like that of ‘Ā’ishah, may God be pleased with her, when she was brought one hundred thousand dirhams as a stipend, and she took them and distributed them all on the same day. Her servant said to her, “You could not even buy us a dirham’s worth of meat to break our fast with from what you distributed today.” She replied, “Had you reminded me, I would have done so.” Whoever is in such a state, even if the entire world with all its treasures were in his hands and storehouses, it would not harm him, for he sees wealth as being in the treasury of God, not in his own possession. Thus, it makes no difference to him whether it is in his hand or in the hand of another. The possessor of this state ought to be called “the contented one,” because he is independent of both the loss and the presence of wealth. From this term, one should understand a meaning that differs from the absolute name “the Rich,” which belongs to God and to any servant whose wealth is abundant. For if a servant’s wealth is abundant and he rejoices in it, he is needy for the wealth to remain in his possession; he is only independent of wealth entering his hand, not of its remaining there. Thus, he is needy in one respect. As for this person, he is independent of wealth entering his hand, remaining in his hand, and also leaving his hand, for he is not harmed by it so as to need its removal, nor does he rejoice in it so as to need its retention, nor is he lacking it so as to need it to come into his hand. His contentment leans more toward universality, and thus he is closer to the richness that is an attribute of God. Indeed, the servant draws near to God through the nearness of attributes, not through the nearness of place. However, we do not name the possessor of this state “rich,” but rather “contented,” so that the name “the Rich” remains for Him who possesses absolute independence from all things. As for this servant, if he becomes content with wealth whether present or absent, he has not become independent of other things besides it, nor has he become independent of the support of God’s enabling grace to maintain the contentment with which God has adorned his heart. For the heart bound by love of wealth is enslaved, while the one content without it is free; and God is the One who has liberated him from this bondage. Thus, he remains in need of the permanence of this liberation. Hearts fluctuate between bondage and freedom in close intervals, for they are between two fingers of the Merciful. Therefore, the name “the Rich” cannot be applied absolutely to him, despite this perfection, except metaphorically.

Know that asceticism is a station that constitutes the perfection of the righteous, and the possessor of this state is among those brought near. Thus, it is no wonder that asceticism becomes a deficiency in his case, for the good deeds of the righteous are the misdeeds of those brought near. This is because the one who despises the world is preoccupied with the world, just as the one who desires it is preoccupied with it. Preoccupation with anything other than God, exalted is He, is a veil from God, exalted is He, for there is no distance between you and God, exalted is He, such that distance could be a veil. Indeed, He is closer to you than your jugular vein, and He is not in a place such that the heavens and the earth could be a veil between you and Him. Therefore, there is no veil between you and Him except your preoccupation with other than Him, and your preoccupation with your own self and its desires is preoccupation with other than Him. As long as you remain preoccupied with your self and its desires, so too will you remain veiled from Him. Thus, the one preoccupied with love of his self is preoccupied away from God, exalted is He, and the one preoccupied with hatred of his self is also preoccupied away from God, exalted is He, with everything other than God. Its example is like that of a watchman present in a gathering that brings together the lover and the beloved. If the heart of the lover turns to the watchman, and to hating him, resenting him, and disliking his presence, then in that state his heart is preoccupied with hating him, diverted from delighting in the sight of his beloved. Had he been utterly absorbed in love, he would have been heedless of other than the beloved and would not have turned to him. So just as looking to other than the beloved out of love, when the lover is present, is association in love and a deficiency in it, likewise looking to other than the Beloved out of hatred is association in it and a deficiency. However, one is lighter than the other. Rather, perfection lies in the heart not turning to other than the Beloved, whether in hatred or love. For just as two loves cannot coexist in the heart in a single state, so too hatred and love cannot coexist in a single state. Therefore, the one preoccupied with hating the world is heedless of God, just like the one preoccupied with loving it, except that the one preoccupied with loving it is heedless and in his heedlessness is treading the path of remoteness, while the one preoccupied with hating it is heedless and in his heedlessness is treading the path of nearness, for it is hoped that his state will culminate in this heedlessness being removed and replaced by witnessing. Thus, perfection is anticipated for him, because hatred of the world is a mount that leads to God. The lover and the hater are like two men on the pilgrimage route, preoccupied with riding the she-camel, feeding it, and driving it. But one is facing the Kaaba and the other has his back to it. They are equal relative to the state, in that each of them is veiled from the Kaaba and preoccupied away from it. However, the state of the one facing it is praiseworthy relative to the one with his back to it, for he is hoped to reach it, but it is not praiseworthy relative to the one residing in the Kaaba, attached to it, who does not leave it such that he would need to busy himself with the mount to reach it. Therefore, you should not think that hatred of the world is an objective in itself. Rather, the world is an obstacle from God, exalted is He. There is no reaching Him except by removing the obstacle. For this reason, Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy on him, said: "Whoever practices asceticism regarding the world and stops at that has hastened to comfort. Rather, one should busy oneself with the Hereafter." He thus indicated that traversing the path of the Hereafter lies beyond asceticism, just as traversing the path of the pilgrimage lies beyond repelling the creditor who is an obstacle to the pilgrimage. It has thus become clear that asceticism regarding the world, if intended as the absence of desire for its existence or non-existence, is the ultimate perfection. If intended as the desire for its non-existence, it is perfection relative to the station of the content, the satisfied, and the covetous, but a deficiency relative to the station of the one who is free from need. Rather, perfection regarding wealth is that wealth and water become equal in your sight. An abundance of water in your vicinity does not harm you, as if you were on the shore of the sea, nor does its scarcity harm you except to the extent of necessity, while wealth is needed just as water is needed. Thus, your heart should not be preoccupied with fleeing from the vicinity of abundant water, nor should it hate abundant water. Rather, you should say: "I drink from it according to need, and I give it to the servants of God to drink according to need, and I am not miserly with it toward anyone." This is how wealth should be, because bread and water are one in terms of need. The difference between them lies only in the scarcity of one and the abundance of the other. And when you know God, exalted is He, and trust in His management by which He manages the universe, you know that the measure of your need for bread will come to you without fail as long as you live, just as the measure of your need for water comes to you, as will be explained in the Book of Reliance on God, if God, exalted is He, wills.

Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari said: I said to Abu Sulayman al-Darani: Malik ibn Dinar said to al-Mughira: "Go to the house and take the water-skin I gifted to you, for the enemy whispers to me that the thief has taken it." Sulayman said: "This is from the weakness of the hearts of the Sufis. He has increased in the world what overpowered him from taking it." He thus indicated that disliking the water-skin being in his house is a turning of attention to it, its cause being weakness and deficiency.

If you ask: Why did the prophets and saints flee from wealth and utterly shun it?  
I say: They fled from it as they fled from water, meaning they drank no more than their need, avoiding what exceeded it and not storing it in waterskins and vessels to manage for themselves. Rather, they left it in streams, wells, and open lands for those in need—not because their hearts were preoccupied with love or hatred of it. Indeed, treasures of the earth were brought to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) and to Abu Bakr and Umar (may God be pleased with them), and they took them and placed them in their proper places without fleeing from them, since wealth, water, gold, and stones were equal in their sight.  

What is narrated of their abstention may be reported from one who feared that if he took wealth, it would deceive him, shackle his heart, and invite him to desires—this is the state of the weak. Thus, hatred for wealth and flight from it are, in their case, a perfection. This is the ruling for all creation, for all are weak except the prophets and saints. Or it may be narrated from one strong and perfected, who displayed flight and aversion, descending to the level of the weak so they might follow him in renunciation; for if they followed him in taking, they would perish—just as a resolute man flees from a snake before his children, not from weakness in seizing it, but knowing that if he took it, his children would take it upon seeing him, and they would perish. Walking in the way of the weak is a necessity for prophets, saints, and scholars.  

Thus, you have learned that the stations are six: the highest is the rank of the self-sufficient, then the ascetic, then the content, then the satisfied, then the eager. As for the compelled, asceticism, contentment, and satisfaction may also be conceived in his case, with degrees varying according to these states. The name "poor" applies to these five. To call the self-sufficient "poor" has no basis in this sense; rather, if he is called poor, it is in another meaning: his awareness of being in need of God Almighty in all his affairs generally, and in the persistence of his sufficiency from wealth specifically. Thus, the name "poor" for him is like the name "slave" for one who knows himself in servitude and acknowledges it—he is more deserving of the name "slave" than the heedless. Though the name "slave" is general for all creation, so too is the name "poor" general; and whoever knows himself in poverty before God Almighty is most deserving of the name "poor." The name "poor" is shared between these two meanings.  

When you understand this shared meaning, you comprehend that the saying of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), "I seek refuge in You from poverty," and his saying (peace be upon him), "Poverty almost becomes disbelief," do not contradict his saying, "Make me live as a pauper and make me die as a pauper." For the poverty from which he sought refuge is that of the compelled, while the poverty that is acknowledgment of neediness, humility, and dependence on God Almighty is what he asked for in his supplication (peace be upon him)—and upon every chosen servant among the people of earth and heaven.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Poverty in Its Absolute Sense

As for the verses, it is indicated by the words of the Almighty: "For the poor emigrants who were driven from their homes and their properties..." [the verse]. And the Almighty said: "For the poor who are restricted in the cause of Allah and cannot move about in the land..." He presented the discourse in the context of praise, then He preceded the description of them with poverty over their description with emigration and restriction, and in this is a clear indication of the praise of the poor.

As for the narrations in praise of poverty, they are too numerous to count: 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, reported that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said to his companions: "Who are the best of people?" They said: "A wealthy person of property who gives the right of Allah from himself and his wealth." He said: "This is a good man, but he is not it." They said: "Then who are the best of people, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "A poor person who gives his utmost effort."

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said to Bilal: "Meet Allah in a state of poverty and do not meet Him in a state of wealth."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed, God loves the poor man who is self-restrained and burdened with dependents."

In the well-known tradition: "The poor of my community will enter Paradise five hundred years before their wealthy ones." And in another narration: "by forty autumns," meaning forty years. Thus, the intended meaning is an estimation of the precedence of the striving poor over the striving rich, and the estimation of five hundred years is for the precedence of the ascetic poor over the desirous rich. What we have mentioned regarding the varying degrees of poverty necessarily informs you of the disparity among the poor in their ranks. It is as if the striving poor are at a level of twenty-five degrees from that of the ascetic poor, for this is the proportion of forty to five hundred. Do not suppose that the estimation of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, proceeds from his tongue arbitrarily or by chance. Rather, he, peace and blessings be upon him, speaks only with the truth of reality, for he does not speak from whim; it is nothing but revelation revealed. This is like his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "A righteous dream is one part of forty-six parts of prophethood." For that is an estimation of certainty without doubt. However, it is not within the capacity of anyone else to know the reason for that proportion except by conjecture; as for knowing it with certainty, no. For it is known that prophethood is an expression for what is specific to the Prophet and distinguishes him from others. It is specific to various unique characteristics: one of them is that he knows the realities of matters pertaining to God and His attributes, the angels, and the Hereafter, not as others know them, but in a manner differing from them in abundance, and with an increase in certainty, verification, and unveiling.

The second is that he possesses within himself an attribute through which miraculous acts that break customary norms are perfected for him, just as we possess an attribute through which movements coupled with our will and choice are perfected—namely, capability—even though both the capability and what is made possible are entirely from the act of God, exalted be He.

The third is that he possesses an attribute through which he sees the angels and witnesses them, just as the sighted person possesses an attribute through which he differs from the blind, enabling him to perceive visible things.

The fourth is that he possesses a quality through which he perceives what will be in the unseen, whether in wakefulness or in sleep, for through it he gazes upon the Preserved Tablet and sees what is within it of the unseen. These are perfections and attributes whose establishment for the Prophets is known, and it is known that each one of them is divided into divisions. Perhaps we can divide them into forty, into fifty, into sixty, and we can also contrive to divide them into forty-six, such that the true dream becomes one part of their totality. However, specifying one single path from among the possible paths of division is not possible except by conjecture and guesswork. We do not know with certainty whether it is what the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, intended or not. What is known are the collective attributes through which prophethood is perfected and the principle of their division. That does not guide us to knowing the cause of the specific estimation. Likewise, we know that the poor have degrees, as preceded. As for why this poor person, who is covetous for example, is on half of one-sixth of the degree of the poor person who is ascetic, such that his advancement to Paradise is not more than forty years, while that [of the ascetic] necessitated an advancement of five hundred years—it is not within the power of humans, other than the Prophets, to ascertain that except by a kind of guesswork, and there is no certainty in it. The purpose is to alert to the methodology of estimation in matters like these, for the one weak in faith might think that this proceeds from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, by way of coincidence—far be the station of prophethood from that! Let us return to transmitting the reports, for he, peace and blessings be upon him, also said: "The best of this community are its poor, and the quickest of them to recline in Paradise are its weak."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, I have two traits; whoever loves them loves me, and whoever hates them hates me: poverty and jihad." And it is narrated that Gabriel, peace be upon him, descended upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said: "O Muhammad, indeed God, the Mighty and Majestic, sends you greetings and says: 'Would you love that I make these mountains gold, and it be with you wherever you are?'" The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, lowered his head in thought, then said: "O Gabriel, this world is an abode for one who has no abode, and wealth for one who has no wealth, and for it gathers one who has no intellect." Gabriel said to him: "O Muhammad, may God establish you with the firm word."

It is related that Jesus, peace be upon him, passed during his travels by a man sleeping, wrapped in a cloak. He woke him and said, "O sleeper, arise and remember God the Exalted." The man said, "What do you want from me? I have left the world to its people." So he said to him, "Then sleep, O my beloved."

And Moses, peace be upon him, passed by a man sleeping on the dust, with a brick under his head and his face and beard in the dust, wearing a cloak as a waist-wrapper. He said, "O Lord, this servant of Yours is lost in the world." Then God the Exalted revealed to him, "O Moses, do you not know that when I look upon a servant with My full countenance, I divert the entire world away from him?"

From Abu Rafi' that he said: A guest came to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he did not find with him what would be suitable for him. So he sent me to a man from the Jews of Khaybar and said, "Say to him: Muhammad says to you, 'Lend me or sell me on credit some flour until the crescent of Rajab.'" He said: So I came to him, and he said, "No, by God, except with a pledge." So I informed the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, of that, and he said, "By God, I am indeed trustworthy to the people of the heavens and trustworthy to the people of the earth. If he had sold to me on credit or lent to me, I would have fulfilled it to him. Go with this armor of mine to him and pledge it." Then, when I went out, this verse was revealed: "And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [as] the splendor of worldly life." And this verse is a consolation for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, regarding the worldly life.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Poverty is a greater adornment for the believer than a beautiful bridle on the cheek of a horse."

Whoever among you wakes up in the morning healthy in body, secure in his home, and with his daily sustenance provided, it is as if the entire world has been gathered for him.

Ka‘b al-Aḥbār said: God Almighty said to Moses, peace be upon him: "O Moses, when you see poverty approaching, say: 'Welcome to the emblem of the righteous.'"

And 'Ata al-Khurasani said: A prophet from among the prophets passed by a seashore, and there he saw a man fishing. The man said, "In the name of God," and cast his net, but nothing came out in it. Then he instructed another, who said, "In the name of Satan," and cast his net, and there came out in it such an abundance of fish that they were struggling due to their multitude. The prophet, peace be upon him, said, "O Lord, what is this, when You know that all of that is in Your hand?" So God, exalted is He, said to the angels, "Reveal to My servant the stations of these two." When he saw what God had prepared for this one in honor and for that one in disgrace, he said, "I am content, O Lord."

Our Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "I looked into Paradise and saw that most of its inhabitants are the poor, and I looked into Hellfire and saw that most of its inhabitants are the wealthy and women." In another wording: "So I said, 'Where are the wealthy?' They are detained by striving." And in another narration: "I saw that most of the inhabitants of Hellfire are women, so I said, 'What is their affair?' It was said, 'They are preoccupied with the two reds: gold and saffron.'"

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The believer's gift in this world is poverty."

In the tradition, "The last of the prophets to enter Paradise is Solomon, son of David, peace be upon them both, because of his kingdom; and the last of my companions to enter Paradise is 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf, on account of his wealth." And in another narration: "I saw him entering Paradise crawling."

The Messiah, peace be upon him, said: The rich man enters Paradise with difficulty.

And in another narration from the Household of the Prophet, may God be pleased with them, it is reported that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When God loves a servant, He tests him; and when He loves him with an intense love, He acquires him." It was asked: "And what does 'acquire him' mean?" He said: "He leaves him neither family nor wealth."

In the tradition: "When you see poverty approaching, say: 'Welcome, the emblem of the righteous,' and when you see wealth approaching, say: 'A sin whose punishment has been hastened.'"

Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, who among Your creation are Your beloved, that I may love them for Your sake?" He replied: "Every needy one, every needy one." This may be taken as emphasis, or it may refer to one in severe distress.

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, I love poverty and detest affluence." And the most beloved of names to him, peace be upon him, was to be called: "O poor one."

When the chieftains and wealthy men of the Arabs said to the Prophet, peace be upon him, "Appoint a day for us and a day for them—they come to you when we do not, and we come when they do not," meaning by "they" the poor such as Bilal, Salman, Suhayb, Abu Dharr, Khabbab ibn al-Aratt, 'Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Hurayrah, and the People of the Bench from among the poor, may God be pleased with them all, the Prophet, peace be upon him, agreed to that. This was because they complained to him of being troubled by their odor, for the clothing of these people was wool in the intense heat; when they sweated, odors emanated from their garments. This became severe for the wealthy among them, such as al-Aqra' ibn Habis al-Tamimi, 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn al-Fazari, 'Abbas ibn Mirdas al-Sulami, and others. So the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, agreed that they should not gather them and the poor in one assembly. Then there was revealed the word of the Exalted: "And keep yourself patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance, and let not your eyes pass beyond them" meaning the poor, "desiring the adornment of worldly life" meaning the wealthy, "and do not obey him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance" meaning the wealthy, up to His saying: "And say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills—let him believe; and whoever wills—let him disbelieve.'"

And Ibn Umm Maktum sought permission to enter upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, while with him was a man from the nobles of Quraysh. This weighed upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, so God revealed: "He frowned and turned away because the blind man came to him. And what would make you perceive, perhaps he might be purified or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him?" meaning Ibn Maktum, "But as for he who thinks himself self-sufficient, to him you give attention" meaning this nobleman.

And from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "The servant will be brought on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah, the Exalted, will make an excuse to him as a man makes an excuse to another man in this world. He will say: 'By My might and majesty, I did not withhold the world from you because you were insignificant to Me, but rather because of the honor and excellence I have prepared for you. Go forth, O My servant, to these ranks. Whoever fed you for My sake or clothed you for My sake, desiring thereby My countenance, then take him by the hand—he is for you.' And on that day, the people will be choked by sweat. So he will pass through the ranks, looking for whoever did that for him, and he will take him by the hand and admit him into Paradise."

And he, peace be upon him, said: "Increase your acquaintance with the poor and establish for yourselves means of favor with them, for they possess a dominion." They said: "O Messenger of God, and what is their dominion?" He said: "When the Day of Resurrection comes, it will be said to them: 'Look, whoever gave you a morsel of food, or gave you a drink of water, or clothed you with a garment, then take him by the hand and proceed with him to Paradise.'"

He, peace be upon him, said: "I entered Paradise and heard a movement ahead of me. I looked, and behold, there was Bilal. I looked at its highest part, and behold, there were the poor of my community and their children. I looked at its lowest part, and behold, there were few of the wealthy and women therein. I said: 'O Lord, what is their affair?' He said: 'As for the women, the two red things—gold and silk—harmed them. As for the wealthy, they were preoccupied with the lengthy reckoning.' I then sought out my companions, but I did not see 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf. Then he came to me after that, weeping. I said: 'What delayed you from reaching me?' He said: 'O Messenger of God, I did not reach you until I encountered the gray hairs (of old age), and I thought I would not see you.' I said: 'And why?' He said: 'I was being held to account for my wealth.'"

Then consider this: 'Abd al-Rahman, who possessed immense precedence with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and is among the ten specifically designated as the people of Paradise, and is among the wealthy about whom the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Except for one who says with his wealth like this and like this"—despite all this, he was harmed by wealth to this extent.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, visited a poor man and saw that he possessed nothing. He said, "If the light of this man were divided among the people of the earth, it would suffice them all."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Shall I not inform you of the kings of the inhabitants of Paradise?" They said: "Indeed, O Messenger of God." He said: "Every weak and oppressed one, dusty and disheveled, wearing two worn-out garments, who is given no heed; were he to swear by God, He would fulfill it."

'Imran ibn Husayn said: I held a special status and esteem with the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. He said, "O 'Imran, you indeed have a status and esteem with us. Would you like to visit Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him?" I said, "Yes, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of God." He stood, and I stood with him until he stopped at Fatimah's door. He knocked on the door and said, "Peace be upon you. May I enter?" She said, "Enter, O Messenger of God." He said, "Myself and the one with me?" She said, "And who is with you, O Messenger of God?" He said, "'Imran." Fatimah said, "By the One who sent you with the truth as a Prophet, I have nothing upon me but a cloak." He said, "Do with it like this and like this," gesturing with his hand. She said, "This covers my body, but what about my head?" He threw to her a worn garment that was upon him and said, "Wrap it around your head." Then she gave him permission, and he entered. He said, "Peace be upon you, my daughter. How are you this morning?" She said, "By God, I am in pain, and what increases my pain is that I cannot manage to eat any food, for hunger has weakened me." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, wept and said, "Do not grieve, my daughter, for by God, I have not tasted food for three days, and I am more honored by God than you. If I asked my Lord, He would feed me, but I prefer the Hereafter over this world." Then he placed his hand on her shoulder and said to her, "Receive glad tidings, for by God, you are the mistress of the women of Paradise." I said, "And what about Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh, and Maryam, the daughter of 'Imran?" He said, "Asiyah is the mistress of the women of her world, and Maryam is the mistress of the women of her world, and you are the mistress of the women of your world. You are in houses of reeds, wherein there is no harm, no clamor, and no weariness." Then he said to her, "Be content with your cousin, for by God, I have married you to a master in this world and a master in the Hereafter."

It is narrated from Ali, may God honor his countenance, that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When people despise their poor, display worldly adornment, and vie greedily to amass dirhams, God will strike them with four traits: famine in the age, injustice from the ruler, treachery from the governors of judgments, and might from the enemies."

As for the narrations: Abu al-Darda, may God be pleased with him, said: "The possessor of two dirhams is more severely restrained—or he said, more severely accounted—than the possessor of a single dirham."

Umar, may God be pleased with him, sent a thousand dinars to Sa'id ibn 'Amir. He came home sorrowful and dejected. His wife asked, "Has some new matter occurred?" He replied, "Something more severe than that." Then he said, "Show me your worn-out garment." He tore it and made it into pouches, distributed the money, then stood in prayer, weeping until morning. Then he said, "I heard the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, say: 'The poor of my community will enter Paradise five hundred years before the rich, to the extent that a wealthy man will be among their throng, and he will be taken by the hand and pulled out.'"

Abu Huraira said: Three will enter Paradise without reckoning: a man who intends to wash his garment but has no other garment to wear, a man who does not set up two cooking pots over a fire, and a man who calls for his drink and is not asked, "Which one do you want?"

It is said: A poor man came to the gathering of al-Thawri, may God have mercy on him, and he said to him: "Step forward, for if I were wealthy, I would not have drawn you near." And the wealthy among his companions wished they were poor, due to his frequent drawing near of the poor and his turning away from the wealthy. And al-Mu’ammal said: "I have never seen the wealthy more humbled than in the gathering of al-Thawri, nor have I seen the poor more honored than in the gathering of al-Thawri, may God have mercy on him."

Some sages have said: Wretched is the son of Adam; if he feared the Fire as he fears poverty, he would be saved from them both. And if he yearned for Paradise as he yearns for wealth, he would attain them both. And if he feared God in his innermost being as he fears His creation in the outward, he would be blissful in both abodes.

Ibn Abbas said: Cursed is he who honors the wealthy and despises the poor.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: Embracing poverty is among the traits of the Messengers, preferring their company is a sign of the righteous, and fleeing from their companionship is a mark of the hypocrites.

And in the reports from the previous scriptures: that God, exalted is He, revealed to some of His prophets, peace be upon them: Beware lest I despise you, and you fall from My sight, and I then pour the worldly life upon you in a deluge.

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, would distribute one hundred thousand dirhams in a single day—funds sent to her by Mu'awiyah, Ibn 'Amir, and others—while her own garment was patched. Her servant girl said to her, "If only you would buy a dirham's worth of meat to break your fast with!" She was fasting and replied, "Had you reminded me, I would have done so." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had instructed her, saying, "If you wish to join me, then adopt the life of the poor, beware of sitting with the wealthy, and do not remove your garment until you have patched it."

A man came to Ibrahim ibn Adham with ten thousand dirhams, but he refused to accept them. The man insisted, so Ibrahim said to him, "Do you wish that I erase my name from the register of the poor for ten thousand dirhams? I will never do that." May God be pleased with him.
Explanation of the virtue specific to the poor who are content, satisfied, and truthful.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Blessed is he who is guided to Islam and whose livelihood is sufficient, and he is content with it." And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O company of the poor, give God contentment from your hearts, and you shall attain the reward of your poverty; otherwise, you shall not." The first is the contented one, and this is the satisfied one. This almost conveys the notion that the covetous one has no reward for his poverty, but the general traditions reported concerning the merit of poverty indicate that he does have a reward, as will be clarified later. Perhaps the intended meaning of the lack of satisfaction is the dislike for God's act in withholding the world from him. And perhaps one who desires wealth does not entertain in his heart any denial of God, the Exalted, nor dislike for His action. That dislike is what nullifies the reward of poverty.

It is narrated from 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Verily, everything has a key, and the key to Paradise is the love of the poor and the needy for their patience. They will be the companions of Allah, the Exalted, on the Day of Resurrection."

It has been related from Ali, may God honor his countenance, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "The servant most beloved to God, the Exalted, is the poor one who is content with his provision and pleased with God, the Exalted."

O Allah, make the sustenance of the family of Muhammad just sufficient.

He said: "There is no one, rich or poor, but will come on the Day of Resurrection having been granted provision in this world."

And God, exalted be He, revealed to Ishmael, peace be upon him: "Seek Me among those whose hearts are broken." He said: "And who are they?" He said: "The truthful poor."

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "No one is better than the poor person if he is content."

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Allah the Exalted will say on the Day of Resurrection: 'Where are My chosen ones from among My creation?' The angels will say: 'And who are they, O our Lord?' He will say: 'The poor among the Muslims who are content with My provision and pleased with My decree. Admit them into Paradise.' So they will enter it, eating and drinking, while the people are still being held to account." This pertains to the content and the pleased one. As for the ascetic, we shall mention his merit in the second half of the book, if Allah the Exalted wills.

As for the narrations concerning contentment and sufficiency, they are numerous, and it is well known that sufficiency opposes greed. Indeed, 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: "Verily, greed is poverty and despair is wealth; and whoever despairs of what is in people's hands and is content becomes independent of them."

And Abu Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "There is not a day except that an angel calls from beneath the Throne: 'O son of Adam, a little that suffices you is better than much that makes you transgress.'"

Abu al-Darda, may God be pleased with him, said: There is no one without some deficiency in their intellect, and this is because when the world brings him increase, he remains joyful and delighted, while night and day are ceaselessly at work demolishing his lifespan, yet this does not grieve him. Woe to the son of Adam! Of what benefit is wealth that increases while life decreases?

It was said to one of the wise: What is wealth? He replied: Fewness of desires and contentment with what suffices you.

It is said: Ibrahim ibn Adham was among the people of ease and comfort in Khorasan. One day, as he was looking out from one of his palaces, he saw a man in the courtyard holding a loaf of bread and eating it. When the man finished eating, he fell asleep. Ibrahim said to one of his servants, "When he wakes, bring him to me." When the man awoke, he was brought before him. Ibrahim asked, "O man, did you eat the loaf while hungry?" He replied, "Yes." He asked, "And were you satisfied?" He replied, "Yes." He asked, "Then did you sleep peacefully?" He replied, "Yes." Ibrahim then said to himself, "What then do I need with the world, when the soul is content with this little?"

A man passed by 'Amir ibn 'Abd al-Qays while he was eating salt and vegetables, and said to him, "O servant of God, are you content with this from the world?" He replied, "Shall I not direct you to one who is content with less than this?" The man said, "Indeed." He said, "He who is content with the world as a substitute for the Hereafter."
And Muhammad ibn Wasī', may God have mercy upon him, would take out dry bread, moisten it with water, eat it with salt, and say, "Whoever is content with this from the world will have no need of anyone."

Hasan, may God have mercy on him, said: "God curse those people to whom God the Exalted has sworn, yet they did not believe Him." Then he recited: "And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised. By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, indeed, it is truth—just as you are able to speak."

One day, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) was sitting among the people when his wife came to him and said, "Do you sit among these people? By Allah, there is not a scrap nor a morsel in the house." He replied, "O this one, before us lies a steep, arduous pass from which none will be saved except those who travel light." She returned, content.

And Dhu al-Nun (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "The closest of people to disbelief is one in need who has no patience."

It was said to one of the wise: "What is your wealth?" He replied: "Outward refinement, inward moderation, and despair of what is in people's hands."

And it has been related that God, the Almighty, said in some of the previously revealed scriptures: "O son of Adam, if the entire world were yours, nothing of it would be yours except sustenance. So when I give you its sustenance and place its accounting upon another, then I am bestowing favor upon you."

And it has been said regarding contentment.

Beseech God, not people, and be content with despair, for honor lies in despair. Be independent of every relative and kin, for truly rich is he who is independent of people.

It has also been said regarding this meaning:

O Gatherer who withholds, O Determiner of every gate,
While time watches it, from Him it is closed.
Pondering how to approach it—whether in the morning or in its forecourt—
His appointed fate travels and knocks at his door.
You have gathered wealth, so tell me, O gatherer of wealth:
Have you gathered for it days to spend it?
Wealth is stored with you; wealth is not yours
For its inheritor, except on the day you expend it.
Live at ease, for a youth who goes forth
In trust—He who apportioned the provisions will provide for him.
Thus, honor from Him is preserved—what
Can tarnish it? It does not wear out.
Indeed, contentment—whoever settles
In its courtyard, no anxiety keeps him awake within its shade.

Explanation of the Virtue of Poverty over Wealth

Know that people have differed concerning this matter. Junayd, the elect, and the majority have held poverty to be superior. Ibn ‘Ata said: “The grateful rich person who fulfills the rights [of his wealth] is better than the patient poor person.” It is related that Junayd invoked [God] against Ibn ‘Ata for opposing him in this, and a trial befell him. We have mentioned that in the Book of Patience and have clarified the distinctions between patience and gratitude—and we have paved the way for seeking virtue in actions and states, and that this is not possible except through detailed exposition.

As for poverty and wealth when taken in absolute terms, one who has read the traditions and reports will not doubt the superiority of poverty. Yet this requires elaboration. We say that doubt can only arise in two scenarios: one is a patient poor person who is not eager in seeking [wealth], but rather is content or satisfied, compared to a wealthy person who spends his wealth in good causes and is not eager to hoarding money.

The second is a poor man who is covetous alongside a rich man who is covetous, for it is not hidden that the poor man who is content is superior to the rich man who is covetous and miserly, and that the rich man who spends his wealth in good works is superior to the poor man who is covetous.

The first station is that of the poor who are patient, not being covetous in seeking. As for the first, one might suppose that the rich are superior to the poor, because they are equal in their lack of covetousness for wealth, and the rich draw near through charities and good deeds while the poor are incapable of that. This is what Ibn ‘Ata’ supposed, as we reckon. However, the rich who indulge in their wealth, even if it is permissible, cannot be conceived as superior to the contented poor. This is supported by what has been related in the report: that the poor complained to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, about the rich outpacing them in good deeds, charities, pilgrimage, and jihad. So he taught them words of glorification and informed them that they would attain thereby more than what the rich had attained. Then the rich learned of it and began saying it, so the poor returned to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and informed him. He, peace be upon him, said: "That is the bounty of God; He gives it to whom He wills."

Ibn 'Ata' was also cited when asked about this, and he said: "The rich person is superior because it is an attribute of the Truth." However, his first proof is subject to scrutiny, for the report has come in a detailed manner that indicates the contrary: namely, that the reward of the poor in glorification exceeds that of the rich, and that their attainment of that reward is a bounty from God which He gives to whom He wills. Yazid ibn Aslam narrated from Anas ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him, who said: "The poor sent me as a messenger to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. I said: 'I am the messenger of the poor to you.' He said: 'Welcome to you and to those from whom you have come—a people whom I love.'" He said: "They said: 'O Messenger of God, the wealthy have taken away the good deeds: they perform Hajj, and we cannot afford it; they perform 'Umrah, and we cannot afford it; and when they fall ill, they send forth surplus from their wealth as a provision for themselves.' The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: 'Convey from me to the poor that for whoever among you is patient and seeks reward, there are three qualities not possessed by the wealthy: As for one quality, verily in Paradise there are chambers whose inhabitants are gazed upon by the people of Paradise as the people of earth gaze at the stars of the sky. None enters them except a poor prophet, a poor martyr, or a poor believer. The second: the poor will enter Paradise before the wealthy by half a day, which is five hundred years. The third: "Glory be to God," "Praise be to God," "There is no god but God," and "God is the Greatest." If a poor person says the like of this, the rich person cannot catch up to him even if he were to spend ten thousand dirhams therein. And so it is with all righteous deeds.'" So I returned to them and informed them of what the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, had said, and they said: "We are content, we are content."

This indicates that His statement, "That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills," refers to the additional reward for the poor due to their remembrance. As for the statement that wealth is an attribute of the Truth, some masters responded by saying: Do you suppose that Allah the Exalted is rich through means and accidents? Then he fell silent and spoke no more. Others answered, saying: Arrogance is among the attributes of the Truth, so it ought to be superior to humility. Then they said: Rather, this indicates that poverty is superior, for the attributes of servitude—such as fear and hope—are a virtue for the servant, while the attributes of Lordship are not to be contested. For this reason, Allah the Exalted said, as related from our Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "Majesty is My cloak and grandeur is My mantle; whoever contends with Me regarding either of them, I shall break him."

Sahl said: Love of honor and permanence is polytheism in divine lordship and a contestation thereof, for both are attributes of the Lord Most High. From this category, they spoke concerning the superiority of the rich and the poor. The essence of this is connected to generalities that admit interpretations and to deficient words whose contradiction is not far-fetched. For just as the statement of one who favors the rich—because wealth is an attribute of the Truth through pride—is contradicted, so too is the statement of one who censures the rich—because it is a description of the servant through knowledge and gnosis, for that is a description of the Lord Most High, while ignorance and heedlessness are descriptions of the servant, and none should prefer heedlessness over knowledge. Uncovering the veil from this is what we mentioned in the Book of Patience: that which is not desired for itself but for something else should be attributed to its intended purpose, for through that its merit becomes apparent. The world is not forbidden for itself, but because it hinders arrival at God Most High; nor is poverty sought for itself, but because in it lies the removal of the hindrance from God Most High and the absence of distraction from Him. How many a rich person was not distracted by wealth from God Almighty, like Solomon, peace be upon him, and Uthman and Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, may God Most High be pleased with them; and how many a poor person was distracted by poverty and turned away from the goal. The ultimate goal in the world is love of God Most High and intimacy with Him, and that is not possible except after knowing Him, and traversing the path of knowledge with distractions is not possible. Poverty may be among the distractions, just as wealth may be among the distractions. Truly, the distraction in reality is love of the world, for love of God Most High does not coexist with it in the heart. The lover of a thing is preoccupied with it, whether in separation or in union—perhaps his preoccupation in separation is greater, perhaps his preoccupation in union is greater. The world is the beloved of the heedless; the one deprived of it is preoccupied with seeking it, and the one capable of it is preoccupied with preserving it and enjoying it. Therefore, if we suppose two individuals free from love of wealth such that wealth in their regard is like water, then the possessor and the non-possessor are equal, for each enjoys only according to need, and the presence of need to the extent of need is better than its absence, for the hungry one treads the path of death, not the path of knowledge. If we consider the matter from the perspective of the greater likelihood, the poor person is farther from danger, for the trial of ease is more severe than the trial of hardship, and immunity lies in not having power. Thus, the Companions, may God Most High be pleased with them, said: "We were tested with the trial of hardship and we were patient, and we were tested with the trial of ease and we were not patient." This is the nature of all human beings except the rare, exceptional individual who appears only seldom across many ages.

Since the divine law addresses the collective, not that rare exception—and hardship is more beneficial for the collective than for that rare individual—the law has warned against wealth and censured it, while preferring poverty and praising it. So much so that Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "Do not look to the wealth of the people of this world, for the glitter of their wealth will extinguish the light of your faith."

Some scholars have said: The constant turnover of wealth sucks away the sweetness of faith.

In the tradition: "Every community has its calf, and the calf of this community is the dinar and dirham." The original calf of Moses' people was also made from ornaments of gold and silver, and the equivalence of wealth and water, gold and stone, is conceivable only for the Prophets, peace be upon them, and the saints. Then this is granted to them after the grace of God Almighty through prolonged spiritual struggle, for the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would say to the world, "Away from me," when it would appear to him in its adornment.

Ali, may God honor his countenance, used to say: "O yellow gold, deceive other than me; O white silver, deceive other than me." This was because he sensed within himself the emergence of beginnings of delusion by them, were it not that he had seen the proof of his Lord. And that is absolute richness, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Richness is not from abundant possessions; rather, richness is the richness of the soul." If that is remote, then the most beneficial for all creation is the loss of wealth, even if they give it in charity and spend it on good deeds. For they cannot, in their ability to possess wealth, avoid finding familiarity with this world, taking pleasure in the ability to have it, and sensing comfort in spending it. All of this begets attachment to this world, and to the extent the servant becomes attached to this world, he becomes estranged from the Hereafter. To the extent he becomes attached to any attribute other than the attribute of knowing God, he becomes estranged from God and from His love. Whenever the causes of attachment to this world are severed, the heart withdraws from the world and its adornment. When the heart withdraws from all besides God Almighty and is a believer in God, it inevitably turns to God, for an empty heart is inconceivable. In existence, there is nothing but God Almighty and other than Him. So whoever turns to other than Him has withdrawn from Him, and whoever turns to Him has withdrawn from other than Him. His turning to one is proportionate to his withdrawal from the other, and his nearness to one is proportionate to his distance from the other. They are like the east and the west, which are two directions: one oscillating between them, to the degree he draws near to one, he distances from the other. Indeed, the very essence of nearness to one is the very essence of distance from the other. Thus, the very essence of love for this world is the very essence of hatred for God Almighty. Therefore, the aspirant's focus should be on his heart's aversion from the world and his attachment to it. Thus, the superiority of the poor and the rich is according only to the attachment of their hearts to wealth. If they are equal in that, their ranks are equal. However, this is a slippery foothold and a place of delusion, for the rich person may think his heart is detached from wealth, while it lies buried within his inner self without him sensing it. He only senses it when he loses it. So let him test himself by parting with it or if it is stolen from him. If he finds his heart inclining toward it, let him know he was deluded. How many a man sold a slave-girl of his, thinking his heart was detached from her, yet after the sale was finalized and the slave-girl handed over, a fire that had been hidden within his heart blazed, and he then realized he had been deluded, and that passion had been concealed in his heart like fire hidden beneath ashes. This is the condition of all the wealthy except the Prophets and the saints. If that is impossible or remote, then let us state plainly that poverty is more beneficial and superior for all creation, because the poor person's connection and attachment to the world is weaker, and in proportion to the weakness of his connection, the reward for his glorifications and acts of worship is multiplied. For the movements of the tongue are not desired for their own sake, but to affirm through them the familiarity with the One remembered. Their effect in arousing familiarity in a heart empty of other than the Remembered is not like their effect in a heart preoccupied. Therefore, some of the early pious said: "The likeness of one who worships while seeking the world is like one who extinguishes fire with chaff, and like one who washes his hand from filth with a fish."

Abu Sulayman al-Darani, may God have mercy upon him, said: The sigh of a poor man, devoid of a desire he cannot attain, is better than the worship of a rich man for a thousand years.

From al-Dahhak, it is said: Whoever enters the marketplace and sees something he desires, yet exercises patience and seeks reward from God, it is better for him than spending a thousand dinars entirely in the path of God, the Exalted.

A man said to Bishr ibn al-Harith, may God have mercy upon him: "Pray for me, for my dependents have brought me hardship." He replied: "When your dependents say to you, 'We have no flour nor bread,' then call upon God at that moment, for your supplication is superior to mine."

The likeness of a wealthy worshipper is as a garden upon a refuse heap, and the likeness of a poor worshipper is as a necklace of jewels upon the neck of a beautiful woman.
They used to dislike receiving the knowledge of spiritual realization from the wealthy, and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, said: "O God, I ask You for humility before the righteous among my soul, and for detachment from that which exceeds sufficiency."

If even a companion of the caliber of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him, in his state of perfection, was wary of this world and its possessions, then how can there be any doubt that the absence of wealth is more wholesome than its presence? For the best condition of a wealthy person is that he acquires it lawfully and spends it righteously, yet even so, his reckoning will be prolonged on the plains of Resurrection and his waiting will be extended. And whoever is subjected to a detailed reckoning is surely punished. It is for this reason that 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf was delayed from entering Paradise, as he was preoccupied with his account, just as the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saw him. For this reason, Abu al-Darda', may God be pleased with him, said: "I would not love to have a shop at the door of the mosque, where I would not miss a prayer or remembrance, and earn fifty dinars every day to spend in the cause of God Almighty." He was asked, "Then what do you dislike?" He replied, "A bad reckoning."

Thus said Sufyan, may God have mercy on him: The poor have chosen three things, and the wealthy have chosen three things: The poor have chosen tranquility of the soul, emptiness of the heart, and lightness in the reckoning; while the wealthy have chosen toil of the soul, preoccupation of the heart, and severity in the reckoning.

What Ibn ‘Ata mentioned—that richness is an attribute of the Divine Reality and is therefore superior—is correct. However, this applies only when a servant is rich in the sense of being equally indifferent to the presence and absence of wealth, so that both states are the same to him. But if he is rich only when wealth is present and feels need for its continuance, his richness does not resemble the richness of God, exalted be He, for God is rich by His Essence, not by something conceivable to perish—whereas wealth can perish, as by theft. The rebuttal mentioned—that God is not rich through accidents or causes—is valid in censuring a rich person who desires the permanence of wealth.

What you mentioned—that the attributes of the Divine Reality are not fitting for a servant—is not correct. Indeed, knowledge is among His attributes, and it is the most excellent thing for a servant. Rather, the ultimate aim of a servant is to be adorned with the character traits of God, exalted be He. I have heard some shaykhs say: “If the seeker asks you the way to God before he has traversed the path, the ninety‑nine Names become attributes for him”—meaning he attains a share of each one. As for arrogance, it is not fitting for a servant, for arrogance toward one who does not deserve it is not among the attributes of God, exalted be He. But arrogance toward one who deserves it—such as the believer’s arrogance toward the unbeliever, the learned toward the ignorant, and the obedient toward the disobedient—is fitting for him. Yes, arrogance may be intended as vanity, haughtiness, and causing harm, and that is not a description of God, exalted be He. Rather, God is described as greater than everything and as knowing that He is so. The servant is commanded to seek the highest stations if he is capable, but by deserving them as is his right, not by falsehood and deception.

Thus the servant should know that the believer is greater than the unbeliever, the obedient greater than the disobedient, the learned greater than the ignorant, and man greater than the beast, the inanimate, and the plant—and closer to God, exalted be He, than they. If he were to see this quality with a certain knowledge free from doubt, the quality of arrogance would be realized in him and be fitting for him and a virtue in his regard. However, he has no means to know that, for it depends on the final ending, and he does not know how the ending will be or how it will come about. Therefore, due to his ignorance of that, he must not assume for himself a rank above the rank of an unbeliever; for perhaps the unbeliever will be sealed with faith, while he himself may be sealed with unbelief. Hence that is not fitting for him because of the deficiency of his knowledge concerning the outcome.

Since knowing a thing as it truly is constitutes perfection for him—because knowledge is among the attributes of God, exalted be He—and since knowing some things may harm him, that knowledge becomes a deficiency for him, for no knowledge that harms is among the attributes of God, exalted be He. Therefore, knowing matters that contain no harm is what can be conceived in the servant from the attributes of God, exalted be He. No wonder it is the ultimate virtue, and by it the prophets, the saints, and the scholars excel.

Thus, if the presence and absence of wealth are equal to him, this is a kind of richness that in one respect resembles the richness ascribed to God, glorified and exalted be He, and it is a virtue. But richness through the presence of wealth contains no virtue at all. This clarifies the relation between the state of the contented poor and the state of the grateful rich.

The Second Station: On the Comparison Between the State of the Eager Poor and the State of the Eager Rich

Let us suppose this in a single individual who seeks wealth, strives for it, lacks it, then attains it. He thus experiences a state of lack and a state of possession. Which of the two states is superior? We say: We must examine. If what he seeks is indispensable for livelihood, and his intention is to tread the path of religion and be aided by it therein, then the state of possession is superior. For poverty preoccupies him with seeking, and one who seeks sustenance cannot engage in reflection and remembrance except with a capacity impaired by preoccupation. The one who is provided for is the one who is capable. For this reason, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "O Allah, make the provision for the family of Muhammad just sufficient." And he said: "Poverty almost becomes disbelief"—meaning poverty involving necessity in what is indispensable.

If, however, what is acquired exceeds the need, or if what is sought is the measure of need but the purpose is not to seek aid by it for treading the path of religion, then the state of poverty is superior and more beneficial. For they are equal in covetousness and love of wealth, and equal in that neither intends by it to seek aid for the way of religion, and equal in that neither is exposed to sin due to poverty or wealth. But they differ in that the possessor finds comfort in what he possesses, so his love for it becomes firmly rooted in his heart and he becomes content with the world. The lacking, needy person, however, turns his heart away from the world, and the world becomes to him like a prison from which he seeks deliverance.

Whenever all matters are equal and two men depart from the world, one of whom is more inclined to the world, his state is inevitably worse, for his heart turns to the world and feels estranged from the Hereafter in proportion to the strength of his comfort with the world. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Indeed, the Spirit of Holiness breathed into my heart: 'Love whom you love, for you will part from him.'" This is an admonition that parting from the beloved is severe. Therefore, you should love He who does not part from you—that is, Allah, the Exalted—and not love what parts from you—that is, the world. For if you love the world, you will dislike meeting Allah, the Exalted. Thus, your arrival by death will be to what you dislike, and your parting from what you love. For anyone who parts from a beloved, the pain of parting is according to his love and the degree of his comfort. The comfort of the possessor of the world, who has power over it, is greater than the comfort of one who lacks it, even if he is covetous of it.

Thus, through this verification, it has become clear that poverty is the nobler, superior, and more beneficial state for all of creation, except in two instances: The first is a wealth like the wealth of 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, for whom possession and lack are equal. Possession then becomes an increase for him, as he benefits by it through the supplications of the poor and needy and the gathering of their concerns. The second is poverty below the measure of necessity, for that almost becomes disbelief, and there is no good in it in any way—unless his possession sustains his life, and then he uses his strength and life for disbelief and sins. If he were to die of hunger, his sins would be fewer. Thus, it is more beneficial for him to die of hunger and not find a way to what he is compelled to seek. This is the detailed discourse on wealth and poverty.

The consideration remains regarding a poor person who is greedy and voraciously obsessed with seeking wealth, having no concern but that, and a wealthy person who is similarly intense in his greed to preserve wealth, yet whose grief at losing wealth, were he to lose it, would not equal the grief of the poor person at his poverty. This is a matter for careful reflection, and the more apparent view is that their distance from God, exalted is He, corresponds to the strength of their grief at the loss of wealth, and their nearness corresponds to the weakness of their grief at its loss; and the full knowledge thereof rests with God, exalted is He.

Explanation of the Etiquette of the Poor in Their Poverty

Know that the spiritual seeker has inner disciplines, social etiquettes, and outward actions which he ought to observe.

As for the inner discipline, it is that there be no aversion within him to what God, exalted is He, has tested him with in terms of poverty. That is to say, he should not be averse to the act of God, exalted is He, inasmuch as it is His act—even if he is averse to poverty itself—like the one being cupped, who is averse to the cupping due to the pain it causes him, yet he is not averse to the act of the cupper nor averse to the cupper himself; indeed, he may even feel indebted to him for a favor. This is the lowest of its degrees, and it is obligatory. Its opposite is forbidden and nullifies the reward of poverty. This is the meaning of his saying, peace be upon him: "O company of the poor, give God contentment from your hearts, that you may attain the reward of your poverty; otherwise, you will not." Higher than this is that he not be averse to poverty at all, but rather be content with it. Higher still than that is that he seek it and rejoice in it, knowing the perils of wealth. And in his innermost being, he relies upon God, exalted is He, trusting in Him regarding the provision of his necessity, that it will come to him without fail, and he is averse to any increase beyond sufficiency. And Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: Verily, God, exalted is He, has punishments through poverty and rewards through poverty. Among the signs that poverty is a reward are that his character improves through it, he obeys his Lord by means of it, he does not complain of his state, and he thanks God, exalted is He, for his poverty. Among its signs—if it is a punishment—are that his character becomes corrupt, he disobeys his Lord by abandoning obedience to Him, he complains excessively, and he is discontent with the divine decree. This indicates that not every poor person is praiseworthy; rather, the praiseworthy one is he who does not show discontent, but is content, or even rejoices in poverty and is pleased, hoping for its fruit. For it has been said: No servant is given anything of this world without it being said to him: "Take it upon three thirds: preoccupation, anxiety, and lengthy accounting."

As for the outward discipline: it is to manifest abstinence and refinement, and not to display complaint and poverty. Rather, one should conceal his poverty and conceal that he is concealing it. For in the Hadith it is said: "Verily, God Almighty loves the abstinent poor man who is the provider for his family."

And He, the Exalted, said: "The ignorant suppose them to be wealthy because of their self-restraint."

Sufyan said: The best of deeds is to maintain composure in the face of tribulation.

Some have said: Concealing poverty is among the treasures of righteousness.

As for in deeds, his manner is that he should not humble himself before a wealthy person on account of his wealth; rather, he should hold himself above him.

Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: How excellent is the humility of the rich toward the poor, out of desire for the reward of God Most High. Yet more excellent than that is the pride of the poor toward the rich, out of trust in God Almighty. This is a rank. And lesser than it is to not associate with the wealthy nor desire to sit with them, for that is among the beginnings of covetousness.

Sufyan al-Thawri, may God have mercy on him, said: When a poor man mingles with the wealthy, know that he is a hypocrite; and when he mingles with the ruler, know that he is a thief.

And one of the knowers said: When a poor man mingles with the wealthy, his bond is loosened; if he then covets from them, his protection is severed; and if he finds repose in them, he is led astray. One must not remain silent in mentioning the truth to flatter the wealthy or in hope of receiving gifts.

As for his conduct in his actions: that he should not cease worship due to poverty, nor withhold giving the little that remains beyond his need, for that is the utmost effort of one with little, and its merit is greater than abundant wealth given from the surplus of a rich man.

Zayd ibn Aslam reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A single dirham given in charity is more excellent in the sight of God than one hundred thousand dirhams." It was asked: "How can that be, O Messenger of God?" He said: "A man gave one hundred thousand dirhams from his abundant wealth as charity, and another man gave a single dirham from his two dirhams—possessing nothing else—with a heart contented in giving it. Thus, the possessor of the single dirham became more excellent than the possessor of the hundred thousand." And one ought not to hoard wealth, but rather take only what suffices for his need and give away the remainder. In hoarding there are three degrees: The first is to hoard nothing except for one's day and night, and this is the degree of the truthful ones.

The second level is to store provisions for forty days, for anything beyond that falls into the realm of prolonged hope. Scholars have understood this from the appointed time set by God, the Exalted, for Moses, peace be upon him, from which they derived the permissibility of hoping for life for forty days—and this is the station of the God-fearing.

The third level is to store provisions for one’s year, which is the utmost of ranks and the rank of the righteous. Whoever exceeds this in hoarding has fallen into the common multitude and is entirely outside the bounds of the elect. Thus, the sufficiency of the righteous yet weak lies in the tranquility of his heart regarding his sustenance for the year; the sufficiency of the elect lies in forty days; and the sufficiency of the elect among the elect lies in a day and a night. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, divided his wives according to similar categories: some he would provide with sustenance for a year when circumstances allowed, and some with sustenance for forty days and a night—this being the portion of ‘Ā’ishah and Ḥafṣah.

Explanation of the Etiquette of the Seeker in Accepting Gifts

when it comes to him without request

The indigent should observe three matters regarding what comes to him: the essence of the wealth, the intention of the giver, and his own intention in receiving.  
As for the essence of the wealth, it should be lawful and free from all ambiguities. If there is any ambiguity in it, he should be cautious against taking it. We have already mentioned in the Book of the Lawful and the Forbidden the degrees of ambiguity, what must be avoided, and what is recommended to avoid.

As for the intention of the giver, it is not free from possibilities: either his intention is to heal his heart and seek his love, and that is the gift; or it is for reward, and that is charity and zakah; or it is for remembrance, ostentation, and reputation, either in isolation or mixed with the remaining intentions.

As for the first—which is the gift—there is no harm in accepting it, for accepting it is the Sunnah of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him. However, it should not involve a sense of obligation. If it involves a sense of obligation, then it is preferable to leave it. If he knows that part of it is something in which the sense of obligation is great, then let him return that part and not the other part; for indeed, clarified butter, dried yogurt, and a ram were gifted to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and he accepted the clarified butter and the dried yogurt and returned the ram.

He, peace be upon him, would accept from some people and refuse from others. And he said: "I was indeed inclined to accept gifts only from a Qurayshi, a Thaqafi, an Ansari, or a Dawsī." And a group of the Followers acted in this manner.

A purse containing fifty dirhams was brought to Fath al-Mawsili, and he said: "Ata' narrated to us from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: 'Whoever is provided sustenance without asking for it and then refuses it, he has only refused it from God.'" Then he opened the purse, took a single dirham from it, and returned the rest.

Al-Hasan also narrated this tradition. However, when a man brought him a purse and a bundle of fine Khurasani garments, he refused them, saying: "Whoever sits in my gathering and accepts from people something like this will meet God Almighty on the Day of Resurrection with no share [of good]." This indicates that the matter is more stringent for the scholar and the preacher in accepting gifts. Yet, Al-Hasan would accept from his close companions.

Ibrahim al-Taymi would ask his companions for a dirham or two, or something similar, but when others offered him hundreds, he would not take them. Some of them, when a friend gave him something, would say: "Leave it with you and observe: if after accepting it, your heart holds me in higher esteem than before the acceptance, then inform me so I may take it; otherwise, do not." The sign of this is that he would find it difficult to refuse if he were to return it, and would rejoice in the acceptance, seeing the favor as being upon himself in accepting his friend's gift. If he knew that a sense of obligation would mix with it, then taking it is permissible, but it is disliked among the sincere poor.

Bishr said: "I have never asked anyone for anything except al-Saqati, because his asceticism in this world is firmly established with me. He rejoices when something leaves his hand and is vexed by its remaining with him, so I become an aid to him in what he loves."

A Khurasani man came to Junayd, may God have mercy on him, with wealth and asked him to consume it. He said, "Distribute it among the poor." The man replied, "I do not desire this." Junayd said, "When will I live long enough to consume this?" The man said, "I do not wish for you to spend it on vinegar and herbs, but rather on sweets and delights." Junayd accepted it from him. The Khurasani said, "I find no one in Baghdad more trustworthy than you." Junayd replied, "And it is not fitting to accept except from one like you."

The second type: that it be for the sake of pure reward, such as charity or alms. In this case, one must examine the attributes of his own soul: is he deserving of alms? If he is uncertain, then it is a matter of doubt. We have detailed this in the book *The Secrets of Zakat*. If it is charity and the giver gives it for the sake of his religion, then let him look into his inner state. If he is secretly involved in sin, knowing that the giver, if aware of it, would naturally recoil and would not have drawn near to God by giving charity to him, then taking it is forbidden. This is like if he gave it thinking him to be a scholar or a descendant of Ali, and he is not. In such a case, taking it is purely forbidden, with no doubt in it.

The third is when his intention is for show, ostentation, and fame; thus, his corrupt aim should be rejected and he should not be accepted, for that would be aiding him in his corrupt purpose.

Sufyan al-Thawri would refuse what was given to him, saying: "If I knew they would not mention it boastfully, I would accept it." Some of them were reproached for refusing the gifts that came to him, and he said: "They only intended their gifts out of compassion for them and sincere advice, because they mention it and love for it to be known, so their wealth is lost and their rewards are nullified."

As for the intention in accepting, one should consider: is he in need of it for what is indispensable, or is he independent of it? If he is in need of it and is safe from the doubts and harms we mentioned concerning the giver, then accepting is best for him. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The giver from abundance is not more greatly rewarded than the taker when he is in need."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever receives something of this wealth without asking or coveting it, it is but a provision that God has directed to him." In another wording: "Then let him not refuse it."

Some scholars have said: He who is given to but does not take, asks but is not given.

Sari al-Saqati used to send something to Ahmad ibn Hanbal—may God have mercy on them both—but on one occasion he returned it. Sari said to him, “O Ahmad, beware the harm of refusal, for it is more severe than the harm of acceptance.” Ahmad replied, “Repeat to me what you said!” So he repeated it, and Ahmad said, “I only returned it to you because I have provisions for a month. Keep it with you, and when a month has passed, send it to me.”

Some scholars have said: In refusing while in need, one fears punishment from being afflicted with greed or falling into doubt or the like. As for when what comes to him exceeds his need, then it is not free from two possibilities: either his state is being occupied with himself or undertaking the affairs of the poor and spending on them due to the gentleness and generosity in his nature. If he is occupied with himself, then there is no justification for taking and keeping it if he is a seeker of the path of the Hereafter, for that is pure following of desire, and every deed not for God is a path of Satan or an invitation to it. Whoever hovers around the forbidden pasture is likely to fall into it. Then for him are two stations: one is to take openly and return in secret, or to take openly and distribute in secret. This is the station of the truthful ones; it is difficult for the soul and none can bear it except one whose soul has become tranquil through spiritual discipline.

The second is to decline and not accept, so that the giver may direct it to one more needy than himself, or to accept and convey it to one more needy, performing both acts in secrecy or both openly. We have previously discussed whether it is preferable to manifest acceptance or conceal it in the Book of the Secrets of Zakat, along with a collection of rulings concerning poverty; let it be sought from its place. As for Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s refusal to accept the private gift of Sari al-Saqati—may God have mercy on both—this was due to his self-sufficiency, as he possessed sustenance for a month and did not deem it fitting for himself to occupy with receiving and redirecting it to another; for in that lie harms and perils, and scrupulous piety is to be cautious from the grounds of harm when one does not feel secure from the devil’s guile against his soul.

One of the residents near Mecca said: I had some dirhams I had set aside to spend in the path of God. Then I heard a poor man who had finished his circumambulation saying in a subdued voice: "I am hungry as you see, naked as you see, so what do you see, O You who see and are not seen?" I looked and saw him wearing worn-out garments that barely covered him. I said to myself: I will not find a better place for my dirhams than this. So I brought them to him. He looked at them, then took five dirhams and said: "Four are the price of two waist-wrappers, and one dirham I will spend on three things. I have no need for the rest," and he returned the remainder. He said: I saw him the following night wearing two new waist-wrappers, and something stirred in my heart about him. He turned to me, took my hand, and took me around with him for a week—each circuit over a jewel from the earth's minerals that crunched under our feet up to the ankles: among them gold, silver, ruby, pearl, and precious gems, though this was not visible to people. He said: "All of this has been given to me, but I renounced it and take from the hands of creation, for these are burdens and a trial, while that is a mercy and blessing for the servants." The intended meaning of this is: What comes to you beyond the measure of need comes only as a test and trial, so that God may observe what you will do with it. But what comes to you according to the measure of need comes as gentleness toward you. So do not neglect to distinguish between gentleness and trial.

God Almighty has said: "Verily, We have made all that is on the earth an adornment for it, that We may test them as to which of them is best in conduct."

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The son of Adam has no rightful claim except to three things: food that sustains his spine, a garment that covers his nakedness, and a house that shelters him. Whatever is beyond that is for reckoning."

Therefore, in taking the measure of need from these three, you are rewarded; and in what exceeds that, if you do not disobey God, you are exposed to account, and if you disobey God, you are exposed to punishment.

Another form of trial is when you resolve to abandon a pleasure among pleasures to draw nearer to God Almighty and to break a trait of the self, yet it comes to you effortlessly and purely to test the strength of your intellect. The preferable course is to abstain from it, for if the soul is permitted to break a resolution, it becomes accustomed to breaking covenants and returns to its habits, and it cannot then be subdued. Repelling that is essential, and that is asceticism. If you take it and divert it to one in need, that is the ultimate degree of asceticism, and none can achieve it except the truthful ones. As for when your state is one of generosity, giving, and undertaking the rights of the poor, and looking after a group of the righteous, then take what exceeds your need, for it is not beyond the need of the poor. Hasten to spend it upon them and do not hoard it, for withholding it even for a single night contains temptation and trial. Perhaps it becomes pleasing to your heart, so you hold onto it, and it becomes a trial for you. Indeed, a group has undertaken serving the poor, making it a means to expand in wealth and indulge in food and drink, and that is destruction. Whoever intends kindness and seeks reward through it may borrow based on good expectation of God, not relying on oppressive rulers. If God provides him from lawful means, he repays it. If he dies before repayment, God Almighty repays it on his behalf and satisfies his creditors, provided his situation is disclosed to the one who lends to him, so he does not deceive the lender or trick him with promises; rather, he reveals his condition to him so that he may proceed to lend him with insight. The debt of such a man is obligatory to be repaid from the treasury of the Muslims and from alms. God Almighty has said: "And whoever is constrained in his provision, let him spend from what God has given him." It is said its meaning is: let one sell one of his two garments. And it is said its meaning is: let him borrow by his standing, for that is from what God has given him.

Some have said: Verily, God Almighty has servants who spend according to the measure of their goods, and God has servants who spend according to the measure of their goodly trust in God Almighty.

And one of them passed away, bequeathing his wealth to three groups: the strong, the generous, and the wealthy. He was asked: "Who are these?" He replied: As for the strong, they are the people of reliance on God, the Exalted; as for the generous, they are the people of good expectation in God, the Exalted; and as for the wealthy, they are the people of complete devotion to God, the Exalted.

Therefore, whenever these conditions are found in the recipient, the wealth, and the giver, let him take it. And he should regard what he takes as coming from God, not from the giver; for the giver is merely an intermediary who has been made subservient to giving, compelled to it by the motives, desires, and beliefs that have been imposed upon him. It has been related that a certain man invited Shaqiq along with fifty of his companions. The host set out a fine meal, and when they sat down, he said to his companions, "This man says: 'Whoever does not see that I have prepared and presented this food, then my food is forbidden to him.'" So they all stood up and left, except for a young man among them who was of lower rank. The host said to Shaqiq, "What did you intend by this?" He replied, "I wished to test the sincere devotion to the Oneness of God in all my companions."

And Moses, peace be upon him, said: "O Lord, You have placed my provision thus in the hands of the Children of Israel; this one feeds me by day and that one by night." So God, exalted is He, revealed to him: "Thus do I deal with My friends—I channel their provisions through the hands of the idle among My servants, that they may be rewarded for it." Therefore, the giver should not be seen except from the perspective that he is a subservient agent, rewarded by God, exalted is He. We ask God for good success in what pleases Him.

An Exposition on the Prohibition of Begging Without Necessity and the Etiquettes of the Indigent in Dire Need

Know that numerous admonitions and strictures have been conveyed regarding begging, yet there has also come that which indicates a concession, as the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The beggar has a right, even if he comes upon a horse."

In the hadith: "Respond to the one who asks, even with a burnt hoof." If asking were absolutely forbidden, it would not be permissible to assist the transgressor in his transgression, and giving is a form of assistance. The clarification here is that asking is fundamentally forbidden, and it is only permitted out of necessity or a pressing need akin to necessity. If there is an alternative to it, then it is forbidden. We said it is fundamentally prohibited because it is inseparable from three forbidden matters: The first: Displaying complaint against God Almighty, for asking is a display of poverty and a mention of the insufficiency of God's blessings upon him, which is the very essence of complaint. Just as if a slave were to ask, his asking would be a reproach against his master, likewise the asking of servants is a reproach against God Almighty. This should be forbidden and not permissible except out of necessity, just as carrion becomes permissible.

The second point is that it involves the supplicant humbling himself before other than God Almighty, and it is not for a believer to humble himself before other than God. Rather, he must humble himself before his Master, for in that lies his honor. As for the rest of creation, they are servants like him, so it is not fitting to humble oneself before them except out of necessity. In asking, there is humiliation for the asker in relation to the one asked.

The third is that it rarely spares the one asked from harm, for perhaps his soul does not readily consent to giving. If he gives out of shame before the asker or for show, it is forbidden for the receiver to take it. And if he withholds, he may feel ashamed and be pained within himself by the withholding, seeing himself in the guise of the miserly. In giving, his wealth is diminished; in withholding, his standing is diminished—both are harmful, and the asker is the cause of the harm. To cause harm is forbidden except out of necessity. Once you comprehend these three perils, you comprehend his saying, peace be upon him: "Begging from people is among the abominations—what is made lawful of abominations besides it?"[62] So observe how he named it an abomination, and it is not hidden that an abomination is only permitted out of necessity, just as drinking wine is permitted for one choking on a morsel who finds nothing else. And he, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever asks from people to increase his wealth only seeks more of the embers of Hell."[63] "And whoever asks while having what suffices him will come on the Day of Resurrection with his face a bone rattling, with no flesh upon it." In another wording: "His asking will be scratches and gashes upon his face."[64] These wordings are explicit in prohibition and severity. And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, took the pledge from a people upon Islam, stipulating upon them hearing and obedience, then said to them a hidden word: "And do not ask people for anything."[65].

He, peace be upon him, would often enjoin self-restraint from begging and say: "Whoever asks of us, we give to him; and whoever is self-sufficient, God enriches him; and whoever does not ask of us is more beloved to us."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Be independent of people, and the less you ask, the better."
They said: "Even from you, O Messenger of God?" He said: "Even from me."

And 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, heard a beggar asking after the Maghrib prayer. He said to one of his people, "Give the man supper," so he gave him supper. Then he heard him a second time begging, and he said, "Did I not tell you to give the man supper?" He replied, "I did give him supper." 'Umar looked, and behold, beneath his hand was a saddlebag filled with bread. He said, "You are not a beggar, but a merchant." Then he took the saddlebag, scattered its contents before the camels of charity, and struck him with a whip, saying, "Do not do it again." Had his begging not been unlawful, he would not have struck him with the whip nor taken his saddlebag. Perhaps the weak jurist, of narrow understanding and constricted comprehension, would deem this action of 'Umar improbable and say, "As for his striking him, it is discipline, and the Sacred Law has prescribed discretionary punishment. As for his taking his property, it is confiscation, and the Sacred Law has not prescribed punishment by taking property. So how did he deem it permissible?" This improbability stems from a deficiency in jurisprudence. Where does the jurisprudence of all jurists appear compared to the comprehension of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, and his insight into the secrets of God's religion and the welfare of His servants? Do you suppose he did not know that confiscation of property is impermissible? Or he knew it but proceeded out of anger in an act of disobedience to God—God forbid!—or he intended deterrence for a beneficial purpose by a way not legislated by God's Prophet? Far be it! For that too would be disobedience. Rather, the juristic insight that became clear to him therein was that he saw him as not in need of begging, and he knew that whoever gave him something gave it believing he was in need, and he had been deceitful. Thus, what he took did not enter his ownership due to the deception and the difficulty of distinguishing it and returning it to its owners, for its specific owners were not known. It remained property without an owner, so it was obligatory to spend it on public interests, and the camels of charity and their fodder are among the public interests. The taking from a beggar who falsely displays need is analogous to taking from one who claims, "I am an 'Alawi (descendant of 'Ali)," while lying, for he does not own what he takes; just as taking from a righteous Sufi who is inwardly committing a sin—if the giver knew of it, he would not have given. We have mentioned in several places that what they take on this basis they do not own; it is unlawful for them, and they are obliged to return it to its owner. Thus, the action of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, is used as evidence for the validity of this meaning, which many jurists are heedless of, and we have established it in several places. Do not infer from your heedlessness of this jurisprudence the invalidity of 'Umar's action.

When you understand that asking is permitted out of necessity, know that a thing is either something one is compelled to need, or something one needs with an important or a light need, or something one can do without. These are four states: As for what one is compelled to need, it is the asking of the hungry when he fears for himself death or illness, and the asking of the naked whose body is exposed with nothing to cover it, and it is permissible whenever the conditions in the one asked are found—that it be permissible, and in the one asked from—that he be inwardly content, and in the asker—that he be incapable of earning. For whoever is capable of earning, asking is not lawful for him unless the pursuit of knowledge consumes all his time, and everyone who can write a line is capable of earning through scribal work.

As for the self-sufficient, it is he who seeks something while possessing its like or the likes thereof; his asking is absolutely forbidden. These are two clear extremes.

As for one in genuine need, such as a sick person who requires medicine—though his fear would not be apparent if he did not use it, yet he is not free from apprehension—or like one who has an outer garment but no shirt beneath it in winter, suffering from cold in a manner that does not reach the level of necessity, or likewise one who asks for fare while capable of walking with hardship—for such a person, permissibility should be extended, for it is indeed a real need. Yet patience is superior, and by asking he forsakes what is better. His asking is not termed reprehensible so long as he is truthful in his request, saying, "I have no shirt beneath my garment, and the cold causes me distress that I can bear, but it is burdensome." If he is truthful, his truthfulness will be an expiation for his asking, if God Almighty wills.

As for the minor need, it is like asking for a shirt to wear over one's clothes when going out to conceal the tears in one's garments from people's sight, or like one who asks for condiments while having bread, or like one who asks for the hire of a horse on a journey while having the hire of a donkey, or asks for the hire of a litter while being capable of riding an animal. This and the like, if it involves deception by displaying a need other than the true one, is forbidden. If it does not involve that, but contains any of the three harms—complaint, humiliation, or annoyance of the one asked—it is forbidden, because such a need does not warrant permitting these harms. If it contains none of that, it is permissible though disliked.

If you ask: How is it possible to free the request from these dangers? Know that complaint is repelled by manifesting gratitude to God and independence from creation, and not asking the ask of one in need, but rather saying: I am independent with what I possess, yet the folly of my soul demands a garment beyond my garments, which is surplus to need and superfluity from the soul. Thus he exits by this from the bounds of complaint. As for humiliation, it is by asking his father, his relative, or his friend who knows that this will not diminish him in his sight nor will he despise him due to his asking; or the generous man who has prepared his wealth for such noble acts, who rejoices at finding one like this and assumes from him a favor by accepting it. Thus humiliation falls away from him by that, for humiliation is inevitably attached to the favor. As for causing harm, the way to be free from it is not to specify a person with the request explicitly, but to cast the speech indirectly such that none proceeds to giving except one volunteering with sincere desire. If among the people is a person of repute who, if he did not give, would be blamed, this is harm, for perhaps he gives fearing blame, and his inner wish would be deliverance if he could attain it without blame. But if he asks a specific person, he should not state it plainly but hint in a way that leaves him a path to overlook if he wishes. If he does not overlook despite the ability to do so, that is due to his desire and that he is not harmed by it. And he should ask from whom he would not feel shame if he refused him or overlooked him, for shame from the asker harms just as showing off with non-askers harms.

If you ask: If he takes it while knowing that the motivator of the giver is shame from him or from those present, and were it not for that he would not have initiated it for him, is it lawful or dubious? I say: That is purely unlawful, with no disagreement therein among the Imams. Its ruling is the ruling of taking another's wealth by beating and seizure, for there is no difference between striking the exterior of his skin with whips of wood and striking the interior of his heart with the whip of shame and fear of blame—and striking the interior is more severe in wounding the hearts of the discerning. It is not permissible to say: He has outwardly consented to it, for the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "I judge only by the outward, and God takes charge of the secrets." This is a necessity in adjudicating disputes, for it is not possible to refer them to the inward states and circumstantial evidence, so they are compelled to judge by the outward statement of the tongue, even though it is an interpreter of much falsehood, but necessity demanded it. This question concerns what is between the servant and God Almighty, and the Judge therein is the Most Just of Judges. Hearts before Him are like tongues before other judges. So do not look in such a matter except to your own heart, even if they give you legal opinion after legal opinion. For the jurisconsult is an instructor for the judge and the ruler so they may judge in the realm of testimony, while the jurisconsults of the hearts are the scholars of the Hereafter, and by their legal opinion is salvation from the authority of the Hereafter, just as by the legal opinion of the jurist is salvation from the tyranny of the authority of this world. So if he takes it with dislike, he does not own it between himself and God Almighty, and he must return it to its owner. If he feels ashamed to take it back and does not take it back, then he must reward him for that with what equals its value in the form of a gift or reciprocation to absolve his responsibility. If he does not accept his gift, then he must return that to his heirs. If it perishes in his possession, he is liable for it between himself and God Almighty, and he is disobedient by disposing of it and by the asking through which harm occurred.

If you say: This is an inward matter difficult to ascertain, so how can one find deliverance from it? For perhaps the questioner may think he is content while inwardly he is not. I say: For this reason, the God-fearing abandoned asking altogether, so they would not take anything from anyone at all. Bishr, for instance, would not take from anyone at all except from al-Sarī—may God have mercy on them both—and he said: "Because I knew he rejoiced at wealth leaving his hand, and I assist him in what he loves." Indeed, the censure of asking and the emphasis on self-restraint are for this reason: because harm is only permitted out of necessity—that is, when the asker is on the brink of destruction, with no means of deliverance left, and finds no one to give him without aversion and harm; then it is permitted for him, just as eating pork or carrion is permitted. Thus, abstaining was the way of the devout. Among the possessors of hearts were those who trusted their insight in discerning the signs of circumstances, so they would take from some people and not from others. Among them were those who would only take from their close friends. Among them were those who would take from what was given, accepting some and returning some, as the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did with the ram, clarified butter, and dried yogurt. This would come to them without asking, for that occurs only out of desire—but his desire might be coveting status or seeking ostentation and reputation, so they would guard against that. As for asking, they abstained from it altogether except in two situations:

One is necessity, for three prophets asked in a state of necessity: Solomon, Moses, and al-Khidr, peace be upon them. There is no doubt that they only asked from whom they knew desired to grant them.

The second type is asking from friends and brethren, for they used to take what was theirs without request or permission, because the possessors of hearts knew that what is sought is the contentment of the heart, not the utterance of the tongue. They were confident in their brethren that they rejoiced in sharing with them. Thus, they would ask their brethren only when they doubted their brethren's ability to provide what they desired; otherwise, they would dispense with asking. The criterion for the permissibility of asking is that you know the one asked is of such character that if he knew of your need, he would initiate giving without being asked. Therefore, your asking should have no effect except in making your need known. As for stirring his sense of shame or provoking his motive through cunning, no. One confronts the asker in a state where he has no doubt about inner contentment, and in a state where he has no doubt about aversion, knowing this by the indications of circumstances. Taking in the first state is freely permissible; in the second state, it is illicit gain. Between these two states are fluctuating circumstances where one is uncertain; so let him consult his heart therein and abandon what causes unease in the heart, for that is sin. Let him leave what causes him doubt for what does not cause doubt. Perceiving this through the indications of circumstances is easy for one whose insight is strong and whose greed and desire are weak. If greed is strong and insight weak, what conforms to his objective will appear to him, and he will not discern the indications pointing to aversion. Through these subtleties, one comprehends the secret of his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: "The most wholesome food a man eats is from his own earning," for he was given concise, comprehensive speech. For whoever has no earnings nor wealth inherited from the earnings of his father or any of his relatives, let him eat from the hands of people. Even if given without asking, it is given for the sake of his faith. When is his inner state such that if his inward were revealed, he would not be given for his faith's sake? Then what he takes is unlawful. If given upon asking, then where is he whose heart is pleased with giving when asked? And where is he who restricts asking to the limit of necessity? If you examine the conditions of those who eat from the hands of people, you will know that all or most of what they eat is illicit gain, and the wholesome is the earning you or your inheritor have acquired lawfully. Therefore, it is rare for scrupulous piety to coexist with eating from the hands of people. So we ask God, exalted is He, to sever our hope from other than Him, to enrich us with His lawful provision instead of His unlawful, and with His bounty instead of that of any other, by His grace and the vastness of His generosity, for He has power over all He wills.

Explanation of the Measure of Wealth that Makes Begging Forbidden

Know that the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, "Whoever asks from one who appears wealthy is only asking for a burning coal; let him take little or take much," is explicit in its prohibition. However, the definition of wealth is problematic and its estimation difficult, and it is not for us to set the measures; rather, this is to be discerned through authoritative guidance.

It has been reported in the Hadith: "Be content with the richness of God, the Exalted, over that of others." They asked: "And what is that?" He said: "A day's breakfast and a night's supper."

In another Hadith: "Whoever asks while possessing fifty dirhams or their equivalent in gold has asked importunately." And it is reported in another wording: "forty dirhams." However the estimations may differ and the reports be sound, one should conclude that they pertain to different circumstances, for the truth in itself cannot be but one, and a fixed estimation is impossible; the utmost possible therein is approximation. This is only achieved by a division encompassing the conditions of the needy. Thus we say: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "The son of Adam has no rightful claim except to three things: food that sustains his body, a garment that covers his nakedness, and a dwelling in which he resides. Whatever is beyond that is an account." Therefore, let us take these three as the foundation for needs, to clarify their categories and to examine the categories, quantities, and timings. As for the categories, they are these three, and what is analogous to them is attached thereto, so that the rent for a traveler who is incapable of walking is attached to it, as well as what serves a similar purpose among necessities. Attached to his own person are his dependents, his children, and everyone under his guardianship, including his beast of burden as well.

As for quantities, regarding clothing, one should consider what befits people of faith: a single outer garment, a shirt, a head covering, trousers, and footwear. A second of any kind is superfluous, and this principle should be applied to all household furnishings. One should not seek fine garments or use copper or brass vessels where earthenware suffices, for that is unnecessary. Limit the number to one and the type to the humblest of its kinds, unless it is extremely contrary to custom.

As for food, its daily measure is a mudd—as prescribed by the Sacred Law—and its type is what sustains, even if it is barley. Condiments are consistently an excess, while complete abstinence is harmful; seeking them on occasion is a concession. As for lodging, the minimum is what suffices in terms of space, without adornment. Seeking adornment and spaciousness is to ask from a position of apparent sufficiency.

Regarding timeframes, what is needed at present—food for a day and night, a garment to wear, and a shelter to occupy—is unquestionable. Asking for the future, however, has three degrees: first, what is needed tomorrow; second, what is needed in forty or fifty days; third, what is needed within a year. Let it be clear that whoever possesses enough for himself and his dependents for a year, if he has dependents, asking is forbidden, for that is the ultimate sufficiency. Upon this is based the estimation of fifty dirhams in the Hadith, as five dinars suffice a single person for a year with frugality, whereas a provider may not find that enough even if the need arises before the year’s end.

If one is capable of asking and the opportunity will not be missed, it is not permissible to ask because he is currently self-sufficient, and he may not live until tomorrow, thus having asked for what he does not need. Sufficient for him is the day’s lunch and night’s dinner, upon which is based the report specifying this measure. If the opportunity to ask may be missed and he finds no one to give if he delays, asking is permitted, for hoping to survive a year is not far-fetched, and by delaying he fears remaining in desperate need, unable to obtain what sustains him.

If the fear of being unable to ask in the future is weak, and that for which he asks lies outside the realm of necessity, his asking is not free from dislike, the degree of which corresponds to the weakness of the need, the fear of missing the chance, and the remoteness of the time when the need will arise. All this cannot be precisely regulated; it is tied to the servant’s diligent consideration for himself between him and God Almighty. He should consult his heart and act accordingly if he treads the path of the Hereafter.

Whoever’s certainty is stronger, trust in future provision more complete, and contentment with the sustenance of the moment more evident, his rank with God Almighty is higher. To fear the future when God has given you and your dependents the day’s sustenance is nothing but weakness in certainty and heeding Satan’s intimidation. God Almighty has said: “So fear them not, but fear Me, if you are believers,” and Exalted is He: “Satan threatens you with poverty and enjoins upon you immorality, while God promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty.” Asking is among the immoralities permitted only by necessity.

The state of one who asks for a need remote from his present day, even if it is something needed within the year, is more severe than that of one who possesses inherited wealth and saves it for a need beyond the year. Both are permissible according to the apparent legal ruling, but both stem from love of this world, prolonged hope, and lack of trust in God’s bounty. This trait is among the chief causes of ruin. We ask God for good success through His gentleness and generosity.

An Exposition of the States of Those Who Ask

Bishr, may God have mercy upon him, used to say: The poor are of three kinds: a poor person who does not ask, and if given, does not take—this one is with the spiritual beings in the highest paradise; and a poor person who does not ask, but if given, takes—this one is with those brought near in the gardens of Paradise; and a poor person who asks when in need—this one is with the truthful among the companions of the right hand.

Thus, all have unanimously agreed upon condemning begging, and that it, alongside poverty, diminishes one's rank and station.

Shaqiq al-Balkhi asked Ibrahim ibn Adham when he arrived from Khorasan: "How did you leave the poor among your companions?" He replied: "I left them such that if given, they are grateful, and if denied, they are patient"—thinking that by abandoning request, he had praised them to the highest degree. Shaqiq said: "Thus have you left the dogs of Balkh among us." Ibrahim then asked: "How are the poor among you, O Abu Ishaq?" He answered: "The poor among us, if denied, are grateful, and if given, they prefer others." So he kissed his head and said: "You have spoken truthfully, O master."

Indeed, the degrees of those endowed with spiritual states in contentment, patience, gratitude, and supplication are many. Therefore, it is essential for the traveler on the path of the Hereafter to know them and to understand their divisions and the differences in their levels. For if he does not know, he cannot ascend from their lowest depths to their lofty peaks, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high. Man was created in the finest stature, then he was returned to the lowest of the low, then he was commanded to ascend to the highest of the high. Whoever cannot distinguish between low and high is absolutely incapable of ascension. Doubt only concerns one who knows this, for he may still be incapable of it. Those endowed with states may be overcome by a condition that necessitates supplication as an increase for them in their degrees, but relative to their state. For such deeds are according to intentions. This is as narrated: that one of them saw Abu Ishaq al-Nuri, may God have mercy on him, extending his hand and asking people in some places. He said: I considered that immense and found it unbecoming of him, so I went to al-Junayd, may God have mercy on him, and informed him of that. He said: Do not consider this immense, for al-Nuri did not ask people except to give to them; he only asked them so that they would be rewarded in the Hereafter and thus gain reward from where it does not harm them. It is as if he alluded by this to the saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him: "The hand of the giver is the upper hand." Some said: The hand of the giver is the hand of the one who takes the wealth, for he is given reward and power for it, not for what he takes. Then al-Junayd said: Bring the scale. He weighed one hundred dirhams, then grasped a handful and cast it upon the hundred, then said: Carry it to him. I said to myself: A thing is only weighed to know its measure, so how did he mix with it something unknown, and he is a wise man? I went with the purse to al-Nuri. He said: Bring the scale. He weighed one hundred dirhams and said: Return it to him and tell him: I do not accept from you anything, and he took what exceeded the hundred. He said: My astonishment increased, so I asked him. He said: Al-Junayd is a wise man; he wishes to take the rope by both ends: he weighed the hundred for himself seeking the reward of the Hereafter, and he threw upon it a handful without weighing for God, Exalted and Glorified. So I took what was for God, Blessed and Exalted, and returned what he made for himself. He said: I returned it to al-Junayd, and he wept and said: He took his wealth and returned our wealth. God is the One sought for help. So see now how pure their hearts and states were, and how their deeds were purified for God, to the extent that each of them witnessed the heart of his companion without speech of the tongue, but by the mutual witnessing of hearts and the whispering of secrets. That is the result of consuming the lawful, the heart's freedom from love of this world, and turning to God, Exalted, with the utmost aspiration. Whoever denies this before experiencing its path is ignorant, like one who denies, for example, that a medicine is a purgative before drinking it. And whoever denies it after striving long until he expended his utmost effort and did not attain, then denies it for others, he is like one who drank the purgative and it did not affect him specifically due to an internal ailment, so he began to deny that the medicine is a purgative. This, though in ignorance less than the first, is not devoid of a sufficient share of ignorance. Rather, the insightful is one of two men: either a man traveling the path to whom has appeared what appeared to them—he is the possessor of taste and knowledge and has reached the essence of certainty; or a man who did not travel the path, or traveled and did not arrive, but he believed in that and affirmed it—he is the possessor of the knowledge of certainty, even if he has not reached the essence of certainty. The knowledge of certainty also has a rank, though below the essence of certainty. Whoever is devoid of the knowledge of certainty is outside the company of the believers and will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the company of the deniers, the arrogant, who are the slain of weak hearts and the followers of devils. So we ask God, Exalted, to make us among those firmly grounded in knowledge, who say: "We believe in it; all is from our Lord. And none will remember except those of understanding."

The Second Part of the Book on Renunciation

This section elucidates the true essence of renunciation, expounds upon its virtue and its various categories, and details the practice of renunciation in matters of food, clothing, dwelling, furnishings, and all modes of livelihood, while also clarifying the signs of genuine renunciation.

An Exposition on the True Nature of Asceticism

Know that renunciation of the worldly life is a noble station among the stations of the spiritual wayfarers. This station comprises knowledge, state, and action, like all other stations, for all the gates of faith, as the predecessors said, revert to conviction, speech, and action. Speech, due to its outward manifestation, stands in place of the inner state, since through it the hidden state becomes apparent. Thus, speech is not intended for its own sake; if it does not arise from a genuine state, it is termed submission but not faith.

Knowledge is the cause for a state that functions like the tree that bears fruit, and action proceeds from that state like the fruit itself. Let us then discuss the state along with its two aspects: knowledge and action. As for the state, we mean by it what is called renunciation, which is an expression of diverting desire from something to that which is better than it. For whoever turns away from one thing to another through exchange, sale, or otherwise, does so due to a lack of desire for the former and a desire for the latter. Thus, his condition relative to what is turned away from is called renunciation, and relative to what is turned toward is called desire and love. Therefore, the state of renunciation necessitates something renounced and something desired, the latter being better than the former.

A condition for the renounced object is that it must also be desirable in some respect, for one who renounces what is not inherently desirable is not called a renunciant. For example, one who abandons stones and dust and the like is not called a renunciant; only one who abandons dirhams and dinars is so called, because dust and stones are not typically objects of desire. A condition for the desired object is that it must be better in his estimation, so that this desire prevails. A seller does not proceed with a sale unless the buyer is, in his view, better than the sale. Thus, his condition relative to the sold item is renunciation of it, and relative to the compensation is desire and love for it.

Hence, God Almighty said: "And they sold him for a paltry price—a few dirhams—and they were of those who renounced him." This means they sold him, for "selling" can be used to mean "buying." The brothers of Joseph were described as renouncing him because they hoped to have their father's attention to themselves; that was dearer to them than Joseph, so they sold him in hope of compensation. Therefore, whoever sells this world for the Hereafter is a renunciant of this world, and whoever sells the Hereafter for this world is also a renunciant, but of the Hereafter. However, convention restricts the name "renunciant" to one who renounces the worldly life, just as the name "atheist" is restricted to one who inclines to falsehood specifically, even though linguistically it denotes any inclination.

Since renunciation is a turning away from something loved altogether, it can only be conceived by turning to something more beloved; otherwise, abandoning the beloved for something not more beloved is impossible. He who turns away from everything other than God Almighty—even the paradises—and loves only God Almighty is the absolute renunciant. He who turns away from every worldly share but does not renounce such shares in the Hereafter, rather aspiring to houris, palaces, rivers, and fruits, is also a renunciant, but of a lower rank than the first. He who abandons some worldly shares but not others—such as one who abandons wealth but not status, or who forsakes indulgence in food but not adornment in dress—does not deserve the name "renunciant" absolutely. His rank among renunciants is like that of one who repents from some sins among repenters; it is valid renunciation, just as repentance from some sins is valid. For repentance is an expression of abandoning prohibitions, and renunciation is an expression of abandoning permissible things that are the soul's share. It is not far-fetched to be capable of abandoning some permissible things but not others, just as it is not far-fetched regarding prohibitions. One who confines himself to abandoning prohibitions is not called a renunciant, even if he has renounced the prohibited and turned away from it, but convention restricts this name to abandoning permissible things.

Thus, renunciation is an expression of turning away from the worldly life toward the Hereafter, or from other than God Almighty toward God Almighty—and this is the highest degree. Just as it is a condition for the desired object to be better in his estimation, it is a condition for the renounced object to be within his capability, for abandoning what one is incapable of is impossible. Through abandonment, the absence of desire becomes evident. Hence, it was said to Ibn al-Mubarak: "O renunciant!" He replied: "The renunciant is 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, to whom the worldly life came submissively and he abandoned it. As for me, in what have I renounced?"

As for the knowledge that yields this state, it is the knowledge that what is forsaken is insignificant in comparison to what is taken, like a merchant's knowledge that the exchange is better than the sold item, thus he desires it. Unless this knowledge is realized, it is inconceivable that desire for the sold item would vanish. Similarly, whoever knows that what is with God is everlasting, and that the Hereafter is better and more enduring—meaning its pleasures are inherently better and more lasting, just as jewels are better and more lasting than, for example, snow. It is not difficult for the owner of snow to sell it for jewels and pearls. Such is the analogy of this world and the Hereafter. This world is like snow placed in the sun, constantly melting towards extinction, while the Hereafter is like a jewel that does not perish. The strength of desire for the transaction and exchange is proportional to the strength of certainty and knowledge of the disparity between this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, one whose certainty is strong sells his soul and wealth, as God Almighty said: "Indeed, God has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for Paradise." Then He clarified that their transaction is profitable, saying: "So rejoice in the transaction you have contracted." Thus, the knowledge required for asceticism is only this measure: that the Hereafter is better and more enduring. Yet, one may know this but be unable to forsake the world, either due to weakness in his knowledge and certainty, or due to the immediate dominance of desire over him and his being overpowered by Satan, or due to being deluded by Satan's promises of procrastination, day after day, until death snatches him, leaving him with nothing but regret after the opportunity is lost. The indication to the baseness of this world is in His saying: "Say, 'The enjoyment of this world is little.'" The indication to the preciousness of the Hereafter is in His saying: "And those who were given knowledge said, 'Woe to you! The reward of God is better.'" Thus, He pointed out that knowledge of the jewel's preciousness is what motivates one to relinquish its substitute. Since asceticism is inconceivable except by opposing a desire for something beloved in favor of what is more beloved, a man said in his supplication: "O God, show me the world as You see it." The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to him: "Do not say that. Rather say: 'Show me the world as You have shown it to the righteous among Your servants.'" This is because God Almighty sees it as insignificant as it is, and every creature is insignificant in comparison to His majesty. The servant sees it as insignificant in himself in comparison to what is better for him. It is inconceivable that a seller of a horse, even if he desires to part with it, sees it as he sees, for example, insects, for he is inherently independent of insects but not independent of the horse. God Almighty is inherently independent of all besides Him, so He sees everything at one level in comparison to His majesty, and sees it as varying in comparison to others. The ascetic is the one who sees its disparity in comparison to himself, not to others. As for the action arising from the state of asceticism, it is a single act of abandonment, for it is a sale, transaction, and exchange of what is better for what is inferior. Just as the action arising from the contract of sale is abandoning the sold item, removing it from hand, and taking the exchange, so too asceticism necessitates completely abandoning the object of asceticism—which is this entire world with its causes, preliminaries, and attachments—so that love for it departs from the heart and love for obedience enters, and what is removed from the heart is removed from the eye and hand, and the hand, eye, and all limbs are assigned the duties of obedience. Otherwise, one is like he who delivered the sold item but did not take the price. If he fulfills the condition of both sides in taking and abandoning, let him rejoice in the transaction he has contracted; for the One with whom he contracted this sale has fulfilled the covenant. Whoever delivers the present for the absent, delivers the present, and strives in seeking the absent, the absent will be delivered to him upon completion of his striving, provided the contracting party is one whose truthfulness, capability, and fulfillment of the covenant are trusted. As long as one holds onto the world, his asceticism is fundamentally invalid. Therefore, God Almighty did not describe the brothers of Joseph with asceticism regarding Benjamin, even though they said: "Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we are," and resolved to distance him as they resolved regarding Joseph, until one of them interceded and they desisted. Nor did He describe them with asceticism regarding Joseph at the resolution to expel him, but rather at the delivery and sale. The sign of desire is holding on, and the sign of asceticism is relinquishing. If you relinquish from hand some of the world but not all, you are an ascetic only regarding what you relinquished, not absolutely. If you have no wealth and the world does not assist you, asceticism is inconceivable from you, for what one cannot possess, one cannot be strong in abandoning. Perhaps Satan may beguile you with his deception and make it appear to you that even if the world does not come to you, you are ascetic regarding it. You should not descend by the rope of his deception without securing and fortifying yourself with a strong covenant from God. For if you have not experienced the state of capability, do not trust your ability to abandon when capable. How many a person presumed in himself a dislike for sins when they were unattainable, yet when their means became available without impediment or fear of people, he fell into them. If this is the self's deception regarding prohibitions, then beware of trusting its promise regarding permissible matters. The strong covenant you take from it is to test it time after time in the state of capability. If it consistently fulfills what it promised, with the absence of distractions and excuses, outwardly and inwardly, then there is no harm in trusting it somewhat. But also be cautious of its change, for it is quick to break covenants, swift to revert to natural disposition. In summary, there is no security from it except at the point of abandonment in comparison to what is abandoned only, and that is at the time of capability. Ibn Abi Layla said to Ibn Shubrumah: "Do you not see this Ibn al-Ha'ik? We do not issue a legal opinion on any matter but he refutes us"—meaning Abu Hanifah. Ibn Shubrumah said: "I do not know if he is Ibn al-Ha'ik or not. But know that the world came to him and he fled from it, and it fled from us and we pursued it." Likewise, all Muslims during the time of the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "We love our Lord, and if we knew in what thing His love lies, we would do it," until His word was revealed: "And if We had decreed upon them, 'Kill yourselves' or 'Leave your homes,' they would not have done it except for a few of them."

Ibn Mas'ud, may God have mercy on him, said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said to me: "You are among them" — meaning among the few. He said: And I did not know among us anyone who loved the world until the verse was revealed: "Among you are those who desire this world, and among you are those who desire the Hereafter" (Quran 3:152). And know that renunciation is not merely abandoning wealth and spending it out of generosity and chivalry, or to win over hearts, or out of covetousness. All of that is among the virtues of character, but none of it has any place in acts of worship. True renunciation is that you abandon the world because you know its insignificance compared to the preciousness of the Hereafter. As for every other form of abandonment, it can be conceived from one who does not believe in the Hereafter; that may be nobility, chivalry, generosity, and good character, but it is not renunciation, for good repute and the inclination of hearts are among the shares of the immediate life, and they are more pleasing and delightful than wealth. And just as abandoning wealth in a state of peace, coveting compensation, is not renunciation, so too is abandoning it coveting praise and renown, seeking fame for chivalry and generosity, or finding it burdensome due to the toil and hardship in safeguarding wealth and the need to humble oneself before rulers and the wealthy. This is not renunciation at all; rather, it is hastening another share for the soul. Rather, the true renunciant is he to whom the world comes submissively, pure and freely, and he is capable of enjoying it without loss of status, a tarnished name, or missing a share for his soul, yet he abandons it out of fear of becoming intimate with it, lest he become intimate with other than God and a lover of what is besides God, thus associating others with God in love. Or he abandons it out of hope for God's reward in the Hereafter: he forgoes enjoying the drinks of this world hoping for the drinks of Paradise; he forgoes enjoying concubines and women hoping for the wide-eyed maidens; he forgoes strolling in gardens hoping for the gardens and trees of Paradise; he forgoes adorning and beautifying himself with the adornments of this world hoping for the adornment of Paradise; he forgoes delicious foods hoping for the fruits of Paradise and fearing that it will be said to him: "You exhausted your good things in your worldly life" (Quran 46:20). Thus, in all of that, he prefers what is promised over what was made readily available to him in this world, purely and freely, because he knows that what is in the Hereafter is better and more lasting, and that anything besides this is worldly dealings that yield no benefit in the Hereafter whatsoever.

An Exposition on the Virtue of Asceticism

God Almighty said: "So he went forth before his people in his adornment... until His words... and those who were given knowledge said, 'Woe to you! The reward of God is better for those who believe.'" Thus, asceticism is attributed to the learned, and its people are described with knowledge, which is the ultimate praise. And He said: "Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured." And in the commentary, it is related concerning asceticism in this world.

And the Almighty said: "Verily, We have made all that is on the earth an adornment for it, that We may test them as to which of them is best in deed." It has been said: Its meaning is which of them is most detached from it, thus describing detachment as being among the best of deeds.

Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We increase for him in his harvest; and whoever desires the harvest of this world, We give him thereof, but he has no share in the Hereafter.

And He, the Exalted, said: "Do not extend your eyes toward that with which We have provided some of them—the splendor of the worldly life—that We may test them therein. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring."

And God Almighty said: "Those who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter" — thus describing the disbelievers with this trait. It is understood from this that the believer is the one characterized by its opposite, which is to prefer the Hereafter over the worldly life.

As for the narrations, those that have come condemning the world are many, and we have cited some of them in the Book Condemning the World alongside the quarter of destructive traits, for love of the world is among the destructive traits. We shall now confine ourselves to the virtue of despising the world, for it is among the saving traits, and it is what is meant by asceticism. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever begins the morning with his primary concern being the world, God will scatter his affairs, disperse his provision, place his poverty before his eyes, and nothing of the world will come to him except what has been decreed for him. And whoever begins the morning with his primary concern being the Hereafter, God will gather his concern for him, safeguard his provision for him, place his richness in his heart, and the world will come to him submissively."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When you see a servant who has been granted silence and detachment from the world, draw near to him, for wisdom is imparted to him."

And God Almighty said: "Whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant good." For this reason it is said: Whoever renounces the world for forty days, God causes the springs of wisdom to flow in his heart and makes his tongue speak with it.

From some of the Companions, that he said: We asked, "O Messenger of God, which people are best?" He said, "Every believer with a fevered heart and truthful tongue." We asked, "O Messenger of God, and what is a fevered heart?" He said, "The pious, the pure, in which there is no rancor, no deceit, no oppression, and no envy." We said, "O Messenger of God, then who follows in his footsteps?" He said, "He who detests the worldly life and loves the Hereafter." The implication of this is that the worst of people is he who loves the worldly life.

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "If you wish for God to love you, then renounce the world." Thus, he made renunciation a cause for divine love. Whoever is loved by God, exalted is He, is in the highest of stations. Therefore, renunciation of the world should be among the most excellent spiritual ranks. The implication is also that one who loves the world exposes himself to the displeasure of God, exalted is He. And in a report from the path of the Household of the Prophet: "Renunciation and piety roam through the hearts every night. If they find a heart containing faith and modesty, they settle within it; otherwise, they depart."

When Harithah said to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, "I am a true believer," he asked, "And what is the reality of your faith?" He replied, "My soul has turned away from the world, so its stone and its gold have become equal in my sight, and it is as if I see Paradise and the Fire, and as if I see the Throne of my Lord plainly before me." The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, then said, "You have come to know, so hold fast—a servant whose heart God has illuminated with faith." Observe how he began by manifesting the reality of faith through the soul's turning away from the world and coupled it with certainty, and how the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, commended him when he said, "a servant whose heart God has illuminated with faith."

When the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was asked about the meaning of "expansion" in God Almighty's saying, "Whomever God wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam," and it was said to him, "What is this expansion?" he said, "When light enters the heart, the breast expands and becomes spacious." It was said, "O Messenger of God, is there a sign for that?" He said, "Yes: turning away from the abode of delusion; turning in repentance to the abode of eternity; and preparing for death before it descends." So observe how he made asceticism a condition for Islam, which is turning away from the abode of delusion.

And he, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Be truly modest before God." They said, "We are indeed modest before Him, the Exalted." He said, "It is not like that. You build what you do not inhabit, and you amass what you do not eat." Thus, he clarified that this contradicts modesty before God Almighty. And when some delegates came to him, they said, "We are believers." He said, "What is the sign of your faith?" They mentioned patience in times of tribulation, gratitude in times of ease, contentment with the decree of fate, and refraining from gloating when calamity befalls enemies. Thereupon, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "If you are truly so, then do not amass what you do not eat, do not build what you do not inhabit, and do not compete for that from which you will depart." Thus, he made asceticism the perfection of their faith.

Jabir, may God be pleased with him, reported: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, addressed us in a sermon and said, "Whoever comes with 'There is no god but God,' not mixing it with anything else, Paradise is guaranteed for him." Ali, may God honor his countenance, rose and said to him, "May my father and mother be your ransom, O Messenger of God! What is 'not mixing it with anything else'? Describe it for us, explain it to us." He said, "The love of this world, seeking it and pursuing it, and a people who speak the words of the prophets yet perform the deeds of tyrants. So whoever comes with 'There is no god but God' wherein there is nothing of this, Paradise is guaranteed for him."

In the tradition: "Generosity stems from certainty, and no one who is certain enters the Fire; miserliness stems from doubt, and no one who doubts enters Paradise."

He also said: "The generous person is close to God, close to people, and close to Paradise; the miser is far from God, far from people, and close to the Fire." Miserliness is the fruit of desire for this world, and generosity is the fruit of detachment. Praise inevitably belongs to the one who produces the fruit.

It is narrated from Ibn al-Musayyib, from Abu Dharr, from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Whoever is detached from this world, God will instill wisdom in his heart, cause his tongue to speak it, make him aware of the disease of this world and its cure, and bring him forth from it safely to the Abode of Peace."

It is narrated that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, once passed by his companions with a herd of ten pregnant she-camels, which were among their most beloved and precious possessions because they combined transportation, meat, milk, and wool. Due to their great importance in their hearts, God Almighty said: "And when the pregnant camels are abandoned..." The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, turned away from them and averted his gaze. He was asked, "O Messenger of God, these are our most precious possessions; why do you not look at them?" He replied, "God has forbidden me from that," and then recited His words: "And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment..."

Musruq reported from ‘A’ishah, may God be pleased with her, who said: I said, “O Messenger of God, will you not ask God to provide you food so that He may feed you?” She said: And I wept because of the hunger I saw in him. He said, “O ‘A’ishah, by Him in whose hand is my soul, if I were to ask my Lord to make the mountains of the world flow with gold for me, He would make them flow wherever I wished on earth. But I have chosen the hunger of this world over its satiety, its poverty over its wealth, and its sorrow over its joy. O ‘A’ishah, this world is not fitting for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. O ‘A’ishah, God was not pleased for the Possessors of Resolve among the messengers except with patience over the world’s afflictions and patience in abstaining from its delights. Then He was not pleased except to charge me with what He charged them, saying: ‘So be patient as the Possessors of Resolve among the messengers were patient.’ By God, I have no alternative but to obey Him, and by God, I shall surely be patient as they were patient, to the utmost of my ability, and there is no power nor strength except with God.”

It is narrated from Umar, may God be pleased with him, that when the conquests were opened for him, his daughter Hafsa, may God be pleased with her, said to him: "Wear the softest garments when delegations come to you from the horizons, and order the preparation of food to feed them and feed those present." Umar said: "O Hafsa, do you not know that the people most knowledgeable of a man's condition are his household?" She said: "Yes." He said: "I adjure you by God, do you know that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, remained in prophethood for such and such years, neither he nor his household being sated in the morning except that they were hungry in the evening, nor being sated in the evening except that they were hungry in the morning? And I adjure you by God, do you know that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, remained in prophethood for such and such years, neither he nor his household being sated from dates until God opened Khaybar for him? And I adjure you by God, do you know that food was once brought to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, on a raised table, and this distressed him until his complexion changed, then he ordered the table removed and the food placed on something lower or placed on the ground? And I adjure you by God, do you know that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would not sleep on a folded cloak, and one night it was folded for him into four folds and he slept on it, and when he awoke he said: 'You have prevented me from standing in prayer this night with this cloak; fold it in two as you used to fold it'? And I adjure you by God, do you know that the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, would put his clothes to be washed, and Bilal would come to call him to prayer, and he would not find a garment to go out to prayer in until his clothes dried, and he would go out to prayer in them? And I adjure you by God, do you know that a woman from Banu Zafar made two garments, a waist-wrapper, for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and sent him one of them before the other was finished, and he went out to prayer wrapped in it with nothing else on it, having tied its ends to his neck, and prayed like that?" He continued speaking until he made her weep, and Umar, may God be pleased with him, wept and sobbed until we thought his soul would depart.

In some narrations there is an addition from the words of 'Umar, wherein he said: I had two companions who traversed a path. If I traverse a path other than theirs, I will be led upon a path other than theirs. And I, by God, shall endure their harsh life, that perhaps I may attain with them their abundant life.

And from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that he said: "Indeed, the prophets before me were tested; one of them would be afflicted with poverty such that he would wear nothing but a coarse cloak, and indeed one of them would be afflicted with lice until the lice would kill him, and that was more beloved to them than your being given gifts."

From Ibn Abbas, from the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, who said: "When Moses, peace be upon him, arrived at the water of Midian, the greenness of the herbage could be seen in his belly from emaciation." This is what the prophets and messengers of God had chosen for themselves, and they are the most knowledgeable of God's creation regarding God and the path to success in the Hereafter.

In the narration of 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: When the verse was revealed, "And those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah..." the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Woe to the world! Woe to the dinar and dirham!" So we said: O Messenger of Allah, Allah has forbidden us from hoarding gold and silver, so what should we save? He, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Let one of you acquire a tongue that remembers, a heart that gives thanks, or a righteous wife who helps him in the matter of his Hereafter."

In the narration of Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him: "Whoever prefers this world over the Hereafter, Allah afflicts him with three things: a worry that never leaves his heart, a poverty from which he never becomes self-sufficient, and an insatiable greed that is never satisfied."

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "A servant’s faith is not perfected until he prefers not to be known over being known, and until he prefers scarcity over abundance."

Jesus, peace be upon him, said: "The world is a bridge, so cross it, but do not build upon it." And it was said to him: "O Prophet of God, if only you would command us to build a house in which to worship God?" He said: "Go and build a house upon the water." They said: "How can a structure stand firm upon water?" He replied: "And how can worship stand firm alongside love of the world?"

Our Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Indeed my Lord, the Almighty, offered to make the valley of Mecca gold for me, but I said: 'No, O Lord. Rather, let me be hungry one day and full another day. For on the day I am hungry, I will beseech You and call upon You; and on the day I am full, I will praise You and extol You.'"

From Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, went out one day walking, with Gabriel accompanying him. He ascended Mount Safa and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: "O Gabriel, by Him who sent you with the truth, not a handful of barley meal nor a measure of flour remains for the family of Muhammad this evening." No sooner had he spoken than he heard a terrifying crash from the sky which alarmed him. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Has God commanded the Hour to commence?" He said: "No, but this is Israfil, peace be upon him, who has descended to you upon hearing your words." Israfil came to him and said: "Indeed God, the Mighty and Majestic, heard what you mentioned and has sent me with the keys of the earth. He has commanded me to present to you: if you wish, I can make the mountains of Tihamah march with you as emerald, ruby, gold, and silver, I will do so; or if you wish, a Prophet-King; or if you wish, a Prophet-servant." Gabriel gestured to him to show humility before God, so he said: "A Prophet-servant," three times.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "When God desires good for a servant, He makes him indifferent to this world, instills in him a longing for the Hereafter, and grants him insight into the faults of his own soul."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to a man: "Be detached from the world and God will love you, and be detached from what is in the hands of people and people will love you."

And the blessings of God be upon him, he said: "Whoever wishes that God grant him knowledge without study and guidance without instruction, let him be detached from the world."

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever yearns for Paradise hastens to good deeds, whoever fears the Fire turns away from desires, whoever anticipates death abandons pleasures, and whoever is detached from the world finds afflictions light upon him."

It is narrated from our Prophet and from Jesus, peace be upon them both: "Four things are not attained except through toil: silence, which is the beginning of worship; humility; abundant remembrance [of God]; and having little."

To compile all the narrations extolling the disdain for this world and censuring the love for it is not possible, for the prophets were sent only to divert people from this world to the Hereafter, and to this end most of their discourse with creation returns. In what we have presented, there is sufficiency, and God is the One sought for aid.

As for the transmitted reports, it has come in an *athar*: "The declaration 'There is no god but God' continually wards off the displeasure of God, Mighty and Majestic, from the servants, so long as they do not ask for what diminishes from their worldly portion." And in another wording: "So long as they do not prefer the bargain of their world over their religion. But if they do that and say, 'There is no god but God,' God, Exalted is He, says: 'You have lied; you are not truthful in it.'"

And from some of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, that he said: We followed all the deeds, and we did not see in the matter of the Hereafter anything more effective than renunciation of this world.

A companion said to a leading figure among the Successors: "You engage in more deeds and strive more diligently than the companions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, yet they were better than you." It was asked: "Why is that?" He replied: "They were more detached from this world than you are."

Umar, may God be pleased with him, said: Asceticism in this world is a comfort for the heart and the body.

Bilal ibn Sa'd said: Sufficient as a sin is that Allah the Exalted makes us indifferent to the world, yet we still yearn for it.

A man said to Sufyan: "I desire to see a scholar who is an ascetic." He replied: "Woe to you! That is a lost thing, not to be found."

Wahb ibn Munabbih said: "Indeed, Paradise has eight gates. When the people of Paradise arrive at them, the gatekeepers are made to say: 'By the might of our Lord, no one shall enter it before those who renounced the world and yearned for Paradise.'"

Yusuf ibn Asbat, may God have mercy on him, said: "I desire from God three traits: that I die at the moment I die without possessing a single dirham, that I owe no debt, and that no flesh remains upon my bones." And he was granted all of that.

It is narrated that a certain caliph sent gifts to the jurists, and they accepted them. He sent ten thousand to Fudayl, but he did not accept them. His sons said to him, "The jurists have accepted, yet you refuse in your current state?" Fudayl wept and said, "Do you know what my parable is and yours? It is like a people who had a cow they used to plow with. When it grew old, they slaughtered it to benefit from its hide. Likewise, you wish to slaughter me on account of my old age. Die of hunger, O my family, for that is better for you than slaughtering Fudayl!"

Ubayd ibn 'Umayrah said: The Messiah, son of Mary, peace be upon him, would wear wool and eat from the trees. He had no child to die, no house to be ruined, and he stored nothing for the morrow. Wherever evening found him, there he would sleep.

The wife of Abu Hazim said to him, "Winter has descended upon us, and we must have food, clothing, and firewood!" Abu Hazim replied to her, "From all of this, one may be spared, but we cannot be spared from death, then the resurrection, then standing before God Almighty, and then either Paradise or the Fire."

It was said to Al-Hasan: "Why do you not wash your clothes?" He replied: "The matter is more pressing than that."

Ibrahim ibn Adham said: Our hearts have been veiled by three coverings, and certainty will not be unveiled for a servant until these veils are lifted: delight in what is present, sorrow over what is lost, and joy in praise. For if you delight in what is present, you are covetous; if you sorrow over what is lost, you are discontent, and the discontented one is tormented; and if you rejoice in praise, you are self-admiring, and self-admiration nullifies deeds.

Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: Two cycles of prayer from one whose heart is detached are better for him and more beloved to God than the worship of the striving devotees until the end of time, perpetually and forever.

Some of the early righteous said: God’s favor upon us in what He has turned away from us is greater than His favor in what He has granted to us.  
It is as though he perceived the meaning of the Prophet’s saying (peace be upon him): “Truly, God shields His believing servant from the world while loving him, just as you shield your sick from food and drink out of fear for him.” Thus, whoever comprehends this knows that the favor in withholding that leads to well-being is greater than the favor in giving that leads to sickness.

Sufyan al-Thawri would say: This world is an abode of distortion, not an abode of rectitude; a dwelling of sorrow, not a dwelling of joy. Whoever truly knows it will not rejoice in ease nor grieve in hardship.

Sahl said: The devotee's worship is not purified until he is free from four things: hunger, nakedness, poverty, and humiliation.

Al-Hasan al-Basri said: I encountered people and kept company with groups who would not rejoice at anything of this world that came to them, nor grieve over anything of it that turned away. It was, in their eyes, more insignificant than dust. One of them would live fifty or sixty years without a garment reaching him, without a cooking pot being set up for him, and without placing anything between himself and the ground. He never ordered anyone in his household to prepare a meal. When night came, they would stand on their feet, prostrating their faces, their tears flowing down their cheeks, supplicating their Lord for the ransom of their necks. When they performed a good deed, they would persist in gratitude for it and ask God to accept it. When they committed an evil deed, it would sadden them, and they would ask God to forgive it for them. They remained in that state constantly, and by God, they were not safe from sins, nor were they saved except by forgiveness—God's mercy and pleasure be upon them.

An Exposition on the Degrees and Categories of Renunciation

in addition to the self, to what is shunned, and to what is desired.

Know that asceticism in itself varies according to the variation in its strength across three levels. The first level, which is the lowest, is that one abstains from the world while still desiring it, with his heart inclined toward it and his soul turning to it, yet he struggles against it and restrains himself. This is called the one who forces asceticism, and it is the beginning of asceticism for those who reach the degree of asceticism through effort and striving. The one who forces asceticism first melts his soul, then his purse, whereas the true ascetic first melts his purse, then melts his soul in acts of obedience, not in patience over what he has forsaken. The one who forces asceticism is in peril, for perhaps his soul may overcome him and his desire may pull him, causing him to return to the world and to seeking comfort in it, whether little or much.

The second degree is one who forsakes the world willingly, deeming it insignificant in comparison to what he aspires to attain—like one who abandons a single dirham for the sake of two dirhams. This does not cause him hardship, even if it requires a brief period of waiting. Yet, this ascetic inevitably perceives his own asceticism and turns his attention to it, just as a seller regards the merchandise and turns his attention to it, so that he nearly becomes self-admiring of his own soul and his asceticism. He imagines within himself that he has forsaken something of value for that which is of greater value, and this too is a deficiency.

The third and highest degree is to renounce willingly and to renounce even the awareness of one's renunciation, such that one does not perceive one's own asceticism, for one does not see that one has forsaken anything. This is because he has realized that the world is nothing. Thus, he is like one who discards a potsherd and takes a jewel, yet does not regard this as an exchange, nor does he see himself as having forsaken anything. For the world, in comparison to God—Exalted is He—and the bliss of the Hereafter, is baser than a potsherd compared to a jewel. This is the perfection of asceticism. Its cause is the perfection of spiritual knowledge. Such asceticism is secure from the peril of turning back toward the world, just as one who leaves a potsherd for a jewel is secure from seeking to rescind the transaction.

Abu Yazid, may God have mercy upon him, said to Abu Musa 'Abd al-Rahim: "On what subject do you speak?" He replied: "On renunciation." He asked: "Renunciation of what?" He said: "Of the world." Abu Yazid shook his hand and said: "I thought he was speaking of something, but the world is nothing. What is there to renounce in it?"

For the people of true knowledge and the possessors of hearts illuminated by spiritual unveilings, the likeness of one who abandons this world for the Hereafter is that of a man whom a dog at the king's gate prevented from entering. So he threw a morsel of bread to it, thus occupying it with itself, entered the gate, attained proximity to the king, and his command was executed throughout the entire kingdom. Do you think he would consider that morsel of bread he threw to the dog as a favor presented to the king, in exchange for what he attained? Indeed, Satan is a dog at the gate of God, Exalted is He, preventing people from entering, even though the gate is open and the veil is lifted. The world is like that morsel of bread: if eaten, its pleasure lasts only during the chewing and ends quickly upon swallowing. Then its dregs remain in the stomach, and it ends in foulness and filth. Afterwards, one needs to expel that burden. So how could one who abandoned it to attain the glory of the King's presence turn his attention back to it?

The proportion of all the world—I mean what is allotted to each person, even if he lives a hundred years—compared to the bliss of the Hereafter is less than a morsel compared to the dominion of the world. For there is no proportion between that which is finite and that which is infinite. The world is finite and near its end. Even if it were to extend for a million years free from all distress, it would bear no proportion to the bliss of eternity. How much more so when the lifespan is short and the pleasures of the world are tainted and impure? What proportion could they have to eternal bliss?

Therefore, the renunciant does not turn his attention to his renunciation except when he turns his attention to that which he renounced. And he does not turn his attention to that which he renounced except because he considers it something significant. And he does not consider it significant except due to the deficiency of his knowledge.

This is the disparity in the degrees of asceticism, and each of these degrees also has its own degrees, for the endurance of the ascetic varies and differs according to the measure of hardship in that endurance. Likewise, the degree of one's admiration for his own asceticism is according to the measure of his attention turning toward it.

As for the division of asceticism in relation to what is desired, it also falls into three levels: The lowest level is when what is desired is salvation from the Fire and from all pains, such as the torment of the grave, the reckoning of the account, the peril of the Bridge, and all the terrors that lie before the servant as conveyed by the reports, for in them it is said: "Indeed, a man will be held for reckoning until if a hundred thirsty camels were to come upon his sweat, they would depart fully quenched." This is the asceticism of the fearful, as if they would be content with non-existence if they were deprived, for deliverance from pain is attained through mere non-existence.

The second degree is to renounce worldly things out of desire for God's reward, His bliss, and the promised delights in His Paradise—such as maidens and palaces and the like. This is the renunciation of those who hope, for these individuals did not abandon the world out of contentment with non-existence and deliverance from pain, but rather out of longing for an everlasting existence and perpetual bliss that has no end.

The third and highest degree is that one's desire is solely for God and for meeting Him. Thus, the heart does not turn toward pains to seek deliverance from them, nor toward pleasures to seek their attainment and acquisition. Rather, one is entirely absorbed in concern for God Almighty. This is the one whose concerns have become a single concern. This is the true monotheist who seeks nothing other than God Almighty; for whoever seeks other than God has indeed worshipped it, and every object of seeking is an object of worship, and every seeker is a servant in relation to what he seeks. Seeking other than God is from the hidden polytheism. This is the asceticism of the lovers, who are the knowers, for none loves God Almighty in particular except he who knows Him. Just as one who knows the dinar and the dirham and knows he cannot combine them loves only the dinar, so too one who knows God and knows the delight of gazing upon His Noble Countenance, and knows that combining that delight with the delight of enjoying the wide-eyed maidens and gazing upon the embellishment of palaces and the verdure of trees is impossible, loves only the delight of the gaze and prefers nothing else. Do not suppose that for the people of Paradise, when gazing upon the Countenance of God Almighty, there remains room in their hearts for the delight of the maidens and palaces. Rather, that delight, in relation to the delight of the bliss of the people of Paradise, is like the delight of worldly sovereignty and dominion over the ends of the earth and the necks of creation in relation to the delight of seizing a sparrow and playing with it. Those who seek the bliss of Paradise are, in the view of the knowers and the possessors of hearts, like a child who seeks to play with a sparrow, abandoning the delight of sovereignty, due to his incapacity to perceive the delight of sovereignty—not because playing with the sparrow is in itself higher and more delightful than attaining dominion, by way of sovereignty, over all creation.

As for its division in relation to what is to be shunned, the statements on this have multiplied, and perhaps what has been mentioned therein exceeds one hundred opinions. Therefore, we shall not occupy ourselves with transmitting these statements, but we shall point to a discourse that encompasses the details, so that it becomes clear that most of what has been mentioned therein falls short of encompassing the whole. We say: What is to be shunned through asceticism has both a general and a detailed aspect, and its detailed aspect has levels, some of which are more expansive for individual categories and some of which are more concise for the aggregates. As for the generality at the first level: it is everything other than God, so one should practice asceticism towards it, even towards his own self as well. The generality at the second level: is to practice asceticism towards everything in which the self finds pleasure, and this comprises all the demands of natural disposition, such as lust, anger, pride, leadership, wealth, status, and the like. At the third level: it is to practice asceticism towards wealth and status and their causes, for to these two revert all the shares of the self. At the fourth level: it is to practice asceticism towards knowledge, power, the dinar, the dirham, and status; for wealth, even if its kinds are many, is gathered by the dinar and the dirham, and status, even if its causes are many, reverts to knowledge and power—and by this I mean every knowledge and power whose aim is the mastery over hearts, for the meaning of status is the mastery over hearts and power over them, just as the meaning of wealth is the mastery over substances and power over them. If you were to go beyond this detail to an explanation and detail more comprehensive than this, what is to be shunned through asceticism would almost become beyond enumeration. God, exalted is He, has mentioned seven of them in a single verse, saying: "Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire—of women and children, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life." Then He reduced them in another verse to five, saying, exalted is He: "Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting among you and competition in increase of wealth and children." Then He, exalted is He, reduced them in another place to two, saying, exalted is He: "And the life of this world is not but amusement and diversion." Then He reduced the whole to one in another place, saying: "And as for he who feared the standing before his Lord and restrained the soul from [unlawful] inclination, then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge." Thus, "inclination" is a term that gathers all the shares of the self in this world, so asceticism should be practiced towards it. And when you understand the way of generality and detail, you will know that some of these do not contradict others; rather, they differ only in the degree of explanation and conciseness.

In essence, asceticism is an expression of turning away from all the desires of the self. Whenever one turns away from the desires of the self, one turns away from remaining in this world, and thus inevitably shortens his hope, for he only desires to remain in order to enjoy, and he desires perpetual enjoyment through desiring permanence. For whoever desires something desires its permanence. The meaning of loving life is nothing but loving the permanence of what exists or is possible in this life. So when one turns away from it, he does not desire it. Therefore, when fighting was prescribed for them, they said, "Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? If only You had postponed it for us for a short while." Then the Almighty said, "Say, 'The enjoyment of this world is little.'" That is, you do not desire to remain except for the enjoyment of this world. Thus, the ascetics became apparent at that time, and the state of the hypocrites was unveiled.

As for the ascetics who love God Most High, they fought in the path of God as if they were a solid structure, and they awaited one of the two good things. When they were called to battle, they would inhale the fragrance of Paradise and hasten to it like the thirsty hasten to cool water, out of eagerness to support God's religion or to attain the rank of martyrdom. Whoever among them died on his bed would grieve over missing martyrdom. Indeed, when Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God Most High be pleased with him, was on his deathbed, he said: "How many times did I risk my soul and plunge into the ranks, hoping for martyrdom, and now I die the death of old women." When he died, eight hundred wounds from the traces of injuries were counted on his body. Such was the state of the sincere in faith, may God Most High be pleased with them all.

As for the hypocrites, they fled from the fray out of fear of death, and it was said to them: "Indeed, the death from which you flee will surely meet you." Their preference for survival over martyrdom is an exchange of the lower for the better. Those are the ones who purchased misguidance for guidance, so their transaction brought no profit, and they were not guided.

As for the sincere ones, God Most High has purchased from them their souls and their wealth in exchange for Paradise for them. When they realized that they had forsaken, for example, twenty or thirty years of enjoyment for eternal delight, they rejoiced in the sale they had made. This is the explanation of what is renounced.

When you comprehend this, you will know that what the theologians have mentioned regarding the definition of renunciation refers only to some of its categories. Each of them mentioned what he saw as predominant in himself or in those he was addressing. Thus, Bishr—may God Most High have mercy on him—said: "Renunciation of the world is renunciation of people." This is an indication specifically of renunciation of status.

Qasim al-Ju'i said: Asceticism in this world is asceticism in the belly; to the extent you possess your stomach, so you possess asceticism. This points to abstaining from a single appetite, and by my life, it is the most dominant of appetites for most people, and it is the inciter of most other desires. Fudayl said: Asceticism in this world is contentment, and this points specifically to wealth.

Al-Thawri said: Asceticism is the shortening of hope, and it encompasses all desires. For whoever inclines toward desires, his soul anticipates permanence, thus his hope becomes prolonged. But whoever shortens his hope, it is as if he has turned away from all desires.

Awais said: When the ascetic goes out seeking, the gold of asceticism departs from him. This does not mean he intended it, but rather he made reliance (on God) a condition of asceticism.

Awais also said: Asceticism is abandoning the pursuit of what is guaranteed, alluding to provision.

The scholars of Hadith said: Love of this world is acting upon opinion and rational deduction, while asceticism is solely following knowledge and adhering to the Sunnah. If what is meant is corrupt opinion and rational deduction pursued for worldly status, then this is correct. However, it points to some of the superfluous desires, for among the sciences are those that yield no benefit in the Hereafter, and people have prolonged them until a person's lifetime is consumed in occupying himself with just one of them. Thus, a condition for the ascetic is that superfluities are the first thing he renounces. Al-Hasan said: "When the ascetic sees anyone, he says, 'This person is better than me,'" indicating that asceticism is humility. This points to the negation of status and pride, which is one aspect of asceticism.

Some have said: Asceticism is the pursuit of the lawful, but how far is this from one who says: Asceticism is the abandonment of pursuit, as said by Uways. There is no doubt that he meant by it the abandonment of pursuing the lawful. And Yusuf ibn Asbat used to say: Whoever endures harm, forsakes base desires, and eats bread from lawful earnings has grasped the root of asceticism.

In asceticism there are sayings beyond what we have transmitted, but we saw no benefit in transmitting them. For whoever seeks to uncover the realities of matters from the sayings of people will find them divergent and gains nothing but perplexity. As for the one to whom the Truth is unveiled within himself and grasps it by witnessing from his heart—not by merely catching it from his hearing—he has placed his trust in the Truth and has perceived the shortcoming of those who fall short due to the deficiency of their insight, and the limitation of those who limit themselves despite possessing complete knowledge, due to the limitation of their need. All of these limited themselves not from any defect in insight, but they mentioned what they mentioned according to need; thus, they mentioned it in proportion to the need, and needs differ, so inevitably the words differ. The cause of limitation may also be reporting the present state, which is a station of the servant within himself, and states differ, so inevitably the statements reporting them differ. But the Truth in itself is only one and cannot conceivably differ. The comprehensive statement among these sayings—complete in itself, even if lacking in detail—is what Abu Sulayman al-Darani said when he stated: "We have heard much discourse on asceticism, and asceticism in our view is abandoning everything that distracts you from God, Glorified and Exalted." On another occasion he elaborated, saying: "Whoever marries, travels in pursuit of livelihood, or records Hadith has leaned toward the world," thus making all of that contrary to asceticism. Abu Sulayman recited God’s saying, "Except one who comes to God with a sound heart," and said: "It is the heart in which there is nothing but God, Exalted." And he said: "They renounced the world only to empty their hearts of its concerns for the Hereafter." This clarifies the division of asceticism with respect to the categories of what is renounced. As for its division with respect to its rulings, it splits into obligatory, supererogatory, and safety, as Ibrahim ibn Adham stated: the obligatory is renouncing the forbidden, the supererogatory is renouncing the permissible, and safety is renouncing the doubtful matters. We have detailed the levels of scrupulousness in the Book of Scrupulousness within the Book of the Lawful and the Forbidden, and that is part of asceticism. When Malik ibn Anas was asked, "What is asceticism?" he replied: "God-consciousness." As for the hidden aspects of what is abandoned, there is no end to asceticism therein, for there is no end to what the soul delights in during fleeting thoughts, glances, and all states—especially the hidden aspects of ostentation, which none perceive except the brokers among the scholars. Even the apparent states also have degrees of asceticism that are boundless. Among its utmost degrees is the asceticism of Jesus, peace be upon him, when he used a stone as a pillow in his sleep. Satan said to him: "Have you not renounced the world? What then has appeared to you?" He said: "What has occurred?" Satan replied: "Your using the stone as a pillow," meaning you enjoyed raising your head from the ground in sleep. So he cast away the stone and said: "Take it along with what I have left for you."

It is narrated from Yahya ibn Zakariya (peace be upon them both) that he wore coarse haircloth until it wore holes in his skin, abandoning the comfort of soft garments and the ease of tactile sensation. His mother then asked him to wear a woolen cloak in place of the haircloth, and he complied. Thereupon, God the Exalted revealed to him: "O Yahya, you have preferred the worldly life." He wept, removed the wool, and returned to his former state.

Ahmad, may God have mercy upon him, said: True asceticism is the asceticism of Uways. It reached such a degree of destitution that he sat upon a mat.

Jesus, peace be upon him, sat in the shade of a man’s wall, and the owner of the wall made him stand up. He said: “It was not you who made me stand; rather, it was He who was not pleased for me to enjoy the shade of the wall.” Thus, the degrees of asceticism, both outwardly and inwardly, are beyond enumeration, and the lowest of its degrees is asceticism in every doubtful matter and prohibition. Some have said: “Asceticism is abstaining from the lawful, not from the doubtful and prohibited, for that is not among its degrees in any way.” Then they saw that no lawful wealth remained in worldly possessions, so asceticism is no longer conceivable now.

If you ask: Since true asceticism is abandoning all besides God, how can this be conceived alongside eating, drinking, clothing, mingling with people, and conversing with them—all of which involve engagement with other than God Almighty? Then know that the meaning of turning away from the world toward God Almighty is to turn the entire heart toward Him in remembrance and contemplation. This cannot be conceived except with continued existence, and there is no continued existence except through the necessities of the self. Therefore, as long as you limit yourself from the world to warding off what destroys the body, and your aim is to use the body as an aid to worship, you are not engaged with other than God. For that without which a thing cannot be attained is considered part of it. Thus, one occupied with feeding and watering his she-camel on the pilgrimage route is not turning away from the pilgrimage. Rather, your body should be on the path of God like your she-camel on the pilgrimage route. You have no aim to indulge your she-camel in pleasures; your aim is solely to ward off what destroys her so she may carry you to your destination. Likewise, you should be in preserving your body from destructive hunger and thirst through eating and drinking, and from destructive heat and cold through clothing and shelter, limiting yourself to the extent of necessity and not intending pleasure, but rather seeking strength for obeying God Almighty. This does not contradict asceticism; rather, it is a condition of asceticism. If you say: But I inevitably feel pleasure in eating when hungry—know that this does not harm you if your intention is not pleasure. For one who drinks cold water may find pleasure in drinking, yet the outcome returns to the removal of the pain of thirst. And one who relieves a need may find comfort in it, but that is not intended or sought by purpose, so he is not turned toward it. A person may find comfort in standing at night from the breeze of the dawn and the sound of birds, but if he does not intend to seek a place for this comfort, what befalls him of that without intention does not harm him. Indeed, among the fearful were those who sought a place where the dawn breeze would not reach them, fearing comfort from it and the heart's familiarity with it, for therein lies familiarity with the world and a decrease in familiarity with God to the extent that familiarity with other than God occurs. Therefore, Dawud al-Ta'i had an uncovered well with his water, which he would not shield from the sun, and he would drink warm water, saying: "Whoever finds pleasure in cold water will find it difficult to part from the world." These are the precautions of the cautious and the prudence in all that precaution, for though it is arduous, its duration is short, and enduring a brief period to avoid perpetual indulgence is not burdensome for the people of knowledge who subdue themselves through the governance of the Sacred Law, holding fast to the firmest handhold of certainty in knowing the opposition between this world and religion—may God Almighty be pleased with them all.

Explanation of the Superiority of Asceticism in the Necessities of Life

Know that what people are engrossed in divides into superfluities and essentials. Superfluities are like branded horses, for instance, since most people acquire them merely for the luxury of riding them while they are capable of walking. Essentials are like eating and drinking. We are not able to detail the categories of superfluities, for they are boundless, whereas the essential necessities are limited. Moreover, superfluities can encroach upon essentials in their quantity, kind, and timing. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the aspect of asceticism regarding them. The essentials are six matters: food, clothing, shelter, its furnishings, marriage, and wealth. Status is sought for various purposes, and these six are among them. We have already mentioned the meaning of status, the reason for people's love of it, and how to guard against it in the Book of Ostentation from the Quarter of the Destructive Matters. Now, we shall confine ourselves to explaining these six essentials.

The First Sustenance: Man necessarily requires lawful sustenance to maintain his backbone, yet it possesses both length and breadth. Therefore, it is essential to curtail its length and breadth to perfect asceticism. As for its length, this pertains to the entirety of one's lifespan. For he who possesses food for his day is not content with it. As for its breadth, it concerns the quantity, type, and timing of the food.

Regarding its length, it is only shortened by curtailing hope. The lowest degree of asceticism in this regard is to limit oneself to what suffices to repel hunger at the time of severe hunger and fear of illness. One in this state, if he deems what he consumes sufficient, does not save from his midday meal for his evening meal. This is the highest degree. The second degree: to save for a month or forty days. The third degree: to save for only a year. This is the rank of the weak ascetics. Whoever saves for more than that, calling him an ascetic is impossible; for he who hopes for survival beyond a year possesses exceedingly long hope, and asceticism is not perfected in him unless he has no earnings and does not consent for himself to take from the hands of people, like Dawud al-Ta'i, who inherited twenty dinars, held onto them, and spent them over twenty years. This does not contradict the essence of asceticism except according to those who make trust in God a condition for asceticism.

As for its breadth in relation to quantity, its lowest degree for a day and night is half a pound, its middle is one pound, and its highest is one *mudd*, which is what God the Exalted has ordained for feeding the poor in expiation. Anything beyond that is from the expansion of the belly and preoccupation with it. Whoever cannot restrict himself to a *mudd* has no share of asceticism in the belly.

As for its breadth in relation to type, its lowest is anything that sustains, even bran bread. Its middle is barley or corn bread, and its highest is unbolted wheat bread. If it is sifted from the bran and becomes fine white bread, then one has entered into luxury and departed from the last doors of asceticism, let alone its first. As for the condiment: its lowest is salt, or vegetables and vinegar. Its middle is oil or a little of any fats, and its highest is meat, any meat, and that is once or twice a week. If it becomes constant or more than twice a week, one departs from the last doors of asceticism, and its practitioner is not an ascetic in the belly at all.

As for its breadth in relation to timing, its lowest in a day and night is once, which is to be fasting. Its middle is to fast and drink one night without eating, and to eat one night without drinking. Its highest is to reach the point of going three days or a week and more. We have mentioned the method of reducing food and breaking its craving in the Book of Destructive Evils. One should look to the conditions of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the Companions, may God be pleased with them, in the manner of their asceticism regarding foods and their abandonment of condiments.

Aisha, may God be pleased with her, said: "Forty nights would pass upon us, and no lamp or fire would be lit in the house of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him and his family." It was said to them: "Then by what did you live?" She said: "By the two black things: dates and water." And this is an abandonment of meat, broth, and condiments.

Al-Hasan said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, would ride a donkey, wear wool, put on sandals, lick his fingers, and eat on the ground. And he would say: "I am but a servant; I eat as servants eat, and I sit as servants sit."

And Jesus, peace be upon him, said: In truth I say to you, whoever seeks Paradise, for him barley bread and sleeping on refuse heaps with dogs are abundant.

Fudayl said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, did not eat his fill of wheat bread for three days after arriving in Medina."

And the Messiah, peace be upon him, used to say: "O Children of Israel, content yourselves with pure water, wild herbs, and barley bread, and beware of wheat bread, for you will not be able to give due thanks for it."

We have already detailed the conduct of the prophets and the pious predecessors concerning food and drink in the Quarter of the Perils, so we shall not repeat it here.

When the Prophet, peace be upon him, came to the people of Quba, they brought him a drink of milk mixed with honey. He set the cup down from his hand and said, "Indeed, I do not forbid it, but I leave it out of humility before God, the Exalted."

Umar, may God be pleased with him, was brought a drink of cold water and honey on a hot summer day. He said, "Set aside for me the account of it."

Yahya ibn Mu'adh al-Razi said: The sincere ascetic's sustenance is what he finds, his garment is what covers, his dwelling is where he alights. The world is his prison, the grave his resting place, solitude his gathering, reflection his thought, the Qur'an his discourse, the Lord his intimate companion, remembrance his comrade, asceticism his constant associate, sorrow his state, modesty his emblem, hunger his condiment, wisdom his speech, dust his bed, piety his provision, silence his gain, patience his reliance, trust in God his sufficiency, intellect his guide, worship his craft, and Paradise his destination, if God Most High wills.

The second important matter is clothing: its minimum degree is that which repels heat and cold and covers the private parts. It is a garment one covers oneself with. Its middle degree is a shirt, a cap, and a pair of sandals. Its highest degree is to have with it a handkerchief and trousers. Whatever exceeds this in quantity surpasses the limit of asceticism. The condition for the ascetic is that he should not have a garment to wear when he washes his garment; rather, he must remain in the house. If he becomes the possessor of two shirts, two pairs of trousers, and two handkerchiefs, he has departed from all forms of asceticism in terms of quantity. As for the type, its minimum is coarse haircloth, its middle is coarse wool, and its highest is thick cotton. As for duration, its maximum is what covers for a year, and its minimum is what lasts a day—to the extent that some patched their garment with tree leaves, even though it would quickly dry out—and its middle is what holds together for a month or thereabouts. To seek what lasts more than a year is a departure into long hope, which is contrary to asceticism, unless what is sought is its coarseness. Then strength and durability may follow that. Whoever finds an excess of that should give it in charity, for if he keeps it, he is not an ascetic but rather a lover of this world. And let him look into the conditions of the prophets and the companions, how they abandoned fine garments. Abu Burdah said: 'Aisha, may God be pleased with her, brought out for us a patched garment and a coarse waist-wrapper and said: "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away in these two."'

And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Verily, Allah the Exalted loves the humble person who does not care what he wears."

'Amr ibn al-Aswad al-'Ansi said: "I shall never wear a garment of renown, nor shall I ever sleep at night under a coverlet, nor shall I ever ride upon a well-trodden path, nor shall I ever fill my belly with food." Then 'Umar said: "Whoever wishes to behold the guidance of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, let him look to 'Amr ibn al-Aswad."

In the prophetic tradition: "No servant dons a garment of fame but that God turns away from him until he removes it, even if it were beloved to him."

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, purchased a garment for four dirhams.

The value of his two garments was ten [dirhams]. His waist-wrapper measured four and a half cubits, and he purchased trousers for three dirhams.

He would wear two white woolen garments, which were called a "hullah" because they were two garments of the same kind. Sometimes he would wear two Yemeni or Sahuli cloaks of these coarse types.

In the tradition: The shirt of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was as if it were the shirt of an oil-seller.

And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, wore on a single day a garment of striped silk from fine brocade, its value two hundred dirhams. His companions would touch it and say, "O Messenger of God, has this been sent down to you from Paradise?" in astonishment—for it had been gifted to him by al-Muqawqis, the king of Alexandria, and he wished to honor him by wearing it. Then he removed it and sent it to a man from the polytheists, giving it to him as a gift. Thereafter, he prohibited the wearing of silk and brocade. It is as if he wore it initially to emphasize the prohibition, just as he wore a ring of gold one day and then removed it, thus forbidding its wear for men; and just as he said to 'A'ishah concerning the matter of Barirah, "Stipulate for her masters the right of patronage," and when she stipulated it, he, peace be upon him, ascended the pulpit and forbade it; and just as he permitted temporary marriage for three days and then prohibited it to emphasize the matter of permanent marriage.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, once prayed in a striped cloak that had a mark. When he concluded the prayer, he said, "Its appearance distracted me. Take it to Abu Jahim and bring me his *anbijaniyyah*"—meaning his cloak. Thus, he chose to wear the cloak over the soft garment. The strap of his sandal had worn out, so he replaced it with a new thong and prayed in it. When he concluded the prayer, he said, "Return the worn strap and remove this new one, for I noticed it during the prayer." He also wore a gold ring and glanced at it once on the pulpit, then cast it away, saying, "This distracted me from you—a glance at it and a glance at you."

He, peace be upon him, once wore a new pair of sandals; their beauty pleased him, so he fell down in prostration and said, "Their beauty pleased me, so I humbled myself before my Lord, fearing that He might despise me." Then he went out wearing them and gave them away to the first needy person he saw.

From Sinan ibn Sa'd, who said: A cloak of Anmar wool was woven for the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and its border was made black. When he put it on, he said, "Look how beautiful it is! How soft it is!" He said: Then a Bedouin man stood up before him and said, "O Messenger of God, give it to me." And the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, whenever he was asked for something, would not withhold it. He said: So he handed it over to him and ordered that another one be woven for him. He, peace and blessings be upon him, passed away while it was still being woven.

From Jabir, who said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, while she was grinding grain with a hand-mill, wearing a cloak of camel hair. When he looked upon her, he wept and said, "O Fatimah, endure the bitterness of this world for the bliss of eternity." Then God revealed to him: "And your Lord will surely give you, and you will be satisfied."

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Among the best of my community, as the Supreme Assembly informed me, are a people who laugh openly from the vastness of God's mercy, and weep secretly from fear of His punishment. Their burden upon people is light, yet upon themselves it is heavy. They wear coarse garments and follow the ways of the devout ascetics; their bodies are on earth while their hearts are at the Throne." This was the conduct of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, in matters of clothing, and he generally enjoined his community to follow him, for he said: "Whoever loves me, let him follow my way." And he said: "Hold fast to my way and the way of the rightly-guided successors after me. Cling to it with your molar teeth."

Say: "If you love God, then follow me, so that God may love you."

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, gave a special counsel to Aisha, may God be pleased with her, saying: "If you wish to join me, then beware of sitting with the wealthy, and do not remove a garment until you have patched it."

He promised upon the shirt of 'Umar, may God be pleased with him, twelve patches, some of which were of leather.

Ali ibn Abi Talib, may God honor his countenance, purchased a garment for three dirhams and wore it during his caliphate. He cut its sleeves at the wrists and said: "Praise be to God, who has clothed me with this from His adornment."

Al-Thawri and others said: Wear garments that do not make you conspicuous among the scholars nor contemptible among the ignorant. He used to say: A poor man passes by me while I am praying, and I let him pass; but one of the worldly people passes by wearing such finery, and I detest him and do not let him pass.
Some of them said: I valued the garment of Sufyan and his sandals at a dirham and four daniqs.

Ibn Shubrumah said: The best of my garments is that which serves me, and the worst is that which I serve.

Some of the early pious predecessors said: Wear from clothing that which blends you with the common people, and do not wear from it that which makes you conspicuous, so that eyes turn toward you.

Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: Garments are of three kinds: a garment for God, which is that which covers one's nakedness; a garment for the self, which is that which is sought for its softness; and a garment for people, which is that which is sought for its substance and beauty.

Some have said: Whoever's garment becomes thin, his religion becomes thin.

The majority of scholars among the Followers (Tabi'un) valued their garments at between twenty and thirty dirhams. The elite among them would not wear more than two garments: a shirt and a waist-wrapper beneath it. Sometimes, they would fold the tail of their shirt over their head.

Some of the early pious predecessors said: The beginning of worship is modesty.

In the tradition: "Simplicity in dress is part of faith."

In the prophetic tradition: "Whoever forsakes a garment of adornment while having the means to wear it, out of humility before God the Exalted and in pursuit of His Countenance, it becomes incumbent upon God to store for him, among the fragrant herbs of Paradise, within clasps of ruby."

And God, exalted be He, revealed to one of His prophets: Say to My friends, let them not wear the garments of My enemies, nor enter the doorways of My enemies as My enemies do. And Rafi‘ ibn Khadij looked at Bishr ibn Marwan upon the pulpit of Kufa as he was exhorting the people, and said: Look at your leader exhorting the people while upon him are the garments of the dissolute—and he was wearing thin, fine garments. And ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amir ibn Rabi‘ah came to Abu Dharr in his fine attire, and began to speak on asceticism. So Abu Dharr placed his palm over his own mouth and began to make a derisive sound with it. Ibn ‘Amir grew angry and complained of him to ‘Umar, who said: You have brought this upon yourself, speaking on asceticism before him in such attire.

And Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: Verily, God the Exalted has charged the guides of right guidance to be in a state akin to the lowest condition of the people, so that the wealthy may follow their example and the poverty of the poor may not be disparaged. And when he was reproached for the coarseness of his garment, he said: It is nearer to humility and more fitting for a Muslim to emulate.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade indulgence in luxury and said: "Verily, God the Exalted has servants who are not given to luxury."

Fadala ibn 'Ubayd, while serving as governor of Egypt, was seen disheveled and barefoot. He was asked, "You are the governor and you do this?" He replied, "The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, forbade us from excessive comfort and commanded us to go barefoot sometimes."

Ali said to Umar, may God be pleased with them both: "If you wish to join your two companions, then raise your shirt, lower your waist-wrapper, mend your sandal, and entrust your provision to the One who suffices short of satiety."

Umar said: Adopt austerity and beware of the gathering of the non-Arabs like Khosrow and Caesar.

Ali, may God honor his countenance, said: Whoever adopts the attire of a people is counted among them.

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Among the worst of my community are those who are nurtured in luxury, who seek out varieties of food and varieties of garments, and who are verbose in speech."

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "The believer's lower garment should reach to the middle of his shins, and there is no blame upon him if it extends between that and his ankles. But what falls below that is in the Fire, and Allah will not look on the Day of Resurrection at one who drags his garment out of arrogance."

Abu Sulayman al-Darani said: The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "None among my community wears a wig except a hypocrite or a fool."

Al-Awza'i said: Wearing wool garments during travel is a Sunnah, but doing so while settled is an innovation.

Muhammad ibn Wasī‘ visited Qutaybah ibn Muslim wearing a woolen cloak. Qutaybah asked him, “What has led you to wear a woolen garment?” He remained silent. Qutaybah said, “I speak to you, yet you do not answer!” He replied, “I dislike saying ‘out of renunciation,’ lest I praise myself, or ‘out of poverty,’ lest I complain against my Lord.”

Abū Sulaymān said: When God took Abraham as His intimate friend, He revealed to him: “Cover your private parts from the earth.” He would not possess more than one of anything, except for trousers; he would have two pairs. When he washed one, he would wear the other, so that no moment would pass without his private parts being covered.

Salman al-Farsi, may God be pleased with him, was asked, “Why do you not wear fine garments?” He replied, “What does a slave have to do with fine clothing? When he is freed, then, by God, he will have garments that never wear out.”

It is narrated that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, may God have mercy upon him, had a woolen cloak and a woolen mantle which he would wear at night when he rose to pray.
And al-Hasan said to Farqad al-Sabakhi: Do you suppose you have merit over people because of your mantle? It has reached me that most of those wearing fine mantles are hypocrites.

Yahya ibn Ma'in said: "Did you see Abu Mu'awiyah al-Aswad, who would gather rags from rubbish heaps, wash them, patch them together, and wear them? I said to him: 'You could be clothed better than this!' He replied: 'What harm does it do them what befalls them in this world? God compensates them for every calamity with Paradise.'" Then Yahya ibn Ma'in would relate this story and weep.

The third important matter is dwelling, and regarding asceticism in it there are also three levels: the highest is that one does not seek a specific place for himself and is content with the corners of mosques like the People of the Bench. The middle level is that one does not seek a specific place for himself such as a hut built from palm fronds or reeds or the like. The lowest is that one seeks a built room, whether by purchase or rent. If the extent of the dwelling's spaciousness is according to his need without excess and there is no adornment in it, this extent does not remove him from the last level of asceticism. But if he seeks solid construction, plastering, spaciousness, and a ceiling height exceeding six cubits, then he has completely transgressed the limit of asceticism in dwelling. The difference in the type of construction—whether of plaster, reeds, clay, or brick—and the difference in its extent regarding spaciousness and constriction, and the difference in its duration relative to times—whether owned, rented, or borrowed—asceticism is a factor in all of that. In summary, everything intended for necessity should not exceed the limit of necessity. The measure of necessity from the worldly life is the instrument and means of religion, and what exceeds that is opposed to religion. The purpose of a dwelling is to repel rain and cold and to shield from eyes and harm; its minimum level is known, and what is added to that is superfluity. All superfluity is from the worldly life, and the one who seeks superfluity and strives for it is very far from asceticism. It has been said: The first thing that appeared of extended hope after the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was *tadreez* and solid construction—meaning by *tadreez*: mending the seams of garments, for they used to be patched with patches, and by solid construction: building with plaster and brick. They used to build only with palm fronds and palm stalks.

There has come in the report: "A time will come upon people when they will embroider their garments just as the Yemeni striped garments are embroidered."

And the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, commanded al-‘Abbas to demolish an elevated chamber he had built high.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed by a lofty chamber and said, "Whose is this?" They said, "It belongs to so-and-so." When the man came to him, the Prophet turned away from him and did not turn toward him as he used to. The man asked the Prophet's companions about the change in his countenance, peace be upon him, and they informed him. So he went and demolished it. Then the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him and his family, passed by the place and did not see it. He was informed that the man had demolished it, so he supplicated for his good.

Al-Hasan said: The Messenger of God, peace be upon him, died without having placed one brick upon another, nor one reed upon another.

The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When God wills evil for a servant, He destroys his wealth in water and mud."

Abdullah ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, passed by us while we were repairing a wall, and he said, "What is this?" We said, "It is a wall of ours that has weakened." He said, "I see the matter is more urgent than that."

Noah, peace be upon him, took for himself a house of reeds. It was said to him: "Would that you built [something more]?" He replied: "This is ample for one who is to die."

Al-Hasan said: We visited Safwan ibn Muhriz while he was in a house of reeds that had begun to lean over him. It was said to him: "Would that you repaired it?" He replied: "How many a man has died while this remains standing in its state."

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Whoever builds beyond what suffices him will be burdened to carry it on the Day of Resurrection."

And in the report: "Every expenditure on earth is rewarded, save what is spent on water and clay."

And in His Exalted saying, "That abode of the Hereafter We assign to those who seek not exaltation in the earth nor corruption," it refers to leadership and the vainglorious raising of buildings.

And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Every structure will be a source of regret for its owner on the Day of Resurrection, except what is built to provide shelter from heat or cold."

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to the man who complained to him about the narrowness of his home: "Seek spaciousness in the sky," meaning in Paradise.

And Umar, may God be pleased with him, saw in the road to Syria a lofty palace built with plaster and baked bricks, and he exclaimed, "God is great!" and said, "I did not think there would be among this nation one who builds the construction of Haman for Pharaoh"—referring to Pharaoh's saying, "So kindle for me, O Haman, upon the clay," meaning by it the baked bricks. It is said that Pharaoh was the first for whom a structure was built with plaster and baked bricks, and the first to make them was Haman, then the tyrants followed them, and this is the ornamentation.

One of the early pious predecessors saw a mosque in a certain city and said: I witnessed this mosque built from palm branches and fronds, then I saw it built from rough stone, and now I see it built with baked bricks. Thus, the people of the palm fronds were better than the people of rough stone, and the people of rough stone were better than the people of baked bricks.

Among the early pious predecessors were those who would rebuild their homes multiple times within their lifetime due to the frailty of their construction, the brevity of their worldly hopes, and their detachment from perfecting buildings. Some among them, when setting out for pilgrimage or striving in the path of God, would dismantle their dwellings or bestow them upon their neighbors, only to rebuild upon their return. Their homes were made of reeds and hides, a custom still practiced by the Arabs in the lands of Yemen, with the roof's height being merely a man's stature or an arm's span.

Al-Hasan said: Whenever I entered the houses of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, I would reach my hand up to touch the ceiling.

Amr ibn Dinar said: When a servant raises a building beyond six cubits, an angel calls out to him: "To where, O most wicked of the wicked?"  
Sufyan forbade looking at a towering building and said: "Were it not for people's gazes, they would not build so high. Thus, looking at it aids in its construction."

Fudayl said: I am not amazed at one who builds and then abandons, but I am amazed at one who looks and does not take heed.

Ibn Mas'ud, may God be pleased with him, said: "A people will come who elevate the trivial and diminish the religion, and they will employ the eloquent. They will pray toward your qiblah, yet they will die not upon your religion."

The fourth important matter: household furnishings, and in asceticism regarding them there are also degrees. The highest is the state of Jesus the Messiah—may God’s blessings and peace be upon him and upon the heart of the chosen servant—for he would not keep with him except a comb and a cup. Then he saw a man combing his beard with his fingers, so he threw away the comb; and he saw another drinking from the river with his hands, so he threw away the cup. This is the ruling for every furnishing: it is only intended for a purpose, so if one can do without it, it becomes a burden in this world and the next. As for what one cannot do without, one should restrict oneself to the lowest degree, which is earthenware in everything where earthenware suffices, and one should not mind if its edge is broken so long as the intended purpose is achieved by it.

The middle degree is to have furnishings according to need, sound in themselves, but to use a single tool for multiple purposes, like one who has a bowl from which he eats, drinks, and stores belongings. The early pious predecessors preferred using one tool for various things to lighten the load.

The lowest degree is that one possesses for each need a tool of the base, lowly kind. If one increases in number or in the nobility of the kind, one departs from all the doors of asceticism and leans toward seeking superfluities. Let one look to the conduct of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and the conduct of the Companions, may God be pleased with them all. For indeed, 'A'ishah, may God be pleased with her, said: "The bedding of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, upon which he slept, was a cushion of leather stuffed with palm fiber."

Fudayl said: The bedding of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, was nothing but a folded cloak and a leather pillow stuffed with palm fiber.

It is narrated that Umar ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, entered upon the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, while he was sleeping on a bed woven with palm fiber. He sat down and saw the imprint of the fiber on his side, peace be upon him, and Umar's eyes filled with tears. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him: "What has made you weep, O son of al-Khattab?" He said: "I thought of Chosroes and Caesar and the sovereignty they possess, and I thought of you—you who are the beloved of God and His chosen one and His Messenger—sleeping on a bed woven with palm fiber?" The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: "Are you not content, O Umar, that for them is this world and for us is the Hereafter?" He said: "Yes, O Messenger of God." He said: "And so it is."

And a man entered upon Abu Dharr and began to let his gaze wander about his house. He said: "O Abu Dharr, I see no possessions nor any furnishings in your house." He replied: "We have a house to which we direct the best of our possessions." The man said: "But you must have some possessions as long as you are here." He said: "The Master of the house does not leave us therein."

When 'Umayr ibn Sa'id, the governor of Homs, came before 'Umar, may God be pleased with them both, he said to him: "What do you possess of this world?" He replied: "I have my staff, upon which I lean and with which I kill a snake if I encounter it; I have my saddlebag, in which I carry my food; I have my bowl, from which I eat and drink and my garment; and I have my waterskin, in which I carry my drink and my water for purification in prayer. Whatever of this world exists beyond these is but an appendage to what I already have." 'Umar said: "You have spoken truthfully. May God have mercy on you."

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, returned from a journey and entered upon Fatimah, may God be pleased with her. He saw a curtain at the door of her dwelling and on her wrists two silver bracelets. He turned back. Abu Rafi' then entered upon her while she was weeping, and she informed him of the Messenger of God's, peace and blessings be upon him, turning back. Abu Rafi' asked him, and he said, "Because of the curtain and the two bracelets." So she sent them with Bilal to the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, and said, "I have given them in charity; place them where you see fit." He said, "Go and sell them and give the proceeds to the People of the Suffah." So he sold the two bracelets for two and a half dirhams and gave it in charity to them. Then he, peace and blessings be upon him, entered upon her and said, "May my father be your ransom, you have done well."

The Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, saw a curtain at the door of Aisha, so he tore it and said, "Whenever I see it, I am reminded of the world. Send it to the family of so-and-so."

One night, Aisha prepared a new bed for him, while the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sleep on a folded cloak. He kept turning throughout the night, and when morning came, he said to her, "Return the worn cloak and remove this bed from me, for it kept me awake tonight." Similarly, five or six dinars came to him at night, and she kept them, so he stayed awake the entire night until he distributed them by the end of the night. Aisha (may God be pleased with her) said: He then slept until I heard him snoring, after which he said, "What would Muhammad think of his Lord if he met God while these were with him?"

Al-Hasan said: I met seventy of the righteous, each of whom had nothing but his garment, and none ever placed a garment between himself and the ground: when he wished to sleep, he would lie directly on the earth and place his garment over himself.

The Fifth Important Matter: Marriage. Some have said there is no meaning to asceticism in the principle of marriage nor in its frequency. Sahl ibn ‘Abd Allāh inclined to this view, saying, "Women were made beloved to the master of the ascetics (the Prophet), so how can one practice asceticism regarding them?" Ibn ‘Uyaynah agreed with this statement, saying, "The most ascetic of the Companions was ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, may God be pleased with him, and he had four wives and more than ten concubines."

The correct position is what Abū Sulaymān al-Dārānī, may God have mercy on him, said: "Everything that distracts you from God—be it family, wealth, or children—is an ill omen for you, and a wife can indeed be a distraction from God." The truth unveiled in this is that celibacy may be superior in some circumstances, as previously discussed in the Book of Marriage. In such a case, abstaining from marriage is a form of asceticism. However, where marriage is superior for repelling overwhelming desire, it is obligatory, so how could abstaining from it then be considered asceticism?

If neither abstaining from nor engaging in it causes him harm, but he abstains from marriage to guard his heart from inclining towards women and finding solace in them to the point of being distracted from the remembrance of God, then such abstention is a form of asceticism. But if he knows the woman will not distract him from God's remembrance, yet he abstains merely to avoid the pleasure of looking, intimate companionship, and intercourse, this is not asceticism at all. For offspring are intended for the continuation of one's lineage, and multiplying the nation of Muḥammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is among the acts of nearness to God. The pleasure that accompanies a person in what is a necessity of existence does not harm him, provided it is not the primary aim and objective. This is like one who abstains from eating bread and drinking water to avoid the pleasure of eating and drinking—that is not asceticism in any respect, for in such abstention lies the ruin of his body. Similarly, in abstaining from marriage lies the severance of his lineage. Therefore, it is not permissible to abstain from marriage as asceticism regarding its pleasure without fearing some other harm. This is undoubtedly what Sahl meant, and for this reason the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, married.

Once this is established, for one whose state is like that of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him—in that numerous wives do not distract him, nor does his heart become occupied with managing their affairs and providing for them—then there is no meaning to his asceticism regarding them out of caution against the pleasure of intercourse and looking. But how can this be conceived for anyone other than the Prophets and the saints? Most people are distracted by numerous wives. Thus, one should abstain from the principle of marriage if it distracts him. If it does not distract him, but he fears that being with many women or a beautiful woman might distract him, then let him marry one who is not beautiful, and let him vigilantly guard his heart in that.

Abu Sulayman said: Asceticism regarding women is to choose a woman of lesser status or an orphan over a beautiful and noble woman.

Junayd, may God have mercy on him, said: "I prefer that the novice seeker not occupy his heart with three things, lest his state change: earning a livelihood, seeking Hadith, and marriage." And he said: "I prefer that the Sufi not write nor read, for that is more conducive to gathering his concentration. If it becomes apparent that the pleasure of marriage is like the pleasure of eating, then whatever distracts from God is to be avoided in both matters."

The Sixth Essential: What serves as a means to these five, namely wealth and status. As for status, its meaning is the mastery over hearts by seeking a place within them, so that one may thereby attain assistance in objectives and tasks. Whoever is incapable of managing all their needs by themselves and requires someone to serve them inevitably requires status in the heart of their servant, for if they hold no place or esteem with them, the servant will not perform the service. The establishment of esteem and a place in hearts is status. This has a proximate beginning, but it extends into a bottomless abyss. Whoever hovers around the forbidden precinct is likely to fall into it. The need for a place in hearts is either to attract benefit, repel harm, or secure deliverance from injustice. As for benefit, wealth suffices instead, for one who serves for a wage will serve even if the employer holds no esteem with them. Status is only needed in the heart of one who serves without a wage. As for repelling harm, status is needed for this purpose in a land where justice is incomplete, or among neighbors who wrong one and whose evil one cannot repel except by having a place in their hearts or a place with the ruler. The extent of the need for this cannot be precisely defined, especially when compounded by fear and pessimism about outcomes. One who plunges into seeking status treads the path of perdition. Rather, it is incumbent upon the ascetic not to strive to seek a place in hearts at all, for their preoccupation with religion and worship paves for them such a place in hearts as repels harm from them, even if they were among disbelievers, let alone among Muslims. As for the imaginings and estimations that necessitate an increase in status beyond what is obtained without effort, they are false illusions, for one who seeks status is also not free from harm in some circumstances. The remedy for that through endurance and patience is preferable to remedying it by seeking status. Therefore, seeking a place in hearts is not permissible at all. A little of it invites to much, and its addiction is more severe than the addiction of wine. So let one beware of its little and its much.

As for wealth, it is necessary for livelihood—I mean a little of it. If it is acquired, then when one earns what suffices for the day's need, they should cease earning. Some of them, when they earned two grains, would lift their basket and leave. This is the condition of asceticism. If one exceeds that to what suffices for more than a year, they have departed from the limit of both the weak and the strong ascetics. If one has an estate and lacks strong certainty in reliance upon God, they may retain from it an amount whose yield suffices for one year. With this amount, they do not depart from asceticism, provided they give in charity all that exceeds the sufficiency of their year, but they would be among the weak ascetics. If the condition of reliance in asceticism is as stipulated by Uways al-Qarani, may God have mercy on him, then this person is not among the ascetics. Our statement that they have departed from the limit of the ascetics means that they will not attain the praiseworthy stations promised for the ascetics in the Hereafter. Otherwise, the name 'ascetic' may not leave them relative to what they have abstained from of excess and abundance. The matter of one who is solitary in all this is lighter than that of one with dependents. Abu Sulayman said: "A man should not compel his family to asceticism; rather, he should invite them to it. If they respond, well and good; otherwise, he leaves them and does with himself as he wishes." This means the strict conditions stipulated for the ascetic are specific to him and are not all obligatory upon his dependents. However, he should not indulge them in what exceeds the limit of moderation either. Let him learn from the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, when he departed from the house of Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, because of a curtain and two cushions, for that was from adornment, not from need.

Therefore, what a person is compelled to of status and wealth is not blameworthy. Rather, what exceeds need is a deadly poison. Restricting oneself to necessity is a beneficial medicine. What lies between them are similar degrees: what is close to excess, even if not a deadly poison, is harmful; what is close to necessity, even if not a beneficial medicine, has little harm. The poison is forbidden to drink; the medicine is obligatory to take; what lies between them is of ambiguous status. So whoever is cautious is cautious for their own soul. Whoever is negligent is negligent with their own soul. Whoever seeks purity for their religion, leaves what is doubtful for what is not doubtful, and restrains themselves to the narrow path of necessity is the one who takes firm resolve and is undoubtedly among the saved party. One who restricts themselves to the measure of necessity and essential need cannot be ascribed to the world. Rather, that measure from the world is the very essence of religion, for it is a condition of religion, and the condition is part of the conditioned. This is indicated by what is reported: that Abraham, the intimate friend of God, upon him be peace, was struck by need and went to a friend to borrow something, but he did not lend to him. He returned feeling distressed. Then God Almighty revealed to him: "Had you asked your Friend, He would have given you." He said: "O Lord, I knew Your hatred for the world, so I feared to ask You for something from it." God Almighty revealed to him: "Need is not from the world." Therefore, the measure of need is from religion, and what is beyond that is a burden in the Hereafter. It is also so in this world, as known by one who is informed of the conditions of the wealthy and the trial upon them: its collection, preservation, and the endurance of humiliation therein. The ultimate happiness with it is that it is safely passed to his heirs who consume it, and perhaps they are his enemies. They may even use it for disobedience, so he becomes an assistant to them in it. For this reason, the gatherer of the world and the follower of desires is likened to the silkworm: it continually weaves a shroud around itself, then seeks to emerge but finds no escape, so it dies and perishes due to the work it did upon itself. Likewise, everyone who follows the desires of the world only decrees for their heart chains that bind it to what it desires, until the chains become manifest upon it, binding it with wealth, status, family, children, the gloating of enemies, the showing off to friends, and all other shares of the world. If it occurs to them that they have erred therein and they intend to exit the world, they would be incapable, seeing their heart bound by chains and fetters they cannot sever. Were they to abandon a beloved of their desires by choice, it would almost be like killing themselves and striving for their destruction, until the Angel of Death separates them from all of it at once. Then the chains remain in their heart, attached to the world that has passed them by and that they left behind, pulling them toward the world, while the claws of the Angel of Death have gripped the veins of their heart, pulling them toward the Hereafter. The lightest of their states at death is like a person being sawn with a saw, one side of them being separated from the other by pulling from both sides. The one being sawn with a saw only suffers the pain in their body by transmission from where the effect is. So what do you think of a pain that first takes hold of the very core of the heart, specific to it, not by transmission to it from elsewhere? This is the first torment they encounter before what they see of the regret for missing the descent into the highest heights and proximity to the Lord of the worlds. By inclining to the world, one is veiled from meeting God Almighty. Upon the veil, the fire of Hell gains mastery over them, for the fire is only unleashed upon the veiled. God Almighty said: "No! Indeed, they will be veiled from their Lord that Day. Then indeed, they will enter the Blazing Fire." He made the torment by fire consequent upon the pain of the veil. The pain of the veil is sufficient without the addition of the fire, so how when the addition is made to it? We ask God Almighty to firmly establish in our hearing what He inspired in the heart of His Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, when it was said to him: "Love whom you will, for you shall part from them." In the meaning of what we mentioned from the example is the saying of the poet:

Like silkworms ceaselessly weaving, the weaver perishes, trapped within the very midst of what he has wrought.

When the friends of God Almighty realized that the servant destroys himself through his deeds and by following his own desires—like the silkworm destroys itself—they utterly renounced the world. Thus, al-Hasan said: I saw seventy Companions of the Battle of Badr; they were more abstinent in what God had made lawful for them than you are in what God has forbidden to you. In another wording: They were more wounded by tribulation than you are by ease and plenty. If you saw them, you would say they are mad; and if they saw the best among you, they would say, “These have no share [in goodness]”; and if they saw the worst among you, they would say, “These do not believe in the Day of Reckoning.” One of them would be offered lawful wealth, yet he would not take it, saying: I fear it might corrupt my heart. For whoever possesses a heart inevitably fears its corruption. And those whose hearts have been killed by the love of this world—God has informed about them when He said, “They are content with the life of this world and feel secure in it, and those who are heedless of Our signs.”

And He, the Exalted, said: "Do not yield to the desire of one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows his own desires, and whose affair is ever in neglect."

And God Almighty said: "So turn away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world. That is the extent of their knowledge." Thus, He attributed all of that to heedlessness and lack of knowledge. For this reason, a man said to Jesus, peace be upon him: "Take me with you on your journey." He replied: "Sell your wealth and then follow me." The man said: "I cannot." Jesus, peace be upon him, then said: "It is astonishing that a rich man could enter Paradise"—or he said, "with difficulty."

Some have said: There is no day whose dawn breaks but that four angels call out across the horizons with four voices—two in the east and two in the west. One of them in the east proclaims: "O you who seek good, come forward! And O you who seek evil, desist!" The other says: "O Allah, grant the giver replacement and grant the miser ruin." And the two in the west, one of them declares: "Bear children for death and build for destruction," while the other says: "Eat and enjoy, for the Reckoning is long."

Explanation of the Signs of Asceticism

Know that one may think that one who abandons wealth is an ascetic, but it is not so; for abandoning wealth and displaying austerity is easy for one who loves to be praised for asceticism. How many of the fearful ones reduce themselves each day to a meager portion of food and adhere to a monastery without a door, yet the delight of each of them is the people's knowledge of his state, their gaze upon him, and their praise for him. That does not indicate asceticism with decisive proof. Rather, asceticism must be in both wealth and status together, until asceticism is perfected in all the soul's shares of this world. Indeed, a group may even claim asceticism while wearing luxurious wool and fine garments, as the elite said in describing the pretenders when they said: "And a people claimed asceticism and wore the finest of garments, thereby deceiving the people so that gifts like their clothing would be guided to them, lest they be looked upon with the eye with which the poor are looked upon, and thus be despised and given as paupers are given." They argue for themselves by acquiring knowledge and that they are upon the Sunnah, and that things enter to them while they are detached from them, and they only take by the pretext of others. This is when they are demanded with realities and driven into straits. All of these are consumers of the world by means of religion; they did not strive to purify their secrets nor refine the morals of their souls, so their traits became apparent upon them and overcame them, and they claimed them as their state. Thus, they are inclined to the world, following caprice. All of this is the speech of the elite, may God have mercy on him. Therefore, knowing asceticism is a difficult matter; indeed, the state of asceticism upon the ascetic is difficult.

One should rely in his inward state upon three signs: The first sign is that he does not rejoice in what is present nor grieve over what is lost, as God Almighty said: "So that you may not grieve for what escapes you, nor exult in what He has given you." Rather, he should be the opposite of that: which is to grieve at the presence of wealth and rejoice at its loss.

The second sign is that one's critic and praiser become equal in his sight—the former being a sign of renouncing wealth, and the latter a sign of renouncing status.

The third sign is that one finds intimate companionship with God Almighty, and the sweetness of obedience prevails in his heart. For the heart is never devoid of the sweetness of love—either love of God or love of other than Him. These two in the heart are like water and air in a cup: when water enters, air departs, and the two do not gather together. Whoever finds intimate companionship with God becomes occupied with Him and does not occupy himself with other than Him. Thus it was said to one of them, "To what did asceticism lead them?" He replied, "To intimate companionship with God." As for intimate companionship with the world and with God, the two do not gather together.

The people of spiritual insight have said: When faith attaches to the outer surface of the heart, one loves both this world and the Hereafter and works for them both. But when faith settles into the innermost chamber of the heart and takes intimate hold of it, one despises this world, so he does not even glance at it nor work for it. For this reason, it is related in the supplication of Adam, peace be upon him: "O Allah, I ask You for a faith that takes intimate hold of my heart."

Abu Sulayman said: Whoever is occupied with himself is occupied away from people—this is the station of the active worshippers. And whoever is occupied with his Lord is occupied away from himself—this is the station of the knowers. The ascetic must necessarily be in one of these two stations, and his first station is that he occupies himself with himself, and at that point praise and blame, existence and non-existence, become equal to him. Nor should one infer from his withholding a small amount of wealth that his asceticism is fundamentally lacking.

Ibn Abi al-Hawari said: I asked Abu Sulayman: Was Dawud al-Ta'i an ascetic? He said: Yes. I said: It has reached me that he inherited twenty dinars from his father and spent them over twenty years, so how could he have been an ascetic while holding onto the dinars? He replied: You wanted from him the ultimate reality of asceticism, and by reality he meant the final limit, for asceticism has no limit due to the multitude of the soul's attributes. Asceticism is not perfected except by abstaining from all of them. Thus, whoever forsakes something of this world despite having the ability to possess it, out of fear for his heart and his religion, has an entry into asceticism according to the measure of what he has forsaken. Its ultimate end is to abandon everything other than God, to the point of not even resting one's head upon a stone, as Christ, peace be upon him, did. So we ask God Almighty to grant us a portion of its beginnings, even if small, for the likes of us dare not aspire to its ultimate ends. Yet, to cut off hope from the grace of God is not permissible. And when we contemplate the wonders of God Almighty's blessings upon us, we know that nothing is too great for God Almighty, so it is not far-fetched that we should magnify our supplication, relying on a generosity that surpasses all perfection.

Thus, the sign of asceticism is the equal regard for poverty and wealth, honor and humiliation, praise and blame, due to the predominance of intimacy with God. From these signs inevitably branch other signs: such as abandoning the world and caring not who takes it.

And it is said: His sign is that he leaves the world as it is, and does not say, "I shall build a hospice," or, "I shall construct a mosque."

Yahya said to Mu'adh: The sign of asceticism is generosity with what one possesses.

Ibn Khafif said: Its sign is finding ease in relinquishing possessions. He also said: Asceticism is the soul's natural turning away from the world without strain.

Abu Sulayman said: Sufism is a banner of asceticism; thus, one should not wear a woolen garment worth three dirhams while in his heart lies a desire for five.

Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Sufyan, may God have mercy on them both, said: The sign of asceticism is the shortness of hope.

Sari said: The ascetic's life cannot be pleasant if he is distracted from his own self, nor can the knower's life be pleasant if he is preoccupied with his own self.

Nasrabadhi said: The ascetic is a stranger in this world, while the gnostic is a stranger in the Hereafter.

Yahya ibn Mu'adh said: The signs of asceticism are three: action without attachment, speech without covetousness, and advancement without leadership. He also said: The ascetic for God's sake offers you vinegar and mustard, while the gnostic lets you smell musk and ambergris. A man asked him: When may I enter the shop of reliance, don the cloak of asceticism, and sit with the ascetics? He replied: When you have reached, through your private spiritual training, such a point that if God were to cut off your provision for three days, you would not weaken inwardly. As for one who has not attained this degree, his sitting upon the carpet of the ascetics is ignorance, and I fear for you that you may be exposed. He also said: The world is like a bride, and whoever seeks it is her beautician, while the ascetic in it blackens her face, plucks her hair, and tears her garment, and the gnostic is occupied with God Almighty and does not turn toward it.

Al-Sari said: I have practiced every aspect of the matter of asceticism and attained from it what I desired, except for asceticism regarding people, for I have not reached it nor been able to bear it.

Al-Fudayl, may God have mercy on him, said: God placed all evil in a house and made its key the love of this world; and He placed all good in a house and made its key asceticism regarding this world.

This is what we intended to mention regarding the essence and rulings of asceticism. And since asceticism is not perfected except through reliance on God, let us proceed to elucidate it, if God Almighty wills.



[1] The hadith that the treasures of the earth were brought to the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), and to Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and they took them and placed them in their proper places—this is well-known and has preceded in the chapter on the Etiquettes of Livelihood, quoted definitively from al-Bukhari from the hadith of Anas: "Wealth from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and it was the most wealth ever brought to him. The Messenger of God (peace be upon him) went out to prayer and did not pay attention to it. When he finished the prayer, he came and sat down, and he would not see anyone without giving to him and connecting with him." 'Umar ibn Muhammad al-Buhayri connected it in his *Sahih* from this chain. And in the two *Sahih*s from the hadith of 'Amr ibn 'Awf: "Abu 'Ubaydah arrived with wealth from Bahrain..." and the hadith of the Ansar hearing of his arrival. And in both of them from the hadith of Jabir: "If the wealth of Bahrain were to come to us, I would give you thus and thus" three times, but it did not arrive until after the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) passed away. Abu Bakr then ordered a caller to announce: "Whoever has a promise or a debt from the Messenger of God (peace be upon him), let him come to us." I said, "The Prophet (peace be upon him) promised me," and he scooped for me three times.

[2] The hadith "I seek refuge in You from poverty" has preceded in the chapter on Remembrances and Supplications.

[3] The hadith "Poverty almost becomes disbelief" has preceded in the chapter on the Condemnation of Envy.

[4] The hadith "O God, cause me to live as a poor man and cause me to die as a poor man" was narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Anas and he graded it *hasan*; and by Ibn Majah and al-Hakim, who authenticated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id. It has preceded.

[5] The hadith of Ibn 'Umar that he (peace be upon him) said to his Companions, "Who are the best of people?" They said, "A wealthy person of property who gives the right of God from himself and his wealth." He said, "Yes, this is a good man, but he is not it." They said, "Then who are the best of people?" He said, "A poor person who gives his utmost effort." Abu Mansur al-Daylami narrated it in *Musnad al-Firdaws* with a weak chain, restricting it to the *marfu'* portion without his question to his Companions and their question to him.

[6] The hadith "He said to Bilal: 'Meet God as a poor man and do not meet Him as a rich man'" was narrated by al-Hakim in the book *'Alamat Ahl al-Tahqiq* from the hadith of Bilal; and al-Tabarani narrated it from the hadith of Abu Sa'id with the wording: "Be poor and do not die rich." Both are weak.

[7] The hadith "God loves the poor, chaste man with dependents" was narrated by Ibn Majah from the hadith of 'Imran ibn Husayn. It has preceded.

Al-Tabarani narrated it with a weak chain.
